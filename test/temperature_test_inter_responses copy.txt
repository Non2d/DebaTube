Based on the provided debate data, here is a list of tuples representing the rebuttals from the 1st opposition speech targeting the 1st proposition speech. Each tuple contains the id of the rebuttal source and the id of the rebuttal target, along with an explanation for each rebuttal identification:

1. **(11, 1)**: The 1st opposition argues that prosecuting terrorists because they killed citizens is counterproductive if the fundamental purpose is against terrorism. This directly counters the 1st proposition's claim that ransom payments are a major source of funding for terrorists and that paying ransom often results in the victim being killed anyway.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is challenging the effectiveness of the proposition's approach to dealing with terrorists and the consequences of their actions.

2. **(13, 1)**: The 1st opposition questions the source of terrorist funding, arguing that it does not necessarily come from ransom payments but from other resources like oil fields. This directly counters the 1st proposition's claim that ransom is a significant source of funding for terrorists.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is undermining the proposition's argument about the financial impact of ransom payments on terrorist groups.

3. **(14, 7)**: The 1st opposition critiques the proposition's model of involving police and censoring citizens, arguing it is unrealistic and unjustifiable. This counters the 1st proposition's claim that criminalizing ransom payments will lead to more effective police intervention and long-term benefits.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is challenging the practicality and ethical implications of the proposition's proposed measures.

4. **(16, 1)**: The 1st opposition reiterates that terrorist income comes from various sources, not just ransom, which counters the 1st proposition's emphasis on ransom as a major funding source.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is reinforcing their argument that the proposition's focus on ransom is misplaced.

5. **(17, 3)**: The 1st opposition proposes giving citizens the choice to pay ransom, which counters the 1st proposition's definition and criminalization of ransom payments in all situations.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is advocating for individual choice and questioning the blanket criminalization proposed by the proposition.

6. **(19, 3)**: The 1st opposition argues that the government should be responsible for saving citizens it sends into dangerous areas, countering the 1st proposition's definition that criminalizes ransom payments in all situations.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is highlighting the government's duty to protect its citizens, even if it means paying ransom.

7. **(20, 9)**: The 1st opposition argues that paying ransom is the most effective way to save hostages, countering the 1st proposition's claim that ransom payments do not effectively save victims and are harmful to society.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is directly challenging the proposition's assertion about the ineffectiveness and harm of ransom payments.

8. **(21, 9)**: The 1st opposition argues that kidnapping will continue even if ransom payments are stopped, countering the 1st proposition's claim that criminalizing ransom will reduce harm and save more people.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is questioning the effectiveness of the proposition's plan in preventing kidnappings.

9. **(22, 9)**: The 1st opposition argues that even careful individuals can be kidnapped, countering the 1st proposition's claim that criminalizing ransom will lead to better protection and fewer kidnappings.

   - **Reason**: The opposition is emphasizing the inevitability of kidnappings regardless of ransom payment policies.

10. **(23, 9)**: The 1st opposition argues that citizens need the right to help themselves because the government cannot always protect them, countering the 1st proposition's claim that criminalizing ransom is necessary for societal safety.

    - **Reason**: The opposition is advocating for individual self-defense and questioning the government's ability to fulfill its protective duties.

11. **(24, 3)**: The 1st opposition questions the justification for criminalizing acts to save citizens, countering the 1st proposition's definition and overall stance on criminalizing ransom payments.

    - **Reason**: The opposition is challenging the moral and ethical basis of the proposition's plan to criminalize ransom payments.

These rebuttals reflect the 1st opposition's efforts to counter the key points made by the 1st proposition, focusing on the practicality, ethics, and effectiveness of the proposed measures.
