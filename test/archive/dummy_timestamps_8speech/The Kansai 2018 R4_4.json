I don't get it.\nI think having three children for having brutalized booking is tantamount to showing children mothers.\nPeople don't make value judgment or difference on that point.\nIf there are lots of people who are children who have been brutalized for being so horrible, they are going to donate anyway on our side of the house."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "So, let's talk about the impact for the entire population by sending cash.\nWe have told you from the Prime Minister that this actually leads to a post-conflict settlement.\nAnd they told us, one, they're going to find an excuse for the leader of the opposition.\nWhat our policy does is to make people get away and forget about these excuses to begin with."}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "We think it is necessary for the Western society to treat male and female quite equally and show the stance that regardless of the vulnerability, we should treat them equally.\nThey are an important source for the countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd we think we want those developing countries to follow the values that Western countries have.\nThat's why we think those people are more likely to think that sexism is something unfortunate, sexism is something wrong to have in our society as Western countries have done."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "They told us, next was, no, this conservative does exist anyway, and that's quite minus, right?\nWe want to fix this conservative, moderate conservative, but as a Western country to show the stance that we want to treat those people equally, and you should treat those female and male equally, and forget about this conservative value we have in our society, and that we think more likely the developing countries follow our stance, yes."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "<POI>\nSo, here it looks like you regret the broadcasting which only changes stance and regretting of the theoretical dominant situation.\nWhat do you support in comparison of how broadcasting has happened?\nWhat sort of values should exist?"}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "We want a society where broadcasts kind of become diverse, I guess.\nWe just want to oppose domination itself.\nSo, what we're saying is, maybe if the ones, for example, CNN broadcasts the way women have been brutalized, we're not opposing itself, right?\nWhat we're saying is, the BBC, CNN, Russia Today, whatever, all sorts of media broadcasts that keep repeating the word, it is always the women and children who have been brutalized.\nWe want to avoid dominance itself, right?\nWe're not opposing to the idea of women being brutalized and broadcasting itself, right?\nWe think that may happen, but fine, because that's what this debate requires us to do, right?\nWe want to oppose dominant narrative itself."}]}
