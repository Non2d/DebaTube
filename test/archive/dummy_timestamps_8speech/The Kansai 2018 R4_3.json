vulnerable activity to increase attention and material support to areas.\nWhy the piling of the aid and support going to the areas is not the same in two paradigms but it's increased on our side of the house because we have more vulnerable, clear images to the public where people feel more need and sympathy to support these areas.\nSecond, I'll talk about why this dominance of a narrative is important.\nWhy people should be aware of the image of what women actually need.\nWhy that pre-imposed exposure to the idea is necessary for people to, in that chaotic, immediate need to help people, they are able to understand what donation is necessary, what they should act right now.\nFor inexperienced NGOs who go into the area, knowing about the situation is so important."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Before I go on, a couple of independent rebuttals.\nSo, first, they talk about how, you know, it leads to some sort of sexism because, you know, they're vulnerable or something like that from the Prime Minister.\nThey told us what sort of sexism and action it actually leads to and I think the logic is very blurred.\nAnd also, we have to recognize that, you know, in these areas, or it's universally, helping women and children first as a man is a pride of a man."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "It's seen as a responsibility of a man.\nAlso, in any form of conservative religion, it's seen that it's the responsibility of the man to protect women and children first.\nThat also adds to the fact that they won't see that they are deprioritized or they are being abandoned.\nThey see it as a pride that women are actually given more support.\nThey will actually facilitate to let women go on with it.\nSo, it's wrong for them to say that men are so greedy and go on with it.\nWe think that those men do exist, but they're a minor part of society.\nI think that's a bizarre characterization."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "But also, even if we concede that sexism might happen to a certain scenario, we think that's far less important than people being saved by the fact that they're given sanitary goods.\nThey're saved by the fact that they're given food and clothing or protection from, I think, mosquitoes and things like that.\nSo, it's only possible because they have a substantial amount of aid provided to these people.\nAnd we think that, talking about the larger individuals in that vulnerable situation, this bit of blurred sexism is far less important than that."}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "Then, they also talk about, from FPM and BPM, that they are seen as vulnerable, so terrorists are likely to more attack them.\nOr men, I like to say that they're weak, so you should obey us or use it as a rhetoric for sexism and things like that.\nFirstly, I think Errol talked about how terrorists don't really care about it, which was not responded.\nBut further, there are plenty of other reasons for terrorist organizations or these men to be sexist on women."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "Firstly, there are reasons to say that, you know, for terrorists, they are intuitively weak in the physical sense.\nThey may have greed for sexual desire, so there are other reasons to attack women first, unfortunately, as men, male soldiers.\nOr they simply think that they have the extremist views of, for example, Islamic beliefs that say that they should subordinate women, so they should attack first instead of men.\nOr they might have this strategic interest attacking women groups, this historical know-how as tribes and things like that.\nAnd given the fact that terrorists often don't really care about it, it's that this additional one reason of a narrative doesn't really change their calculus because they already have tens of other reasons to do that."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "If the tens of other reasons don't change their calculus, I don't understand why this bit of a narrative that these terrorist people haven't been exposed to, maybe, has any influence to it.\nAnd even if not, because even if you add it, because there's not much of a difference, the substantial difference is really unclear.\nEven if you make male, like, trying to make it obedient, you know, this sexist belief or preferences of men to go on with it already exists.\nThis bit of narrative that exists in the context also has no clear...\nSorry.\nIt amplifies that narrative, but it's not clear to what extent that's important."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "No, thank you.\nBut also importantly, this narrative, as they set up, is a broadcasting of Western media.\nIt's not about how the narrative forms in the conflict zone, but rather about people around the area.\nNot in the area, but around the world.\nAnd we also think that also proves the fact that the influence they want to suggest is not that huge.\nSure."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "<POI>\nSo, why have you told us that these conservative sexism are quite minor, limited to not minor people?\nNow, you're saying that there are lots of conservative sexism does exist, so women won't be able to get out of it.\nWhich is it?\nThere are a lot more conservatives or less conservatives?"}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "I'm saying that if they do exist, it's that it's not going to be rid of a big issue.\nSo, no, we're not saying that they're a majority.\nI don't really get it.\nConnection Between ICC and Dominant Narrative\nThen there's a bit about ICC and things like that.\nWe understand that there's not clear connection between ICC's recognition of rape and vulnerability of women.\nThe thing is that it was necessary for the discussion and investigation of female issues even at core, that we needed social pressure to have women being protected.\nBecause in the past, the PKOs, the reporting, didn't even have a section for gender or women.\nWe didn't really investigate the rape.\nIt was all just about protecting against guerrillas and things like that."}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "Why is the use of vivid images so important?\nImportantly, the support to these areas are vital to the survival of people on the ground.\nIt might be aid, it might be interventions, it might be sanctions, but all of this is contingent on the fact that you have a necessary critical mass of people who care about the area, who are angered by the situation and want to support these areas.\nThe more support and attention you have, you have more people saved, or quickly saved because of interventions that were done a bit more quickly."}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "Obviously, the sympathy that is created by the image of the media is enhanced when you use, unfortunately, more vulnerable looking actors.\nThe use of the image of a woman is far more vulnerable looking than a man.\nAlso, religious narratives and social narratives about how men should be obliged to protect women also enhance the fact that when women are put in vulnerable positions compared to men, it provokes some emotional feelings that they should protect them compared to men.\nThey do have the tool of children in their side of the house too, but the mixed use of women would also lead to an accelerated power to have more attention in these areas, and an increased amount of power means that we are able to save these people on the ground more, and that means that more aid is coming around the side of the house."}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "So they say that men are going to receive less aid, but if the pie is increased, they don't receive less.\nBut also, even if we can see that men don't receive sufficient aid, it's that men have more energy and have vitality compared to women.\nSo being prioritized in the situation of aid is far less important than women being provided of the actual needs on the ground.\nShortly on why dominant narratives."}, {"start": 313.0, "end":

provide might not be a necessary thing, it might be a burden to the actual area.\nTo prevent that, it's important that people expose the image of what actually women need.\nThe image that women are suffering in this particular way through the media, providing the understanding that the issues are real, the issues are sanitary conditions, you need napkins instead of actual random foods or clothing and things like that."}, {"start": 314.0, "end": 315.0, "text": "That's only possible when the dominant narrative is also public and people are pre-emptively aware of the particular situation.\nInexperienced NGOs also will be able to be aware of the situation and not provide random unnecessary things but actual needy things for women.\nThat's only possible if we can have a narrative and not an alternative systematic approach.\nThank you."}]}
