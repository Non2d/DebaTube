characterization of women in conflict.\nWe do recognize that some women are strong, who are capable enough to fight back against men.\nBut unfortunate reality is that in general, women are likely to be comparatively more vulnerable than men,\nand comparatively more likely to target the atrocious consequences.\nThus, they need more support and protection."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "Secondly, I will talk about why, due to the dominant narrative,\nthey uniquely make it possible for us and surroundings or NGOs or donors\nto provide the necessary support and a decent amount of support\nso that their women are going to be protected."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "Before that, I will present the responses to the Prime Minister.\nFirstly, they said that this dominant narrative incentivized terrorists to exclusively target women in the conflict areas.\nFirstly, we do concede that the status quo is not perfect,\nbut we think that due to this narrative, the situation is currently going to be changed.\nFor example, the International Criminal Court actually introduced the rape or sexual assault as crimes against humanity,\nand the international recognition that sexual assault requires special recognition.\nAnd also, there is a certain international criminal bashing towards the ignorance of the government\nwho has an incompatibility to deal with sexual assault."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "But furthermore, when it comes to the media's emphasis on gaining attention,\nwe see that terrorist groups are also already relying on the other kind of things.\nFor example, they are relying on the suicidal attack, or they are relying on the indiscriminate killing,\nand this is even more attracting when it comes to getting attention through the media.\nSo I don't think this is a core motive for terrorist groups to exclusively target women on the ground."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "They said that male protection is going to be on the mind, compared to the female.\nBut as I explained earlier, we think that given that women are likely to need special protection,\nwe think it's proportionate and we think it's good."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Lastly, they said that this dominant narrative is leading to the post-conflict system.\nBut we think that if those kinds of leaders or men in society have the intention to discriminate women,\nwe think that they are going to anyway find any excuse to discriminate women or let's reward women on the ground.\nMaybe, for example, they may say that due to their pregnancy, women cannot, unfortunately,\nwork exactly the same as men or so forth.\nAnyway, sexists are going to find that kind of excuse and discriminate women."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "But furthermore, even in that case, we have to be comparative.\nWhile it's also a kind of social position of the post-conflict society,\nit's kind of more important than the immediate help of the women in the conflict zone.\nWe think it's more important."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "So I'll just talk about the realistic characterization of the women in the conflict.\nSo in general, women are fortunately likely to be comparatively more valuable than men for several reasons.\nFirstly, physically, women are kind of likely to be weaker or less physically capable to fight back exactly the same level as men.\nIt's just that women are likely to be the target of the conflict.\nBut furthermore, we believe that women are exclusively likely to be the target of sexual assault on the ground.\nWe do recognize that men also can be the victim of sexual assault.\nBut we think the rate is disproportionately higher on the male and female.\nIf we look at the reality, for example, we come to the abduction by the terrorist group like Kohara."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "Most of the victims, the abductors, are teenage girls in the school, and they are abducted by the terrorist group.\nSo we think in the realistic context, those who are an individual, women are more likely to be the target.\nWe think they need special protection.\nBut furthermore, maybe the need for sanitary protection due to the biological feature.\nMaybe, for example, there is a pregnant mother who needs much more protection, who is more vulnerable, etc.\nSo we think that realistically, women are likely to be relatively more vulnerable, thus they need special protection and support."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "So given the nature, let's look at the second issue about why the dominant narrative is necessary in order to protect these women on the ground.\nSo we think, firstly, that the dominant narrative allows the point of peacekeeping operation, intervening military or any other individual, etc.\nto provide more support to the women on the ground.\nMaybe, for example, we come to this shelter, which has a lot of women.\nMaybe we can deploy more soldiers so that we are able to protect them more.\nOr, for example, we are giving extra support, medical support or sanitary support to pregnant women, etc.\nAnd also extra support is going to be available on our side of the house.\nAnd also, as I already told you, ICC's recognition of rape or sexual assault as a crime against humanity\nare also introduced due to this dominant narrative that recognizes that women are relatively more vulnerable on the ground.\nAnd we think it's beneficial."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "Secondly, we think that this dominant narrative allows the...\nWhat is the connection between ICC recognizing sexual rape as assault and making people believe that women are non-violent?\nThis is because, due to the dominant narrative, people in the liberal democracy can't stand women are more likely to be victimized than any other assault in Korea, etc. No thank you.\nSo we think, yeah, that's really important to say that."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "But secondly, we think that due to this dominant narrative, it kind of enables the individual donors in the liberal democracy or the advanced nation\nto think about the women, the situation of the women on the ground, and think about what kind of support they are going to need, etc.\nAnd we think it's critically important, right?\nBecause the majority of the average citizen in the liberal democracy haven't experienced the situation of the conflict that much,\nand it's kind of hard for individuals to imagine what kind of support they are going to need, etc."}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "And we think that the dominant narrative allows those average citizens or individuals who can be the potential donors to the NGO\nor the supporter towards the women on the ground, right?"}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "And they are going to think that, you know, that women may need, for example, certain special, like, sanitary protection,\nor maybe can't, like, want to need extra protection, extra, like, deployment to the military due to the high tendency of sexual assault.\nAnd we think that it's also the recognition of what, like, understanding of the exact necessity of support is very important, right?\nBecause in order to, like, maximize the utility or, like, benefit from the support and the donation,\nwe think that this, like, dominant narrative is critically important."}, {"start": 114.0, "end": 115.0, "text": "So overall, we think that, you know, given that it's, like, unfortunately that women are more likely to be vulnerable and targeted at a special time,\nwe think that it's, like, beneficial and reasonable to use the dominant narrative to gather support and help them."}]}
