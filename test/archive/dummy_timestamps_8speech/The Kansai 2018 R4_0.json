these women are vulnerable, they target these children are so vulnerable that they are weak, they are non-violent.\nThat leads to the bad outcome that ultimately these women and children are being targeted by the terrorists, are being targeted by those post-conflict sexism.\nWe believe that is something horrible, as the Western media has done.\nWe believe, we beg to propose."}, {"start": 1.0,

"First thing first, about the dominant narratives.\nWhat we mean by dominant narrative is those, mainly those Western medias, like picturizing these women and children who are being raped, who are being brutally murdered in the conflicts or the humanitarian crisis zones.\nThey picturize those women and children being forced by the power of male, and being forced by the power that they are being raped and they are being weak toward those kinds of attacks.\nThey have the massive incentive to use women and children as a vulnerable and non-violent actor.\nIt's because it's pretty shocking that they are using the picture of women being raped, picture of children being stabbed by the knives or those kinds of things.\nBecause those kinds of shocking pictures and shocking words are going to raise the viewing rate or those kinds of magazines or those kinds of things.\nTherefore, those Western media has a massive incentive to make those kinds of narratives very dominant."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "As a consequence, by this kind of dominant narrative done by Western medias, there will be much more attention toward female victims than the male victims, Mr. Speaker.\nFor example, in Boko Haram, for example, in Syria, for example, in ISIS areas.\nAs a consequence, what happens is that there will be a massive amount of discussion inside of U.S. councils or WTOs or those kinds of more policies sending peacekeeping operations or humanitarian aid toward those kinds of women and children who are dying on the ground inside those kinds of conflict zones.\nWhat happens is that peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid enter conflict zones and prioritize women and children than the men."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "What happens is that more male victims are going to increase rather than those kinds of female victims, Mr. Speaker.\nThis leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nIt means that those kinds of male victims who are brutally killed or male victims who are brutally injured by those kinds of war operations, they feel that they need a reward in a post-conflict society.\nThey need some kind of class.\nThey need some kind of money.\nThey need some kind of reward that they have done in conflict zones.\nTherefore, they cannot give away their money or their tax revenues toward women because they think that they were already saved by the Western society.\nThey were already prioritized than our lives in the conflict zones."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "We believe in that kind of scenario, that leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker, that those men are getting a reward and women are getting nothing in return because they have already got those kinds of reward or the treatment during those kinds of conflict zones.\nWe believe, rather, that saving those kinds of women and men equally leads to the betterment of these kinds of situations because those kinds of male victims cannot make the excuse that they were de-prioritized than female victims and therefore they cannot use those kinds of rhetoric.\nWe believe this kind of sexism is going to better off on our side of the house."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Secondly, Mr. Speaker, those kinds of dominant narratives lead to more targeting women and children by the terrorist attacks.\nWhy is that?\nIt's because those kinds of terrorists, for example, ISIS, knows that Western media uses female and children as a news title or those kinds of eccentric news reports.\nTherefore, they have a massive incentive to spread their political messages throughout those kinds of news outlets, which means that by targeting women and children, they will have a massive potential or possibility to make their political messages throughout those kinds of Western media.\nBecause they know that Western media have an incentive to use and target those female victims' reports or the children victims' reports."}, {"start": 7.0,

{"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "Thirdly and lastly, why this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexism.\nDominant narrative regarding women who are pictured as weak and non-violent actors is like 100,000 women who were brutally killed and raped.\nThey were forced by men's power.\nThey were overly done by Western media and that leads to unconscious sexism."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0,

Speaker, first of all, we want to question why do you prioritize women's lives over the male, right?\nWe could see why that is justified in the first place, but second of all, we do not want, by equalizing those kinds of aids and treatments, we believe that the post-conflict society is going to be better off, right, better off, Mr. Speaker, because sexism is something really rooted in the society and that is going to give less rights to women, Mr. Speaker.\nWe believe that is important as well."}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "So by picturizing women as weak and non-violent actors, that is going to make people unconsciously sexist toward women.\nThey are going to say that because you are weak, you cannot wear slutty clothes, you are going to be raped in the town, you
