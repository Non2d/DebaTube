Our side believes that we want to protect most moral people, every people, so every innocent people. And now another thing that's called the technology of hacking system or security camera is developing now and police can capture surprise information in the group of terrorists. So, thanks to those things, we can search those terrorists' move and act. "}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "And the payment of ransom is money source of terrorist and criminal group. Huge rate of money source is ransom. Plus, criminal is very malicious. So, in many cases, even if victim's side pays huge money to the terrorist group and criminal groups, the victim will be killed by them. This is a very major case, but the family wants to protect their own family or own child, so they give money."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Okay, let's move on to my argument. I have two arguments in this round. Firstly, I'd like to talk about long-term benefits, capturing those terrorists' source of money. And secondly, to save all people and victims, this plan is a very efficient way. "}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Before, I want to define this motion. This house means all liberal democratic country. And when a criminal requests ransom from individual victims, family, or government or bank, in all situations, we criminalize the payment of ransom."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "Okay, let's move on to my argument. Firstly, I'd like to talk about the long-term benefits. Under the status quo, family strongly love the child or they have a very great memory from the child, so they strongly want to save, right? So, suddenly, they give money to terrorist groups. They are very confused about the situation; it's a crazy situation. So, they easily do without concern with police or specialists, so they cannot judge this system objectively. "}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "So, in the rare case, they are very rich, so they can give the money. Another rare case, they are poor, they rent from the black market or something, not so good source of the money, comes to the poor family's house, and this money goes to the terrorist groups. So, terrorists get a huge source of money. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Why is it so big harm? Because if the terrorists have huge money, they can buy more weapons, such as guns and more harmful drugs or something, so they can expand power easily if they have more money. So, worse accidents will occur due to the money. So, we want to stop this source."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "After taking this plan, we criminalize this payment of ransom. So, reduce payment. Many people don't want to criminalize the ransom, so they can see this situation more objectively, and this is criminalized. So, if I give the money, it is criminalized, so we should consult with specialists or police. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "So, in that case, police can effectively solve the situation because they have the technology, as I mentioned in the introduction, hacking or searching through the security camera, we can effectively search the terrorists and arrest them. So, in this case, we believe that long term, we can arrest the terrorists and save more, not expand the harm for another people and worse case."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "And secondly, I would like to explain why this plan can effectively save more people than now. So, as I mentioned in the introduction, even just paying of ransom to terrorist groups, this money, in the end, the terrorist is very malicious, so they kill or request more money. So, this request is not cut by only one request of ransom, so this ransom cannot save the victims, surely. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "And also, as I mentioned again and again, this money is very harmful to society because worse accidents occur and also the individual family and victims cannot save thanks to ransom. So, we strongly believe that ransom is meaningless for saving the individual victims and also it is very harmful for the society. In this viewpoint, we strongly propose this motion and I am happy to propose. Thank you."}]}
