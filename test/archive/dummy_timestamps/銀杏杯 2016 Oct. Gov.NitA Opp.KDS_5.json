Terrorist group's action won't escalate. As usual, government remain to give money to terrorists. They request a yen and yen. And we want to stop this occasion and this motion is uniquely and only way to cut source of this case. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "OK. Let's move on my summarize. But I want to repeat my previous speaker. I have three refutations. Firstly, she said family cannot save because they cannot give ransom to terrorists. So it is pity. But it is not true. But as I mentioned in my constructive speech, but even if the ransom, they are family in the ransom, in the major case, the victim, the child will be killed by the terrorist. So even if they cannot save, in most case, they are pity. So we stop this. It is no problem. "}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "And secondly, she said we don't save the justification, so I want to justificate now. Namsung is equal to give money to terrorists. It is equal to support terrorist act. It is very guilty. Even if subjective, but support is very guilty. So it is in the criminal justice system, they should be criminalized, right? Yes. OK. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "And thirdly, they negotiate secretly. So this is a good point. But we believe that police is not so, so police can intervene also secretly not to know from terrorists. They do more secretly and they can, police is good, is specialist. So only families or not specialist are nervous people, negotiate secretly is more than our police can do well than our individual. So we think thanks to police, it is effectively solve the problem. "}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "OK. I want to summarize this debate. I have two crash points. Firstly, which plan can prevent worst case accidents such as one million people died. This plan, as I told you that in confused situation, people cannot think safely deeply and they do easily to give money to terrorists. So it is not saving victims and our opposition says countermeasures but it is no mechanism and they are irrational in public place. But I don't know, I don't know the mechanism. So our side is sperior."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "And secondly, which is better, protect victims and the large number of people. Opposition side strongly talk about one people's right, one people's right. But our side mentions again and again the major majority people's right. So which is more important to protect? The answer is surely the more people. So from that reason, our side's theory to opposition side. Thank you for listening."}]}
