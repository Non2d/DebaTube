As I said in the past speeches, though the auditing was different, there are people who are not responsible for their being captured. For example, spies, soldiers, journalists, and so on.

They believed that the government had a responsibility to protect its citizens, and also there's no justification to prohibit to save these kind of people by the family or state, ladies and gentlemen.
