And there will be the habit to give up easily. At this point, we believe that these kinds of norms will make the atmosphere that young adults will be happy in the future and they can make effort and they can endure the difficulty they face. So that's why we believe that there should be these kinds of norms so that young adults can live happily in the future."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "First of all, let me rebut their arguments. First of all, about their health. They said that young adults will consume too much of their time to maximize the benefit. How is it? First of all, this is not true. This is because when they harm their physical health or something like that, it can be easily imagined that it will harm their future. For example, they said that people will study until 4 am or something like that. These kinds of things cannot be efficient. For example, if you get enough sleep, the effectiveness will be much bigger."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So we believe that health can lead to efficiency and people will do much healthier behavior when they think of the future. For example, a lot of people drink alcohol and a lot of people do tobacco. These kinds of things happen just to meet the immediate demand. However, we believe that these kinds of things are harming their health. However, we believe that when they think of the future, they cannot do these kinds of unhealthy things. So we believe that people will have much more health benefit when they think of the future. "}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "The second rebut against is about friends. They said that young adults will tend to only reject friends because it will not be beneficial. However, this is not true. We believe that friends are an important thing for the future. For example, when you get a job, it will be much more beneficial for you if you have a lot of friends. For example, if you have friends who are good at mathematics, you can rely on these kinds of friends. When you have friends, it means that there are a lot of people who you can rely on. And we believe that when thinking of the future, young adults will have friends and will not be like the situation that young adults get all the friends. That's literally my point. "}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "<POI>If you seek this kind of like trying to have a friend who's good at mathematics, you're likely to throw away the relationship once you don't need them anymore.

However, we believe that these kinds of things will not be completely the bad thing because they can have a friend. And these kinds of things will be beneficial to their future. And this is not a bad thing."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "Then let me tell our first argument. Our first argument is that young adults will lose the long-term benefit. So let me talk about two things. First thing is about young adults do not have enough experience. So because of the not enough experience, they tend to make wrong decisions when they see back what they have done. For example, they will only think about what they want to do now. And they will behave to meet their immediate demand. For example, like eating or like playing with their friends or like drinking tapioca. These kinds of things will be much more done when they are young without these kinds of defining norms."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "And the second thing is that there will be the habit to give up easily. So for example, without these kinds of norms, young adults will be much more or will tend to do what they want to do. And even if they have one thing that they want to do in the future, they will give up. Because to realize these kinds of dreams, it is common that young adults have to face a lot of difficulties. Young adults will only give up when they face these difficulties because they will not think of the future. They will just seek the immediate demand and they will give up when they face difficulties. So why these kinds of things are serious? So when you think about the situation that without defining the norm, in the short term, young adults may feel happiness. However, in the long term, there will be a habit to give up."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "And these kinds of things will lead to low quality life. For example, when young adults do not study enough, they cannot get into a good university. And they will have difficulty in getting a job because the academic skills are now in society a lot prioritized. So they will have difficulty in getting a lot of money and money will lead to less choice. So a lot of choice will diminish because of the less of the money and less of the effort of themselves. For example, like buying a house, marrying, having a child. However, with these kinds of defining decay norms, there will be atmosphere that you will be happy in the future if you make effort now. Because of this atmosphere, young people can endure the effort and endure facing difficulties. In the long term, they will feel happiness because they can do what they want to do. They can do what they want to do, what they have been since they were young. Thank you."}]}
