They were talking about they can't enjoy in the present situation and they have to feel more pressure, and they will think about only their individual profit. It's bad for society too. However, as our speaker said, if they only think about individual benefit, they will get more matter for health and also they will feel more importance with other people and those friends. Both of these affect the future. If we make more effort and get a good future or get a good job and those things, if we can make enough money, we can afford to be loved and make children and those things.

If this affects the future, their target, the people who have the opportunity to enjoy, they can't enjoy in the future because they have to suffer working with low wage and those hard work, and they will feel like health mental burden.

They can't get a job, and they will get a low wage, or they will suffer their life from 30s and 40s. They will have to suffer their rest of the life.

Young age is like 20 years and 30 years, but in the future, we have to live 70 or 80 years. We must raise more awareness. We oppose this motion. Thank you."}]}
