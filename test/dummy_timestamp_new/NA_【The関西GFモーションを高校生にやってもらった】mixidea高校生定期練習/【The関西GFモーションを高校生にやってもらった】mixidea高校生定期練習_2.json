They argue that it's okay to discard relationships because focusing on the future will lead to long-term happiness. However, this neglects the uniqueness of the defining decade norm, which emphasizes sacrificing immediate norms for the future. This is serious because individuals, driven to be future-oriented, may become too busy with studies or work, leading to strained relationships and friendships that cannot continue."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "Additionally, I support the argument that only the younger generation has the right to make choices. Young people, being at a stage where they can choose between studying and working, have the freedom to decide. However, as time passes, decisions about the future become more rigid, and the spirit to take on new challenges diminishes. If the current situation is wasted, especially for the younger generation, it becomes a serious matter as unexpected events like COVID-19 can cut lives short. Sacrificing efforts for the future might lead to sudden and irreversible consequences, a point of deep sadness for the younger population."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "In the long term, the argument about the defining decade norm being beneficial loses its appeal. While it might be advantageous for some to enter good universities and secure financial stability, it may not be great for everyone. The sudden loss of lives and diminishing choices over the years due to rigid life decisions make it challenging for people to find motivation to live in the future. This hardship, especially for the younger generation, makes the defining decade norm detrimental. Therefore, I propose to oppose the defining decade norm. Thank you."}]}
