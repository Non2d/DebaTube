I'm happy to oppose. "}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "What is our stance? We're not gonna defend a world like what opposition is likely to do and characterize as a world where people are gonna be lazy, they're just gonna procrastinate all the time. We're not gonna defend those kind of extreme cases. We think that our burden in this debate is going to be proving about like people that we're gonna prove. Our burden is to prove that people shouldn't feel guilty about watching Netflix, for instance, as a break. They shouldn't be shunned for debating as extracurricular activities and doing something that might not get them into that. We think that's the case we're gonna be supporting today. We don't think what opposition is likely to come up here and talk about all these lazy people are gonna emerge is gonna be at the expense of this debate. It's just gonna prove to you why there's gonna be important needs to not neglecting immediate desires. "}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "With that in mind, three things in my speech. First, I'll be explaining why this will affect the health of these young adults, especially when they're in college or around the age of 18 to 25. Secondly, I'll be explaining why this specifically harms these kinds of stakeholders of young people apart from health. And thirdly, I'll be explaining societal harms."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "First, let's talk about health. We think what's gonna happen and the contextualization I'm gonna provide and what this defining decade norm is literally people who have to stay up until 4 a.m. studying for exams, people who neglect and throw away their mental and physical health for the sake of trying to gain and maximize these educational values. I think this is extremely bad for a couple of reasons. It's because we think that this success isn't guaranteed. Because no matter how long you stay awake until 4 a.m. and study, we think it rather degrades the kind of quality of education you gain. We think that's gonna lead to people overworking at the expense of their physical habits. And when this happens, we think there's likely to be two scenarios."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "That is, one is that in the case of failure or success eitherwise, is that you're gonna push yourself harder. That's literally the reason why so many Asian Asians face overwork or suicide as an example. We think that in these cases, these mental health are gonna be significantly harmed. I think this is gonna be much worse in the case of the long term, which opposition is likely gonna defend. So at this point, we think there's gonna be long-term harms considering this point. "}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "But secondly, is that you're gonna be more likely to give up once any kind of failure hits you. We think that you're not gonna have any options to pursue because you literally neglected and sacrificed every single other kind of option you had. We think this is extremely problematic compared to our side, where we at least have some other options to fall back on. We think we prioritize these immediate needs such as physical, mental health, or any kind of social bonding. In these cases, opposition is gonna be a world where failure cannot be justified. Where failure is not gonna be justified. And in the case of failure happens, we think there's no gonna be kind of falling back on their cases."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Let me move on to my second point, talking about the most important part of what's gonna happen to young people. We think that the characterization of young people is that they're gonna still rely, they can still rely on their parents, they have the freedom to do something. But in the case of when there's a culture norm that urges people to persistently just pursue life goals, we think that people are gonna lose their capability of finding their identities. That is, the people won't think of taking gap years at universities, for instance. They're not gonna have the option of switching between jobs, for instance. They're just gonna be looking after just one job and trying to stick to that because of this kind of norm which tries to stigmatize idle time and just seek these kinds of instrumental values.

You're gonna have other people like enjoying life as they were while you are here like not knowing what to do. After you achieve the life goal in the first place, we think you're gonna be left out.
