If you push yourself too much, you're going to stay up until 4 am, etc., and you'll be in a bad state both mentally and physically. But firstly, as my previous speaker told you, if you really prioritize achieving your life goals or if you really prioritize educational value or more vocational skills, the most rational decision for you to make is to get like a sufficient amount of sleep. So we firstly say that there is a very low possibility that people will go to the like such an extreme case that they sacrifice their whole health, their whole mental state in order to keep studying or keep working."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "But secondly, even if we take their best case and say that a certain amount of people do overwork themselves, we still see that the health risks are like equally high on their side as well. And inside the government's world, where people are encouraged and not stigmatized from prioritized instant pleasure, what we ultimately see is like you like spending time on your phone or your YouTube until midnight, or you like staying up all night at a party, or you like going out every day, or spending a lot of your money on junk food, or alcohol or tobacco, or anything that gives you that instant pleasure, right? I think comparatively, if you are going to spend a lot of your like time, like spending, spending my time and money on these kinds of unhealthy stuff, I think like the health risks are comparatively like, there's not much difference in the end, even if we take their best case."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "But more importantly, let's talk about their issue about friends, right? So first of all, like they concede in the beginning that they would have some kind of friends, like only it's kind of like friends, because they're good at math or like, that kind of stuff. But firstly, we don't see the unique harm of that because you do have a friend in the end. "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "But secondly, we also think that like, just because you prioritize, like your life goals doesn't mean that you wouldn't have like any friends or like any lover whatsoever. I think like a relationship is not about like the quantity of friends, but like the quality. So if you do have like one really close friend or one family member, I think you could still be happy. But then again, we don't see the specific harm of this like whole relationship issue."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "But then thirdly, they also talked about this like policymaking, right? How like, we won't be able to fund climate change or whatsoever. But I think that like, as a premise, you prioritizing instant pleasure is what like makes climate change is what makes climate change like an even more serious problem, right? I think the issue like this whole like you prioritizing instant pleasure is firstly like irrelevant from policymaking. I think politicians should be able to look into the future; it should have like a wider vision, right? "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "But like, we think that like people prioritizing instant like economic benefits, for example, is a specific reason why there won't be any like green policies for climate change, or like people like not going to quarantine, for example, or like the reason why people vote for like a populist politician is because they're short-sighted, right? They don't see like the long term harm of that, like certain politician getting into place. So in the end, when you think about policymaking, I think that it's far better for you to be pursuing life goals or for you to be like stigmatizing idle time, because I think that's what leads to proper rational decisions as a democratic citizen."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "But thirdly, the opposition speaker, the second speaker talks about this issue about motivation, right? How like, if you work too much, there wouldn't be any like motivation left for you to have your dream whatsoever. But like, firstly, we negate the premise that like working hard leads to like a lack of motivation. I think that if you keep prioritizing immediate pleasure, if you keep going out to parties, if you keep slacking off, I think this is what makes you lose motivation for everything. As my first speaker talked to you, like you're the habit of like, procrastinating and the habit of prioritizing instant pleasure is what makes you like look away from these long term goals that you could be pursuing at the same time. So we think that like comparatively within the world with this kind of norm, when you push yourself to work hard, that's when you find new goals that you can work hard for, like life goals or dream jobs that you want to achieve in the future. So in terms of motivation, we also say the side opposition has a higher chance for people to be motivated and for people to be encouraged to keep working."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "<POI>like, as a stance, you guys are saying that when the motion literally says you're going to seek instrumental value from social relationships, or you're going to seek more responsibilities at work, and you literally neglect that kind of premise. What does your side like uniquely achieve? Because we don't understand what your side like really envisions."}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "Well, the motion says, the motion also says that young adults who persistently pursue life goals. So I think this is also a stance that we can protect. "}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "Of course, we'll be talking about like you maximizing educational value and stuff like that. But this one ties into my substantive, which is the comparative, why our side is better. So what we exactly see inside opposition is like, as I said, like you maximizing educational value. And this means like you gain lots of skills, or you make like important relationships within like a lot of industries that help you in the future, right? Like if I get like a couple of examples, maybe you take like online courses for vocational skills, like after you come back from work, or you make like acquaintances in like different industries, or like different companies, or you like climb up the social ladder at a very young age and gain a lot of responsibility and gain a lot of like connections, or like overall, like rather than wasting off that Friday night to go drink and go to karaoke, stuff like that, you will study for like a degree for like TOEFL, or you learn another language, etc. So all in all, you won't be resting much, but you also be gaining a lot of things in the time that you have. "}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "And we think that this is very beneficial. First point, the unique thing about this being a norm is that like encourages people to work hard, right? So in the end, you don't need anybody to tell you to slack off, it's really easy for you to procrastinate, and to like not like to seek instant pleasure, because that's your like natural instinct. That's why you specifically need a norm that like suppresses your natural instincts, and tells you that it's important to work hard, it's important to have a long vision, like and to seek for your future and for like future dreams. Because like, this is something that really pushes you to work for like an uncertain future."}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "We told you, like as our first speaker told you, young people don't have the capability to look into a lot of things, and they're not like rational enough. And that's why it's really easy for them to prioritize that kind of partying or that instant pleasure. That's why we need a specific norm that goes against their natural instincts, and tells them that if you work hard right now, you'd be like, you'd be happy in the future. "}, {"start": 313.0, "end": 314.0, "text": "Because right now, like we live in a world where people can live up to like 100 years, right? Like after you retire, and after all those like many, many decades that you're going to come, would you rather have like no money at all? Or would you rather have a lot of money saved, a lot of like connections built, like a lot of job opportunities that you gain in your life, etc. So overall, we think that like this widens your opportunities. So it really takes time for you to know what you really want, like your dream job, or like starting a company, for example. But once you do have that goal, it's really important that you have enough money, you know, you have enough connections to achieve what you really want to do. And you only learn these kinds of things by like trying different skills, or by talking with different people. So overall, because on our side, you gain more important life experiences, but you specifically need to have to make a habit while you are young, we're very proud to oppose."}]}
