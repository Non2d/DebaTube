We think that media is the only way to prevent corrections and achieve real democracy. First of all, we'll talk about why it is justified. And secondly, we will talk about how those reports are critical for democracy."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "So first of all, we say that they have talked about the traffic privacy rights for the politicians, but we have several responses."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "First of all, we say that politicians can always sue media if they feel that media reported something so terrible, but we say that that decision should not be up to the government; whether media should report that information should be decided by courts, not the government itself because the government can always sue, like personal lives and exploit it to protect politicians who are committing corruptions. So we're not completely taking away private privacy rights."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Second of all, we say that medias have no incentive to disclose personal information of people around politicians because what people are interested in is what politicians do or whether the politicians are morally good or not. So, point you can always like put A or B instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always sue. Instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always put some mosaics on the face of the families of politicians.

For example, already in elections, women are being discriminated, right? Because they put their names. They put their faces. And that's enough for people to know that they're women and they're being discriminated. We don't think this is a unique problem to this reporting personal rights."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "And moreover, we say if that one politician turned out to be LGBTQ like he might.

So first of all, I'll start by capitalizing media. The first thing we say amongst the institutions that are able to disclose influence about politicians, for example, such as government itself or police, etc. Media is the most far from government, which means that media is least likely to be controlled by the government, like we can see that like court is already being controlled by government, and it is easy to say that all the other organizations are going to be controlled by the government."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "Second of all, what media point about politicians? Two things, first of all, they report whether they are moral. For example, they might report that the politician is committing DV to his wife or something. Then the people will know that those politicians are not eligible to talk about women's rights in parliament or like in the recent example, we can see that media reported that Mr. Kurokawa went out during quarantine and that can help people know that policymakers don't care about the role point they make."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "And second of all, they report connections between politicians. For example, like Mr. A and Miss B went out to a secret dinner party at like the western sea. This is something that is doubtful. Of course, politicians themselves will claim this is personal life and this is what the government side has said. But how like you don't know when like those personal dinner parties turn into political like corrupting meeting, right? So it is in so-called personal meetings that all the connections begin. So like after all, no one can plan a scheme in the official government building, right? So it's likely that politicians are exploiting world personal lives to actually do corruptions."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "So what is it is like in the opposition side's world? So first of all, people can know about politicians' corruptions or morality and this is critical for like rational judging and voting because this is important because democracy is about receiving enough necessary information and voting. And we say that those morality of politicians is a critical information for that, because politicians are someone who represents people. "}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "And if the politician force people some kind of moral obligation or law and but they themselves don't conform it, we can say that politicians are just enjoying privilege by being politicians. Meaning they're just receiving money and pretending to be helping people and people know that those politicians don't care about people they're responsible. they don't care about what people will suffer or like people will benefit from their policies. If so no one will want to vote for them, right?"}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "But in the government side as well because no one will disclose the information about morality or corruption people can't know about this and if the government's if this motion is taken the worst thing more worse things gonna happen because the government can always threaten media saying that hey, this is personal lives. Don't report this. So corruption is going to be more income under their world. So therefore we are proud to oppose.\n"}]}
