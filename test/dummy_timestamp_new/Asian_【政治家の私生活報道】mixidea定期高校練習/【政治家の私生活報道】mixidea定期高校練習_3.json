So what the government side said is that there is no legislation to report the politician's private life because there is no consent and also includes your family members, but this is not true because under the status quo, media itself does not report your really private life. What the media is doing is, like, because media is not reporting, like, his children go to some surgeon's school or something, or he is dating with someone, media is not reporting such kind of thing because this is not related to the citizen's interest."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "And what media report is a private thing but relating to the policy to some extent. So, for example, like, some politicians are appealing to certain authority or certain private company members, or like, he or she had a trip in disastrous situations or such kind of thing, but we think people have the right to know because we think that people have the right to know the beginning of corruption, and media have the right to report those kinds of things."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Second part is that, like, homosexual politicians will be attacked by non-LGBTQ supporters, but we think media will not disclose this kind of really sexual thing because media have never disclosed such kind of thing, and also media will not discriminate those politicians because if media does discriminate because they are LGBTQ, there will be a lot of criticism by citizens, because many people see media and people, there are many people who support LGBTQ, and those people will really criticize those media, and then media lose credit. So media have no incentive to discriminate those kinds of people"}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "And even if media disclose those kinds of, report those kinds of points, they earn a lot of supporters, the politicians will earn a lot of supporters. Because for example, under the status quo, Komeito is supported by Soka Gakkai, it is a religious institution, community, but that's why, that's why Komeito have a lot of powers, and what I wanna tell from this example is those who have the same thoughts, or who have the same religious, or who have the same sexual thoughts, will be supported, will be strongly supported by the same group."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So, moving on to my argument, so first of all, I'm gonna talk about politicians will be conscious, and second of all, media have rights.

So, in government paradigm, people lose the chance to know about those kinds of personality, your personality, and people have, people have rights to know that in order to choose, choose their lawfully person for the parliament, parliamentary."}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": " And second of all, people can know about the faction in each party or know about advocation with certain people or private companies. It is significant because on this data pool, many politicians, some politicians giving money illegally, or prioritizing their friend's company, but this, without media, people can't, people can't know about them, and police will not search this kind of thing because what police do is some accident happens, or some people witness some accident, and then they're going to research."}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "But media is not, it's not doing such kind of thing because media will be more flexible to those kinds of things. And in the government paradigm, since the media can't report their private life, citizens will lose the chance to know that, and because media lose incentive to research about that, so politics will be collapsed in government power line."}, {"start": 313.0, "end": 314.0, "text": "And so in our paradigm, we can achieve, we can stick together who are highly motivated politicians, who are willing to be good model for a person, like keeping those are morally good person.
