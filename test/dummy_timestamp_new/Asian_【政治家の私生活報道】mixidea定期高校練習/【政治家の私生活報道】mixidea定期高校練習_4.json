"}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "I'm going to examine two areas of clash. First, does the media have justification? And secondly, I'm going to look at the effects on politics."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "First, let's look at whether media has justification. And let me number out what opposition really talked about, but it realized in the first place that opposition never really gave a constructive argument, but most of their talk was basically built upon rebuttals to our constructive. So if we mitigate the rebuttals, we say at the moment in which they don't have any constructive impact to fall back on, we say that we should win this debate."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "A is that first the problem with what opposition first told us is the distinction between media and government, because there's somehow stance coming from leader of opposition was that, hey, that governments like governments should not be able to report on the private lives of politicians, but media can because media is more reliable than the government. This is an absurd argument to come up with because in terms of authority, governments is the ones that are passing policies that are giving laws that say that these politicians have a right to privacy. So the moment in which opposition is willing to concede that the government doesn't have authority to report on the private lives, and we say similarly, just in terms of authority, the media should similarly not be able to report on private lives."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "But B is that they refuted against our argument saying that these other individuals involved aren't really related because one, we have a mosaic, and two, that media has no incentive to do so. Realize that in the first place, they never refuted our main premise about politicians themselves not giving consent. Opposition needs to engage with this main crux because this was an argument that was a sub nuance of our main argument. They need to say why even if politicians didn't give consent to, why the media is justified in doing so."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "But let's take their best of consent to other individuals. Notice that you're only able to determine whether a politician is, quote, quote, coming from opposition is good or morally a good person, morally capable person, is through interpersonal relationships. That means that you need to know how they behave through their relationships with other people, how they treat other members of society. And in order to find that out, then inevitably you need to report on the private lives of other members that are in the sphere of the private lives of politicians. Given this, we think that these other individuals didn't give consent, and we think the media has no perverse incentive to only look at the politicians themselves."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "But B, notice that when they talk about mosaic, that's not really, that's a really weird stance to take by. Because if their stance was that, hey, the public and private lives is becoming very unclear, so we should be justified in like breaking that apart, then if they're okay with just simply going with mosaic, I don't really see why the media won't be justified in not reporting on mosaic or hiding up names. And I think, rather, if they're saying that security should be maintained to some certain extent, I don't know why it cannot go, why it cannot go to the extent where media should not report on the private lives of any instances. The moment in which you draw an unclear line is the moment in which opposition will still be."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "But lastly, most importantly, is that they said that, hey, this is okay in the case of preventing corruption. This argument is the most absurd but most important thing I want you to know in my speech. That is that I think it's extremely disrespectful to substitute minor cases and categorize all politicians as potentially being corrupt or someone that commits adultery. Because their logic was that, hey, that if no one is looking, then these politicians are going to be able to do whatever they want to do. Look, people won't commit domestic violence just because you have the capability of doing so. We say politicians in general are usually good people who care for society. That's literally the reason why they become politicians, because they want to create policies and make people happy. So it's important to note that opposition's label of all politicians are bad is bad."}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "But secondly, this, what they're suggesting as a policy is analogous to, for instance, these people might be committing a crime, so let's invade their house and check. Look, realize that people are proven innocent until guilty, and this is something that is intuitively correct because we can't just suddenly label a person as guilty without evidence. What they are suggesting is in sake of a potential crime, then we should be able to infringe upon privacy, their consent. "}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "And we think this is extremely bad because this is going to lead to a slippery slope in a line where the media can do whatever they want to do for some baseless potential of crime. We kept on talking about, and this clashes directly with our arguments about political discourse, because we think it's important that the media should never be able to just do whatever they want to do because of some hypothetical myth that these people have created themselves. "}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "Given this, media has no justification, but at the moment in which they never engage with their material about how they never gave consent and that they already have a given certain protection in terms of, for instance, like privacy, in terms of bank accounts or house. We think opposition never really was able to engage this. And at this moment, we say the media has never a justification."}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "But secondly, let's look at the effects on politics. The first thing that opposition suggested was that, hey, that if we expose the identity of politicians, then they might lose some like supporters from non-LGBT, but they'll gain support from LGBTQ members. I think it is important to note that the media should not be the actor that determines what is good for the politicians, because on our side, we're very happy for politicians to come out and expose their identity if they think it's good for them. "}, {"start": 412.0, "end": 413.0, "text": "But we don't think that the media is justified in substituting the politicians' opinions and forcibly exposing the identity, especially in instances of conservative communities, the examples that we told you, because this simply is unjust. I think it is important that opposition is the one that is suggesting that the media should always be the one that determines what politicians want.

I have two responses. First is that I don't really see the need for politicians becoming role models in the first place, because politicians are not social influencers that determine what kind of people, like the best ideal person that a normal citizen wants to be. Because we think that the inherently job and the point of a politician is to create policies and laws that are good for society. So there's really no need for the general public to have a politician as a role model. And we think that this isn't a justification for the media to report in the first place."}, {"start": 415.0, "end": 416.0, "text": "But B, is that let's take them at their best and that there are individuals that cater, they want to become like these politicians. We think in those instances, that's still capable on our side. Like the POI that Kotaro gave to DLO, that was that we have enough opportunities to engage for these individuals, such as local voting blocs, because you see politicians walking around in the streets and seeing what they are like. I think that's enough of these politicians to act. And I think that that again, is not a substitute for a constructive argument for opposition."}, {"start": 416.0, "end": 417.0, "text": "And lastly, is the case about corruption. I think it is important to note that we already said in our model that corruption, domestic violence is irrelevant in this debate in the first place, because those are public issues related to criminal law. And it's important that opposition can't really defend these cases because that's simply out of the debate."}, {"start": 417.0, "end": 418.0, "text": "Lastly, I want you to note the lack of engagement because there was never a response coming to you about how there's going to be worse or politicians and politicians becoming basically a competition of throwing dirt like Trump did to Hillary in elections for Pizzagate. I think it is important to note the politicians are going to be severely worse on their opposition side. I'm very happy to propose."}]}
