We don't need to know whether or not politicians have committed adultery in the past, or whether or not they are homosexual, or even this tiny detail of what could tell those politicians stayed in their family trips, right? All of those private informations that politicians do not disclose by themselves are the private information that must be protected on our side of the house."}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "With that in mind, I'm going to talk about two things. Firstly, on privacy. Secondly, on democracy."}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "Firstly, on privacy. The opposition side merely asserted that the people should be able to know without explaining to us why the right to know actually overrides the privacy that we have been talking about in this debate. We told you from the start of this debate, the very tangible harms that come with the intrusion of privacy by media organisations that are critical not only to politicians but also to politicians' families."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "Now, there are reasons to believe that the individual's rights and the individual's rights to privacy actually override the right to know. For instance, I think it's clear that the media organisation always gets consent before using any videos in which a person is shot, for instance. You always get explicit consent from the person because those individuals are portrayed, right? This is analogous to what we are talking about in this debate. We think that individuals have the right to privacy, have the right to consent to what extent that information is actually available to the public, and that media absolutely must obey this principle."}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "The only response we got from the side of opposition was about the LGBT example. This is practically the only thing that they have revised. They say, but firstly, it's not enough to negate our point."}, {"start": 705.0, "end": 706.0, "text": "But secondly, they tell us that you get votes from LGBT at the point where you say that you're a homosexual individual, you found out that you're a homosexual individual, but then they also say that media won't make offensive comments on being homosexual. "}, {"start": 706.0, "end": 707.0, "text": "They completely miss the nuance from our argument, right? We said that this debate, even those individuals actively hide the fact that they're being homosexual means that they're presumably in conservative areas where they have high likelihood of being the subject of conversion therapy or being subject to arbitrary discrimination. Now, the harm is also that arbitrary discrimination, conversion therapy, but also imagine what happens when you are a dear Christian and the person that you have voted for in the last election turned out to be gay that you think is a sin. It's the point where those individuals absolutely go furious with those individuals. We think the amount of backlash those homosexual candidates get is enormous on their side of the house."}, {"start": 707.0, "end": 708.0, "text": "Moving on to the democracy point, they said two things.

This was again a mere assertion, but secondly, even if politicians are so morally egregious to the extent that they're really bad individuals, I think the fact that in the public sphere, they have not found out that they're morally egregious individuals already shows that in the public sphere, they can control their own behaviour, right?"}, {"start": 709.0, "end": 710.0, "text": "What's important as a politician is not whether or not you're actually a good individual, but rather how you act in the public sphere, how you act when you meet the president of another country. Those are the important skills that politicians must have and the public must be able to assess. All of this information can be accumulated from individuals on our side of the house through interacting with those individuals face-to-face in the community centre if you're particularly interested in politics."}, {"start": 710.0, "end": 711.0, "text": "But let's take them at their best case scenario, which is that the right to know actually exists and right to know completely exists, right?

"}, {"start": 711.0, "end": 712.0, "text": "That's not possible because we told you in our second argument that presumably liberal media will focus on conservative politicians' private scandal for instance, so there will be a subjective control of information available to the public from the media organisation. So the harm is fairly symmetric even if we take their best case scenario. For all these reasons, please do not intrude the fundamental right that the politician has. Very proud to propose."}]}
