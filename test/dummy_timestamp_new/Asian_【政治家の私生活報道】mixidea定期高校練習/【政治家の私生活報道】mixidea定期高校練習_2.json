We think that the sort of politicians that are likely to be the main context of this debate are the ones who have committed adultery, for instance, or who have hidden the fact that they are homosexual in an extremely conservative area where they have the danger of being beaten up in the street and being the subject to conversion therapy. Those are the people we are protecting in this debate, and those are the people that the opposition, at the start of this debate, have ignored."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "So, I'm going to introduce our third substantive, which is how we increase the quality of political discussion inside the parliament, but before moving on, I have a number of responses to the side of the opposition."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Firstly, the leader of the opposition says that this is justified because governments can, like on our side of the house, governments can redefine what the private life is, to effectively protect politicians who are corrupted. That's not the case, because this debate is not about state preventing media from doing something, because this is a value judgement debate, and this debate should be based on objectively whether or not media should do X, right? So this is clearly out of this debate."}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "But then they say, oh, the corruption is going to happen on our side of the house. But the important thing we need to note here is that we don't need to infringe on the privacy of politicians, we don't need to know what they're doing, whether or not they are committing adultery, in order to check what the money for the governmental subsidy to a political party has been used, right? We think that those are the public lives, which the media can legitimately check on the side of the politician, right? So there's always a check and balance system that exists on our side of the house. So clearly, that is out of this debate."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "But then they say, in case of the infringement of privacy for families, we can always have mosaic. First of all, I think we have made this clear from the start of this debate, that media is likely to sensationalize at the point where it is actually beneficial to publish the very private lives of politicians, right? Because this is slippery slope, at the point where media is allowed to report whether or not some individual have committed adultery in the past is the point where they are likely to also publish the picture of them in the prom in high school, for instance. And then this extent goes on and goes on and goes on. So I think that eventually, in the long run, media will no longer have mosaic on your side of the house. But plus, you don't have a fear to say that the media is going to do this."}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "Secondly, because the fact that people, for instance, in conservative, extremely conservative area, know that this politician is a homosexual, it's not just about that they're going to lose votes, but it's also the question of survival. That is to say that even in the liberal context of the United States, there are 160 cases reported of conversion therapy, which is extremely traumatic for the homosexual individual. "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "Now, the reason why those politicians hide their own identity in the first place is because they think it's worse for those individuals. So precisely, precisely by that logic, I think that the vast majority of context in this debate is a homosexual individual in conservative area, not in liberal area, because if those individuals are in liberal area, they would have presumably already come out of the closet as the leader of the opposition say that they can get more LGBT votes, right? So precisely for that logic, I think that it's false."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "But then they say, so again, on the weird and coward response that we got from the leader of the opposition about how LGBT candidates can get votes from LGBT individual. This is already responded by two response; conversion therapy plus in conservative area. "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "But then they say, oh, this is a critical information for democracy. But they have never explained to us why an immoral politician can't pass a law that criminalizes sexual harassment, if that's what people want, right? The ability for politician to fairly represent the view of individual, view of citizen is independent of whether or not they have committed adultery in the past, right? "}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "I think we can make it very clear, because I think what matters is how those politicians act in the public sphere, which is exactly the information that currently people can assess, right?For instance, I think that it's very clear that the voters have dozens of opportunities to interact with politicians in real life and face-to-face, right? Local community, so for instance, in the United States, politicians approximately spend more than 60% of their working hours going to supporters house and going to community center and interact with the voters, right, in order to get the crucial voter in order to be re-elected in the next election. "}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "So there are plenty of opportunities for those individuals who are genuinely caring about politics to be able to interact with politicians, thus being able to know about the very minor details of those individuals, right? The distinction we have to draw is that whether or not those politicians have actually consented to this disclosure of information, that is a crucial point we're making in this debate."}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "But finally, I want to add one thing to our argument about politics, right? One layer of mechanism as to why media is likely to use this tactic, so debunk the private lives of politicians, of opponents of politicians, actually. For instance, conservative media actively marginalizing liberal side of politicians in order to get the politics to be more conservative, right? "}, {"start": 212.0, "end": 213.0, "text": "So why is this a powerful tool for media to effectively marginalize politicians? Because there's a confirmation bias. For example, when a media broadcasts a picture of a politician who advocates to support the poor, wearing the thousand dollar suit in their vacation, for instance, even if that picture was photoshopped, for instance, people are going to effectively and immediately tie that politician with the image of being greedy at the point where that image is planted in people's mind, subconscious mind, is a point where even if that politician says that it's not true, it's a photoshopped picture, it seems like a pathetic attempt for that politician because you are a bad guy from the eye of the public. "}, {"start": 213.0, "end": 214.0, "text": "So I think we can all be clear that there are perverse incentives for media organizations, actually, especially conservative media organizations, to actively disenfranchise the liberal side of politicians and vice versa. So I think the politics is not going to focus on the policy and what the good for the society actually is, but more of the personal side of each politician and the image control, and it's going to be a really dirty game. "}, {"start": 214.0, "end": 215.0, "text": "So on to first, how it increases the quality of political discussion. I think we made it clear that the premise of this argument is that politicians' ability and how good a politician is at their job is independent from their personal life and how they act in the private sphere. And with that in mind, I think that the competitiveness of the job of politician is likely to increase on our side of the house for two reasons."}, {"start": 215.0, "end": 216.0, "text": "Firstly, it's because being a politician, there are already a lot of hurdles on being a politician. For instance, the responsibility that comes with it or potential backlash that you're likely to get. The fact that media actively debunks private lives of politicians means that there will be more disincentive for people not to become politicians. "}, {"start": 216.0, "end": 217.0, "text": "Secondly, it increases the accessibility of people to become politicians because people who have committed something immoral, maybe, can't be a political candidate immediately in the first place. "}, {"start": 217.0, "end": 218.0, "text": "So this increase in competitiveness means that we get politicians who better represent the will of the people. That means we get a far better form of democracy on our side of the house. For that reason, we want to protect the privacy of politicians. We want the politics to be better on our side of the house. Very proud to propose."}]}
