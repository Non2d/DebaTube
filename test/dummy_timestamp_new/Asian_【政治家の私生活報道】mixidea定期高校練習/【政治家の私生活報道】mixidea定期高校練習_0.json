We think it is inherently unjust for the media to try and pry into the private lives of politicians at the expense where they could potentially have children or families who didn't consent to these behaviors. So I'm very happy to propose. "}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "Let me start off by explaining our stance. Three parts. First, is that we would define private lives as the world in which these politicians or members that are part of the private lives didn't give consent to. Realize that this is inherently different from public lives, which is literally their job as a politician, so we think that private lives are inherently the elements of life that are irrelevant to one's action of doing a job. "}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "And secondly, we would define media as anything that looks like social media, we think it could look at any kind of newspaper or magazine, we think it doesn't matter. "}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "And thirdly, is that we think that in instances of corruption, these are instances that are involved in security, and this is an issue that is involved in their own jobs as a politician, so we think in the case of corruption, we think that's kind of irrelevant to this debate, so we think that in those instances, that's basically a public matter for society."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "So we think opposition really needs to defend the micro nuances of private lives, for instance, of which newspaper they walk to, or what house, where they live, or what kind of house they live in. That's the kind of comparison we want to make."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "Given this, I'm going to bring you two arguments. First, I'm going to explain to you why politicians have a right to private lives, and secondly, I'll be explaining why this is bad for public discourse. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "First, let's look at why politicians have a right to private lives. Two reasons. First, is because we think that this is just a natural reaction of the rights we give. Because if you look at the status quo, politicians are given some certain extent of protection. For instance, they have the right to property, that is that we don't allow people to access their bank accounts or invade someone's house. Why? Because we think this is information that is inherently only relevant and important to that specific person, and people around them don't have a right to know it. "}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "What does this suggest? This suggests that this motion is just a natural extension of the rights we give. For instance, we think that there is no justification or any kind of need for the public sphere to know which politician goes out to eat with, what kind of things they do with their children or their family, and we think that it is unjust for the media to just pry on specific and wavy information for the sake of their own. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "We think it is just in saying that these politicians should be able to live a life where they don't have to fear paparazzi escaping around, at the point in which we already give certain rights. We think this is just a natural extension, we see no problem. "}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "But B, is because politicians never consented to this in the first place, right? Because we think the private lives are inherently elements of life that these politicians didn't give consent to, right? At the point in which we infringe consent, even at the bypass of one instance, we say this is a slippery slope, with at the moment in which the media can infringe upon the consent of an individual, we allow the media, for instance, barge into houses or looking at private documents of a policy, and we think this is never justified, and at the moment in which we should never cross the line of consent. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "But let's take the best case scenario of politicians, that is that politicians don't really care about their private lives, so we should be able to do whatever we want to do. Even if politicians still gave some consent, we think that it's still not legitimate. Why? Because we think that other factors and other variables are included in private lives, who didn't consent to this in the equation. For instance, it could look like family members, or friends, or children who didn't agree to having their every single action being exposed by the media. "}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "We think that it is inherently justified to not report on the private lives when there are third-party harms. We think it is unjustified for a politician's wife to be surrounded by cameras every single day asking about a potential scandal of a politician, where innocent children are trying to be asked by popularity every single day of how they think their dad is, right? We think that those kind of third-party harms, at the point in which they didn't consent to these kind of behaviors in the first place, we think the media never has a justification. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "Given that politicians have a right to private lives, why should this override the authority of the media? Which is probably going to be the argument coming from opposition. Two reasons. First, is that we think that the role of media should not be provoking or inciting these kind of issues in the first place. Why? Because we think the media should be news that just shows reliable information and not try to create some fake news in the first place. "}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "We think that what's going to happen in the status quo is that these medias are going to be profit-incentivized and they're going to sensationalize issues. So we're very able to see situations where these media or newspapers are going to aggravate a politician and broadcast them in a very false way and try to incite violence and portray these politicians as someone that is radical or sexist or homophobic. "}, {"start": 14.0, "end": 15.0, "text": "Realize that these private issues of sensationalization are different from public issues like corona or murder because these issues are inherently public. And these public issues mean that it's very easy for the public to say, to see if this is fake or not. But the problem of this sensationalization of private lives is that there's no other source to determine the credibility. So that means that the public is only able to trust that piece of unreliable source and take it as true. So even if a politician is not racist or homophobic, if a media tries to broadcast their private lives as being racist, then everyone believes the politician is racist and we think that's inherently evil. "}, {"start": 15.0, "end": 16.0, "text": "But B, we think the private lives are irrelevant to the public actors, public actions of politicians.

Because we think that the world we're going to see if media reports on the private lives of politicians is that if a politician is trying to gain votes, despite being very fair and equal, what's going to happen is that if they're found to be homosexual, they're going to lose votes in very conservative communities. We think this is bad because we think that we're going to have fair politicians being kicked out of office just by some racial bias.

That is, the politician is just not really going to care about the policies they make, but rather just try to make a good persona and a personality for the sake of the state. "}, {"start": 21.0, "end": 22.0, "text": "And but secondly, what's going to happen furthermore is that these politicians are just going to try to throw dirt at other politicians, saying that some politicians committed adultery, even if it's not true, saying that one politician is racist.

"}, {"start": 22.0, "end": 23.0, "text": "Given this, we think that this is going to be bad for political discourse because politicians are now going to have an incentive to not care about policies, but rather to just shut down competition for other politicians.
