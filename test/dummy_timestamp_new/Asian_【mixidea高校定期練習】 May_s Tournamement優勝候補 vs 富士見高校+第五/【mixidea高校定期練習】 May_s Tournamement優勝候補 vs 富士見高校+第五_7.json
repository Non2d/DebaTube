Many of the elderly in the status quo die from loneliness; they're unable to go to supermarkets because the supermarkets are like 50 miles away in extreme rural areas. So many of the elderly suffer from this kind of emotional and physical burden of being away from their family, being away from people they're comfortable with. We think that this sort of physical and emotional support is something that can only come from living in close proximity with their family, and we see that that sort of support is what the elderly need the most. So we think that this debate mainly came down to the question of which has more benefits for the elderly and the children. "}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "So two clash points first, which is better for the elderly, and second, which is better for the children."}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "First, on the elderly, we think that opposition overall gave us not much of an explanation of how their side is comparatively better than our side in terms of giving a better life for the elderly. They told us a couple of alternatives about how we can also provide these benefits under their side. Mainly, they told us two things. "}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "First, they told us that financial aid is enough, but as we told you from the very first speaker, financial aid isn't what the elderly need. We say that what the elderly need is physical help like going to the supermarket to get groceries that they need or being able to walk around the house, being able to talk to someone about their health issues and so on. "}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "Second, they told us about hiring helpers and so on, right, but we told you, we told you that like daycare and like those helpers are lacking, especially within an aging population, like in Japan. But we also said that there are unique benefits that come from the children and the family of the family members of the elderly helping them because they're more comfortable in that situation. They're more comfortable talking about their health issues, and also, they're able to physically help within their own household, like help them around the house, help them get down the stairs, and so on."}, {"start": 705.0, "end": 706.0, "text": "Third of all, they talked about how an online environment is possible and so on, but we've told you that these elderly are not very good at using these technologies in the first place.

"}, {"start": 707.0, "end": 708.0, "text": "So what have we told you under government? We've told you that first of all, they need physical help right, they can't drive to the supermarket because it's so far away, or they have health issues that keep them from getting around properly around the house, and so on, and we think that this sort of physical help is uniquely achieved under our side because you're able to live under the same roof, which means that you can help them around the house or help them get the necessities that they need, and so on. "}, {"start": 708.0, "end": 709.0, "text": "But second of all, we also told you about how there's emotional help right, you're able to live in a comfortable environment with people that you care about, the people that care about you, and you're more likely to talk about your health issues and so on, and we think that that's a unique benefit that comes under our side that cannot be achieved under opposition."}, {"start": 709.0, "end": 710.0, "text": "The second of all, let's talk about the children opposition told us that there's going to be sort of extreme dependency, but first of all, we don't see why that's necessarily bad right because the children were also taken care of by their parents when they were younger. And we think that we don't see why they shouldn't be doing that once they become older right. So we think that because these children were dependent on their parents when they were older, we think that these children are justified, and these parents are justified in depending on their children in later life."}, {"start": 710.0, "end": 711.0, "text": "But second of all, all the cases that they talked about, like, even though the web speaker brought up most of them, which is pretty late but we think that those are mostly extreme cases right.

First, they'll be able to take care of their grandchildren."}, {"start": 712.0, "end": 713.0, "text": "And second, that the sort of, they will have this sort of regret, and they told us that that's not going to happen. But we didn't see why because we think that this regret comes from being unable to save them or help them when they needed it the most, if they live far away. And we think that that regret will be better under our side. "}, {"start": 713.0, "end": 714.0, "text": "And we've also told you the relationship between the generations also become better under our side, no response on that point. "}, {"start": 714.0, "end": 715.0, "text": "So we think that overall, the elderly will be saved by this close proximity to their children, and we think that the children can also have a better bond with their parents, very proud to propose."}]}
