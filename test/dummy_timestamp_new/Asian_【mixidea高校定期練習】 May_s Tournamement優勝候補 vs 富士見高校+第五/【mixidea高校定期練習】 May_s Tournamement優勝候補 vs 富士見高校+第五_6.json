It is no necessity for all because first about the communication, like why only they need to communicate with, why the family is the most important. Because this just increases the possibility to not communicate with others because the parents only just depend on the adult children and the people around them. So if we make them more independent and communicate with more other people, this is more good for their communication. So it is no necessity."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "And about the grandchildren, if the adult children take care of their parents, like those adult children can't even have time to care for their children. "}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "And also about third, about the emotional support. Like, is it necessary to live together? Because like, they were saying that it's like they can't use this electronic thing and so on. But however, like they can still use their cell phones. But we can't talk to them and we can't know their conditions and so on. So and also, as my other speaker said, like they may neglect those things, bullying and those things, it is really emotional support. So to prevent the situation, it is no necessity."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "And about their health problems. They were really talking about like they can't go to the helper and those things. But however, as our second speaker said, like we can change the norm. So if we change the social norm, like those government will try to support more helpers and those things. So we can also solve these communication problems, too."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "However, our point, we have high necessity because first, the adult children have no freedom. And they were saying that like they can, they're living together. So like they can do timetables and so on. But however, they first of all, they live together. So the adult children have to make up time. It is certain. So but time is very important for everyone. Right. So it is it's not good to intervene in their time. "}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "And also, again, about the emotional cost. If it's the if their parents have a serious disease, they will definitely become tired to support. So it is more good to use a professional helper because they know really about it. So it's not tired. So it is very necessary."}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "And they were like talking. They were saying that it is peace. But support is not peace. Right. Because if they are like happy. They don't. Those suicides together don't happen and they don't like those depressions don't happen. But because their target is like people. Their parents can't even go to the supermarket, even move. And it means that they are in heavy condition. Right. So we have to give big support to them. So it's so easy for those things."}, {"start": 608.0, "end": 609.0, "text": "And adult children will certainly worry a lot and always think about parents so they can't concentrate on their working and so on. And that's why it's better to rely on helpers. At least mental burden will become less. So people need time. So everyone, every people have rights to live more freely. So we are happy to oppose.
