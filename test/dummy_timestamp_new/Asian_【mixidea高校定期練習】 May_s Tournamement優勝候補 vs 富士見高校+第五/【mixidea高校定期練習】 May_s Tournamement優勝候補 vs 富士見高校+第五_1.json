So today, we strongly oppose this motion."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "So first, let me explain the model. And second, I want to explain why we are leaving. Second, I will explain the rebuttal. And third, I want to explain why leaving the superlative is good for the self-actualization for the children. And finally, I want to explain why it's also good for the parents."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So first, let me explain our model. So in the opposition side, of course, think that taking care of the parents is a very good thing. So we agree at this point. However, we think that taking care of the parents is, of course, good for the parents. However, it should also be good for the children. So we strongly oppose. So in our role, even if the children cannot live with the parents, we can support their parents. It is because they can support by the financial. So in the current situation, sometimes the parents cannot have enough money, only the pension. So our side, the children can help by the financial. So for example, if the parents want to hire a helper, the children can pay money instead of their parents. And secondly, even if they leave the superlative, of course, they can meet once a month. No, thank you. So they can also meet even if they are on our side."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "So second, let me attack their point. They said that they could talk and live together. It is not always true because children can't talk if parents have dementia. This puts stress on the children and burdens them. And we will explain this point by my second speaker."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "So let me move on to why living separately is good for self-actualization for the children. So we have the three ways."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "So first point. First is that if the government side, they have the restriction of the time because the children want to care and children want to care their parents. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle. So that means that the children cannot enough their working or their hobby. Because, for example, maybe their children's wake-up time and their parents' wake-up time is different. And of course, the children worry about their parents can't meet only themselves. So they worry about it. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "And second point is emotional cost. So the care to care to their parents is a very hard work. So sometimes they cannot communicate not easily. So that's connected to the mental stress. And so this is a very bad thing. "}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "And so and on the contrary, why we can guarantee freedom for children. So then, however, in opposition, we don't have any restriction of the time because we live in the separate. So they can continue to work and they can continue the things that they want to do. And of course, the emotional cost is reduced. So that means that they can live freely in the government side. And as I said, the two, the opposition side thinks that locally is very important. So that point. Sorry. So it is better than the government side."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "And there also this our opposition side is the good for the parents because we think the parents can be independent, and children can keep supporting. So the first day in a pleasant situation, parents is not in a future. So they become in the old that children supported them. So that means that they give up to become in the older and order to be low their functions. So children don't do it for it."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "However, in our position side, parents will require only financial order remotely support. So that means that they have to do. They have to do a lot of work or a lot of things, even if they become in the old so that they don't give up. So that's really true. Their function is still OK. So it is also good."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "And in addition, maybe there are children is a very worldly about their parents. So that means that sometimes is that parents is to extremely depend on their children. However, I think that, as I said, to training their function is a very important. So the hours, our arguments want to say that in the opposition side can can parents more and more independent. So it is also good for the parents. So we propose we oppose this motion."}]}
