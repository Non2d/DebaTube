The reason why I know this is because I have a teacher's license for junior high school and high school, and I visited a real nursery center, and I know the real situation of how elderly people look like. As exactly, they characterize some people with Alzheimer's. Those who have Alzheimer's really need immediate dependence right now, immediately. For those people, I don't think it's appropriate and realistic characterization that those with Alzheimer's or those kind of elderly people are capable of taking care of their grandchildren. It is very unrealistic. Rather, we think those with Alzheimer's or elderly people are often times, sometimes not, sometimes very getting angry or shouting around at midnight and they start walking around at midnight, and they have to find it. That excessive burden is too much. "}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "And we think there is no justification suggested by the government side why this kind of excessive care must be necessary except for sending them to the center or helper and why it should be done by children. This kind of justification is still not heard at the last of the debate except for the material benefit of the spiritual or psychological happiness for parents, and I don't think that's not a good enough reason."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "Two crush points I found, first of all, which is better for children, last, which is better for elderly people. Very simple. "}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Moving on, first of all, which is better for children. So we are saying is that in order to self-actualize for their children fully in terms of the flee from any specialization to choose whatever job they want, whatever partner they want to stay with, whatever hobby they like to do or the place they live, whatever. This kind of situation to live with parent is very narrowing down their entire choice. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "And they somehow rebuttaled to something. Number one, in terms of the benefit for their children as well, like I say, they can sometimes take care of their son, granddaughter or please kick out this kind of very independent elderly characterization should be kicked out of this debate. Rather, those elderly people are psychologically weak or those really need health care immediately. That's why they are not capable of doing that."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "And also, in order to take care of those grandchildren, still we think relying on third-party systems such as babysitter, nursery center is much superior in comparison because they have child care knowledge based on theory, for example, the appropriate amount of food, education or emergency medicine, etc. On the other hand, those elderly people don't follow that theory. That's why we think at least when it comes to taking the criteria of child-caring, still a third-party system is superior rather than relying on these elderly people."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "And also, that I confirmed at the rebuttal, is that sense of regret is happening. That's why in order to prevent that, they have to stay with parents. I don't think so. Because first of all, even right now, I sometimes visit their grandparents' house, a parent's house, on a quarterly basis in a year. And for example, I'm going to visit them in Golden Week and sometimes Obon and before the end of the year. And that's, I think, very good enough to see them, how they are doing. And that is very good enough. "}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "And also, sense of regret is anyway happening on both sides of the house. Because sense of regret is coming from the fact that people have already passed away, right? Just because you guys are staying together does not necessarily mean the sense of regret to death is suddenly disappearing. I don't think, in terms of the amount of the sense of regret, there is not much difference confirmed still."}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "On the other hand, let me flip the entire argument of the sense of the emotional points. We are saying, Mika-san greatly explained, rather in terms of the sense of psychology, that staying together is worse off. Why is that? Because, like I said, as an introduction, taking care of those parents is a very much burden, right? So they are sometimes shouting around at midnight. They sometimes walk around the street at midnight, they have to find it. It's too much. That's why sometimes it's called \u30ab\u30a4\u30b4\u75b2\u308c, right? You know that. Sometimes it's called depression, sometimes it's called even suicide, or there are terrible consequences happening. That's why, in terms of the benefit of the sense of regret, it's much uncertain and rather we think the psychological cost is going to take too much. That's why don't rely on the affirmative argument. "}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "That's why, in terms of self-actualization for children, this point clearly stands. They can choose whatever job, they can stay with a partner, family relationship, whatever the form they like. They don't have to change the place to live; they don't need to go to the suburb area suddenly. That's why, in terms of self-actualization, I also took the debate."}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "Looking at two criteria. First of all, their safety.

In terms of safety, in terms of medication or scientific approach, relying on the center or helper is much superior to those children, because they have enough knowledge or they have enough, you know, they are already professioned based on the nutritious food, based on the what amount of exercise is appropriate to give, and human interaction and so forth.

Because of relying on this norm, unfortunately center is in shortage. Rather, we live on our side that children should stay away from parents by relieving our pardon. Rather, we can have the consensus to send the money to the child care center and the elderly care center and the helper. That's why, in order to the amount of the center, this problem is already solved. "}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "And also, emotion, right? So, I understand to some extent, granted, right? But still, like I say, the kaigotsukare issue, because of depression, suicide, because of that, sometimes they even neglect to take care of them. Sometimes they start bullying their parents. In order to prevent, rather we think, an appropriate amount of separation is necessary for those reasons, rather than all."}]}
