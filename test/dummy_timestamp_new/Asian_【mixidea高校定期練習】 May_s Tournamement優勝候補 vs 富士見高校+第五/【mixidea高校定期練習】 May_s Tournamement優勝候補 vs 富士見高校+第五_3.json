So they said that as South speakers touched on the point, they said like emotional support, they can do emotional support. However, it is no uniqueness because we can use IT and SNS. We can do video calling and we can do even if they can't, they can live together."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "And so I will explain about children's harm to live together with parents. As the first speaker told you like time management and children will be tired, and it is a very serious point. So I will support this argument. So the younger have to take care of their parents, like their age is like 20s or 30s and so on. But, however, if we know or prefer this world, the children can work more and more. They can live free pressure. However, if we prefer this world, children have to, if the parents' support is very become burden, the children have to quit their work because it is very serious physical or mental burden. So why is it very serious? Because if the children feel very burden, they will, if they feel burden, they can't contact the outside because it is the family's problem. So it will lead to suicide. So it is a very serious point.

For example, male's nutrition or they can do exercise with the elder. So it is very good because the elder's body can retain good and their lifestyle can be retained mainly because the professional can support it. And their benefit is like physical safety for the elderly. However, it is not always true because elderly sometimes suffer because of care and neglect and even sometimes is bullying.

So why it is very, why this motion is happen? Because it is a family's norm. So it is very problem, like family's norm, because this tendency is very serious for society. Because first is we can't spend money for social security, security. For example, for example, a housing home and so on. And governments can't, can't, don't have to need to, need to support money because, because governments retain the children. So it is a very burden for children."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "However, if we support them to live separately, so burden, we can solve the burden problem and children can support, support and society will, can support to live, to live the elderly.
