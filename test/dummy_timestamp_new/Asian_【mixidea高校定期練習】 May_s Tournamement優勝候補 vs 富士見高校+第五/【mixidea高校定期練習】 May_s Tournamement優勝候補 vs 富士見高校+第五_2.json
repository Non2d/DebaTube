They do not need financial aid because they already have financial aid from other things like pension and so on. What we think is the most important for these elderly parents to live a fulfilling life is to have like emotional fulfillment, to be comfortable in their own homes, and be able to do things that they enjoy even in their later lives. We think that this sort of emotional support is more important than anything that the opposition can provide, which is only financial support. We think that the children are the only actors that can provide this sort of support for the parents. That is why we are very proud to propose this motion. "}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "So, three things in my speech. First, about which is better for the children. Second, about whether the elderly need the support from children. Third, about how relationships are bettered under our world. My refutations are incorporated into my points."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "First, about children. Opposition gave us mainly two points. They told us that they'll have to adapt to their parents' lifestyles and that's going to be a burden for the children. Two responses. First of all, this isn't true because they told us about how these children will have to wake up at the same time as their parents and so on. We think that's untrue. You can just wake up at separate times. You can create a timetable to figure out how to fit your schedules together and so on. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "Second, they talked about how having parents who have dementia and so on is going to be a huge burden. We think that in the case of elderly who have extreme illnesses and so on, they will obviously have doctors to look over their health or their mental health and so on. We don't think that that burden is going to be completely on the children. Most of their health problems will be solved by, for example, obviously they'll have doctors visiting their house or they'll go to daily checkups and so on. We think that that sort of burden of checking on their health is not necessarily all on the children. We say that that sort of burden is not going to be huge in the first place."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "Second of all, they told us about the emotional burden that these children face, that they're going to be worrying about their parents. We think that that's going to happen on either side. These children are going to be worried about their parents. On opposition, we say that rather that's worse because their parents are going to be far away from them, like in a completely different prefecture, for example, in an extreme rural area where there's no one around them. They're going to be extremely worried about their parents' health. They're going to be worried about how their parents are letting up in that situation. We think that that burden is much worse. It's much better under our side when they can actually check up on these parents daily. We think that that worry is going to be less under our side. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "We think that even if there's going to be an extreme emotional burden, we think that in the long run, as our first speaker told you, there's going to be less emotional burden on these children. Because these children in the long run will be unlikely to, for example, regret not helping their parents. We think that these children are indebted to their parents because their parents raised them. But if they leave them to, for example, if they leave them in a retirement home or live extremely far away from them, and they become emotionally or physically isolated, and they die as a result and so on, they're going to have this regret for the rest of their lives. We think that that is an emotional burden that they have under their side as well. In the long run, they're going to be less burdened under our side. "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "Furthermore, we think that it's much better for children under our side, because if you live close to them, you're more likely to be able to help them if your parents need help. We think that the sort of worry or emotional burden is actually much worse under the opposition."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "But second of all, let's talk about the elderly, right? Do the elderly actually need the physical proximity to their children? So basically, what opposition told us is that all of the support that the elderly need can be done financially, right? But we don't think this is true. And we told you this from our very first speaker, right? Financial aid is not what the elderly people need or what they want. We think that what they need is emotional fulfillment. "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "And we think that the only actor that can provide that are the children. Because we told you from on the physical level, how it's much easier to, for example, talk about a health issue that you have, or something that you're struggling with as a parent to someone that you're comfortable talking to, which is someone that you've lived with all your life, which is someone who you actually trust, right? Whereas if you're talking to like, if you're talking to someone from someone from like a retirement home, it's much harder for you to speak up about these issues. And we also told you about how there's going to be emotional fulfillment, right? If you're left in a retirement home, you're going to be like spending every day just watching other old people play bingo. Whereas in, under our side, these elderly can actually see their parents, their children or their grandchildren grow up, and so on. And we say that the sort of emotional fulfillment is what these people need.

Why this alternative is not good enough."}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "About how these, these elderly parents need the physical help in like, within like health issues, first of all, but second of all, we also think that like, this physical proximity is important, right? Because if, if, like, we think that it's like, extremely unlikely that these children, we think that if you live extremely far apart, people are less like, these children are less likely to like check up on their parents, like over zoom or over like, over text and so on. Because first of all, the elderly are can't use the electronics as well as the children. But second of all, we think that these children will have to go out of their way to do so. And we think that this sort of physical proximity is important. "}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "And going on to how relationships are better under our world, we think that under oppositions world, if people if these children and the parents live separately, if they have disagreements, there's a physical barrier, and it's likely that they will stop seeing, seeing each other if they have a disagreement, and so on. But rather under government side, we think that these disagreements can be resolved in that moment, and people will be more likely to be able to resolve them, because they have that physical proximity, because they have to do that, because they live inside the same household. "}, {"start": 212.0, "end": 213.0, "text": "We think that generational differences can also be like bridged under our side, because these the elderly will like will be less isolated will be less isolated in like an extremely rural environment. And they'll be able to like, understand these generational differences, understand maybe learn how to use electronics, or like learn these societal norms that have changed, and so on. And we think that overall, this relationship between like these intergenerational communication is bettered, and the relationship of the children and the parents are bettered overall under our side, very proud to propose."}]}
