We support this motion."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "Note two things before I begin my set of answers. First, is that this is not a policy debate. We think this is a comparison of benefits of harms to elderly and both children. But secondly, granted that opposition might attack the feasibility saying that this is impossible. We say that we characterize adult children as around 35 to 40, where they have extra income, where they have a stable life. We say this is going to be more than capable of having parents move in. We say this is going to be better for two reasons. Two substantive in my point. First is upon why this is good for elderly. And secondly, why this is good for children."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Let's talk about a first argument. Why is this good for elderly? But before I talk about that, let's characterize what the elderly really need. What they don't need is material consideration because they already have pension fees. They already have money built up from a young age. What they actually need is fulfillment, a care and emergency responses, especially in the age where you are likely to have more health issues or more mental issues. We think that when they live where their husband or wife might have passed away, they might have Alzheimer's. They're isolated away. We think what these elderly require the most in terms of practical is a sense of fulfillment. And we say our side is able to better prove that."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Before explaining why a world is better, two likely cases upon opposition. That is first is that under their side, they're likely to send elderly to retirement homes. The reason why this doesn't provide a sense of fulfillment is because these retirement homes are usually consisted of workers who only care about getting money. That means that if they're fed up, they're only going to give you the bare minimum. They're not going to care how their day was. But even if that these workers were able to provide the sense of fulfillment, we say that they're less likely and less susceptible to treat any kind of mental or health issues of these parents, just because the ratio of these workers to the number of elderly, especially in this world of aging population and a lack of nursery homes are proven. That's why we say that in the retirement homes, this is going to be impossible. "}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "But secondly, we say that in the case, the best case scenario that we assume that the child can assume and invest and get these elderly their own house. The reason why this won't work is because these elderly still won't get enough care. That is the parents don't want to bother children with their issues. They don't want to care because they already feel bad about getting their own house. They're going to love you and assume you're busy. That's why if you have back pain, you won't tell your children. And at this point, we say that issues are more likely to become too late to respond to. We think there's going to be a little world in turn, possibly even death, whether injuries or any kind of damage is untreated."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "With this in mind, why is our world better? Three reasons. First is because when you live together, you're going to be more comfortable sharing your issues. You're more likely to talk to these elderly about their days or problems when you live together and see communication over the dinner table, for instance. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "But secondly, even if there wasn't any kind of direct sense of communication, we see that you're physically able to see their kind of issues since you're up close to them. So at the point when you see that they're limping or any kind of coughing extravagantly, we say that you can send them to hospital and make sure that they're going to be okay at a more urgent pace than opposition side. We say that you're able to provide more affection and love on our side. "}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "But thirdly, we say our side is better because distance creates apathy. You see them less, they become a secondary consideration that when you go there, it's just going to be a two-hour visit, which it was kind of an obligation, right? So in our side, you make sure that the relationships between the elderly and the child become primary considerations. They care about each other the most."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "Why do we get better fulfillment? It's two reasons. First is because we say that we provide a sense of fulfillment because the elderly can watch their grandchild raise up or watch their own child be independent and go on with their lives. We say this is going to be much better. But secondly, is that the problem of the status quo in retirement homes is all the old people do is they just watch TV all day or just play bingo with their elderly friends. This is problematic because this is usually the reason why they don't have any kind of sense of living. This is one of the reasons why many people say elderly are more likely to feel depressed because they don't do anything productive. On our side, we look for things for elderly to do, such as interacting with grandchildren on a daily basis, perhaps cooking or doing any kind of more chores to help out the family. We say that in terms of fulfillment, our side is better. So to weigh this is that elderly people want fulfillment. We provide them, unlike opposition, where because of our likely cases that are analyzed, this is impossible for opposition's case. "}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "Secondly, why is this going to be better for children? Two reasons. First is that we open up important opportunities for women or single parents who are unable to afford nannies or cannot afford babysitters. That means that they're not able to take the jobs they want to take. They have to quit jobs they want to participate because they have to take care of their child and stay at home. At this side, we say that it's much better because women are able to seek help from parents. The parents are staying home. And instead of perhaps like affording some kind of stranger or some kind of shady babysitter, you're able to ask your parents for help to look after your grandchild. We think this is going to be better for both elderly because they could look after their grandchild. You're going to provide seek and affection, but also good for the child themselves because they can have their own child looked after."}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "But secondly, is that they won't feel a sense of regret. Is that we think that in the status quo, these children usually feel regret, not feeling depressed because they weren't able to do what they could have done when their parents might have had an injury at a retirement home when they couldn't find out their injuries during the two-hour visit of an obligation. We think these can often be the stamp for suicide or differentiation. For instance, we take care of mental health and prevent any kind of regret happening."}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "Now, we understand opposition is going to probably come up here with like some kind of likely case that these parents are going to impose social norms. So this isn't going to be true. It's not going to be good. Given that they say this, three rebuattals. First, is that parents who are extreme traditionalists will usually do this on both sides and do this from a young age. So this point wouldn't be really mutually exclusive. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "But secondly, is that this isn't susceptible because since they're parents now, we think they will have decent footing with one other. It's unlikely that the elderly would just be super mean and angry and dominant over an adult child. "}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "But thirdly, we think it's better to resolve these conflicting implications by living together. So if a child is gay, it's better to show that they're gay by living a comfortable life with them instead of just saying that the gay child is fine during a two-hour visit. At this point, we say our side is better for a world where both sides seek benefits. I'm happy to propose."}]}
