But my grandma managed to set an unknown password on her iPad, and she locked herself out. So then now we have an iPad in her house that hasn't been open for five years or more because she chose this like unknown password, and that she can't figure out. So basically, my point here is that just saying that we can do stuff online sounds simple, but it's not simple for the elderly, right? Elderly people are simply, no offense, but they're not really used to electronics. It's really hard for them to suddenly have this kind of device that allows them to communicate with people online. There's a lot of difficulties that face them from making a simple account or even getting the internet, especially in rural areas where elderly live in secluded areas away from the city. They don't even bother to have an internet or a Wi-Fi router, right? So I think it's very infeasible when they say that, oh, we can just do this online, right? But more importantly, we say that even if they do get this kind of communication via screen, it's still not enough, right? Like, of course, I enjoy debating online, but I rather prefer doing it in person. The same goes for taking care of people, right? We think that the elderly don't just need to see their child's faces, right? "}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "There are lots of other needs that they have that can only be fulfilled by them living together. So basically, we see that the elderly are, first of all, very lonely, because maybe their spouses died decades ago, or maybe they're living in really rural areas that have a decreasing population. They just need someone to constantly be by their side. "}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "But more importantly, a lot of elderly have diseases, like both physically and mentally, that prevent them from living healthily on their own. This can be like Alzheimer's, right? If you have Alzheimer's, there's always a danger that you can wander away from your house, not be able to come back, or you can't remember what you wanted to buy for your groceries, or these kinds of things are like daily disturbances in order for you to live a comfortable life. But more importantly, if you become physically weak in the process, it's really hard for you to even go to the supermarket, especially if you have to drive, for example, because you're in rural areas, or like it's really hard to walk around the house as well. Because maybe if you have stairs, or maybe if you have like a really long hallway, it's really hard for you without the support of someone beside you. So firstly, we see that these kind of physical and mental issues are significantly serious, and that can never be solved on opposition side where they only have the internet."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "But secondly, why can't it be like helpers, right? Opposition so far has been talking about things like financial aid or getting helpers, or just sending them to daycare whatsoever. But we still think this is very bad for the elderly. First of all, there is not enough daycare nor helpers, especially in a lot of developed countries like Japan. There's so many populations of the elderly, and so few working-class people that the simple ratio isn't enough to fulfill the demand for these kinds of taking care of the elderly. So I don't think not all elderly would be able to get a helper or be able to get into a quality daycare. "}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "But more importantly, a lot of elderly don't want to go to daycare in the first place, especially if they have to leave the neighborhood or the community or the house that they've been living for decades and decades. It's really stressful for them to leave stuff behind, right? And more importantly, a lot of elderly, once they do go into daycare, they're going to be spending their whole day watching TV, playing bingo, doing meaningless stuff. And with this poor facility and little entertainment and small community, that overall leads to their stress, which also leads to the shortening of their lives, and a lack of quality of life that we can never support. That is why we still say that this kind of financial support provided to the elderly is still not enough."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "Then on the other hand, what we see uniquely from the government side is things like physical health and physical comfort, and direct communication between the child and the parent. This kind of intimacy and this kind of physical proximity is what we can uniquely achieve on government side, and the reason why you should vote for the government."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "But then let's look at what they themselves talk about in their arguments, right? So firstly, this whole issue about children getting a lot of stress because they have to cope with their grandparents or their parents' lives and so on. But we negate the very premise that they wouldn't be able to coexist, right? Let's say like a working mother, and like their high school daughter have really different lifestyles, and have maybe different times to wake up, but they still live together, right? We think that just because you wake up at different times doesn't mean that you're incapable to live together. I think it's very possible for these two members to live happily in the house. "}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "But even if maybe they might say, oh, if they're together all the time, it might lead to a huge burden, etc. You don't have to always be together, right? The unique thing about side government is that you're always in close distance so that you can check on them when you have to or like when you need to, but that doesn't mean that you're always going to be standing over them and watching their every move, right? You could always have different rooms, for example, or you have like a lot of like in the first floor, there's the first generation, and the second floor, there's the grandparents that can also, there can be lots of flexible lifestyles within that one house, where like people can live both independently, but where people can also reach out when they actually do need help. So overall, we think that like the possibility of this a huge emotional cost or like huge disturbance to their lifestyle is pretty low. Also considering the fact that today we have a lot of things like paid leave, or like companies supporting their workers to leave their job in order to support their parents, I think it's very feasible for the child to live healthily, even when they have to take care of parents."}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "But secondly, they talk about how like elderly becomes like overly dependent on the child, and therefore like it becomes like easy for them to give up, etc, right? Two responses. Firstly, like, just because they're dependent doesn't mean that it's something bad, right? We think that it's the elderly deserve to get a bit more attention than they do now, considering the fact that they have a lot of mental and physical needs that they can't cope by their own. So I think it's okay for them to depend on their child for groceries or depend on their child for things like mental communication or like daily chats."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "And we think that like the will to live and the will to survive and keep fighting wouldn't decrease onside government because you're always together with your family, your son or your daughter or your grandchildren. Being with your family together is your motivation to keep living, right? On the comparative, when we see old people dying off because they're so lonely in offside opposition's world, we think that there's a higher possibility that elderly becomes more motivated to keep living, and they wouldn't give up inside government's world."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "So secondly, our second response is that like, in the end, it's comparatively better than what we see outside opposition, where like a lot of elderly people do not get the resources they need, do not get the mental support, the attention they need, and they ultimately die off, either from like mental, like lack of mental support, or lack of physical support. So overall, what we see onside government is both the elderly and children living together in harmony, supporting each other, and leading happier and sustainable lives for all these reasons."}]}
