When public officer raped women being drunk, knowing that being drunk actually deprives him of the ability to judge reasonably, he got only three months of suspension from his job. He didn't lose job at all, and he was just released after his sentencing for three months. We think simply that's not enough, and we think intoxication defence is illegitimate as a form of defence. We were very happy to propose this motion today."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "I have two things to tell you from my speech. Firstly, how the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes such as rape, and secondly, why intoxication defence is illegitimate and should be abolished from the perspective of the criminal justice system. But before that, several points of model."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Of course, Mr Speaker, we are very happy to inform how alcohol deprives a person's ability to judge and act reasonably, and we think it goes through the educational processes that we are doing right now. We think that before drinking, he should know that his judgment ability would be probably diminished, and we are very happy to inform for those informations. And we also support rehabilitation centres when you're in prison or whether or not you're in prison or not, you can actually go to a rehabilitation centre if you have that alcohol problem, and you'd be better, you should probably feel the responsibility when we abolish the intoxication defence."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "But the point is, at the point in which you drink, knowing that alcohol causes you a judgment problem, then you will be responsible fully for the action you do during the time of being drunk, right? So having drunk like that, then you'd be more to the first issue, right? So the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes. So simply, we think the punishment mitigated based on you being drunk, by mitigating this based on being drunk, victims are not inadequately compensated. They feel their damage, and damage isn't really fully compensated. And also, the criminal also don't really regret the problems that they caused during drunk, and they actually end up causing repetitive crime, and we think this possibility will be higher under their paradigm, right? Yes."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "<POI> So what if the individual is intoxicated by a side effect of a medicine that they're prescribed? Your cases are just about specific cases of rape which are rape-coaching criminal justice, and does not accommodate the variety of cases of intoxication, right?"}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "Ah. I'm not sure if I'll answer that, sorry. So why does this happen, right? Firstly, we think that when you drink, you know that you'll be excused to some extent, right? Just like the public officer who said in the court that I was drunk, I couldn't really control myself, and he lost, he just mitigated his crime, and said this, and only stayed in three months. He knows that he will be excused, and at the point in which you drink and you do some stupid things, you know that you'll be excused, right? "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "But secondly, socially also, you seem to be excluded, right? The narrative that surrounds this crime, because you're drunk, you're not that as responsible as other cases, right? We think that's a kind of norm that's created through this system, because the state officially recognizes as a mitigating factor and legitimate cause of defense, right?"}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "So as a result of that, two harms happen. Firstly, victims are damaged in the court trial, in the process of court trial, when they hear that the offender says, because of alcohol, I wasn't responsible, right? We think that narrative itself that exists in the court is very harmful for victims to enter the court, and we think that's a double jeopardy for these victims. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "But secondly, also, there is a danger of repetitive crime, right? Please note that the drug rape problem has a repetitive tendency, 60 or 70% of repetitive tendency, right? So if it's because of the alcohol, you don't regret your action at all, because you raped the alcohol and not really blaming the actions and your ability to judge, which is resulting in more and more numbers of victims being raped after sentencing and also after sentencing of offenders, and we think this problem has been so long left in, especially in Japanese society and other universities, rape in cultural society, right?"}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "No, sorry. So we think that's the problem. But more importantly, secondly, why intoxication defense is illegitimate and should be abolished? So we think that this is an illegitimate formal defense that is more bankrupt. So first reason is because, as I stated, right, it's your choice to choose to drink and choose to maybe prescribe the medicine in a situation where you might do something wrong, right? So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments, and probably that is your choice also, right? So meaning that even if you do things while you're being drunk, at the point in which you choose to drink and to actually go into the society knowing that you might be a hanko, we think those persons should be fully responsible for actions, right?"}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "It's totally different from, for example, insanity defense, where people don't choose to be a mental illness or cannot really control themselves, but it's rather the way that you choose to drink, right? So it allows us probably to drink drunk driving, where you probably drink and you drive and you're punished, right? So even if you have multiple judgments, that doesn't mean that you are not responsible for action. You should be punished equally, right? So why is this important at the end of the day? We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the bitter-bitter justice for victims, right? Victims don't care why you started drinking or started, you know, you lost your judgment ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which those are the ones who didn't choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example. And like, we think that's, for that sense, we think intoxication defense is immoral as a defense and should not be really justified and for that reason, I'm very happy to support this."}]}
