Because we have told you that if there are circumstances in which this could be applied, like in cases where prescribed medicine causes a new side effect because you were not being well that day and you did something terrible. It might be that you have a hard drinking session and you did some terrible thing, but it's kind of a cultural thing, you know, cooperation that was unavoidable for you."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "But even if it's your after-choice and you're just drinking and going on with it, these circumstances, you were not yourself. You were not really remembering it, you don't really think about it, and it's that your culpability is minimized. We were telling you that it might be that in some cases they are really responsible, but there are multiple cases where these people do not take the reasonable culpability as compared to where they were rational and not drinking or not being intoxicated by the substances. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "I'm telling you that I think the distinction reasonably exists, this framework should exist. Once again, this circumstantial argument from coming from God, we can deal with them specifically. The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were caused into situations because they were telling us that for some minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice. I don't think that's how justice should work."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Three questions. Firstly, is this policy beneficial or are those benefits justified in taking this policy? Secondly, should the consent on whether you're drunk or not matter in the debate? And thirdly, if I have time, I'll talk about what is important in the criminal justice system. So, rebuttals integrated. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "So, is this policy beneficial or are the benefits justified? So, the main argument is that rape is terrible, we've got to do something, and they're willing to say that rape is so important that they're willing to abolish it if they don't care about the traitor. One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in addressing the situation. We're talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice framework. We're talking about investigations and assessing of situations that are especially in drunk cases being highlighted as Scandinavian nations taking more hard criminal sanctions on rape cases where people are doing active things and trying to get away with it. These discussions are happening and these things are gradually changing. I don't necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute because if you are able to put in specific clauses about drunk cases in rape situations, then they achieve their goal."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "So, the argument is best saying that we should abolish intoxication defense in rape cases and not necessarily supporting the motion. Because if it takes the alternative, you don't have to sacrifice all the alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked about, and people intoxicated at the time of one's sins and get all their benefits. So, I don't know why they're willing to get the trade-off. "}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "But even if we concede that they can get the benefit, we argue that criminal justice is about inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation. So, ultimately, your attempt to prize one specific case for the case for the sake of sacrificing other considerations or other situations is against the basic framework of criminal justice. You're abandoning your attempt to be proportionate and inclusive of a variety of situations that considerations are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was so clear and substantive from leaders of opposition. "}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "But another even-edged case is that if criminal justice is so distorted by offenses or rapes or patriarchal judges of things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help because it's still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and sins going on there. And you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved.

We don't think that is important because they have not responded to our leader of opposition to stand up for how victims' emotions are not considered in criminal justice, which is a factual thing. But also importantly, that argument is invalid. If that argument is true, they're saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defense would also be discussing the victim and that the cause of insanity defense ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they have to do this kind of thing, maybe discussing the victim so they're willing to abolish that. But that's not how they made the principle of distinction. I don't think that's how, obviously, it should work. So while we think that argument, even if it's beneficial, does not justify taking this policy."}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "So thank you. The last practical thing they said was that crimes increase, we want deterrence. We think, obviously, it's just that a 10-year sentence might become an 8-year sentence with the existence of this defense. You have the social sanctions and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it. I don't think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate. But also deterrence is just one part of the clause. So if deterrence is important in that specific case, we might increase the punishment. But that is not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent power clause that exists in the criminal justice system. So I don't know why abolishment makes sense. Sure.

Should the choice of you drinking matter that much? The principle argument coming a bit from Gov is that, you know, you're drunk, you are aware of it, so you should take the responsibility and just face it. That is not really important, because, firstly, I think they had no response to our argument from the leader of our position and the deputy talking about our culpabilities at the core of the criminal justice system, where to the extent that you are trying to impose sanctions on an individual and to the extent that we consider fairness as important, we need a reasonable accusation and grounds that these people are responsible for their acts to impose any punishment on these individuals and why assumption of innocence exists. Obviously, these individuals, because they were not necessarily themselves when they were drunk, they don't remember it, they usually wouldn't do that, which means that the extent that they take responsibility for their acts is decreased and to the extent that even if we agree to that, there's a different parallel reason to consider that they should be decreased of their punishment and why that doesn't really prove any validity in this debate. "}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "But also importantly, they say that insanity is okay but drunk is bad. We think that's a bad argument. Because, essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally vulnerable and you can't think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational, or they're not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances. Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take the choice of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware of the risk that they might go kind of mentally unstable and do these acts and they're not willing to impose on these individuals and understand the distinction."}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "And the last point about planned crime and composite crime, that's important because their argument is technically saying that you're drunk and you chose that, you should take the full responsibility, distinct from other people that are rational. Meaning that, if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the responsibility. Meaning that, if you opt into it and knew that you'd opt into a framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that's technically saying that a well-planned crime, which you opt into fully, and a composite crime, which you're very compulsively opt in, have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that. And I think that doesn't matter and it doesn't make sense to think it's both."}]}
