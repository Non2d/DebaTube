First of all, what they are trying to prove is that they are opposing the entire concept of the intoxication defense itself. So that's the state of the government's side has to need to decide any cases that's why students need not necessarily to consider about the intoxication defense, even if there is a certain possible existence, it's obvious that they cannot control themselves this kind of situation. Rather, they can provide proof as to why students, in any case, need to abolish the concept of this type of defense itself. "}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "The second point is that we do not rather than have the responsibility to disperse completely any no responsibility about committing a crime. Obviously, we are more than happy to consider the extent, to what extent they cannot control themselves, the understanding of these things, or furthermore, we are more than happy to consider whether or not they can avoid becoming intoxicated or not, to what extent the harassment by the bossy case, or to what extent they can avoid taking medicine, this kind of thing. We are more than happy to also consider this kind of situation. So, that's the clarification. So, I have one question. First of all, whether or not we can have the responsibility to disperse properly becoming intoxicated or not. "}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Before moving on, that's two points of response. So, they're talking about, they're consciously talking about that as a student, we cannot make this sense of rape problematic, people are using these defenses, and they're committing again and again. It's obvious that out of the debate, if this rape is problematic, people are actually intentionally committing crime, again and again, and abusing this type of defense. We are more than happy to also consider this situation. So, obviously, these people are abusing all day, and certain consciousness, we are more than happy to punish them. It's obvious that the debate, what the debate is about, we can just allow the people who became intoxicated, the situation, can have the responsibility about their action or not. "}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "First of all, they're talking about, the first speaker talking about the rape culture, etc. Two responses here. First of all, fundamentally, it's also nothing to do with us, this motion based on us, it's obviously that defense is at the principle level. Furthermore, we say that the rape culture is obviously related with us, whether or not the court making, particular decision making, or not. So, even if it's a significantyl related to these, and also, after this system, people recognizing that the responsibility or the situation in the toxication, it's rather counterproductive, I think that. Because in such cases those potential criminals may figure out way how to defend themselves by blaming victims. For example, victimes can be thought to know the culture and created the situation and have some responsibility. So, that's rather counterproductive to combtat rape culture. Uh but it's not so much relevant to this motion. But after all, it's counterproductive."}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "Okay, so, um, okay, moving on to the first issue, my issue, whether or not we can, whether or not these people have a responsibility in the intoxication situation. So, we think that, generally, that these people cannot avoid and cannot control themselves, and actually they are committing a crime, because they are in the situation of intoxication. Two layers of analysis. First of all, before they become intoxicated, whether or not they can choose to become intoxicated or not. So, we think that, because as my partner already told you, it's obviously that it's inevitable to become intoxicated. For example, taking the medicine, or the sudden pressure from the boss's existence. They don't just quit, or just control themselves, etc. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So, first of all, as I already mentioned, we want to also consider that to what extent this pressure is so huge or not. So, that's why we still recognize that even the power harassment is recognized as sexual harassment, it's problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it, some people are forced to do particular actions. So, on that occasion, we also consider that part. "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "For example, they talk about that they took the preemptive measure, they do not go outside, etc. Two responses here. First of all, it's from the perspective of the individual who is gradually becoming intoxicated. It's extremely difficult to understand to what extent I am rational, to what extent I am becoming intoxicated, etc. Even taking drugs, or even taking alcohol. So, on that occasion, even still, yes, they believe in that. Maybe I am 30% rational, maybe I do not commit a crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation. So, on that occasion, it's easy to understand whether I am rational or not, but still, they need to keep their ordinary life. They need to, for example, take drugs, they go to the supermarket, or some situation. So, on that occasion, someone believes, maybe I am not so much, 30% rational, I do not commit a crime, etc. Are they going to do so? Actually, it's obviously not so much easy to take preemptive measures."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "<POI>If we pass this activity, don't you think it's more likely, for example, workers can avoid the housemaid, saying that I will never be mitigated, or those people will act more responsibly? "}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "It's obviously nothing to do with this debate. Because even if the children commit more crimes, they will still be supporting the child's defense over this kind of idea. The obvious thing is that, whether or not people commit a crime or not, it's obviously a different debate as to whether or not we can give a punishment to those people, and whether or not we can consider that in this kind of situation. So, okay. And also, still that they have a certain punishment, a huge punishment in existence, obviously that's workable, as it turns out."}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "Second point, about the other day, becoming the intoxication situation. So, as I already mentioned that, whether or not they are intoxicated or not, it's extremely important, that's a big metric. Furthermore, if you want to become intoxicated, you cannot consider that so much. What I mean by this, is that if you become intoxicated, you can understand what is the linkage with your action, and what is the consequence of that. So, for example, just people who drink too much, so, punching something, so they do not understand whether or not it's a damage to this something, or also how to damage themselves, this kind of thing."}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "So, people cannot understand what is the consequence of their action. They can easily imagine that. So, that's why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people, because they cannot understand what is their action, and what are the consequences of their action. It's very much the same as child defense, or insanity defense, these kinds of things. So, that's why they do not intentionally commit crimes. They learn how to accidentally commit crimes. It's not easy to think that this is a responsibility of that person. So, what I told you, first of all, this is a debate about to what extent people have a responsibility. First of all, we think that it's not easy to avoid becoming intoxicated. Furthermore, after becoming intoxicated, people cannot control themselves. So, that's why we propose."}]}
