It might seem that the degree of responsibility differs between intoxicated criminals and non-intoxicated criminals, so it might seem, according to the opposition, that when it comes to deciding on mitigation, this difference of degrees of responsibility should be taken into account, hence intoxication defense, and the opposition might seem to have a very easy debate here. So that's why they didn't deepen their case beyond self-cultural things."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "So the government's burden is to show how this sweeping denial of intoxication defense can be successful, and this burden will be met by how society currently deals with intoxication problems, making individuals informed about the danger of intoxication, and making them capable of making decisions upon that intoxication. The way we as a society view substance intoxication and the way we inform people about it justifies a special case against intoxication defense sweepingly, and that is the point I'm going to summarize in this speech."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "So, unfortunately, I have only one flashpoint, which is obviously how we should recognize the difference of degrees of responsibility between intoxicated and non-intoxicated criminals. So the main point was clear from the leader of the opposition, saying that responsibility should be carefully calculated in case of criminal cases because public trust in the criminal justice system is important, and because rights restrictions should always be carefully justified on a case-by-case basis. So the first response to this general argument is that, this is shallow, I think, but the second response is that if trust matters, then the leader of the opposition's rebuttal to our Prime Minister's point about the victims' interests doesn't stand at all because we generally have doubts on the criminal justice system that continually decreases the terms of imprisonment of criminals just because they were intoxicated at the moment, right? So we think if we are carrying all the public trust in the criminal justice system, we think that comes in favor of our case against this kind of defense."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "And the second response is against their point about rights restrictions. Any rights restriction should be justified adequately. And we have no disagreement here. This point is, I think, related to a deeper issue that the opposition side presupposed but not explained. Free will or self-control. We say that the degree of responsibility of one's action should be based upon how much reasonable self-control one could have exercised in the process leading to criminal actions, right? So those who lack the ability to act on self-control at any point of that process cannot be punished as harshly as those who are self-controlling. That might be the opposition's case."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "And now we have to make some differentiation between substance intoxication and non-intoxication. So how does substance intoxication differ from other cases of diminishing responsibility? So the opposition prefers analogies of mental illness or insanity defense, or more specifically, or characteristically for today's opposition, side effects of medicines."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "So firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one's own self-controlled choice that one enters the gate to intoxication. So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, begins from one's choice in the first place. Not only that, the continual substance addiction or the ongoing process of being addicted can be avoided, could have been avoided, by one's own self-controlled choices. For example, going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals. "}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "And that choice, or that self-controlled choice, was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions. So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-intoxicated defendant's cases. So we think this is the massive difference of substance intoxication from other cases, such as mental illnesses because obviously there is no self-control in the process leading to mental illness and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "<POI> If your argument is true, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? Sorry? So if the fact that you knew it and you opt into it is all that matters, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? "}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "No, we don't have to make that distinction because... Okay, let's talk about that later. Okay, let's take the preferred cases one by one."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "So this said first, then what about the side effect of medicines? So we think the opposition cannot just throw one possible case of intoxication. They must show that such a case is significantly likely to lead to intoxicated criminal actions that are totally detached from self-control's decision-making. So we think that deep explanation was lacking in the opposition's case despite the fact that they tried to be specific about each case."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "Secondly, they said, then what about being forced by bosses to drink? Bassai already responded in his rebuttals, but to put the fundamental point from a criminal policy perspective, we have always warned the public or cautioned the public of the dangers of substance intoxication in our daily practices. For example, we campaign against drug violence. Those campaign posters against drug violence appear time and again in train stations, for example. An anti-drug campaign exists everywhere. Also, Tamifu is already known as dangerous enough to distort your calculation, right? So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control. "}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "Also, the fact that we abolished intoxication defense will enhance our ability to deal with such problems as forcing and persecution-related problems. The point is that the way society approaches crimes expresses the society's view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing to drink is dangerous, Tamifu is dangerous, and all these evaluations of the opposition's proposed problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated upon on a daily basis. And we think these kinds of effects don't exist for mental illness, right? We can't warn people against becoming mentally ill, and we think this is a clear distinction. Enough. We are done."}]}
