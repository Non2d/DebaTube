You're being coerced by your boss to drink in order to increase your sales revenue, etcetera. On the other hand, he also told us, look, they're going to be punished anyway. They are sitting in a room where they think they are responsible for the inevitable action ordered by the boss, meaning that it's massively contradictory. They have agreed that there are cases, well, I mean, in their cases specifically, in their favorite cases, that even in the inevitable cases, there are rooms where those people are responsible for their actions. What we argue from our proposition is that their case, what they told us, is not inevitable in any way, but even if they are inevitable, they already made a massive concession by their side that they should take responsibility on the inevitable cases. We don't really understand why. 20% it was boss's fault for me to reduce it, but 80% was, you're coerced, but still it's responsible by yourself. They have to deserve it. We think that is wrong."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "I'll talk about two things. I'll talk about, firstly, a brief idea, a rebuttal idea about this. Rape cases, an idea of the main side effect, and secondly, why even in their case, in their favorite, when we talk about this medicine or customer sales, why we think those people are still responsible and should not deserve intoxication defense."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Firstly, what are the cases we're talking about? The first case we have told you that, well, there are the problem of understanding of gender problems, like rape cases, for example."}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "What we've told from the opposition that rape is not only a problem about intoxication defense, but there are other things that are also involved, when we talk about gender biases, etcetera. We don't deny that. Maybe that is a problem we also have to fix. But also, what we have conceded, had a concession from opposition, is that he didn't deny this idea of gender intoxication defense is one part of the big problem that associates by getting a verdict to defend it, or rape, etcetera."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "The problem we have is that there are people who say, well, that person was drunk, so he raped, so he won't deserve punishment. But still, he deserves a less punishment, maybe it's a factor, because it wasn't for himself. When we talk about boss requesting the employees to keep drinking for increasing the sales salary, he said, well, you know, I'm forcing him to drink a lot in order to increase sales revenue. But, you know, partial part of it is something negative, right? Then he's not going to receive a certain less punishment than he actually deserves. We don't think other people should be blamed on that point, right?"}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "What we want to blame for those victims, the criminals, is that it was you who knew that drinking a drug could give you a side effect at that point. You should have asked, and you could have asked, a help to other people. You could have asked your mom to lock up the door so you don't have to go outside or keep bullying other people, for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather, any other family members, to be with you when you have to go outside to a supermarket to buy a drug, for example."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "So that person can control you when you have used your conscience and may start attacking someone else's, right? There are lots of options that a person could have taken. A person has actually the negligence and said, I'm not going to take any of those options and I'm just going to go out because I want to, right? And I think actually being forgiven a part of it, it was, you know, it was a side effect, right? I couldn't do anything about it. Even though that person could have done a lot of things to prevent that, right? That person didn't do it. We think that person deserves a punishment at that point, yes."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "<POI>So your logic was like, people should be punished without any defenses because you made some decision that caused crimes in the end. So why don't you maintain insanity defense because mentally ill people chose to go outside, which caused crimes?"}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "Well, the distinction here is right. This is a huge distinction, right? So when a mentally ill person decided that this person is going to go out, that person, already before going out, does not have a full capability of deciding what's going to happen when they go outside. What are the other viable alternatives that that person could take in order to prevent all the possible harm that could happen, right? That's the distinction, right? Before people become drunk, they're not drunk, right? Obviously, they have certain constants that they control by themselves. That's the distinction between insanity defense or target of people who are mentally ill."}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "Second case was, look, other plausible case was the boss is going to force them so they have to drink, right? Firstly, the requirement from the boss is an absolute, right? If you're going to deny, it's not like you're going to be killed, right? There are a couple of options you can take. One worst-case scenario, just quit. Second option, just go to a harassment center or whatever, just claim your boss that you've been coerced to do all this alcohol harassment whatsoever."}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "We think that person are more likely to be told, you should not coerce your employees to drink too much, but that person is going to be squished because there are lots of problems that are associated with harassment and compliance that are associated in any other country or Western world democracy, including Japan, that it's a wrong thing to keep doing all this harassment and we should be nice to those employers. We think that very function as well. There are lots of options that a person can take. And moreover, if that's necessary, we think that boss should also be coerced, right, into punishment, etcetera. That person making those employees lose control by the coercive orders, right? There's lots of options that customers or employees can take. Obviously, it was not inevitable. It was your choice."}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "And moreover, that person didn't have to keep drinking forever, right? We have to realize that all these problems often happen when the individual drinks often too much over their capacity that they cannot control anymore, right? They have also had an ability to control how much they drink in the vast majority of cases, but they didn't do that. They have realized, what boss told me to do is I'm just going to drink a far lot more than the capacity I can have in order to create all the problems, right? We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control on their mind, but they didn't choose to, and therefore those people deserve punishment. That's why in any cases, intoxication defense should not be allowed. It was your fault. You deserve punishment. That's all it is."}]}
