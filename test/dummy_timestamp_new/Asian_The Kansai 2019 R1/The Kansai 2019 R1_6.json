For example, sales forces can avoid drinking, they can quit, they can sue bosses for harassment. Actually, that's not important, even though that's a case coming from our side of the house. What we need to talk about here is that there are some differences of gravity of responsibility between these sales forces punching someone and clearly conscious people punching someone intentionally."}, {"start": 601.0, "end": 602.0, "text": "Maybe it's right, but there will be some differences between people who are drunk and people who are not drunk. They may have succeeded to explain the difference is not that big. Yeah, they could explain that. Maybe the difference is not that big. People chose to be drunk, people chose to avoid drinking, that will be the choice of the individual. That's why maybe the difference is not as big as we told you from the beginning."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "But the thing is, they couldn't prove there should be no differences of treatment for individuals who are drunk and who are never drunk, and who are consciously punching someone. So, maybe that will already show how we won this debate, but I want to talk about some other government's principle, and I want to clarify why we clearly won this debate."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "So, the basic principle coming from their side of the house was that people made a decision to pass the gate that will be connected to crimes, and they are informed of the risk that their action will ultimately lead to some consequences. Okay, let's look at non-toxicated criminals. So, they chose to go outside consciously, they chose to buy a knife consciously, they chose to meet a person they hate consciously, they chose to stab someone, that person consciously, they chose not to call ambulances consciously, everything was conscious in that case."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "But conversely, how about intoxicated individuals? They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but they chose to drink a lot, that will be a conscious choice of individuals. They may be aware of some risk at this point, but they didn't choose to buy a knife, they didn't choose to meet a person that they turned to hate, they didn't choose to stab a knife into a person, maybe they even don't remember everything after they actually went drunk."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "So, intoxicated criminals are still very bad people, that's also a murder, but they should be sentenced according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be, the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate. But those kinds of expected risks are very different from cases where individuals are very conscious, have a clear mind to kill someone, there will be some differences."}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "Then, let's go back to the bottom group of the outsider house. We are talking about we should maintain the intoxication defense in the outsider house. We are not saying people shouldn't be mitigated in every circumstance. What they have to prove is there should be no kind of intoxication defense, people should be sentenced equally in every circumstance, even though they have some tiny responsibility, compare them between individuals who are very conscious and people who are not conscious, even though they chose to be drunk."}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "So, that's why I share a person. So, I think I won this debate already. They couldn't prove there is no any tiny difference between people who chose to drink and who didn't choose to kill someone, and people who are conscious about everything, there will be some differences. That's why that difference should be reflected in the sentences that should be given to individuals because that should be more equal treatment for individuals who are differentiating,  and that will be the most trustable system that we can rely on. For those reasons, I'm very proud to oppose."}]}
