We believe that there are two main theories that lose their case in this debate. First mistake they have made is that the line they draw on intoxication defense is so blurred to an extent that it sounds almost contradictory. At the point in which, Mizogami-san said, when you're drunk, you don't remember anything, and you are basically a different person. Then why and on what ground you are punishing the person? Because if you think that being drunk is so big of a deal to the extent that you don't remember anything, then probably you should not punish this individual at all. But the important point is that you didn't provide the reason as to why you can punish and then draw the line as to why that's legitimate."}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "The second mistake that they have made is that despite the fact that they keep claiming that there are some cases we should consider, they never really prove to us how that case is important to the extent that we should remain this framework. Because the trade-off that they give us is probably like taking Tamifu without guardian, and do you know the consequence of that? And the consequence is what, right? We don't see the impact, and you didn't really ground the impact as to why taking Tamifu and going out and do something, and your punishment is such a culpable thing, and we think that even if we give the trade-off thing, we think we are actually winning this debate."}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "But moving on to my issue, which is about is intoxication defense legitimate based on three criteria, I'll talk to you about this in this class, right? But the first reason they have told us is that we should keep this framework itself because citizens' trust is important, and we should be careful about treating individual rights, which is critically rebutted by Dr. Sun saying society now is becoming a hatred, having a hatred to a drinking culture, and this voice is not really heard under the jurisdiction system, and we think that point is dead, right?"}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "But secondly, more importantly, the criteria about the consequence of you being drunk, you are not really fully informed about the consequence of drinking, right? So that's the point I pointed out in the introduction, where if the result is unexpected, then why the hell you can actually punish this individual at all, right? We think when the point meets you, overgenerous, overly illustrated, the effect of the drinking problem, we think you lose the ground on why you can actually punish this individual."}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "But thirdly, more importantly, the point where you are forced by the boss, and therefore you should be mitigated of this crime, right? Then we think it's not the point, anything that can influence you taking action should be a mitigating factor, right? Maybe you didn't choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early, and you didn't choose that, and you kill someone, and you should be mitigated, right? We think anything then should be a mitigating factor, and we think explicitly, we said drinking and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously, therefore you should not be granted the mitigations, right? We think for that reason, I'm very happy to propose that."}]}
