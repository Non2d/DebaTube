First of all, we are debating on the existence of the concept about intoxication defense. We are not saying sentences for people who have committed a crime when they are drunk should be always mitigated, regardless of context. It's like any other existing defenses, like insanity defense. When perpetrators submit insanity defense as a case to ask for mitigation, there will be careful discussion about whether or not they actually don't have responsibility. If the court believes the application of that defense is good, maybe it should be applied. If the court doesn't think it is, it should not be applied. They cannot simply win this debate by throwing random examples, which sound bad."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "Second of all, we don't oppose regulations to prohibit actions when people are drunk. For example, drunk driving is prohibited. We are supporting that regulation as well. There is an expected consequence of it. That's why we are regulating drunk driving or some other actions when people are drunk, but we will support it. We claim the responsibility to not respect that regulation, but we are saying the consequences of things like being drunk or other substances should be mitigated, compared to other, for example, general murders, general damage to individuals, that's the stance from our side of the house."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So from the legal approach, I want to talk about two things. First of all, why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense principally, and I will, secondly, deep dive on specific cases why it is not reasonable to abolish intoxication defense in their side of the house. "}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Before that, several independent rebuttals to the Prime Minister. First of all, they provided cases about rape repeatedly. I don't say it's completely irrelevant at all. But problems regarding rape cases are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense but in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of sentences for rape are generally very low. Those kinds of issues are consistently discussed in the current context. We say, they are talking about rape is very lightly treated. It's not about this debate. They need to talk about it in other debates."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "And secondly, they are talking about victims. Victims' rights are unrespected in the status quo. But criminal cases don't respect victims' rights to much extent, unfortunately, as a system. Victims' voices are heard as one evidence to discuss culpability, but victims' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be heard already in the status quo. If you want to argue some compensation things for the rape victims, it will be another debate about intoxication defense in civil cases. That will be a completely different debate. Then, also, it's the same for insanity defense. Victims don't care that people have mental illness or so forth. But still, insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator's right and prosecute individual in a fair manner. That's the core principle of the criminal justice system."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "So let's move on to my first point about the principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the prosecuting individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice system is built on a trust of citizens. Every single individual should feel it's a fair jurisdiction under equality of law. That's why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law. If people feel it's not fair, I don't have any responsibility for this particular crime. That way criminal justice system cannot work in the first place."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "And secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of an individual to a great extent which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for consequences caused by the person without any doubt by the individual. That's why we assume presumption of innocence. In order to protect the right of individual who committed a crime, that's why we put the burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors not on the side of defendants. So that should be consistently working in a status quo. That's why using intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "Then let's move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained. So for example, Ms. Speaker, taking alcohol and other intoxicant substances are oftentimes inevitable. For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it's really inevitable to go out drinking with customers. It's not limited to alcohol, Ms. Speaker. For example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things which they can do in other very ordinary situations. For example, you may receive Tamiflu as a drug for influenza. So in those circumstances, patients don't have any ways to avoid taking those medicines, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their side of the house."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "But in their circumstances, when they abolish every single intoxication defense, the people who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances and the people who commit a murder when they take Tamiflu are going to be prosecuted in the same way in their side of the house. That is very helpful in terms of fairness for individuals who don't feel like I'm very untreated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons. That's why we think that should stand before moving on here."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "Okay. Tamiflu is taken in the case of influenza, right? You choose to go aside the beings that are severely ill, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the case of the complete harm of the influenza. I don't understand your point of information. Taking Tamiflu is also the realm of this debate. We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicated circumstances. They need to defend why people who are under the law need to be prosecuted in the same way compared to other people in ordinary circumstances. "}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "So why is this analysis important? Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defense from insanity defense in their side of the house was that a person didn't choose to be in that situation. But in many circumstances, even about alcohol, about other intoxicated circumstances, a person didn't choose to be in that situation. For example, they don't choose to be a sales rep. They don't choose to be going drinking with customers. That will be the order from, for example, the boss. That is not controllable consequences for individuals. That's why they are mainly distinguished that intoxication defense from other defenses are already not standing in their side of the house."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "And also, we told you, so that's important. And also, we told you, in those circumstances, victims, for example, when customers are punched by those sales reps, don't care whether people are better or not, people are drunk or not. But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for those consequences is severely different from people who are doing the same thing in ordinary circumstances. We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility. There will be sentences anyway in our side of the house. But we say there is a slight difference over that responsibility that individuals can take. That should be affecting the sentences that individuals will receive in our side of the house. For all these reasons, we are very proud to oppose."}]}
