Secondly, is taking this motion beneficial for women? The second question is more important than the first one because in such urgent situations, as the government side has explained, there is no place we made to care about what they call fairness, which was so unclear."}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "So moving on to the first question. They have, as we have already responded to the democracy argument, I'll concentrate on fairness. As for this point, their idea was that, look, just leaving women and men just the way it is, is fair. So let's just encourage them, which is a fair way. So then they have to prove that in the status quo, women and men are competing on the same ground, which they didn't prove. Because they proved that in the status quo, the election is unfair. Two things. So we told you how stereotype is in everyone. And so how people, so how women won't run for an election. So women are not even on the same ground. "}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "Secondly, they said that gender cannot be changed. So in elections, we can see profiles, names, photos, and all things are stopping people from fair judge because they are biased. So this beats the analysis on abilities. If they say that people who are capable should be elected, then in the status quo, the capable women are not elected."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "So moving on to the second point, which is, is taking this motion beneficial for women? So women are, in the status quo, unfairly imposed on the government. For example, when the government raised consumption tax to 10%, the government didn't raise the tax of daily products, but then they didn't, they did raise the tax of, like, 3D yohin, which is, for women, a daily product. So why did this happen? Because the men couldn't represent the feelings of women exactly. "}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "At least on our side, we can solve those kinds of problems, which are the serious problems. And if they say that after the plan is not fair, we still believe that the status quo is more unfair because now women are oppressed, but in this society, everyone has to be equal. So before anything, before everything, people have to be equal. That is the premise for everything, including democracy that the opposition side has been talking about. Also, we explain how we can solve inequality through exclusively zero points, by, like, giving a prize to companies that support women."}, {"start": 705.0, "end": 706.0, "text": "So overall, they said, like, in practical terms, they talk about backlash or stereotype, but these harms are unclear. So are they going to leave when women live unfair lives? And just concentrate on backlash or stereotypes and images. So we think that at least women might receive backlash, but at least on our side, women can get support from the government. So they can work, for example, by having her husband get childcare leave by the government. So we think that is more good for women. "}, {"start": 706.0, "end": 707.0, "text": "So overall, the other side's goal was to protect women, but they just concentrated on stereotypes and didn't concentrate on women's practical needs.
