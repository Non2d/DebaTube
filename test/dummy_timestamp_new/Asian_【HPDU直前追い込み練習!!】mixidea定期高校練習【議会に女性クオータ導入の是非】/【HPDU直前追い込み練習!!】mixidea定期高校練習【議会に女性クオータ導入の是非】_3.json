Because the nation can vote and they select the people and the candidates to live their future. And the candidates, after all, are not skilled. Only the female candidates are valued to join the parliament. So is it an equal opportunity? I don't think so. So I will oppose this motion."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "First of all, I will rebut their argument. This is about a stereotype. However, of course, if there is a stereotype, the people and the nation can vote.

So we can't see the necessity of introducing this motion. So how can females change the situation? It is unclear. We can't see the necessity.

First point is some of the females don't want to do it. Of course, some of the females will be pleased with this motion. Because they can join our parliament, they can get elected. However, some of the people will be unwilling to join it. Because of the government, the women can't join it. So it depends on the government."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "So even if they have a chance to get elected, almost all women don't want to join because of the government's dependence.

So it is very bad for women."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "Second point, second target is like maternities or females who don't desire it. So why is it serious? Because they have to join without forcing. So it is a very bad case. How government decides the rate or desire to join in parliament is unclear and irresistible. So forcing if women don't have it."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "And after plan, so first target like a skillful woman. Even if it is a woman who is very skillful, it is not a limit like a woman who is very skillful. Women have to do it. It is impossible. So it is a very bad cycle to discuss in parliament. Second target is like they said about women's maternity leave. So they will leave long term. It is bad and the women's image will be decreased if they leave. So I will oppose this motion. Thank you."}]}
