Even if it is enough of a just reason to implement quotas, we say that the harms actually are counterintuitive and counterproductive in the liberalization of these minority groups. I'm very happy to oppose."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "What is our stance as an opposition? We say our side has a stance of trying to achieve the issue of gender equality throughout measures that are not female quotas. That looks like things like engaging in targeted recruiting and trying to increase the number of women who are capable of entering elections. We're going to promote women applying for jobs which are very male-oriented, such as getting into STEM fields. We're also going to ensure fair pay and legislative action for paid leave, for instance. We think that those cases can be done by men and don't need a radical change of female quotas which harms and infringes on the principle of equal opportunity."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "The reason why this stance is so important but also so mutually exclusive on our house is that our side puts equal opportunity, the most fundamental case of democracy which government tried to say their side was supporting. We say that on our side, we make sure the woman with skills can go up the corporate ladder without any kind of bias, whereas in their world, they're automatically letting women into powerful positions. As a stance, we support different things, so if they try to say that all these kinds of things can be achieved on the government side, we say that's going to automatically mean their stance is contradicting because there's a difference between equal opportunity and affirmative action."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "With this in mind, two things come to mind. First, why this is principally unjust and shouldn't be taken in a democratic nation. And secondly, why their side harms women, the very factor they're trying to protect. "}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "Principly, this is unjust. We say that the principle of competition, regardless of elections, is equal opportunity. That is that we should ensure always that the one who deserves something should always get rewarded. Two reasons why. First is because this is true, even on governmental levels, is because democracy always ensures that people are able to fight on equal grounds. That's the reason why in many, several cases, regardless of race, for instance, the reason why corporates are able to choose, regardless of affirmative action, is because they always want the people with the most skills."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Two, the reason why we think female quotas infringe upon this principle is two reasons. First is because it puts the unworthy in worthy positions. As a premise, we cannot assume that just because a woman means that they are able to represent the values of all women. There's going to be women who respect abortions, for instance, while there's women who don't respect abortion. But even further, the fact that we don't, is that we don't think that something determined as a time of birth should be chosen to decide who's going to be the prime minister or some kind of politician in the first place."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "But secondly, this kind of female quotas is something that absolutely discriminates against men, right? You're using a variable that's unchangeable at the time of birth to decide who gets to be in powerful corporate structures. We think that principally this is unjust."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "But thirdly, we say this is bad because it fundamentally attacks the principle of democracy, which government was trying to say they were protecting. Why? Because you now have to make voters have to choose, magically choose a female, even if they don't agree with their kind of beliefs. We think that principally voting should be about voting who you want to choose for. We think that at this point, where you have to make voters select one male and one female, for instance, this goes against this kind of principle of equal opportunity."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "Secondly, why does this harm women then? Because we say that stigmatization and oppression are going to, it's going to continue. Why is this? Because in the case of having oppression and stereotypes, we think that even if you get these people into the parliament, they're still going to be just acted as a tokenization for instance, right? That they're going to be, these women are going to be treated as if they were just getting there without any kind of power, but just for the sake of filling up the number of females in the parliament. We think at this case, when tokenization is seen in European nations like France or Spain, we think that this is already true and that oppression and stereotypes are not going to disappear. We see it's going to be much worse."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "But secondly, we see this harms women because this puts women against only women, right? We think that the fairness should be that women and men have an equal ground of fighting against each other, making sure who has the most skill is able to be achieved. But the problem with this is that you're making women go against women trying to get into the quota, but you're also putting men against men. We think this is unjust, but realize that our side does actually the opposite."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "We liberalize and reduce stereotypes for two reasons. First is that we reduce stereotypes by making sure that the most capable people are able to go into politicians by ensuring that there won't be any kind of stereotypes or bias inside these kinds of elections or even in corporate levels. But secondly, we liberalize women because we tell them that they're not being chosen just because of women, but we're choosing them based on their own skill and capability and not a variable determined at the time of birth. We say that our side is much better because we protect the principle of fairness, but also we actually liberalize women, the very factor that government is trying to protect. I'm happy to vote."}]}
