First view is meaning. So, government side complains female candidates will be free from stereotype with this motion. However, this motion contradicts from its purpose because this motion itself represents stereotype. In fact, it looks bad on women. So, let me explain. All this motion is saying is that women can't be elected with the help of this motion. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "Meaning, after this plan, women are elected not because they are skillful or they deserve to be, but because they are women. So, this motion contradicts from its purpose of freeing women from stereotype. And also, our point is superior because we ensure equal relationship based on equal ground as the first speaker said. In our world, women can work against not only women, but also all candidates based on skill. And in addition to that, government side concedes that our side is better because they did not refute this point."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "So, let me move on to the second point. Second point is the benefit. So, government side claims that this motion can tackle the current problem of female inequality because there will be more female members of the parliament. However, this won't work. So, let's think why there looks no policy for women in the current situation. So, basically, government side misunderstands the current situation. So, why there looks less policy for women is because citizens as voters do not prefer such policy. So, basically, members of parliament are elected through equal vote including women or white, if any, or all people, right? So, this is the basic of democracy, by the way. So, because people have the right to vote equally based on their opinions, this current situation is not because of some stereotype or the problem government claims but it is because of the opinion of citizens as such. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "<POI>So, if you say that status quo problem is happening due to the small number of female candidates, how opposition paradigm can solve that kind of issue? "}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "So, even women or feminists have the right to vote and there's equal opportunity for women candidates. So, if we want some policies for women, we can just vote for such candidates. And also, it's not just women who will have such idea or have such policy, but also men can do so. So, there's no need for this motion."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "And let me move on. So, also, after this motion, also government assumes that men can't make rational decisions about childcare, as their second speaker says, I recall. This is incorrect because men also have children, right? And they have siblings and families, so they have more than enough incentive to take care of gender issues. So, their argument is meaningless. So, at the end of my speech, let me say that even if you take that they resolve female issues, we shouldn't dismantle the principle of equal opportunity as government conceded. And as we argued, this is what democracy is all about. And we're happy to oppose. Thank you."}]}
