So every voter will select one male candidate and also one female candidate in each selection. And the gender is based on one's acknowledgment. It's not necessarily physical gender. So that is our model."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "The three analyses for status quo. First, females are oppressed in many occasions, especially in issues exclusive to females, which are neglected and ignored in the status quo. For example, child care. They have exclusive possibilities to raise and give birth to children. There are many harms for females that males may not necessarily understand."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Our second analysis is that stereotypes are lessening the opportunity for women to make discourse. The current system is not a true meritocracy, as many means dominate societies and leaders, especially in parliament.

And other like parliament, it can be installed in another case that female quota is for female issues. And if ethnic problems or such things are so serious, it can be introduced. And yeah, that's the stance."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Back to analysis, there is a so-called meritocracy in the status quo, which is not actual. The idea that females can't have enough ability as males is perpetuating stereotypes, limiting opportunities for women to express themselves."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "The third analysis is that there is oppression motivating females to speak up and bring about change. The motion aims to break the unconscious voting based on stereotypes, allowing women to voice their opinions and contribute to societal change."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "Now, let me explain the exclusivity of this motion. Two things to say - why other solutions can't solve and why this quota can. In parliament, those who can be candidates can make an opinion and have a chance to change society. The quota ensures exclusive opportunities for women in this crucial role. So, I am so proud to propose."}]}
