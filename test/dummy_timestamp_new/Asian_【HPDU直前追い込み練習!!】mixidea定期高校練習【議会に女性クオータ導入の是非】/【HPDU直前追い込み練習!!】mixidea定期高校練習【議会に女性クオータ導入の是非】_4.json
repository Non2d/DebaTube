They never proved that how the situation of the women are going to improve in their side. So we actually think that our side wins because, and principally and practically, because these women are being exploited in society now. We'd like to talk with two things. Firstly, we'd like to do some kind of rebuttals to them. Secondly, we'd like to compare our point with our point, their points, by the principle and practical level."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "Alright. So firstly, we'd like to do some rebuttals. Well, right. Well, they said some, well, they say a lot of things. Well, firstly, they said that these kinds of like making some kind of law for women or like other things can be made by these kind of men. But we think that, but we think that the most important thing is that even these people can make these kind of law for the women. Well, some women are actually suffering from these laws. Right. Because it is not their will of having those kinds of laws. They're suffering. So actually, what we think is that principally, we have to make these kind of parliament as a place that each woman and the men are also going to discuss. Their opinion and going to make a better side. You guys ask me what we're going to make, what we want, what we want to make."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "And secondly, would they point that these kinds of like, is it isn't it good with some kind of like, for example, racial, racial like quotas that we think that. Well, firstly, we think that we can also introduce these kinds of things that even if it's impossible, we still think that we should introduce these female quotas in the diet. Why is it better? Because these are racial quotas. If we introduce it, what would happen is that we are going to like we think that we're going to introduce with the proportional population rate. This means that they're like the parties that only have like one percent of the quota of the minority ethnicity. We think that these kinds of discriminations will be emphasized in these cases because there's only like one percent and nothing will change. We are going to have a more hard time and we don't want to make it. We don't want to make these kinds of situations in the body, but in the world. "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "Well, as a proportionate population, there are mostly like 50 percent of male and 50 percent of women in this body. Because we say that democracy should be in the small, should be like a small nation to discuss for policy and make a better society without these discriminations. We say that because there are an equal number of females and men, we are male. We say that we can make a better, better discussion, better, better policy by doing it."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "And moreover, they also say that people should vote for their own will or because it's like a liberal and we can't liberalize women. But actually, we think that the woman is being sacrificed today because we say that people usually win when they vote. They usually see like what kind of experience they have before. If you have like if some politicians are chosen like five times, you're going to you have the high possibility to vote these people rather than the person who had never done these politicians. They ask me why these women are not in politics because women are not that have not been chosen or being sacrificed or being ignored in these elections. We think that these situations are still existing. And to change it, we think that we should give the experiment to these women to change these bodies."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "Next, I'd like to go to our comparison of the principle and practical level. All right. So firstly, we'd like to talk about which can work better for democracy principally. Well, firstly, they said that this kind of democracy should be chosen by who you vote or like what party are you going to vote or like that. Then we think that because as we told you, there'd be like democracy. Firstly, it should be a place that you're going to like make a better society by a better society by including the people who are in the country, for example, by using the proportional like proportional rate. Because we say that each of each person should have the right to speak out for it. They ask me why we think that is better.

However, we secondly, we want this to be because we actually told you that how we can improve the society practically, because we say that in today's situation, like child care leave or other situations, it's not improving enough.
