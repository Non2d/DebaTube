Firstly, she said that religious people will feel guilty because of the medical treatment, but it's not true, because religious people can justify post-medical care. They will think if the children have the medical care, the government forced us to take medical treatment, so we are not against our religion. So they can justify their medical treatment, and the other people in the community of this religion will not think so badly of this."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "And also, she said about the possibility of children's blaimed, but if the children are blaimed by the other student or other children, the government can or school can save them.

So we government must protect the children's right to choose their religion."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "And second, she said parents can decide because parents love their children and understand their children. But it's not true. We human beings are not about ourselves, mostly us, so we must decide about ourselves. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "So let me give you more arguments. Why is it so bad that children do not have body autonomies? As my partner told you, little children are immature in this consensus, and so to some extent, and could be possible extent, parents can decide when they are very little, for example, name of what they wear, and so on, because it is reversible in the future. But this is irreversible. We cannot bring the dead back. So children will lose their right to choose their religion forever."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "So why is it so bad? I think it is a consensus, religion is important, religion is a very fundamental part of our life, but the opposition side only considers the parental religious issues and so on. But children are also affected by the religion greatly, and the way of thinking, the children's way of thinking might be different from the religion's thinking. They can change their religion when they grow up.
