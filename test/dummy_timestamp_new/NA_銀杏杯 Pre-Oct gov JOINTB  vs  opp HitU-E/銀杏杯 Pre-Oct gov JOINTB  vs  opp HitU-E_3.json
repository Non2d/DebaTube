So, we strongly believe that the parental right should be prioritized for these children. So, why we can say so, I will explain it. "}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "So, in my speech, I would like to make three points. First, why these people believe in religion and belong to the community. First, for these people, believing in religion is so important in terms of their life. And secondly, how serious are these children after being taken from death. And thirdly, comparing the bottom side in terms of children in the future."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "So, before moving to my point, let me repeat what the government said. The government said that children can change their religion. But this is not true. Because firstly, the dogma is very different from other religions. So, they cannot easily change their religion. And also, these children live in this community when they were born. And they are taking the religious education. So, most of these children believe in this religion. So, concerning this fact, even if these children change their religion, they can't feel comfortable and more serious situation."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Second expectation, the government case is so unlikely. Because we strongly believe that if this situation is not related to the religious cases, of course, our parents allow the doctors to carry out the treatment. So, the situation that goes against religion is few, which these parents and other doctors conflict with each other's statement. So, the possibility of the government cases are so small."}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "So, please let me move to my first point. Why for these people believe in religion and belong to the community, believe in religion is so important in terms of their life? Because the religion is only after to give them mental stability. So, if these people strongly believe that if they obey the dogma, we can save their mental stability even after they die. So, however bad situation occurs to us, we can be saved after death. And that belief supports their life. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "But on the other hand, if they don't obey these dogmas, they feel they cannot be saved by these gods. So, that is very mental harm. Why? Because in the future, they will despair their future. For example, the people in poverty are suffering from this poverty because they have no food and no clothing. But other people who are suffering from the relationship, for example, they are isolated from other friends and are bruised by their classmates. But these people, they betray against the dogma, they feel that if they... forever we cannot be saved. So, no way to help them save. So, in the first case, they kill themselves. But so, we strongly believe this belief is so important."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "And how seriousness will occur is emotional. So, as my partner said, the community, these children will be isolated from this community because the community member ignores their children because they feel that children betray their dogmas. So, if these children go to the school, other children don't talk about with them. And also, the children can't go to the church because they are afraid of criticizing themselves. And also, they feel that living is so hard and so pity. And at last, they feel that it is okay that I die in that situation. So, for this reason, we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you for listening."}]}
