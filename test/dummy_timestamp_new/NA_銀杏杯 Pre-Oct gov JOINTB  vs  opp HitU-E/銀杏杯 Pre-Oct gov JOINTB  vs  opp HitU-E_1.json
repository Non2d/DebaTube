And the religion is very important for believers, and religion has changed their identity and their living community. And keep religious teaching and law is very important because they can devote to the good in the world. By keeping the religious good, they can live comfortably in society and mentality."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "We strongly believe that children are immature, so parents can make more better decision for children. Not only the aspect of medical care, but also living their children's life. "}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So I have two arguments. Firstly, in the status quo, such believers have a choice to be, to decide which medical care should be taken. And this is very good for them. And secondly, after taking this plan, they cannot decide to medical care, and they suffer from the fear of guilty. And they can make a living in the religious society."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Let's move, before moving on to my first argument. Refutation to the government side is included in my argument. So firstly, under the status quo, they can can decide what is good for children of believers. They can decide which medical care is best for the children, so this is very good for them, and good for children's life. Because parents love their children very much, so they can make parents very familiar with the religion. So they know how serious situation they are in."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "And parents also know how serious situation a child is in, whether it's an illness or injury. So they can decide which medical care is best. Which is more important for children's future. So parents can make a decision for children. And comparing those two, and of course, parents want to save children's lives, so they make an effort to touch another medical care, which is not relevant for their just rule. So only a few cases, few medical care is not good. They cannot, so it is okay to deny medical treatment to their children, or they're just wrong."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "So let's move on to my second argument. After taking this prompt, parents cannot decide their children's medical care. So it's very harmful for their children and their family, because broke religious rule is very serious program for them because they devote to the good for a long time to keep the religious rule, so they feel the guiltiness, and they feel they will be betrayed. So they feel very guilty, and it is very miserable life for them."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "And their community is very important for them, and their relationship is very, very strong. So as a community member, that family broke the religious rule, and that family is very bad for us. And they betray them, and they come to ignore them, or they don't make them to go to church and so on."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "So their family living, if children live to buy medical care, however, they will be living a very, very hard life. So it's a very serious program, so we strongly oppose this motion."}]}
