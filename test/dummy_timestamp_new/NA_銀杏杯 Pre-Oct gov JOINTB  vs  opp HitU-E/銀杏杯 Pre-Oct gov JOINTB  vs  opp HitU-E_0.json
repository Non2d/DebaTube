One is that, sorry, I have one today. It is about the choice for the children. And, before we move on to my point, let me define this notion. So, the young children means that there are very little treatment, for example, that all kinds of the elementary school or kindergarten students have to offer to the young. So, and this medical treatment is a very suspected medical treatment. If we deny this treatment, maybe children will die."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "So, let me move on to my point. It is about children's choice. So, fundamentally, we have the right to choose our life. So, the decision of where to live, where to belong, and so on. So, these kinds of issues about our life, we have the right to decide them. However, actually, these young children are so immature. They cannot understand how significant that issue is. So, instead of that, parents can choose their children.

Because, even though at that point, children are immature and cannot understand how significant each choice is, but after they grow up and understand the importance of each choice, they should have the right to live to these kinds of choices. Because, the life of the children is of the children themselves. So, the parents can, instead of choice by the parents, should be only temporary and reversible."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "However, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, it is a very suspected problem. Because, if we deny the birth of children, maybe children will die. So, even that, on children, the chance to be chosen will forever be lost. Even that, so children cannot be chosen in the future. So, it means we are depriving the very fundamental and important life, which is relevant to our life, from the children. So, it is very problematic."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "So, in the first place, why we should have the right to choose for our life? Because, the most effective actor who understands our own love is needless to say, we are all. So that, I can understand my favorite, but I cannot understand your favorite, like this. So, we cannot understand completely each other. So, in order to be happy, in order to choose most enjoyable choice, we should by ourselves.

However, ladies and gentlemen, please remind this point."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "So, this immature children will act in the future and be a very strong existence, very intellectual existence.

However, in the future, when they understand what religion is, how severe, how important, how good, how vicious that religion is.
