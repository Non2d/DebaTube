This motion says that the female character in hero programs as a leader, and as a leader, women can be portrayed as also unsuccessful people. And in this reality where men tend to be leaders. This motion won't necessarily make women successful leaders, which are actually morally correct."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "And so we're moving on to the second point. I think we can all agree that when children watch hero programs, they are inspired by the characters' actions, and therefore they will start acting like them. And for example, for girls, there are hero programs for girls like PQR, and for boys, there are hero programs such as Coming Data. And if girls start being the main leader in programs like Coming Data, even the boys mostly watch. There is a possibility that boys will feel reluctant to act like leaders, and that is the complete opposite of what we are actually trying to do. But this motion may not be able to inspire boys to become leaders."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "And moving on to the third point. We think that, in a way, the government supporting hero programs can be seen as supporting violence. If you look at classic hero programs like Marvel movies. It is pretty clear that the characters are using violence in order to solve their problems. However, removing an insane amount of these programs is not realistic because they are some of the biggest industries in the world. This is why instead of including female characters in hero programs, we should keep supporting feminism like we have in the past."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "Now I'd like to move on to my rebuttals. The government side said that in hero movies, women tend to fall in love. And this is not telling girls to be independent. And yeah, but just because girls become. Just because women fall in love with a hot guy, for example, that doesn't mean that they won't be willing to become leaders. "}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "And the government also said that women are this. But that doesn't necessarily mean this motion doesn't necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable. Not including female characters in hero programs can be seen as a message that women are incapable of resolving conflict. But that doesn't necessarily mean this motion doesn't necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable of being independent and resolving conflict."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "In summary, women can be seen as having roles for unsuccessful characters because of the norm that we have right now. This motion can lead to women being portrayed as unsuccessful characters and that children might receive the wrong message, such as they might feel reluctant to become leaders, which is the opposite of the message we're trying to send out. And supporting current hero programs is not something the government should do because, in a way, it's supporting violence. Thank you."}]}
