So their stance went like this. They said, so the pressure to conform to gender identity image is so unjustifiable, and they said they have a moral obligation to try to solve those unjustifiable situations. "}, {"start": 601.0, "end": 602.0, "text": "So the prime minister told you that even if their plan is not going to work, they have an obligation to try. So they try to, so they ignore the inefficiency of the plan by using the word moral obligation, but they must not run away with such a light burden because when the government restrict something, restrict freedom of speech, it is when those restrictions or something or rule is 100% effective. For example, there is a right of reply on media, right? When media discriminated against the minority, the minority has the right to, like, say no on the same media, and that is effective, 100% effective, because it causes discourse."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "But in this case, the government failed to prove that their plan is 100% effective. So their plan is so nonsense. Like, it's like putting a straw in the river to change the flow of the water, right? And that straw can trap fishes inside the river. So it has risk. So what they have to prove is those straw is strong enough, 100%, to change the river. So we told you how this motion has a risk to harm children's being or harm the situation of gender inequality."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "So having solved principal classes, we're moving on to the practical things, which is two questions. So firstly, whether the status quo is good enough or not. So secondly, whether including one figure in a movie will make the status quo more better. As for the first questions, our speaker effectively told you how role models already exist in the real world. So, but we have been saying this from a member of the opposition, but the other side didn't engage in our claim that there exist role models in the real world."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "The other side just concentrated on the woman speaker in, like, hero programs. But this is nonsense because this debate is actually is about how women representation in the real world is going to change. So it's nonsense to just concentrate on the role inside a program and don't see the real effect on the real world. So we can clearly say that the status quo is good enough because the role models that the government has been defending already exist in the real world."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "So moving on to the second practical question, so does taking this motion make the status quo better or not? You say no. So there are two patterns of female leaders in hero programs, right? So LO tells you the cases in which women are being assigned unsuccessful roles. So there is, so this is likely, as we proved, because the people are seeking for male leaders.

But again, this is nonsense because does a straw in a river will change the flow of the water in the long run? Absolutely not. They are saying that there exist many female sexualized characters in the movie, and they're introducing only one woman. And we don't think this would change the situation. Therefore, we are proud to propose."}]}
