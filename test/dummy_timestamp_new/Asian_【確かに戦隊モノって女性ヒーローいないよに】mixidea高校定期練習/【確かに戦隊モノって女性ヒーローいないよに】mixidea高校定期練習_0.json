We think that there's a current notion in which female characters are thought to be incapable, that they have to follow romantic pursuits with the hot, sexy main character. We think that these kind of notions are unhealthy for the people in the audience that are watching it, and especially the children. I'm very happy to propose. I'm going to be setting up the motion before I begin. On our side, we don't think that all female characters should always be the leader. What we support as proposition is a healthy mixture of decent female leaders as also male leaders. We think that we want to pursue and promote the idea of females being capable of being a leader as much as males, and we think that this is a brilliant idea in reducing discrimination."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "Secondly, is that we think this is going to be an effective motion in dealing with gender injustices. Given that we cannot prove, even if we cannot prove, that there's going to be certain changes in real life, we think that our side, this debate should be measured on equity, that is the principle of whether we should pursue relative equality in the terms of including female characters. "}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Given this, I'm going to give you two arguments. First, why this is a necessary motion for the state to take. Secondly, and on our side, why this is going to be the most effective motion in dealing with gender injustices. Let's talk about why this is a necessary motion."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Two things. First, is that we think that the concept of leaders is not something that is dependent on gender. Just like in real life, how there are many female leaders as well as male leaders, we think that even in Marvel or any kind of film industry, we think that female characters are also capable of being leaders. We think there needs to be a strong image, especially in the media, where everyone is directly influenced by every single day, that there needs to be a strong message that women are also capable. That the fact that they are being leaders and being in control of certain groups does not necessarily mean that we think that if they are being able to be a strong leader in a field, we think that is able to promote a bigger message in real life in promoting gender justice. And I'll be talking about this later."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "But secondly, we think this is just for the state to take because we think that these kind of medias are going to be like the manifestation of a state's standards. So what I mean by this is that we think that when media influence is very strong, we think that there's a strong and moral obligation for the state to ensure moral equality. And we think this is seen in the cases of a lot of movies where there are certain like female heroes such as Wonder Woman or any those kind of instances. And we think that the state should actively promote any kind of gender equality. And we think this side is just in including female characters by the simple fact that there are female characters that are excluded from being leaders just on the basis of their gender. Given this, we think this is a necessary motion given the benefits. There's going to be female actors. And we think this is my second argument. I'll be talking about this."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "<POI> What do you think about the difference between the hero program given in man or the pretty cute hero program? What is the difference?"}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "I'll talk about that later when I give my characterization. So I recommend you wait for a couple of minutes."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "So second argument, why this is the most effective motion dealing with gender injustices. What we think, before I begin my substantive, I'm going to be explaining and contextualizing what female characters are currently like."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "Three things. First is that we think that females are almost never a central character. That is, the women do not currently have basically any kind of female role model to look forward to. We think that, sure, there might be some central characters. But the problem is that we think we need more female characters in the pursuit of leadership. Because we think that these few examples are likely to be sexualized just because of the fact that producers have to choose always the most sexiest and hottest woman. And we think that tends to get sexualized. We don't think that the sexualization of women leaders is necessarily a good thing. We think that on our side, when we include more female actors and make sure there are more central characters, we think that you don't really need to rely on this facial benefit. And rather, you could rather pursue the true message of the movie. That is, to pursue females as a leader."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "But secondly, so we think there's a lot of maternal and romantic links. That is that in movies like The Independence Day, there's a lot of women who end up falling in love with the main character, the very hot white guy, right? And we think that this promotes the message of women being told to be independent. We don't think that's necessarily a good thing. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "But C is that female characters currently have to be rescued. This is seen in a lot of princess movies where women are taught and promoting the message that they have to currently be dependent on the main buff hero. And we think this emphasizes the masculinity of males. And we think this isn't necessarily a good thing."}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "So how does this change under our world? Two things. First, is that these leaders are going to become a central figure, right? We think that's going to mean you're going to have closer proximity to males and females. And we think that female leaders are capable as similar to male leaders. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "But B is that these female characters as a leader are going to have more power. We think this is going to promote the message that women are also capable of resolving conflicts, that they are also capable of negotiating certain conflicts to negotiate this in a peaceful manner. "}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "Now, to answer the POI of opposition, that is the difference between male leaders and female leaders, we say there is no difference. That is, the females are also as enough capable as the males. And we think this is a necessary policy because currently there's a status quo which stigmatizes against female characters as leaders. This is because of the unconceived notion that like just the patriarchal society deems females as more incapable than males. And we think this isn't untrue, right? We think that female characters are also capable. So we see that there's no difference at all, that they are both capable and we think we should remove that kind of stigmatization."}, {"start": 14.0, "end": 15.0, "text": "So what happens once we have these kind of powerful central figured characters is that children who are easily influenced by the media just by the fact that they don't have any kind of like preconceived ideas are going to now look at this and we think that female children are now going to have a more active and positive role model of a leader. So in the future, we think they're less likely to feel like females are unable to do anything. We think that rather they're going to have the feeling that they can be a leader, that they can strive to be a female CEO. So even in the real life, we think that the sense message of female leadership is going to be promoted and we think this is something we always ought to pursue. I'm very happy."}]}
