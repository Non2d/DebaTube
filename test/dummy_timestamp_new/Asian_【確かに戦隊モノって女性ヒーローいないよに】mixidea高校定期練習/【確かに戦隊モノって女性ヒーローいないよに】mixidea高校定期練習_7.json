First, I'm going to talk about its effectiveness for girls. If we take this motion, paper problems that include a female leader influence girls, showing them that women can be a leader in the future. Taking this motion, girls can have new dreams to become leaders, influencing their aspirations positively. "}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "However, the opposition side argued that it is effective for boys. By taking this motion, boys' dreams can also be influenced, crashing boys' dreams that not all TV programs have to change to include a female leader."}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "The opposition claims that the percentage of male first-place winners in competitions is larger than the female population in the country now. While it is true that more males can become leaders, taking this motion doesn't crush the dream of being a leader for boys in the future. For these reasons, the effect for girls is more substantial by taking this motion."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "Now, moving on to the second point: why is this effective for society? Because people's problems are the only TV programs that children want to watch. Children don't want to watch news or documentaries about social problems because they can't understand enough about these issues. Thus, a program with a female leader has the most significant influence to tell children that women can be leaders, promoting more males to be leaders in the future. This can reduce gender discrimination."}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "The opposition side raised concerns about potential violence in these programs, but violence is not an explanation that we brought up in our rebuttal. Instead, we argue that this can make males strong leaders in society to solve problems. We believe that taking this motion has a positive effect on society. Thank you."}]}
