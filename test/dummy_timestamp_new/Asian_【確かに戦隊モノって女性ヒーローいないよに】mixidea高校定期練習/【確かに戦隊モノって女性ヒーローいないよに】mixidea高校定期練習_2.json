For example, Kamen Rider is a hero program that boys also watch. But we already defined that we can make not only a female leader but also a male leader, right? So, we don't say that Kamen Rider's leader is female. But that program can continue with a male becoming a leader. "}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "And third, they talk about violence. So, violence shows how strong they are. Even if the woman becomes a leader, they can show strength to the people who are watching. And I'm gonna explain later, too. And also, even if they use violence, it means that males also use violence, right? So, they explain that males can use violence, but women can't use that, right? "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "So, I'm gonna talk about reconstruction. First, we think that, for example, Marvel or Kamen Rider has a female hero, right? For a supporting role. But why is it important to become a leader? By making a female a leader, it will be a model for everyone that females also can become a leader in society, right? Because now in the world, there are many leaders that are male or some male and fewer leaders that are female.

As the first speaker has said, they have a good effect on children because children always watch hero programs. And it will affect people. For example, Kamen Rider, children watch every Sunday morning, right? And children watch for the long term. So, we feel that it is general that females will become a leader, right? So, children can have less of an image of a gender gap. Even if they get older, they have no feeling of having a gender gap. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "And also, why this is good for society? If the female character becomes a leader in a hero program, it will be the movement that females become a leader in society, right? Because hero programs are watched not only by children but also by adults, right? Like Marvel or something like that is also popular among adults, right? So, this is a good effect for society. "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "And they have said about violence. So, I would like to explain more. So, most hero programs like Kamen Rider or some other hero programs have a person affected by evil, right? So, this person is mostly girls or people who have a weak situation, right? But this is not equal, right? So, by women becoming a leader and so strong, it will remove the image that girls are weak and males are strong, right? For these reasons, we would like to proudly support this motion. Thank you."}]}
