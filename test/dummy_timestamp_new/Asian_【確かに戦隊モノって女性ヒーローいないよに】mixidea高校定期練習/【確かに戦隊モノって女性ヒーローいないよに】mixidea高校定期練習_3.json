Hero Program can make children inspired and shape their identity and thoughts in childhood, right? So if we have an issue or problem that is given in, for example, gender discrimination or another problem, if we can make that, we believe both children's dreams will be crushed and we believe that as a result, those societies will be counterproductive for those females, right? So we're proud to oppose."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Today's debate, let me have two arguments. One, why will this motion make females counterproductive? Two, let me compare the paradigm between the government and opposition, right?"}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "So firstly, let me make a rebuttal of what the previous speaker was talking about. So the government's main case was solving the discrimination of those people by having a leader, right? But as my first speaker was talking about, my first speaker clearly talked about that these data schools are providing female characters, for example, Marvel. "}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Moreover, my first speaker talked about that those female romantic loves won't be solved by those leaders, by providing leaders, right? The reason was, I think that romantic things are not just because of not having leaders, but this is because of a general narrative, right? Even though if we take this situation, those romantic scenes won't be taken, right? Those romantic scenes will be remade, and we believe this motion is inappropriate, right? "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "Moreover, what they talked about was that they said that children won't change their images, and it will influence better to the society, but our side completely talked about that this certain image will make females counterproductive, and we believe this is unjustifiable, right?"}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So moving on to my argument, one, why will this motion make counterproductive for those females, right? So let me make a clear analysis of what is HERO. Two points. One, HERO makes a dream for every child, and it's a certain definition called inspiration for children. Two, it will make strong messages for every people, and for, no, it will make strong messages for the people in today's society, right? So the reason why it will make a dream for those children is that children see those HERO programs for a long time, right? In childhood, children see those HERO programs on the screen, and they have a dream that they want to be a HERO, right? So every people have an experience for having a dream that they want to be a HERO and seeing those HERO programs, right? "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "And second, it will make a strong message in today's society. But today's debate is like a thing we have to talk about, that there's like two messages, right? There's two messages. One, it's for like boys' messages, and two, there's a message for like those girls, right? So mainly, let's just talk about messages of like girls and boys. We believe like those kind of HERO programs are not just particularly for like boys and particularly for like those girls, right? Like we believe there's like a lot of HERO programs, such as Pretty Cura, right? If we see Pretty Cura, most of the time, like those kinds of girls are going to be the leader, right? What we want to say is that like if we see HERO programs, it's like mainly for action for like those boys, right? Boys mainly see HERO programs, and they'll be attracted, right? Pretty Cura is for like girls, so that's why leaders are given."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "So what we want to say is that as if we make female character as a leader in HERO programs, it will hinder like boys' dreams, right? It will hinder boys' like narrative, and we can make like those kind of female, we can crush like those kind of children's dream, right? So like those messages are really strong, and as we make female leaders, what will happen is that as my first speaker said, those kinds of females will be in like an unsuccessful situation, or they'll be like in a situation that they'll be criticized by like those society, right? So as a conclusion for my first argument, when like those kind of female leaders are included, they'll be in a bad circumstance."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "And moreover, like we believe that those particular differences between like those boys' HERO program and girls' HERO program, we believe we can't like include like certain gender and push certain gender, and as an extent, like those kind of gender problem is like made by adults, right?"}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "I'll talk about like more specifically in my second argument. My second argument, it's like comparative between the government side and opposition side. The government side is trying to solve gender discrimination, and they're trying to mitigate those kind of romantic scenes. But opposition side are respecting each character, and respecting the dreams of those children. "}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "So what we want to say is that those kind of leader making HERO program as a leader of female, it's just like a problem that is given by adults, right? It's an adult problem we have to talk about, and it's not like children to be like solving, right? So as we like give like those kind of problem from adults, as if we make that, it will just hinder the dreams of children, and hindering like those dreams of the boys as we hear like those HERO program. These are reasons why we're part of the vote."}]}
