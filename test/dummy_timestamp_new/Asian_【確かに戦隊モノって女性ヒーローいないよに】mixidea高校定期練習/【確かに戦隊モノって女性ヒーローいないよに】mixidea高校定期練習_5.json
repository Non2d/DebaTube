We don't think that these kind of studies are not being made because now in America or like in other places like Ghostbusters or like other things included these female characters in their ones. However, nothing is going to change; rather, it's going to harm these situations. We like talking our point, but we say these situations will never be solved but in their paradigm but it is going to cause more harm to these people. That's actually why we're going to say that it is very harmful for us."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "Okay, moving back. Okay, we like talk about several things, but before that, I'd like to rebut to their points. Well, firstly they say that like these kind of like gender gaps it's going to the gender gap of these children is going to decline. But firstly, alright, um I don't think that these kind of like gender gap is going to decline only by seeing these hero programs because we have like a lot of things and a lot of things that you can see. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "But even if we take their best-case scenario we think that when you try to become adult you gradually realize the male dominance and will and will still be brainwashed by the society right. Because even now even in America if you see like the female Ghostbusters because society is still being the kind of like male-dominant society nothing's going to change; rather, these children are going to be stigmatized again, stigmatized as \"oh women cannot move\" even in their cases."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Secondly, they say always like falling in love is like being independent or like rescue; it's being independent. It's something like romantic things are a social pressure but firstly, um we don't we don't think that these kinds of things it's like dependent or like independent well not always the red people is going to help the yellow or the pink person um the yellow and the pink person sometimes help like the blue person or the red person or like that kind of things too and we think that these things is very justifiable that these women are actually independent in the first place. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "But secondly, we say that this is not a social pressure too even that we say that some, for example, we have some kind of counterexample. For example, Wonder Woman. In these cases, a person is actually going to fall in love with a female leader or like other things too. So even we say, even we say that these kinds of things are a social pressure, we don't think that these things are going to change the society in their paradigm. We don't think that these things are very effective for it."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "Moreover, okay, and certainly, they always say that they have the ability, so why don't you include these kinds of female characters and hero programs? I know that maybe in some cases you have a decent like female people can actually have these kinds of powers. However, we don't think that because you have power, if you become a leader, nothing is like all things are going to change. But rather, we say these people are going to be exploited."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "What we want to say is that we don't want to make it down to the bottom in the slide. Don't think that only including females in the hero programs as leaders can change the whole society. Even Ghostbusters and other shows included female leaders, male leaders are still dominant. And since it's still a male-dominant society, even females try to develop in the studies, you're going to be exploited as Janna Daruku, who was made as a leader and tried her best but betrayed and cut off from the other males, just as Japanese scientist Obokata Haruko, male exploits the female dreams. And actually, we say that we don't want to think that we should like produce these kinds of male-like female fatalities in these studies. So we think that is very harmful."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "If you're going to make these kinds of social norms that females are good and can advance in society, we actually oppose these things because we say that the females are going to be exploited. We don't want to make it too, right? And it's not about these kinds of abilities; it is about your status of it. But if we can't change society and or like others, we sometimes need to do. We'll talk later, okay?"}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "All right, so I'd like to go to the comparison, firstly about the boy's dreams. They mostly didn't talk about it; well, they sometimes talk about it, but what we say on our side is that the boy streams are going to be deprived. Why is it so? Because we say that if you're going to show up some kind of female leaders or other things, some are going to think, \"Oh, my dream is going to be deprived.\" If you think that the females are going to be in there, the boys will be discouraged in their dreams to become a leader. We say that this is going to happen in their paradigm, and we say that because of this, the boys are going to be shrinking in the body."}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "However, what's going to happen to these females if you're going to have some, even if you don't have these kinds of female characters as a hero? You will still think that these kinds of females are still going to develop in the bodies if they really want to do. For example, if some people, if some kind of person, like, for example, the Avengers or other things, if you're going to say that these people are actually having some kind of member of the females, you still know these females have the power and have enough ability to be independent, to be or fight as one of the people is as a hero member or like that. We think that this is very good because we say that these individuals are going to be evaluated in these kinds of things.

Maybe it's so, but in the long term, we think that these things are going to change in the future. We don't think that we don't, and okay, what we want to say in our speech is that we don't want to exploit those women. But if we want to think in the long term, with these kinds of women can develop in the future, that's actually why we strongly oppose."}]}
