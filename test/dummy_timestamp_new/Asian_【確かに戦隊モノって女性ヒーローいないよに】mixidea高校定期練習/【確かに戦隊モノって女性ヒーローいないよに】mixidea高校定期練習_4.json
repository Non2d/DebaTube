So we are seeing that the women are so marginalized that, you know, the society pushes the message that women should be the more housewife, becoming the other women, not becoming the leadership, and so forth. "}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "But we believe that because the society requires women to become more such things, so used to be the make a boyfriend and romantic love, that this kind of social pressure is making a woman more so unfair, and it's not good. So we believe that this kind of disproportionate unhealthy situation is so harmful, so there is no justification on this paradigm. Therefore, we are going to propose our case here."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "So basically, I'm going to talk about three things. Firstly, engage with the opposition's cases. So what is the hero story, and the kinder or the boy's dream or not? Secondly, the principle level, whether it is justified, this social structure, the pushing the burden for the women and the girls. Thirdly, the practical change, how the effect is going on."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "So let's engage with the first cross point, whether or not what is the hero story, and the boy's dream is going to be right or not. So basically, opposition side is saying that, what is the hero, it's a boy's dream. So the question is that, whether we don't think that they are fitting the motions, or KCPM have said on this debate is. So basically, we are not going to prohibit those kinds of movies, like it's balanced. If you want to see the Kamen Rider, who the main character is leaders, then you can watch. And if you want to watch the program, the leader is women, then you can watch it. So this kind of choice is shared. "}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "So we believe that on our side, some people, some girls who want to watch the movies, cannot consume those ideas at all. So they feel happy and they cannot become good. So in that sense, we are saying that, still, even on our paradigm, those boys can have a dream, and they can enjoy and consume those kinds of content, so they can be happy. So it doesn't fit it. So we don't destroy the dream of those people, boys."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "Secondly, they are also saying that women should enjoy the \"Pri-kyua\" or romantic love. That is unrealistic. Basically, the first point is that, who decides, who can determine that women should, making a boyfriend or a husband, or supporting someone, partner, is very important things. So this kind of social pressure is unjustifiable because those girls cannot agree on, or consensus for this issue. So having this kind of pressure that woman must like to support a man, such mindset or stereotype itself is problematic. "}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "Therefore, we are going to increase the, yes, you know, program, which can, the women are taking a leadership, like man or masculinity. This kind of characteristic is required. Therefore, we are proposing."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "Thirdly, the pre-cure cases, they are saying that pre-cure, those girls can be happy, but that's also unrealistic. Simply because the pre-cure is only women's group. The member of the group is only women and girls. So in that sense that, they are regarded as only in the women's communities, that the leader is working. But if there were a man, maybe she is a supporter. Those kinds of things, is going to be regarded and perceived. "}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "In that sense, that's not helpful or useful for those girls who want to become a leader, are not encouraged or inspired at all. So therefore, that's not enough. Therefore, we are saying that our case is important. Basically, that's not basically, we are saying that it's not mutually exclusive. So if you want to support those people, yes, let's support it. Even on our paradigm, there are those characteristics opposition side is saying, it's supported. So that's not the important thing. So therefore, the opposition case is not making sense."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "Lastly, even if all my analysis was false, but still the social structure or mindset, or social recognition can be changed. So in the status quo, yes, what we have said might be true. The women are regarded as, yes, you know, backfire might be because, but that's just only short term. In the middle term and long term, the social recognition for the feminist movement or other kind of people, about these kinds of actions, in that sense, we do not assume that it's not harmful. So therefore, the logic doesn't stand."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "Okay, let's move on to the next first point. Whether or not it is justified in the principle level? Can our paradigm be justified or not? So we are saying that as a leader, those program is justified or not. We say that basically the opposition side thinks that the hero should be the leader as a man, but that's nonsense because simply, the biological relationship already can't be clarified. There's no connection. Just because you are a woman, you are incapable of taking a leadership. So there's no scientific proof or evidence on this matter. So we believe that this artificial and arbitrary structure is so problematic. "}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "So we believe that this kind of the norm or stigmatization makes the woman weaker and weaker, and those girls internalize the ideas, I cannot do anything, or I am incapable, I am useless. So I just support that someone. So this kind of thinking is so harmful. So regardless of the fact they have an ability, they can do that, but they cannot do that because society expects the woman to not do so that. So this is harmful. "}, {"start": 412.0, "end": 413.0, "text": "So as a result, what will happen is that those kind of the stigmatization, it's become less and those women still can become accept the realization more equally and fairly. So as a result, overall, what is more justifiable framework is our side. So that compared to the harm, our benefit is far more better. We are happy to propose."}]}
