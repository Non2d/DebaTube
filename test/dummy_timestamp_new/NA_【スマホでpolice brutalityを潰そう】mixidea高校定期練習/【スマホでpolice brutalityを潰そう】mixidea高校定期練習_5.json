Okay, but the government side has said that, like, education will change politics' mind. But we think that, we only point out that the government is in charge of education, right? And we characterize government as something that is biased, or, like, no incentive to educate. And their characterization was, like, government are happy to do education."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "But we think that our characterization won. Why? Because if the government is like what the opposition side characterized, those kind of, like, discrimination or brutal police, those kind of problems won't be happening in the first place. And we say that, in the first place, the whole point of this debate is, like, countering the government, right? So, we think that it is absurd to rely on government when we are countering government. We think this is obvious."}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "So, the other two ways are, like, through activism, and the third way is to, like, through helping people who are currently under threat, through, like, some people helping out people who are subject to police brutality, or, like, saving people who are participating in demos. As for activism, like, the opposition side seem to prove that the more better discourse will occur on the other side. Well, we already told you that the government is not a good source."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "But, and the opposition side response was like, on our side of the house, the discussion will be superficial. But we already pointed out that superficial discussion is not something that is bad because that can ultimately help people, and the whole point is to help people, so that, like, whether it's superficial or not doesn't matter. We characterized that what we need to, like, turn people into action is to, like, show people the whole image of things so that people will know the, to know the full extent how police brutality is bad, or, like, how police brutality is, how the problem of police brutality is important.

We think that it is absurd to think that we can solve this problem in just, like, one year or something.
