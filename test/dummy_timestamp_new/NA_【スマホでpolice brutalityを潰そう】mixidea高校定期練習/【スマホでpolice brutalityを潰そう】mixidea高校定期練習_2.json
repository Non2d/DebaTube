First of all, about informed consent. And if we take this motion, we can do that. And second, people who participate in demonstrations can prepare for demonstrations because they can realize what the police can do or not.

Like these people have a strong will to participate and don't care about their lives or their bodies to show their wills. But this is not true because they have rights to be safe because they are all humans and have rights to be safe. So, if we take this motion, we can protect those people. So, the opposition side must protect the police. But our side can protect those people. And this is our majority. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "And moving on to the rebuttal. So, they said about two arguments and one alternative. So, about the arguments. So, they said that if we take this motion, we have harm for the police. However, in this debate, police who do brutality can find by using SNS and upload it.

So, we have, people can get financial reward if they upload video of police brutality. So, it will make the increase the number of video. So, at the opposition side, they also have videos about the police brutality. But our side is have more number of video. So, their side, the number of video is, they have few videos. So, there's an edited video in a worse way on purpose. So, if we take this motion, these videos will increase because many videos will be uploaded. "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "So, in the status quo, we have few videos. So, if they have the edited video and can make misunderstanding, it is not reliable. But if these would be uploaded on SNS, it will be the truth on those people. So, for example, a crew person received police questioning from a Japanese police last month or this month, maybe. But the person who took the video edited and just uploaded only the scene that the police hold the crew. But the police just did a questioning and there were no racial discrimination. "}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "So, after plan, many people will upload some videos or upload many videos. So, some videos are the edited video. But others are the whole scene of the action. So, the number of the police who do brutality will decrease because we have public eyes more than opposition. So, maybe we have to consider about the video violence. "}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "And if the children watch, it might have a bad effect on them. But this is not true because it is a social issue. And if we take this motion, we can make the environment that children can think about the post-brutality or discrimination more than opposition side. So, we would like to propose. Thank you.\n"}]}
