The government says that if we take this motion, we can protect people who participate in the demo. But this is not true. Rebutting isn't, can't protect people. Because this is only giving money to people, and the government doesn't have any radical solution, does not provide any radical situation. So this is not, this can't protect people. Because the police are prejudiced, and the people's thinking that they can't change, don't change.

If we take this motion, the revolt will become more big. Because there are three reasons. First, big impact more effect government.

And third, media is so unstable, and this may cause populism to the world."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "First, I'm going to explain the big impact more effect government. The government side, he said that the government rewards all people posted about brutally police on SNS. But there is a question, how does the government manage a large amount of posts? So this is so hard and difficult. But this is exactly. Effective posts will be watched more by the government than small effect posts. And the government doesn't always reward. Like regularly demonstration or little accident. So rewarding all posts are difficult and are so hard. And the government doesn't have so much money.
