For example, like black people being oppressed by police officers in the United States. This is a current situation."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "So as our stance at the government side, we believe that the problem here, in order to solve these kind of problems in the current situation, the vast majority of people, like the vast majority of people, like who just don't under actually exactly understand what's happening in the current situation. These people who just are so ignorant that they don't even know what's going on. The key problem to actually solving these kind of issues is to actually letting these people know about what's happening in the current situation, actually providing them the correct image."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "And we believe that actually taking this by taking this motion, we can intensive and incentivize people to actually take part in these kind of actions and will therefore actually spread a correct image and actually make more people understand what's happening in the current situation."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Before I move on to my two points today, today, I would like to start with a definition and model. So today, as the government side, our definition is that we define political brutality. For example, using, we like to use several examples that are happening in the current situation. So in the United States, black people are getting killed or, for example, in even in Japan, Kurdish people are being attacked in Shibuya. And we believe that these kind of situations are what is called police brutality in the current situation. "}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "And secondly, my model, our model is that we'll actually give the people who post videos on these kind of popular sites, for example, TikTok or YouTube, for example, I don't know, a thousand yen to five dozen and just like not a sufficient amount, but just like a little amount that you can buy like your dinner or something like that."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "So moving on to my two points, my first point is that increased media people can be exposed to. So actually, so I would like to explain first, how will actually, how will these medias like, or these, the amount of these videos increase in the current situation. So I'd like to compare it with the status quo. So in the status quo, when people are basically walking on the street and encounter these kinds of social issues, what will happen is because like, first of all, like the, either don't have interest, like they don't want to be related to these kinds of issues because it's so sensitive. They will actually try to avoid these kinds of situations and not really interact actively interact with this kind of situation. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "But because after we take this motion, people can actually gain money. They can actually save, save their savings for like one meal, like they'll actually be incentivized to actually, actually take part. All you have to do is just basically take a video of this whole situation uploaded on the internet. It's so easy. It's, there's no reason actually to avoid this. And we believe that actually many kinds of people will actually take action to, in order to just take videos and upload it on the internet."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "And the uniqueness here is that because these kinds of popular sites are so popular, trill millions and billions of users around the world are using this. Once someone or like several people upload a single video, several people will access to it. Several and thousands of people ask it. And actually what, and actually the videos or the news that these kinds of situations happen will spread tremendously among these people. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "And actually I would like next, I would like to explain why it's increasing the amount of these kinds of videos important. So I have two announcements here. First A, that the chances that people can actually see or witness these problems will increase. So the current, the problem in the current situation is that even if these kind of police brutality cases are happening, like only a few people upload these videos. So like not many people can actually have the chance to access to these cases in the current situation. But actually, just as I explained, if we take this motion, the chances that people, because there's so many people uploading videos, the chances, definitely the chances that people can actually have one look of these videos will tremendously increase. And therefore the chances that people can actually witness this problem will increase. "}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "And secondly, we can actually provide many aspects of this problem, not only from one perspective, like only one person standing from one angle, not those kinds of situations, but actually tens of thousands of people can actually take these videos and actually understand the whole image of the current situation."}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "And the importance here is leading on to my second point. My second point is spreading the correct image. Before I move on, yeah"}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "<POI> Are you going to financially reward every single people that posted video?"}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "That's what has been said."}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "So next, moving on to my second point, spreading the correct image. Okay. So what does the status quo look like here? Like because there's several reasons why we cannot portray this correct image of these kinds of social actions. For example, the news does not have enough screen time to actually focus on one, one problem. Like, because they only have like, I don't know, 30 seconds to portray a picture. Like they have to cut off many other kinds of parts and only show, for example, the parts that the, that the black person was shot by the white person, but by the white, um, by the white police officer. And like, because of this, people don't actually understand what is, what has happened in the background. They don't even know who actually started the fight, who actually, like what kind of, what kind of, um, conflict happened in the past. So people basically cannot understand the background."}, {"start": 14.0, "end": 15.0, "text": "And secondly, because for example, only one video or only one image like has been posted on the internet. They don't even know what it's actually the whole image, the whole, um, the whole image of the situation. They cannot understand. They cannot perceive what has actually happened."}, {"start": 15.0, "end": 16.0, "text": "But after we take this motion, because we can increase in number, just that I explained previously, what will happen is that people, people in general can actually understand what is happening because not only the scene they're getting shot, but also like, like from the whole start, like who started the fight or like who actually started the punch, who like those kinds of like, like those kinds of cases can actually, people can actually perceive and people can actually understand by looking at those cases."}, {"start": 16.0, "end": 17.0, "text": "And obviously the most cases of police brutality in the United States, like are usually the police, the white police officers, like starting, start to like, um, starting to like, uh, argue with these kinds of black people. And in most cases, actually the white people are the, are the people who have started this whole cases. And they're the actually, they're the actually ones who are bad. But if we only portray the scene that someone has been, um, someone has been, um, punched by someone, like people can not actually know what's happening and the impact here is that basically what is crucial in solving these kinds"}]}
