The government case was that they should try to take this motion in order to protect mass citizens from terrorism. Citizens mentioned that terrorism demands money for kidnapping. So, for example, they kidnapped a journalist and they demand money from the nation. And they get much money by kidnapping. And if you pay, we call it terrorism, it should be justified.
