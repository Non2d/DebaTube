So, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to be here and speak. "}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "I have three points today when it's there. One, the governmental role is a safe citizen, but safe citizen doesn't mean who will be paid and what is good. The second is that this plan, so the payment paid for the terrorists, it means the opposition side of them. Opposition side is totally against our governmental role. Without it there, this plan certainly contributes to our governmental role. "}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "So, let me explain it one by one. So, before that, I have to define this motion. This House means that the all government. As the government told us, we criminalize the payment for ransom to the terrorists. So, terrorists, please imagine about the islamic state and so on. "}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "So, let me move on to my point. First is our governmental role. We, I think that maybe in this debate that safe citizen is the consensus of the state base, but safe citizen, what does it mean? It's completely different in these two sides. So, maybe they said that safe citizen means that safe office, but this is individual. Our means of safe citizen is the safe mass citizen. It's not individual, but societal level."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "So, we government put priority on the mass citizen, not the individual citizen, because the governmental kind of role is making the happiness life of the whole nation. In order to achieve this goal, we have to set up the easy and peaceful society. So, if the system of society will collapse, we'll never get the happy life. So, in order to set up the healthy society, what we need is the citizen. So, mass citizen, not individual. In this point, we put the priority on the non-individuals, but the mass. And so, the society system means that, so only we go shopping in the town or exciting music labs. So, go peacefully and go overseas like that. We can enjoy ordinary daily life. I think that's the ultimate happiness in this world."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "However, the second point is that the payment for the long-term is certainly against this goal. Why? So, A, is that, pay for terrorism group is that, it is a tax to the government to put on this kind of list. Because once we pay to the terrorists, they'll recognize 'yes, we can keep sleeping from this government, we can get the money.'"}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Why? Why terrorism group do kidnapping or get hostage means that they want money. So, ISIS and so on, it's a very isolated organization. So, they are very struggling to deal with that money. So, in order to get money, they kill a kid, kidnapping, get hostage and again and again, and get money from them. So, if they recommend that our government, from our government, they can derive the money, so they do again and again, so that this kind of list of being hostage will be certainly equal."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "The second, so B, is that, to get money is that, it means that to cooperate to the terrorism is certainly best. Because, so this kind of terrorism is that, certainly outside social group, so that it try to destroy our peaceful or healthy society. Because, also, also, also, and give them use that, so give them the money to buy weapons or payment for the, payment for the terrorism and so on, so that it certainly be a power to the IS. So, in two points, payment for the terrorism, it is certainly against our governmental law to save health and society."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "However, third point. So, this plan can be solve this problem"}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "<POI> So do you mean that you want to make those victims of ransom? So you neglect those victims of kidnapping rather than potential hostages? "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "So, one is that, so, so after our friends do that, that this kind of list of hostage should be certainly decreasing. "}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "The second is that, we, we actually clearly know the payment, but other kinds of ways, for example, so a few years ago, so when our Japanese, Japanese hostage by, hostage by the ISIS, we are co-operated by the Turkey government or closed, closed citizens and we try to save them. And it's like this kind of the way we ordered it. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "And the third point is, even if actually we cannot, we cannot actually succeed in this kind of, succeed, but, even though, but, rather we prefer, prefer order in the mass citizens rather than individuals."}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "So, third point is that, after taking this proposal, A, the, the list of the target hostage is certainly decrease. Because as I said, so the intention of the kidnapping or hostage is the money. If they recognize that, even though we do kidnapping or hostage, we cannot get that money, can stop them such kind of an inefficient way. Because they cannot get money. And succesfully we can decrease the future number of victims of the hostage. "}, {"start": 14.0, "end": 15.0, "text": "The second B is that, to equalize the ISIS, their money, so that, it's definitely equalize their money to buy weapons or salary for the army, so it's the same, so ISIS can get weaker and weaker. We can, we can destroy the society's threatened power itself."}]}
