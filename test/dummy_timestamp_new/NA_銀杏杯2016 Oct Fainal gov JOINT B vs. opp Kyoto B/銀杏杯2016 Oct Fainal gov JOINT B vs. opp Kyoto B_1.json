But ladies and gentlemen, that is a strange story and an indirect story. Why? Because we can prevent a mass attack for citizens by terrorism by a more direct plan. For example, airbombing or government restriction directly to the terrorism. For example, actually, we're doing some scheme to the terrorists in ISIS by, for example, airbombing and actually killing readers of ISIS. Actually, they're weakened by airbombing. So actually, we do work by a direct, more direct plan. It cannot be the reason to criminalize payment for ransom to achieve a government-side goal."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "We think that the opposition I said was that we should save those who kidnapped by paying ransom to terrorism.

So, under the status quo, why terrorism groups are kidnapping people, or we can see that they're generally kidnapped by ISIS or children, innocent children are kidnapped by terrorism. So, after that, in order to save them, the other people, or parents, or partners, or sometimes the states state themselves that pay ransom to terrorists. And that is the only way to save the children, or those who are kidnapped. Of course, for example, we can find a case, a Japanese case, a Japanese journalist kidnapped by ISIS. When the Japanese government denied paying ransom, they are killed, actually. "}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, but if they pay ransom, certainly, actually, they can save those who are kidnapped. For example, in the Spanish government, or the European government, or the same journalist, by paying ransom to ISIS, actually, we have the case. Actually, it's reasonable to say that the kidnappers, if we pay ransom to them, those who are kidnapped are released, and actually, we can save them. No, thank you. No, thank you."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "After taking this plan, what will happen? Even though those who pay ransom have no responsibility for the children, for the partners to be kidnapped, but they are criminalized to pay ransom. And after that, what happens? Of course, they cannot pay ransom, or sometimes terrorism kills the people. And of course, the terrorism is no use demanding ransom to the people, ransom to the victims. But they need money, so actually, that's why they do ransom. "}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "So what will happen? So they start human trafficking, they start organ trading. By doing that, by any means, they want money. So they do inhumane things more overall. "}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "So actually, what will happen? Even though we can save them by paying ransom, they won't be saved. They will die, killed by terrorism. The important thing in this argument is that paying ransom is a certain way to save those who are kidnapped, I mean the innocent people. And that's the importance in this first argument. So one of the priorities is not only the mass, but individuals. "}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, of course, we need to protect mass citizens from bombing. But I mean, I say that in order to save mass citizens from a terrorism attack, we have a more effective plan, for example, air bombing, a more direct plan to do that. So really criminalizing the paying ransom is too far from their purpose. That is why we shouldn't criminalize paying ransom."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "Let's move on to the second point, which is freedom of choice. Where freedom of choice is important. Let's look at two things. "}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "The first is whether it's a rational choice or not. The second is harm to others. First, the rational choice. In the case of children kidnapped by terrorism, for the parents, children is a really important existence. So even if they pay ransom to terrorism, as the parents, they want to save their children, because the parents have the duty to protect their children. So that is the rational choice, to pay ransom to terrorism."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "And second, in the case of the government, if the government pays ransom to release those who were kidnapped by paying ransom, is it also we can say that it's a rational choice? Because as the government, it's the duty to protect citizens, and save the citizens from a serious situation. So we can say, also in this case, we can say that it is a rational choice. "}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "And let's move on to the second point, which is harm to others. Of course, firstly, we don't know how to use them. We don't know, of course, it is uncertain that the terrorism, how the terrorism use their money to get from their ransom. "}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "Moreover, they commit crime, they commit human crimes, as I say, kidnapping, because they need money, because of lack of money. Or if they have enough money, they don't do that. It's a risk, it's high risk to be arrested. It's high risk to be, it's organization. So we can say, we can assume that because they don't have much money, because they need money, they start good human crimes. After, if we paying ransom, enough ransom to those terrorism groups, totally, when we say totally, because the kidnappers, I mean terrorism, lose the motivation to have a risk. So totally, we can say these cases, inhuman cases will decrease. And that is why we put this point."}]}
