And their policy is to criminalize paying ransom to terrorist group."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Okay, if you want to save a potentially killed mass citizens, then why not kill the terrorist groups themselves? I mean, destroy the organization itself. If we can't directly air bomb or directly attack, or have an economic restriction, then we can comparatively decrease the power of terrorist groups. "}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Then if those kinds of power would be decreased, then those terrorist groups could not kill those potentially killed mass citizens, then their goal is achieved. We believe that their policy is not in this goal. That's what I believe."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "So, before going to the argument, let me rebuttal first. Before we go to the rebuttals, I would like to analyze actors in this debate."}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "There are two main actors we have to protect. First, it's the individual citizens who are being kidnapped. And second, those potentially killed mass citizens. Okay, let's go from the first actor. In their paradigm, in the United States, if the individual citizens were kidnapped by the terrorist group, they have only one way to save those citizens, that is, to ransom them. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "And they told us that if we can actually cooperate with the government, they can achieve this. First of all, there is no case that we can achieve this. They said that we can actually cooperate, but in fact, those hostages were killed. So we believe that kind of government cooperation is unmeaning."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "Why is that meaningless? This is our second reason why we have rebuttals. Why is that impossible? Because the terrorist groups need money. If they need money, and then they have to exclude the government from the hostages, they will desperately kill those potential hostages from the government, and they have those incentives to have it, because they need money. "}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "So that's why we believe that even if the government cooperates, it's impossible to save citizens just by other means than ransom. So we believe that ransom is the only way to save those kidnapped citizens. Then, if we can criminalize those citizens, then those citizens will surely be killed. So we believe that those individual citizens are important. "}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "Why are those individual citizens important? Because they are inherent, and they will surely be killed if we don't pay ransom."}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "Because the second factor is talking about the potentially killed mass citizens, we cannot understand the potentially killed mass citizens. And in fact, there are a lot of victims. We believe that this is not inherent. But in fact, those individual kidnapped citizens are inherent. Those people will surely be killed. That's why we believe that it's important."}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "So, after taking this plan, we believe that after taking their policy, what will happen? They say that the case of kidnapping will decrease, but we think that is not true. Why is that? Because kidnapping is a rather easier way to save those money. If we kidnap those people, then we can use those people from using or selling those people themselves or use the foreign currency. And there are other ways of taking money other than ransom. "}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "So that's why we believe that even though we criminalize the ransom, those citizens will still be kidnapped. So that's why we believe that even if we take this motion, those individual kidnapped citizens will not be rescued. "}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "So, if we do not have any other way, then there is a way of ransom. And if we can pay ransom, we can actually help those citizens. That's why we believe to help individual citizens, we should not take this motion."}, {"start": 313.0, "end": 314.0, "text": "Let's talk about the second factor, the potentially killed mass citizens. Their logic was that if terrorists can gain money, they will buy weapons, and then they will kill mass citizens. Okay, there are two logics. And I would like to go through those two. "}, {"start": 314.0, "end": 315.0, "text": "First logic was that if they gain money, they will buy weapons. Okay, the terrorist group who purposed it is that they have to kill people. So even though the terrorist group do not have money, they have to have an air bombing, they have to kill. So they have to have their attack on the expense of the group member itself. "}, {"start": 315.0, "end": 316.0, "text": "So if they gain money, what will they do is that they will actually use the money for themselves. For example, under the current situation, people in ISIS are poor. So what they do is that they do a raid or they rob something because they don't have money. But if they get money, then they can use this money for a living. And those inhumane crimes will actually decrease. In that case, those victims of that crime will actually decrease. Even those kind of zero-life manufacturers will be safe in that potential."}, {"start": 316.0, "end": 317.0, "text": "Second, we believe that in the first place, if we stop ransom, those terrorists will not stop killing people. Why is that? Because their purpose is money and they have other ways to gain money by attacking people. So they will not stop that. But if we cannot destroy the terrorist group itself, those people will not be safe at all. So we believe that potentially killed massivists will be killed on their part in the first place."}, {"start": 317.0, "end": 318.0, "text": "Okay, what happens after taking this plan? Because their action is that we destroy the terrorist group itself, and destroy the group themselves, we believe that if we directly attack and decrease the power of terrorist groups, then we don't have enough power to attack the people as a backlash. So we believe that those kind of potentially killed massive citizens will decrease in our part rather than their part. So that's why we believe that the criminalization of the ransom terrorist group is not relevant to the disposal of the terrorist group."}, {"start": 318.0, "end": 319.0, "text": "So how about our argument itself? Because we believe that in the first, individuals in the territory can protect them by paying ransom, and this is clear because if you pay ransom, they will lose individuals, and we go back to our case."}, {"start": 319.0, "end": 320.0, "text": "Well, I've finished the analysis of two actors, so I would like to compare the two reports. Okay, so as I told you, individual kidnapped citizens are inherent, and if we don't pay ransom, they will be killed."}, {"start": 320.0, "end": 321.0, "text": "On the other hand, potentially killed mass, we cannot expect how many people will be killed in the first place, and furthermore, we cannot even understand whether those citizens would be killed. So, I think, we don't think that amount is important. "}, {"start": 321.0, "end": 322.0, "text": "We believe that if someone would be surely killed, and we think that not the potentially killed citizens, but rather the inherent individual kidnapped citizens, saving those people is more important than potentially killed citizens. That's why I believe that we have to save the individual citizens inherently, and we don't think that all of those will. If we pay ransom, we can surely save those people. We are happy to propose."}]}
