So in order to achieve this goal, we must take this motion. Only opposition side paradigm will not erase the kidnapping itself.

But it's not certainly because, for example, I guess IS people's kidnapping, when the kidnapping occurred, the movie was thought that even if we pay the money, the terrorists will not surely release the hostage because they are malicious people and do not always save the hostage."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Secondly, he said that terrorist group will try to earn money with other ways like organ transplants and so on. But who will sell the organ? Even if someone sells the organ, the difference is that the money terrorists can earn at one time. We think the target of terrorist kidnap is mainly journalists and they demand money to nations because nations have much money and terrorists can get much money from the nation the most. So the kidnapping and demanding the money to nations is a very unique way for terrorists to earn money easily. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "So let me move on to my arguments.

For example, a bank robbery is very risky for terrorists because a bank is very high security and one person is not so secure. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "But after taking this motion, kidnapping will disappear or at least will certainly decrease because nations will never give terrorists money and terrorists know even if we kidnap, we can't get money. Also, journalists who will go to those areas of terrorism, they will care more about their security. For example, they will hire bodyguards and they will be more careful. So the risk will be lower."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "Second problem, payment will kill more people. Money given to terrorists will be used to achieve the terrorist's goal by violent way. For example, as my partner told you, much money will allow terrorists to buy weapons, many latest strong weapons. So terrorists will kill drastically lots of people rather than just the kidnapping of one person. For example, sometimes quite a plane attacked the big building and one thousand or one million people died. "}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "So if the terrorist group got the money, they will surely use this money to the crime because they are malicious people and they are willing to use violent way or crime to achieve their goal. So payment surely kills people. So paying money to terrorism means cooperating terrorism. Government cannot cooperate terrorism means crimes and killing people."}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "They said that government needs a direct way to save people. But we see indirect murder is also murder. Government must not indirectly kill people. "}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "Also, he did not explain about the complete way to save mass people. So please give me the complete way to save mass people. "}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "How we can justify? For example, in case of disaster, many people are injured. We, or doctors, prioritize people who have higher possibility to be saved or higher possibility to be cured. They prioritize more people because they cannot save all people. They must prioritize more people because the more people will be saved, the more people will be happy. So it is the same to this notion.

But if the number, let's compare the number of people's life. One individual or mass, one thousand or one million people, of course, we must prioritize the number of mass people. So therefore, we can justify."}]}
