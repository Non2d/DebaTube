So, firstly, they talked about wrong things in this debate. Secondly, they have failed to refute our point. And thirdly, they made no engagement. So, I'll talk about those three things from one by one."}, {"start": 601.0, "end": 602.0, "text": "So first of all, we like to say that the government has been condemning tiger parents as if they are abusing children. The Whip government claimed that tiger parents say abusing words to children, or the Whip government told you how tiger parents brainwash children. We said that is different. The deputy leader, Opposition, told you how parents who experienced failure don't want their children to do the same thing. So, we told you, after all, tiger parents don't want to actively harm children, right? Because if parents actively harm children and narrow down their opportunities or narrow down their freedom of choice or whatever, that is called abusing, and that's out of this debate. Therefore, their point cannot be the voting issue here."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "So, moving on to the second thing. This is about lazy children. We told you, we have proved that tiger parents are necessary in those cases. The Whip government claimed that we need a specific reason why tiger parents are uniquely good, and we did. "}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "So, we told you how lazy children are naturally lazy. They keep playing games and they don't have thoughts about their success or they don't have enough free will for their future, so they have no rebuttal for this point. The only rebuttal likely for this point is, oh, if children are playing video games, parents can't stop them from playing video games, and that's not called tiger parenting. This is so illogical here, because firstly, this actually supports our argument, because we told you, some children are lazy, so if the parents don't keep telling children to study or do something else, they wouldn't stop playing games, because that's what lazy means. "}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "Secondly, the other side is principally contradicting. They talk about how children are rational and have opinions as to what they want to do, but at the same time, the Whip government describes TV games as something that parents can stop if their children keep doing, and we don't understand that, because under this stance, parents have to respect children's freedom of will and let them play. But we told you how this is so problematic, and this harm is so tangible, so therefore, as the D Prime Minister said, we have tangible harm if we take this motion, therefore we mustn't take this motion."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "So moving on to the third thing, why lazy children is the main issue in this debate? Because firstly, we told you that's necessary in terms of parental responsibility to children. We told you how parents who have experience than children have to make the choice instead of children, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told you. "}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "And secondly, we say that the government side has been talking about their best case all the time. They narrowed down this debate by telling you that children have free will from the point of their birth. "}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "And so thirdly, we engaged to that point because we told you how children have at least some choice who to hang out with or what to watch. So therefore, it is clear that we must not take this motion."}]}
