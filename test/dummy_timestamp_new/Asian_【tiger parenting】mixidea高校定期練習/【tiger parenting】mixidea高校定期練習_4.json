No, right? If we look at the motion, we're specifically trying to ban a certain thing, and if they can't prove that there's no, like, if they say that, if there's no reason to keep tiger parenting, then you should obviously vote for Gov, because the government is the one that is getting rid of that unnecessary thing, right? "}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "So opposition do have a burden to prove that tiger parenting uniquely brings some specific benefits to the child, which they haven't so far. We need opposition to clarify what they're trying to support, and why the side they're supporting is comparatively better than the normal parenting that we support, very proud to propose today. "}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "A couple of refutations to the previous speaker, before I get into clash. So firstly, they say that, um, so they say that, like, our burden is not to say that tiger parentings are good, etc, etc, but, like, in the end, if they don't even talk about the benefits of tiger parenting, then they don't have anything to protect on their side, right? So ultimately, in order for opposition to, like, potentially win the debate, they do have to explain to a certain extent why tiger parents are something necessary for the child's education, and why it's something that they need to protect. "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "And the only thing they told us so far is that, oh, tiger parenting, like, because they failed themselves, like, they can, like, teach their child to, like, not, like, regret stuff, and, like, they can teach their child to be stoic and so on. But we don't see why parents have to, like, physically and both mentally, like, abuse their child to the extent that their, like, self-esteem is diminished, they're constantly being called worthless, they're constantly being told to believe that their classmates are enemies, they're constantly told to be top in class, and to always be studying 24 7. We don't see why this method is necessary for the child to be stoic."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "I think, like, a simple encouragement, or, like, telling children about the importance of studying is enough for children to be motivated to work for their own passion. Because if children do have the independence that side opposition forgets, then children themselves are able to work hard for their own dreams, for their own future. That is why we never see why this specific forcing and brainwashing from tiger parenting is necessary for the child to be stoic. So overall, we don't see any benefit coming from side opposition so far. We need a response from WIP."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "Secondly, they talked about how the line between, like, normal parenting and, like, tiger parenting is really vague. Therefore, we shouldn't take the plan. But no, right? Like, firstly, from the very Prime Minister, we told you three specific reasons of why tiger parenting are uniquely bad, right? Firstly, we told you that tiger parents ignore the free will of the child. So even if the child wants to be an actor, or wants to be a sports player, or wants to be any kind of dream job that they want to be, the tiger parent doesn't even let the child speak out. Because their goal is to make their child succeed and live a life that they couldn't live themselves. That is why they only prioritize academic success of their child, they neglect any kind of free will or opinion of their own child. We think that this is very harmful for the independence over the self-actualization and the overall long term happiness of the child. "}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "Secondly, we secondly told you that tiger parents deprived the opportunity of the child, right? This is like making sure that the child never has a chance to go out with friends, that they never have a chance to make their own hobbies and whatnot. All they have to do in their childhood is go to cram school, do piano, etc, etc. All those like cool, like, you know, those classes that they're forced to go. So we think that they don't have time to play, they don't have time to make relationships. We think that this is very crucial for the child's health, their mental health, and also for building your identity, right? Because your identity is built from your relationship with others. "}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "But tiger parents not only deprive the kids to go out with friends in the first place, they tell them that those friends out there in the classroom are their enemies, someone that they have to beat and test, someone that they have to beat in order to climb up the social ladder. This kind of wrong morality, skewed vision of the tiger parents is what deprives a child of having a happy social life. "}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "But more importantly, we told you that because tiger parents are so narrow-minded, and so desperate for their child's success, they ultimately use like harmful and very abusive words saying like, oh, you're worthless, or like, why can't you do this, etc, in order for the child to succeed. And we think that this puts like the wrong set of morals, as I told you before, and overall ignores the long term success of the child, because they think that, oh, as long as you can get into like a top university, like Harvard or Kodai, like everything is going to work out. That's their like narrow-minded, like a plan for their child. And we think that this is never good for the child."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "Our second speaker told you that specifically what children need is independence and critical thinking. If they constantly follow the parents' plans about like, which cram school to go, which universities to go, what like subjects to study, then they will never gain this kind of like self-independence, like self-thinking skills, right? We think that this is especially harmful, because children are never going to be with their parents forever, they have to step out into society at some point. And even if they do get into like a very good university, or like a very good job, once they leave their parents' supervision, they wouldn't know what to do, right? "}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "So ultimately, even if we take side opposition's best case, is saying that the child does leave us with like a successful life in terms of with brand and career, they will never last. So even if they get into like a top university, what we would ultimately see is them falling apart, they wouldn't know what to do. Overall, we think that this is this would be this will not be a long term success of the child is something that we can never support."}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "Finally, this whole issue about whether tiger parenting or relying on the knowledge of other parents is discussed. Some argue that kids lack the knowledge to make decisions. We disagree; kids have access to schools, teachers, and the internet, providing ample resources to learn about their dream jobs. Additionally, we haven't seen evidence supporting the idea that tiger parenting is inherently better than other parenting styles. Therefore, in evaluating parents' capabilities, this argument should not be considered."}, {"start": 412.0, "end": 413.0, "text": "The leader of the opposition suggests that in the government's world, kids will be spoiled, and parents won't be able to discipline them. Let's consider the average parent. While they may allow their kids to play video games or socialize, they would discipline them if academic performance suffers or if the child becomes addicted to video games. This approach is part of average parenting, and it would still be allowed in the government's world. "}, {"start": 413.0, "end": 414.0, "text": "However, what we don't support is parents ignoring a child's desire to socialize, confining them to their rooms, enforcing late-night studying, and responding to lower test scores with harmful and abusive words that undermine the child's identity and self-esteem."}, {"start": 414.0, "end": 415.0, "text": "We assert that such harmful and abusive parenting practices should not be supported. Our stance is not an endorsement of every child becoming spoiled; rather, we propose the establishment of a third party, as suggested, to examine personal parenting styles and ensure the well-being of the child. This way, children can thrive, be happy, and succeed in the long term, forming the basis of our pride in this proposal."}]}
