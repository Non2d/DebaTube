Like they said, we should judge things like in the court, or the individual should have something like, the individual can have some kind of choices in high school, but they never told some kind of logic of this. And moreover, we think that it's too late talking in this debate, so this is late argument, so just please don't take it."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "Okay, I'd like to go to our comparison. Okay, well firstly, this debate is very simple. Well, the opposition side never told like how benefit it's going to happen by doing tiger parenting or like that, so we think that because of this, there is not this kind of benefit gained by this tiger parenting.

Okay, firstly, we'd like to talk about which side can lead children to the better future. Alright, so they always say that they can have a better future by having like good jobs or big like academic skills or like that, but we never, we actually engage on this point by saying that alright, well maybe they can go to this like big corporation, but it's normal that you're going to be fired by bad human relationship or communication with your boss or co-workers and not, cannot be promoted in the society, rather you're going to quit this kind of job. These things are happening in the society. We think that there is this kind of like benefit is very little, and moreover, this is not good for these children, right?"}, {"start": 706.0, "end": 707.0, "text": "So how our side can lead better future for it? Well firstly, we're going to say that by banning this kind of like tiger parenting, we're going to say that the individuals can have the choice or like the time that they're going to think about this future. If you're going to have tiger parenting, you don't have any kind of time which you're going to think about the future. For example, if you're in high school, you're going to say, oh please go to, you have to go to Todai. If you're not going to Todai, you're not like a human or like that, or like what these kind of tiger parenting is too pressuring these children, and we think that it is harming a lot. "}, {"start": 707.0, "end": 708.0, "text": "However, if we're going to ban this, we think this freedom is going to be gained to these people, right? So this, we think that the students are going to think about what kind of like university or like jobs they want to have in the future, and we think that it's going to be the better one. How is it so? Because firstly, we say that we can have the aim that we're about studying or like that, right? Then secondly, we say that because the individual is going to have like the passion that they want to do it, we think that it's going to be the better future. And moreover, because certainly we think that individuality is going to be made, so we think it is better than their paradigm, which these children are being dependent on these parents or like that, and they can never think about like others or like that."}, {"start": 708.0, "end": 709.0, "text": "Okay. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point by saying that which kind of, which role should be like prioritized. Well, they always say that the parents are very rational or like that, but we're just saying that our side is going to support elephant parenting, right? These parents are going to put the children's individual choices, try to see children to have a better future by giving choices, right? Because we say that the children are going to like have like passion or like other things, we think that we can lead to a better future. That is actually why we're going to propose. Thank you."}]}
