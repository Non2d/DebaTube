Two issues from the Deputy Prime Minister. Firstly, the Tiger Parliament expands the children's choice. A parent is an actor to let the children able to live in the society. Secondly, we talk about the disproportionate risk that children are sitting exposed to for child education. A parent is difficult to teach the necessary things for the children."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Before that, several rebuttals to the Deputy Prime Minister. Lastly, they talk about how the children's freedom is deprived by the Tiger Parliament. But, ladies and gentlemen, we think the freedom of the children is not so important in the past. The reason is very simple. The children are not responsible in the society. If the children are committed a crime, the parents also take responsibility for the victim. For example, if the children are robbed of something in the shop, the parents have to compensate for the disturbance. That's the reason why the children are living under the protection of the parents. As long as the children are not independent of the parents, the freedom of the children is not so prioritized by the parenting."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Secondly, we talk about how the children are incapable of making decisions. And this policy is against the children. But, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the children cannot judge what is necessary for their living. Because they cannot have the experience of independence in society, also the children cannot earn money in the past. That's the reason why. As long as the children cannot be independent of the parents, the children cannot judge what is necessary for the children. That's why instead of the children, the parents have to educate the children. And this is so necessary. That's the reason why the children's decision is not important in the state. Okay. Taken."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "<POI>How are Tiger parents comparatively better than other parents at making these decisions? "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "Our boundary is not so that the Tiger parents are always good for their parents. The problem of the government bench is, if they ban the Tiger parents, it also makes this a chilling effect for the necessary parents. Because this line of the Tiger parents and the parents is very vague. If they ban the Tiger parents, also the Tiger parents are treated as child abuse. This problem makes sense. So, parents cannot take the necessary education for the children. That's why the burden of the government bench, while the situation is also justified. That's why our burden is not staying. So, Tiger parents are always good for their parents."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So, moving on to my first argumentation. Tiger parenting sometimes expands the children's choice. The reason is very simple. Parents cannot know what is necessary for the society if they live longer than the children. For example, the parents already experienced many success and failure in their life. Sometimes the parents are used to the raising, and they fail to enter the university. That time, parents think they want to prevent the children from failing by the Tiger parents. That's why we show, at least we show, this is necessary for the Tiger parents. If the kids are without the Tiger parents, sometimes the children continue to be raised. And the children also deprioritize their freedom. They also play with their friends. They just play on the piano. After that, the children regret the same as their parents, right? That's the reason why the Tiger parents are sometimes important. Because humanity is basically raised. Humanity is not always so stoic for themselves. That's why, as the guardian of the parents, guardian of the children, the parents sometimes are necessary for doing the Tiger parents."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "Secondly, the important point is the analysis. This policy leads to a chilling effect for the child's education. The reason is very simple. The government doesn't explain what is the role of the Tiger parents in the necessary education. We think, also, we already banned many stoic education as child abuse. For example, the parents cannot love the children 24 hours in the home. Because it's one of the child's education. However, in so many extreme cases, it's already banned. However, after taking this proposal, some stoic education is also treated as a Tiger parenting. This is so unbeneficial for the parents. Because even if the parents love the children, however, if the parents are punished by the Tiger parenting, the parents cannot live with the children. Because the child abuse, one of the punishments of child abuse, parents have to live apart from the children. That's the reason why, in order to avoid this situation, they cannot teach stoically for the children. That is the sole problem of this policy."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "Secondly, the parents cannot teach the necessary things for the children. The reason is very simple. Because the parents also cannot know this line of the Tiger parenting. Also, many of the third parties always supervise this parental action. If the children say, I always go to the discipline school, and they say, I don't like this studying, the parents force me to do studying. If some people hear this situation, they also sometimes have the opportunity to stand for the child protection center. Also, the child protection center can punish the parents in the first place. Even if the parents and the children love each other, this third party can't intervene easily. That is a very unbeneficial thing for both of the families in the first place. That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we think this policy is not so beneficial in terms of the feasibility point and in terms of the line of this Tiger parenting."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "So that's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, as long as the government didn't explain this line of the Tiger parenting, the necessary parenting, we cannot ban the Tiger parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, we think that if this policy is not just a policy, that Tiger parenting does more harm than good. We think this policy is why the banning is the only way to reduce the child's education for the collective. You think we already saw that this is a necessary point of the Tiger parenting and the damage of the banning of the Tiger parenting, our point is already clear to the government. That's why we oppose the motion."}]}
