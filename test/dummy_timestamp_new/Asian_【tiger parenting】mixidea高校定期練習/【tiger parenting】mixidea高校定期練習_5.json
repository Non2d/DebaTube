They told us that tiger parenting is somehow a bad thing, but it didn't really show us why after taking this motion, the parents are suddenly going to change and going to stop tiger parenting. When it comes to domestic cases, we think that parents are still going to do tiger parenting to begin with. Within that, it doesn't really change the situation from two reasons."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "Number one, we say that it's domestically happening. Same as domestic violence, because it is happening under your family, it's hard for the government to supervise all of those things. Unlike domestic violence, where your husband, your wife can run out and go to the police, when it comes to children, because they don't really have any knowledge about domestic violence or tiger parenting, they don't even know the fact that they are being tiger parenting and this is somehow illegal."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "But number two, we say that because the harm that is being imposed if children are mild where it's a psychological harm compared to domestic violence or child abuse, which is a physical harm, it's unlikely for other people to find out to begin with. Secondly, we say that because it's a mild abuse, children don't really realize and don't really go to the police or other places and say that they are being tiger parenting. We think that it's unlikely for those parents to stop tiger parenting to begin with."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that it's arbitrary. We've told you that the line between tiger parenting and normal parenting is completely arbitrary. And there are three criteria why it is uniquely bad? Even if it is uniquely bad, we don't think how they are going to define tiger parenting to begin with. We say that I'm just going to decide the amount of time that their children are going to study. We think that that's completely absurd. No, thank you."}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that we don't think that they have proven the BOP that they have to prove to begin with, because what they need to prove is not that to us, like to a certain extent it's harmful, but they have to prove all, or like 90 percent, it's most of the time harmful to children. We don't think that they have actually proven that BOP to begin with."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "Three analyses to look at this debate. No, thank you. Number 1, in a principle way. Number 2, how it's going to be for their social interactive ability and last of all, talking about the academic ability that they are going to gain. First one, to a principle."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "Somehow, the Deputy Prime Minister, I think that he didn't really have any strategy within the state to begin with, because the Deputy Prime Minister said that the practical outcome justifies this debate. Let's, if so, let's go with practical outcome. But then he said that the freedom of choice for children in itself is something important no matter the practical outcome. The Deputy Prime Minister proposed an example, LGBTQ plus and you shouldn't hinder the choice that that person has. The precise difference between LGBTQ plus and the difference between tiger parenting is that being LGBTQ plus isn't necessarily harmful. Well, without tiger parenting, without a lady child having any supervision, those children are going to have a bad practical outcome. We think that in terms of a principle argument, what they are just saying is that, consequently, what they are saying is that, let's compare with a practical outcome. So I'm happy to compare this debate within a practical outcome."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "So number 2, how about the children's social interactive ability? So the Prime Minister told us that they need to have time to play with their friends. Number 1, I say that in general, even they are doing tiger parenting, obviously, they can get once a week to play with their friends. But even in the hard case where tiger parenting is imposing an everyday schedule, we say that there's an existence of school, right? When you go to school, they can at least play with your children without any supervision from your parents. You can go out to the play field during lunch break. We think that with school, you can guarantee the social interactive ability for children."}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "So let's go to the academic ability, which is one of the most important parts of this debate. So the side of the government gave us one-liner analysis as the children have irrationality. We don't think so from several reasons. "}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "Number 1, we told you that children most of the time are irrational, right? They don't really see the society. They don't know how society works. And we think that they are unable or incapable to decide what kind of ability they need in order to succeed or in order to do what they want to do in the society."}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "But number 2, we say that there's peer pressure from your friends, right? When you look at other youth friends playing in the park, you also want to play and join that part because you don't necessarily think that studying is as much important as playing with your friends, right? So we think that peer pressure would force you to play with other friends as well. "}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "And number 3, we say that principly, parents have the right to decide over children's ability in terms of medical treatment and civil court because they are under the supervision of parents, right? "}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "And the side government told us from the opposition and from the government that teachers and the internet would help those children. The point here is that they don't even have the idea of asking those things to their teachers or the internet, right? Without any kind of supervision from their parents, we don't think that children know what to ask their teachers to begin with, right? "}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "And secondly, we talked about how independence is going to be lost by Tiger parents. We say that children are gradually going to acquire independence to begin with because we don't think that Tiger parents are going to last for high schoolers, right? Children are gradually going to gain independence. And when they go out into high school, although they might be Tiger parenting, at least they can decide what kind of friends that they want to hang out with, what kind of subject that they want to study, what kind of university that they want to study, right? We think that Tiger parents often take place in elementary school or like junior high school to begin with, right? "}, {"start": 514.0, "end": 515.0, "text": "And secondly, we told you here that there weren't any practical outcomes that came from the side government, right? We think that this is something important in this day because they somehow want to compare this today on a practical level. We didn't show any kind of practical outcome that is going to be beneficial for children, right? We explicitly told you the benefit of tiger parenting exists because academic achievement is regarded as the primal success in the society. Children have the necessity to go out to go to a good university and to go to a good high school, right? And we say, we told you that most children are normal, right? They can't really decide anything by themselves. And we say that this analysis is the primary analysis for children with one disability."}]}
