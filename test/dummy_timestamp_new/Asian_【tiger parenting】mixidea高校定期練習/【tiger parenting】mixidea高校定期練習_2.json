The first thing to note, just on account of their model, is that they haven't been able to distinguish between what a tiger parenting and parenting is. On our side, we explicitly told you the importance of elephant impairing, where we prioritized the freedom of the child, and I explained the importance later, but the problem of Opposition is that they simply gave a one-liner about parents having the ability to choose something because they know society and they already study it."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "There's two problems. First, is that given that it's true, I don't understand how that kind of analysis of tiger parenting is different from normal parenting. I want the DLO to come up here and explain the exclusive benefits that tiger parenting brings. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "Secondly, is that we kind of deny that premise, because I don't think tiger parents are more knowledgeable than other parents. We think that if a child wants to be an actor, a tiger parent won't know anything about it because their only interest is about academics, finding a good job, and finding a good future. We think in these cases, you're oppressing your child's future for the sake of academics, and we don't think this is something just."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "I'm going to get a few things in my speech in.

We think that, as Prime Minister touched upon, we think that the government can intervene given there's a very foreseeable tangible harm. That's why the government is justified in implementing policies like mandatory education, because without education, society will collapse, and we also ban things like child neglect and child abuse because of the sake of the practical harms that are imposed to children. We think that on our side, I'm going to prove to you why there are tangible harms, because we think that in our world, the children are rather capable of making independent decisions. The problem of tiger parenting is that they lock that skill up where they force the children to become dolls and become slaves to the dreams that parents were unable to do."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "That's why it was important for LO to refute the material the PM brought to you, which was that they ignore the free will of the child and they deprive opportunities of child. We think that the importance of the child wanting to play the piano or having friends, it may not necessarily be the practical outcomes of playing the piano, but what's important is the fact and the action that these children have the independence and have the capability of thinking for themselves and deciding that they want to do it."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "Why is this so important? Because we think that we should prioritize the children's freedom over parental rights in these cases. Why? Because we think when we look at cases like where we condemned parents who are against LGBTQ children, we think rather now, we're fine and we're accepting of children who are able to make rational decisions by themselves. The problem of tiger parenting is that they don't grant any kind of free will or independence where we force parents to have authority to look after their children as their dolls. We don't think that's the kind of future children want either."}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "We think that based on that, we think it is just for the government to intervene in terms of practical matter. We say it is just because we think that it hinders the development of the children's growth as well as any kind of independence, but I'll talk about that in my positive matter. Therefore, the conclusion of the first half of my speech is that we think it is just because there are practical harms where we have to prioritize the children's freedom. We think the LO failed in engaging with this material and we think the opposition already failed on this point."}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "Let me move on to my positive matter. My second substantive matter is going to probably directly engage with what DLO's substantive, which is the opposition's ideas about the importance of getting good jobs, for instance. The thesis of this argument is that children will be unable to gain good jobs and even if they do, this is going to result in negative outcomes. The premise of my argument is that the skills you possess at universities are built upon your early ages when you live with your mother as a 12-year-old."}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "Why is this? Because we say that in cases of universities or getting good jobs, these things are a natural extension of primary and secondary schools. So given this, what skills are needed to succeed in good universities and good jobs? We think this looks like things like the sense of independence as you're now going to be separated from the arms of your parents, right? We also think this looks like critical thinking, to be able to adapt to new changes and think rationally for ourselves. We think these are the skills you need and I'm going to prove to you why these skills are not going to be obtained. Before that, sure."}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "<POI> Why do you think that children who grew up in a tiger parenting household are not going to be independent when they go to university, where they have to be independent by themselves when they enter universities?"}, {"start": 212.0, "end": 213.0, "text": "So it's like saying you're suddenly going to make a child suddenly go on a bicycle without any training wheels, right? We think that we need these kinds of training wheels for these children to think independently, but we don't think it's good when there's going to be a parent just pushing their child until they're able to ride a bike. We don't think that suddenly throwing them out is enough for them to prepare for the universities that, in your best-case scenario, they're going to get into."}, {"start": 213.0, "end": 214.0, "text": "But I'm going to prove to you more specifically, right? Because we think under tiger parenting, these skills are lost because these children were a soulless robot obediently just walking the path that parents led them to. We think that when the path disappears, in the case of universities, because they're probably going to be physically separated from parents, these children aren't unable to know how to walk the path, they're unable to know what to do."}, {"start": 214.0, "end": 215.0, "text": "We think this results in people failing to progress in universities as they don't possess the abilities or the qualifications to succeed. Therefore, this is going to result in the 18 years of your youth sacrifice, your hobbies, your funds, all kinds of sacrifice for any kind for nothing, right? We think this is a terrible investment considering the breach of the children's rights that opposition is suggesting.

They're able to get in good corporate structures, executive positions."}, {"start": 215.0, "end": 216.0, "text": "We think in this case, what's going to happen is that these people are going to push the knowledge they gain onto their subordinates.
