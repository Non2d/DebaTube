As long as the prisoners are also a member of the society, it's a totally unjustifiable act by a government to deprive the rights of the board from the prisoner. That's why we are very happy to allow prisoners to vote. Two things to talk about."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "First of all, I'm going to talk to you about the importance of guaranteeing the right to vote under the title of protection of fundamental human right, even for prisoners. Second of all, I'm going to talk to you about benefits for criminals and also the whole entire society as a whole. Clarification of a simple model. Of course, we are going to allow prisoners to vote if they are qualified to have the right to vote in the real society. For example, in Japan, they are allowed to vote over 18 years old and such kind of things. And we are very happy regardless of what kind of punishment are they and how long they are in the prisons. I don't totally care about that regulation. As long as they are a member of society, as long as they are in the prisons, we are very happy to give the right to vote for those people."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "No, thank you. Moving on to the first point about the importance of protection of the fundamental human right for prisoners. I have two reasons here. First of all, in a very general topic, even prisoners, they already have fundamental human right to begin with. For example, they have, of course, the right to life. For example, they are available to have adequate food. They can have enough amount of sleep. And, of course, there is no worry of torture, right?"}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "This should be allowed, and there is no prisons to intervene here. And more than that, we actually allow prisoners to have to some extent of the access to society. What does it mean? In terms of the cultural happiness, for example, they have access to know about society well by reading a book or by watching TV or by reading newspaper or something like this. And they, of course, can work in accordance with the real working environment to go back to society easier and to feel that kind of member of the society, right?"}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "That's why we actually allow prisoners to pursue to some extent of the quality life as well as the right to life under the title of the fundamental human right to very much begin with, right? That's why second of all, the right to vote should be regarded as a fundamental human right. That's why we should recognize this should be given to prisoners as well."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "So what do I mean? For example, even status quo, regardless who you are, such as gender, nationality, generation, income, the right to participate in politics, the right to reflect your opinion in politics is actually allowed to every single people, ladies and gentlemen, because we, of course, recognize the importance of the liberal democratic society to try to catch up every single opinion and to try to decide the priority of the process and the law, ladies and gentlemen, right?"}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "That's why this should be done regardless of who you are, no matter how many, no matter how prisoners actually committed the crime in the past, right? That's why it is important to represent your opinion and they can finally feel as a member of the society, it should be allowed any point of mention before him."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "<POI>Why should criminals like Nicholas Cruz, who shot up dozens of innocent children in Florida, be allowed to vote on gun control? "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "First of all, don't just stick to the extreme opinion to very much begin with. Second of all, even for those people, we should allow them, we should allow the right to voice out your opinion as a member of society, which is same to, for example, the right to publish books to the public. I'm going to explain the analogy a little bit later."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "OK, moving on to the second point about that's why we recognize this, the treatment, current treatment to prisoner is kind of the disenfranchisement of the fundamental human right for the prisoners, right? So, like I say in analogy example here."}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "So, for example, the right to voice out your opinion is already allowed. And of course, the right to somehow make change other people's opinion is also allowed in the status quo. For example, like, please remember, for example, some of the very bad guy like a serial killer published some of the statement from prison. And this is actually kind of supportive opinion for the criminal. Like, please remember, the Yama Yurien Uematsu Hikoku actually published the statement that kind of the people. There are some people, handicapped people should be terminated. Right. But it is actually allowed to state it and allowed to publicize to society. Right. But this is the point. It is allowed to voice out."}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "But it's totally a free choice of every single individual whether or not they're going to take it seriously. And of course, that kind of extreme opinion must be burned out in natural discourses. And it should be this kind of idea should not be taken."}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "Right. So moving on to the practical benefit for society and criminal. So why it is good for criminal. I have a good point in terms of rehabilitation, because they finally get the incentive to know about the actual society. Right. Because the political party can provide a benefit for them. That's why they have a very happy incentive to know about what kind of current news appears. And they can start reading a book about a political party or, you know, the current affairs and so on by watching TV as well. That's why they can finally understand the common sense of the society, rule, regulation. And in the future, they will be easier to adapt to society with enough adequate ability of the common sense."}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "Second of all, in terms of society, it is also good because the political party has a massive incentive to reflect the prisoner's opinion. Right. That's why they can try to identify what kind of benefit they like to get. And they like to solve the prison issues in prison. For example, the very, you know, the not good quality of the prison environment is happening at the moment. Political parties are very happy to fix by presenting a manifest and so on. For example, the financial issue is also the problem at cause and the trigger of the criminal that the political party are very happy to, you know, try to tackle against that."}]}
