It is not the thing they should talk about."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Secondly, they say that by voting, people, the citizens can know what kind of certain policy is going to be reflected. But firstly, we say that voting doesn't mean you can know why criminals committed a crime. It's just voting for a certain policy. We think that it is not going to be a fundamental solution for it. And if you want to know why they committed the crime, we think that we can ask them during these rehabilitation sessions. "}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "And secondly, we say that they can voice out, like publishing a book or other things, as they told, right? We think that because of this, if the people, the citizens who are not the prisoners, say that it is right, then they are going to vote for these prisoners. We think that it is going to be a fundamental solution. And we think that because they have these kinds of ways to do it, we think that this is not going to be a justifiable reason. They're going to be privileged to vote in these certain elections. That is actually why we're going to say it is unjust."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Moreover, we say that because these prisoners once harmed our society, we think that this kind of thing is going to be a retribution for these people. Why is it so? Because if you harm the society, you're going to be restricted to some kind of thing, right? As we told you, for example, you're going to be in prison for a certain time. You cannot go out easily from these prisons until you're going to have those rehabilitations. Why is it so? Because we say that rehabilitation should be the time you're going to see your crime, and you're going to say that I did something wrong.

We think that these things are going to be a deterrent for these people to commit a new crime or death. That's actually why we're going to say this criminal system and justice system are moving well in the current society."}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "Alright, moving to our argument. Our argument is very simple. We're going to talk about these politicians' lenient policies that stigmatize these prisoners. What is so? Firstly, we'd like to talk about what politicians are. Politicians are people who are going to think about every people who can vote in these elections because these people want to be elected in these elections. Because if they're not going to be elected, they're going to lose their jobs and salary. And so actually, these people are going to think about every people who are going to vote. "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that the system of democracy is giving one vote to each voter. That's actually why we're going to say that if these politicians can get more votes, this means that these politicians have more possibility that they're going to be elected. That's actually why these politicians are going to think about the individuals. \nTherefore, if there is some kind of new right, for example, in this case, if these prisoners are going to be given a new right to vote, this means that the politicians are going to try to make a policy for these prisoners. And actually, we think that most of these political parties are going to try to increase these rights. And we think that these things are going to happen."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "One, they're going to say that these prisoners have the right, so we're going to reduce the criminal justice system. For example, you're going to abolish death penalty or prevent giving harsh punishment to rapists or other people. Or you're going to reduce these works in the prison or other things. And we think that this means that these deterrents are going to be reduced in these cases. "}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "What is the harm? We think that social harm is happening in this case because they're going to have fewer deterrents, less retribution, which means that these secondhand crime or other things are going to increase. And this means that something like crime cases or secondhand crime, juvenile crime, or some kind of specific of these kinds of crimes is going to increase. "}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "So what is the harm? We say that the stigmatization is going to happen to these prisoners, and it's going to harm these prisoners. What is so? We say that no policies move 100% well. There are some failures. And now, for example, if you're young, you're going to say, because you're young, you do some kind of radical thing or like that. And actually, the stigmatization will happen in these cases.What kind of harm is going to happen? We say that the negative campaign is going to harm more to these prisoners. What is so? Because if you're going to be in the opposition party and you're going to criticize your government."}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "We say that the scapegoat that you can use is the prisoners, right? Because the crime is going to increase. You say that, oh, because the government did some kind of these things. We say that there are going to be more and more crimes in the societies or like other things. And the media are going to say these things too. So actually this means that the students are going to be affected and radicalize these things. This is the same case of the Hispanic problem of America or like the refugee problem of EU or like other things. We say that alienized people are going to be affected and stigmatized in these cases. Moreover, because they have something wrong in the past, people have more possibility to be stigmatized. "}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "What is the harm? Firstly, we say that there are going to be fewer retributions and rehabilitation because more companies or like other people think that they don't want to accept these people. We say that there are going to be less rehabilitation. "}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that the division in society is going to happen. There are going to be more pressure to the societies by defamation or harassment. "}, {"start": 313.0, "end": 314.0, "text": "Thirdly, we say that people are going to vote for this opposition radical party. And this means that politicians are going to take away more rights of the prisoners because they are going to be radicalized. This is actually why we are going to say these harms will happen.
