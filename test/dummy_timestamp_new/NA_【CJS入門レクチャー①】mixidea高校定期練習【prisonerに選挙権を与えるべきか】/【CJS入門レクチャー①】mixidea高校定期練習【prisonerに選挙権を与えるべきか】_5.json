Although so many freedoms are actually allowed even in the opposition paradigm, under a third title of respecting the fundamental human right, such a right to voice out your opinion by publishing books, such a right to marry in the prisons, such a right to know about society by watching news, by reading a book, right? "}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "But why only the right to represent your political opinion should be terminated, should be infringed? I've never heard this exclusive reason from the opposition side. That's why under the title of respecting one of the important rights, we should in exactly the same way as other rights, we should allow prisoners to vote. Two conclusions here. First of all, whether or not prisoners are allowed in terms of a justification issue. Second of all, which can create a better society."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "Moving on to the first samples about the justification issue. So I've heard probably some of the reasons why it is not justifiable to give the right to vote for prisoners. So in terms of rationality, right? So they say prisoners are not rational enough because they want to break the law. We should not give the right to vote or something like this. So here are some rebuttals."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Number one, prisoners actually, my great partner already told you, they already graduated compulsory education here. That's why they already know the fundamental rules of society. We should grant them as they are rational, right? We should recognize them as rational, right? So this is the unconditional right to voting system to very much begin with. That's why. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "And they say that, what about children? So the difference between children is that who don't really have the right to vote is that, so of course, children have not passed the compulsory education period yet, but those prisoners actually passed the compulsory education period. That's why they should be unconditionally know the fundamental rules. That's what we should recognize them as rational beings."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "And even if somehow that those people are not rational enough because they are not educated well, that's governmental failure to educate people to implant an appropriate amount of common sense and regulation rule, this kind of academic structure to begin with, right? That's governmental failure to bear the burden. It's unjustifiable to push the entire burden on prisoners to deprive the right to vote to begin with."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "And second of all, second rebuttal is that, so in terms of rationality, so it is the fact they want to break the law in the past, but it doesn't mean that they are not reflected that past action, right? They have potentially to fully reflect their past action and they have motivation. They have the ability to bring up reflected will to society, right? They at least should consider this kind of other scenario as well."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "And last of all, so this is the most important argument. So even if somehow they're not rational and rational, this argument doesn't matter. Why is that so? Because it is justifiable, it is not justifiable to ask rationality for acquisition of voting right to begin with, right? "}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "Think about it. For example, in terms of economic policy, who is actually better people who can assess about the economics, future economics? Is it because it's probably the people who already graduated at university and who are educated well, right?

That's why the consequential result does not necessarily matter and rationality is not always, of course, matter to begin with, right? That's why fundamentally they should have the right to vote."}]}
