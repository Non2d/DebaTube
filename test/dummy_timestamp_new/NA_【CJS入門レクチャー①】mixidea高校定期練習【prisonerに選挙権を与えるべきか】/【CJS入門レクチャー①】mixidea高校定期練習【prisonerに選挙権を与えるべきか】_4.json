A world where the murderer of your son can be allowed to shout for gun control, where the rapist of your daughter can vote for abortion, or even someone who stole money from you, which was supposed to be used to treat your mom's cancer, is going to get away scot-free because, according to a member of government, it was a failure of the state. I think as opposition, it's pretty abhorrent to say that people who have broken the law, or potentially even taken lives, or taken someone else's property, and I think it is morally abhorrent to say these kinds of people are knowledgeable and rational, so we can provide them the right to vote, right?I think the moment they decided to not take the side and take the side of victims, we think that we win this debate."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "I'm going to examine two issues in this speech, and I'm going to examine the failures of government.First, let's look at the principles, because I think it's pretty clear that they already dropped the point about voting, but I'm going to talk about it. I think the government failed in engaging any points about how prisoners shouldn't be allowed to vote, especially for the things that sent them to jail, right? We think it's pretty weird for them to put prisoners into jails and say, but you can still try to convince us to not do so. We think that's a pretty weak stance for the government to take."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "The only response and engagement we heard throughout this whole debate was that, in the vast majority of instances, people are so poor so they can go to jail, so you can vote. Look, I think that this is extremely disrespectful for all the rational and hardworking people who don't cross the line of the inhumane act of taking someone else's stuff. "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "And even if we take their best-case scenario that these prisoners, like these people who were coerced into committing crimes should vote, then we think they could vote after jail because that's the moment their citizenship is returned and that the state makes sure that they have been properly rehabilitated and they have been able to successfully reintegrate into society."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "On a principle level, it is extremely bad and extremely abhorrent and extremely disrespectful for the government to say that prisoners are really capable actors. I don't know why they decided to side on the side of murderers, but I'm going to go with the stance the government brought to you. Given this, I think that voting is clearly a privilege, that all the people who have contributed to the well-being of society, in the terms of perhaps taxation, who don't make the inhumane judgment of breaking the law or taking someone else's life, those are the people that voting should only be granted to. On a principle level, this is already unjustified, so we say we win this debate."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "But I'm going to examine this debate further and look at the pragmatics, right?Again, the government side was absolutely unable to engage in our point about how there's going to be bribery in private prisons because there's no regulation by the government. We told you the politicians are going to cater to the needs of these criminals, and the fact that they didn't engage any at all and hasn't refuted any of our points is a concession that society is going to be detrimental in the fact that there's going to be policies that cater to these pretty radical ideas of potentially no abortion, for instance. We think this is inhumane for the government to try to defend."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "But let's take the best-case scenario, that was the whole rhetoric about how you need to find a middle ground, and we have to prioritize prisoners. Again, I'm not sure why they're siding with thieves and burglars and murderers and rapists, but let's say that you want to find a middle ground. We think that the way to find a middle ground is not for prisoners to vote on certain policies; it is to literally have a one-on-one talk with them during rehab sessions. So even under the best-best-best-case scenario, it's still possible on our side."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "There was no engagement coming whatsoever from my second speaker talking about how there's going to be stigmatization, there's bad policies. Even if we take the best-case scenario where we prioritize prisoners' needs, we think that that side is achievable on our side. Don't side with murderers."}]}
