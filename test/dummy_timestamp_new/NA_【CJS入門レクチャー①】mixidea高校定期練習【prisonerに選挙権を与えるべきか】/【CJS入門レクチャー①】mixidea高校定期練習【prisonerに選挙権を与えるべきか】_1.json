PM also brought to you that there are going to be benefits to criminals, but also society as well, because there's going to be a way of trying to incentivize these criminals to not commit a crime anymore and that we think that political parties are able to find the middle ground of benefits."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "I think that the biggest issue with the Prime Minister was that they neglected the fact that voting is not a fundamental right, but rather a privilege. Why is this true? Because we think that in the vast majority of instances, the voting comes with certain responsibilities and that responsibility is to uphold the law and make sure that you are able to look after what the government wants you to do."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "Look, if PM and government side of the bench is trying to promote this idea of fundamental rights, they need to prove to you why we can still kick out and exclude minors and young children from voting. They also need to prove to you that if it's such a fundamental right that it's upholding our sense of dignity, they need to prove to you why we don't allow these young children to vote, or in the case of people like me who come from Korea but don't have a certain nationality. We think that if voting is a fundamental right, they need to be able to explain to you why these people cannot just vote."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Therefore, I'm going to examine one issue in rebuttal first. Given that they haven't absolutely failed in proving their burden upon why voting is a fundamental right, I'm going to talk to you about the pragmatic consequences they talked about. They said that criminals are able to publish books, so given their logic, we should allow prisoners to vote. So, realize that there's a fundamental difference between publishing a book and voting, right?"}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "First, we kind of doubt the premise that you can publish a book during your criminal ages, but let's assume you can. Look, the difference of publishing a book is that in the case of publishing a book, you're reflecting the fact of why you had to commit a criminal, and it's showing a sense of guilt in committing a crime, right? This is different from voting, when prisoners try to legitimize their views and agree to more radical changes in the case of catering to politicians, right? I think there's a fundamental difference between publishing books, and we don't think that should be a metric for allowing prisoners to vote."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Now, given that, if they want to say that, then we say the fact that we are already removing certain rights in the case of prisoners because they broke state laws is self-indicative of the fact that this isn't a fundamental right and isn't beneficial to criminals."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "I'm going to explain two arguments in my speech. First, why this is principally incorrect. Secondly, why it leads to worse social outcomes. Let's look at the principles first, two layers in this argument. First is as I explained earlier, and this will directly clash with the argument about like what is voting, we think voting is a privilege, and this privilege comes with certain responsibilities and the responsibility to obey the law."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "The fact that you are a prisoner is the act of refusing to obey the law. That means that the state is justified in removing certain rights in order for them to make this kind of certain rehabilitation, right? I think that the fact that you became a prisoner and disregarded the law means that you shouldn't be able to be allowed to benefit from the democratic system that you yourself decided to reject. We think that's a fundamental principle upon which voting should be based on, and in the case of minors, we think that the reason why we don't allow them is that they can't uphold the responsibilities of being part of democratic system, but also that they can't make a rational judgment because they're still young and they haven't completed the proper system of education that the state mandated. That's why voting isn't the fundamental right like PM tried to bring to you. It is a privilege, and we think that the moment the prisoners broke this privilege on their own, they shouldn't be allowed to."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "But secondly, let's look at moral outcomes. We think it is conflicting for prisoners to be allowed to vote on things that literally sent them to jail for. That's why I gave you the example of Nicholas Cruz, right? Because we don't think that school shooters or people who shot people with guns should be allowed to talk about gun control, that rapists shouldn't be able to vote on abortion."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "But let's take government's best case. That is that these kind of examples are extremely, extremely rare, and that in the vast majority of cases, it's like economic crimes like stealing stuff. We think that still the fact that it is principally you are able to vote on the things that sent you to jail isn't something that should be principally correct. For instance, in the case of people stealing stuff, we don't think that there should be policies that allow less punishment for stealing other person's property, right? We don't think that's something morally correct."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "Now we think the point of law is to tell people that there's a line you cannot cross, and that fact that you are going to allow prisoners to vote means that you're going to be legitimizing their views, because we think, because just in terms of breaking the law, but also allowing them to vote means that they're legitimizing their own views about school shootings and stealing stuff, because they want people to cater to their own needs. In the case of moral high ground, and judging by the victim's self-reflection upon the fact that they're going to have murderers of their daughters voting on gun control, or how to use knives, we think that we cite as the moral high ground."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "But let's look at worse social outcomes next. Second argument. Will prisoners be able to vote for good? The comparative is that on their side, there's still going to be, these prisoners are still going to be undergoing rehabilitation. That is, the prisoners are more likely to have conflicting ideas about, for instance, their thoughts about drugs or violence and the things that sent them to prison on the first place."}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "That's why, presumably, it's still going to be dangerous for their prisoners, for them to be able to vote rationally, right? On our side, in the case that they're rehabilitated and they're able to go out of jail, we think that they're less likely to vote for dangerous things, because it means that the state justifies that they have been able to go through successful rehabilitation."}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "Secondly, though, we weed out prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, because on our stance, we're just going to allow anyone who's not, who is able to recover and go out from rehabilitation to vote. That is, in the case of prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, I think these people are the most people that are likely to be disattached to life. These people are going to vote for radical policies, such as no abortion or legalizing pedophile, because they don't have the responsibility to look after society, because they can't be able to go out in society in the first place."}, {"start": 114.0, "end": 115.0, "text": "But thirdly, let's look at the perspective of those who want to get votes. Two layers. We think that prisoners become easy prey, and this is going to be a block of free voters. "}, {"start": 115.0, "end": 116.0, "text": "That means, A, they're going to be bribed with shorter sentences for having to vote, because they're going to take private prisons where there's no authority of the government."}, {"start": 116.0, "end": 117.0, "text": "Or B, is that they're just going to cater to prisoners' needs, which is the fact of shorter sentences and less harsh punishments. I think this will rather incentivize these prisoners to feel it is okay to commit crimes, but they're still going to have this fundamental right. Therefore, I think it is unjust for governments to take this motion."}]}
