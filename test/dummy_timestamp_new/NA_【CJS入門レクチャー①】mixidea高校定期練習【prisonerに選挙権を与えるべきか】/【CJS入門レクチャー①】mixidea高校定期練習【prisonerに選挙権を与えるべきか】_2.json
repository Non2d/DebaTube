We have to respect prisoners' rights, and my first speaker clearly talked about why rights are included in the vote. So we're proud to propose. For today's debate, let me prove two things: why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflection in today's society and the comparison between the government and opposition rights."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal to what the previous speaker was talking about. The previous speaker continuously claimed that the exclusivity of kids and minor people is now given in the status quo, showing that the vote is not everyone's right and that there's a situation excluding rights. But the difference between voters like minor people such as kids and those prisoners is that kids are just under knowledge, right? They're not taught to have a rule of society; they don't know the structure of society. Compared to criminals, criminals have a certain knowledge and fulfill the knowledge to have the right to vote. For example, compulsory education is now finished for criminals in today's status quo."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Furthermore, they said that rationality is a certain criterion we have to take, and we can exclude in those kinds of situations. But, for example, if we have a certain issue of undereducated people, we have a certain question: Should we take those uneducated people just because they can't make rational judgments? The answer is no. We can't take away the right to vote for those kinds of things, and rational judgment is not the only reason to take away the right to vote."}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "<POI> Okay, so to clarify, you're saying that prisoners are rationally knowledgeable despite the fact that they might have committed crimes and broken the law, potentially taking someone else's right. "}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "So you're saying that those prisoners are just having a certain cruel thinking, and it should also be excluded. But this is not the debate we're talking about. We're not talking about those situations; we're talking about whether or not those rights are excluded or not, and this debate will be that our side is now including the right, and my first speaker is completely proving why the vote is included, right?"}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "Furthermore, like what the previous speaker was talking about is that it will reduce punishment when prisoners' opinions are reflected. But this is not true; punishment is not the category that will be changing. The category we're trying to support is those criminals' reasoning why they committed the crime and changing the social structure in the status quo."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "Moving on to my argument. One, why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflecting in today's society. Let me make a clear analysis of what prisoners are. Prisoners know best why they committed a crime and what the psychological thinking was behind it. So let me take several cases. For example, the cases of robbing. When prisoners commit robbery, the reason is mostly a social or financial problem. So as we see these cases, prisoners are having a problem that the social structure is not fulfilling their needs. To that extent, we can reflect prisoners' opinions that they have a lack of social welfare, and the government can notice what problems are occurring and can contribute to this society."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "Other cases are also clear, for example, murder. When murder happens, prisoners can only know why they murdered, what the reason was, and what the issue was. Most of the time, stress is given. So as we take this motion, we can contribute to changing this society and reflecting opinions. The impact of this argument is that the government can't know even if prisoners' investigations and psychological investigations are given. The only one that can know about the consequences and circumstances of prisoners is the prisoners themselves. So it's a beneficial thing to take this debate."}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "Lastly, let me briefly compare between the government and opposition. The opposition keeps talking about the principle of the argument and why this is unjust for taking, but they didn't even talk about what is the certain impact of not taking, and they didn't really extend on that. Our side of the house is clearly talking that we can contribute those opinions to this society and make a world where prisoners and those citizens can live safely. This is the reason why we are opposing."}]}
