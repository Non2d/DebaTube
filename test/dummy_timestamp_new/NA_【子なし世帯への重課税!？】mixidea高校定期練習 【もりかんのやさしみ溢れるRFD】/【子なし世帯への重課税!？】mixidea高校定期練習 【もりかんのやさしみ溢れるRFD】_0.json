Therefore, we believe that it is justifiable to take this motion to solve the issues that we are facing right now. So our model is to put a tax on those people who do not have children, and this amount of tax will be constant and equal to everyone. However, we are going to exclude those people who do not have any children due to their economic reasons. Those people who cannot afford another family member and have decided to not create any children, we are not going to put a tax on those people."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "I am going to talk about mainly two things. First, why ageing society is bad and why we need to solve this problem. Second, why taking this motion is going to be effective to solve the problem that we are facing."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "First of all, as we all know, many developed countries are facing ageing society right now, including Japan. For a super ageing country, the future is unmeasurable dull, incredibly fragile, and filled with uncertainty. In the case of Japan, the children in the present days, which I mean by teens and maybe people in the 20s, are an incredibly lower number compared to those people who are in their 50s or 60s or 40s. When those people in their 50s or around those ages reach to 70s and 80s, the people in their teens and 20s right now are going to be forced to take care of them."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Those young, the youngsters in the present days, will be forced to manage the economics and earn money and pay tax to the government in order to secure the pension for those elderly. Because these young people who are going to have the responsibility for taking care of those elderly in the future are small in number compared to the people in their 50s right now, those young have to have the huge burden to support a bigger number of people compared to them. This burden will significantly be severe when comparing to the people in the same position right now."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "Because the government will have to get money, the government will be going to put a heavier tax on those people. They will be going to force a bigger portion of tax. When this happens, those young will be going to lose their incentive to work hard because they know that their money will be taken away largely by the government. They will be able to use those money according to their own will. They will start to work just to get the minimum amount of money that they can live. When this happens, the economy will be deactivated and stigmatized. Obviously, the money that will be spent on the elderly will get smaller. Not only those elderly, but the social welfare that is granted to every single person in the nation, those social welfare will be poor in quality, especially to those people who are in agony of poverty. In their lives, social welfare is playing a big part in their lives."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "When social welfare becomes smaller or worse, those people will not be able to get support from the government. Those people will suffer even more. Also, those people who suffer in their poverty will increase compared to now. We do not want that nightmare. However, if we do not solve this ageing society problem, we will be forced to face that reality, and we will be forced to regret our past beings that we should have done something to prevent that nightmare that they were forced to face. We do not want that. There is an urgent need to solve this problem."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Next, I will talk about why this is going to be effective. Because no one will be eager to pay tax, incentives to make children will increase. Before explaining this process, I would like to first categorize the people who do not have children into three types."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "One is that those who are very poor and cannot afford children, and second is that those people who despise children and strongly believe that they do not want any children, and third is those people who are in between, who are thinking of having children, but they are not that desperate to have children, so they decided to not make any children."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "For the people in the first category, because the tax will not be targeted to those people, it is totally okay for them because they do not need to pay tax, or they do not even need to create children in order to avoid the tax. For the second people, who strongly believe that they do not want any children, they will be forced to pay tax. However, as I said in the beginning and will be explained in my subsequent speakers, they always have the responsibility to contribute to the future of society, so they, and because they made the choice not to make any children, they have to fulfill their role to the society, and it is okay for them to make, it is okay for the government to make them pay the tax. And for the third category, those people who are in between, because they don't want any tax, but they are also okay with having children, their incentive to create children will increase."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "So those people, which we believe that is the majority of the parents who do not have any children, because those people's incentive to create children will increase, the number of children will obviously increase, and therefore will be able to solve or kind of make the issue better. So for this reason, we propose. Thank you."}]}
