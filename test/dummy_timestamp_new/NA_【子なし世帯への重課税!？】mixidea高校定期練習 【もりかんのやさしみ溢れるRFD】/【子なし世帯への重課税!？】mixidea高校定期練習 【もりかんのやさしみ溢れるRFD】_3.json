So, first of all, they said that people who think that couples who want to bear children or don't have to bear babies can raise their babies if this motion is taken. But, think about if, in the first place, women who want to have children and have to bear babies with their strong feelings, they must not bear under the forcing. Because if they do that, they would have a burden to raise their babies, right? Because of the additional tax. So, if some of them don't want to pay additional tax and bear babies, they have no strong feeling to raise them. And some of them would abandon babies. And this case will occur."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Moving on to their arguments about future citizens. So, this can be also achieved in the Opposition side, right? Because our side has come to a plan that also achieves raising many babies. So, this can be also achieved on the Opposition side, too. Like children will improve technology also and improve society. And our side thinks that children are important, too. Because we already share the goal that achieves having many babies in the aging society. So, however, our side, we have a counter plan. And this is much better. Because this can happen. No additional tax to pay by one part of the citizen."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Moving on to the arguments of caring elders. So, this also in government's after plan. Elders are existed much as Opposition side. So, people have to take care of them. Also, not only in the government side and also Opposition side. But Opposition side, we can support money to them. And their arguments are all shared with our side. "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "So, I would like to talk about our counter plan. And say that our counter plan is better than taking this measure. So, our counter plan was to increase the children. As the first leader of Opposition has just explained. And this can be easy for their children. Because of this environment that women can raise their babies or bear their babies easily. And they have spiritual marriage that they have no forced choice. And have freedom on the government side. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So, we have planned that by two processes. First of all, it is to urge maternity leave or making a kindergarten. Or something like a facility that children can play there all day. And more, so that women can work comfortably. And secondly, it is to support money if women raise their babies. So, this counter plan doesn't have to pay an additional tax on people without children. Because people who raise their babies can get money. And also, as I said before, that people who are caring elders can get support from the government by giving money. So, we think that this is very effective in the super-aging society."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "So, our third argument was the evangelical right. For example, people who don't want to marry or people who don't want to raise their babies. So, our example is that people who don't want to marry, especially the man. So, taking the motions mean that if the people who don't want to pay tax. They have to get married and bear their babies. And raise their children and pay a lot of money. And children have to get better education. And they have many orders to raise their babies. So, this is very unjustified between these people."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "So, for these reasons, we would like to oppose. Thank you."}]}
