And now there are a lot of people who can't have children even if they want to have like disabled people and like injured people to get injured people. So those people are if those people want to have children but they can't do that. So to impose an additional tax on these people is not equal and this is not unique for those people. So as the definition we said we won't impose tax for people who have disabled people or who have a disease that can't make children. So that this is this is not our argument but but in this case, there is another counter plan like that to make a system that women can have children more easily and more little anxiety."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "So now why women tend to not have children in these days?
