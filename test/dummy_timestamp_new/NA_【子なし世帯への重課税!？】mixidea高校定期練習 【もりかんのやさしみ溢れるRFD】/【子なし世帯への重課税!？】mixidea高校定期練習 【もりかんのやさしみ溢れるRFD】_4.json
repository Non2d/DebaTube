But the problem that they lack, what they actually needed to do in this debate is to provide a fundamental reason why exactly taking this motion is the most effective way and the most efficient way to actually achieve this goal in this whole debate. But they totally failed in talking about this. They only talked about the benefits."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "And on the other hand, we've provided a better model that actually attacks the core problem of why these issues are currently happening, even in the first place.

Like, in the PM speech of the government side, the PM actually gave three characters of the people who cannot, who do not have babies. And we believe that this is actually true. First of all, the people who are extremely poor. Secondly, the people who don't want to have children in the first place. And third, the people who can but they just don't want, for several reasons. We think that this is actually true. But the problem here is that the first two characters here are totally not mutually exclusive. And on the other side, they will still not have babies. So what I'm trying to say here is that the most important actor, the vast majority of the actors in this debate, stakeholders in this debate, is the people who can but just don't want, just don't have babies for several reasons."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "I would like to clearly explain why they do not, why do they not exactly have babies in the current situation and why, by taking our counter plan, they will actually actively try to make more babies and actually tackle the whole goal in the first place. So the reason why the people, the reason why these people in the first place do not have babies is because I think there are mainly two reasons. First of all, they only have an average income. They're not extremely poor, but they just only have an average income. And they're really worried that they cannot fully support their children, cannot provide an extreme or enough amount of education to their children, even if they have them. And secondly, the people who are just worried about their own career, their own future themselves. But the government side totally mischaracterized or even failed to even characterize these kinds of people in the first place. So I think we already win this debate by clearly clarifying them."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "And secondly, why we can actually achieve this, why these people will actually actively have more children in the future is because, first of all, just as our first speaker and second speaker have clearly mentioned, we're going to provide more maternity leave and even actually support these people in the first place. So like even if they only have an average income, because we will support them financially, they'll also be able to have more babies or even try to have more babies because they actually receive those kinds of financial support. And secondly, the people worried about their career, their future, because we'll provide them more maternity leave or other kinds of options, they will definitely try to make more babies by taking this plan."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "Secondly, the second issue of today's debate, which will provide a better future for our citizens. So I would like to mainly put a focus on two actors. First of all, the people who are actually their parents in the first place. And secondly, their children. "}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "First of all, what will happen to the parents? Just as an explanation, people who have only the average income are worried if they can fully support their children. Because these people are just literally forced to have children just because they just want to get away from these taxes or even maybe forced by the whole social norm in the first place. They're basically forcing their own lives into a very endangered situation where they do not have enough money, they do not have enough support. "}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "Because their parents are even in a financial crisis, literally. They'll be forced into a low-quality life, not enough education, and those kinds of stuff. And we believe that these people, like the government itself is sort of failing their parents and their children in itself. And we believe that this will keep on going, but people keep on going for generations and generations. This will never stop. It actually worsened this problem in the first place."}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "So we believe for all these reasons, we totally take this debate out of the government. Thank you."}]}
