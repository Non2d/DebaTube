Having children, it doesn't mean just only having children in a family. They're creating workers, future laborers. And we don't have children, it means they don't create a new generation, who will be future laborers, who will support future society, who will care elders. So we need to take this motion.

So I'm going to have three points. Firstly, I'm going to analyze the children, and secondly, how it does harm for society if they don't have children, and thirdly, how the situation will be solved.

They're not just a part of the happiness, but they're future citizens, which means they will make an economical movement, which means they make and keep the country's economic alive and healthy, which is worth for almost all citizens. For example, they can get jobs easily, they can buy things easily, like that, and so it's worth for almost all citizens. And moreover, they are future workers. If they work for online jobs, or like in a factory as scientists, they can develop skills or economics, and they will provide things for our society. So they are contributing for society, each other, like that. And it contains nursing the elders, because they need to, who need to nurse the elders is that those citizens who are not child, but they will be adults. So we need those children. "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "The impact of this argument is that, first of all, that those children are very important for our society who we need, or if they don't create those, then they are giving harm to society, which they are not fulfilling their responsibility, which means they should take the responsibility somehow to fulfill the responsibility."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "And the next point is that how it does harm for society by not having children. So what is the responsibility to create a new generation is that, let's see, for example, in Japan, many people need to quit the job to care for the elders, and the point, otherwise, those older points, nursing, and those oldest. Why? Because in an aging society, those elders are increasing, and they are hard to go into nursing, nursing houses like that. And those children who are those families have to care for the point, all those, so they need to quit the job.

So the impact of this point is that not having children does very harm for society, which in terms they are causing harm to others, they should take this responsibility, even if they don't have the freedom to escape from the responsibility, it is justifiable."}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "Finally, the third point, how the situation will be solved. By imposing the tax, those taxes will be used, will be used for welfare services, for example, nursing, the nursing can be high-tech, which helps youngers, like using IT programmings, or like that, and more, they can have more financial support for nursing, which helps the youngers to care, to nurse those elders.
