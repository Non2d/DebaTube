Firstly, the principal issue, utilitarianism versus the property right, and secondly, the incentive of cooperation in status quo, and thirdly, the incentive of cooperation after plan adoption. "}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "So let's start. Firstly, in terms of the principle issues, you may agree that the general importance of property rights, which we already explained to you, because the patent right is simply the fruit of investment of research and development of pharmaceutical corporations, and therefore this is guaranteed as a property right. This is nothing different from buying the land or constructing the factory by investing the money. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "We think that there is no difference between physical property rights and intellectual property rights. And actually, in many countries, the patent law explains discreetly that the patent right is one of the property rights. That's why we think this is, in general, this is particularly important. And what we already proven to you in this debate is that this is not acceptable, even in the context of the emergency cases, that this is the deprival of property rights is unacceptable. "}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "Their only claim is that in emergent cases, this is acceptable. If this is true, for example, if the factory exists, which can produce the vaccine, we can buy this kind of factory regardless of their consent of cooperation and forcibly produce the vaccine. Or if the land exists, in this case, which is suitable for producing the vaccine, that we can forcibly construct the factory and produce the medicine, or that we can forcibly work the doctors or scientists in order to tackle down COVID-19, for example. We think that as long as they fail to explain to what extent the property rights or the rights of the individual, or the rights of the corporation, can be infringed under the name of the arbitrary criteria of emergency, we think their case must fail. Therefore, the general principle of property rights is particularly important. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "And more than that, the arbitrariness of this kind of emergency in terms of focusing on the medical patent is particularly unjust. They mention that in the emergent cases, there is no alternative not to this kind of utilizing patent. Firstly, if you look at even just in Japan, Moderna, Pfizer, KMBIO, Novavax, and so on and so forth, there are lots of alternatives to this. In the worldwide cases, for example, the Chinese vaccine corporation is using alternatives doing this. That's why there is no strong necessity, as they mention that. "}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "And secondly, in the ordinary cases, if one corporation, for example, invests a wonderful anti-cancer drug, in this case, for the cancer patient, there is no alternative for 20 years, but nothing from this kind of wonderful corporation. Therefore, we think the emergency is not so a constitutional component of this kind of established, trikle down the importance of property rights. Therefore, we see utilitarianism cannot trickle down the property rights. That's why we are very proud to oppose this motion. "}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "So let's move on. Based on this kind of principle, let's move on to the practical issues in terms of incentive of the corporation in the status quo. There is still a reason why the country, the corporation, have no incentive to spread the vaccine. Firstly, the very simple question is very factual. Actually, in the worldwide, vaccine is spread as a result of the kindness of the corporation. This is very simple proof that their case must fail. "}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "And on the more logical and debatable level, they mention that this is short-sighted. We think that vaccination is not only the spread in terms of vaccination, it's not only the short-term profit, but also that their KPI includes a reputation risk in terms of their own property, because the ESG is a particularly important criteria in the current investment criteria. Therefore, they are more careful about the reputation risk in the first place. That's why not only the just profit by selling the vaccine, but also the prevalence rate in the population is also the important KPI for the management of the pharmaceutical corporation. Therefore, the analysis of short-sightedness is failed. "}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "And they also mention that knowledge share will be failed. But if you take a look at the very basic of the patent, because I actually offer the similar patent and I have similar patent after entering chemical corporations. Firstly, after sending the patent to the office, and 1.5 years after, the patent information is opened to all over the world. And after the request of the examination, the patent office examines the newness and technological advancement of the patent, and the patent will be registered. This is the very basic knowledge of the patent. We think that's why after, if the corporation decides to open the patent to get the patent right, their knowledge will be shared. That's why there are some specific features of the corporation that can be shared as worldwide knowledge in our paradigm. We think this is nothing proven in the first place. "}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "They also mentioned Evergreen. Again, we think that Evergreen is difficult, particularly in a more competitive field, because there is necessity in terms of technological advancement, not only newness. That's why just a similar patent cannot be guaranteed as right, because they reject it as there is no technological advancement, the gap is not technologically advanced. Therefore, their case must fail. "}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "In terms of the incentive of the corporation, we think this is fine. And in terms of if the corporation has the motivation to build a factory, or ODM the factory, and they sell the vaccine, this is fine. And if licensing is necessary, this is also fine. For those, for two ways of their own production and their licensing, we can guarantee, actually in the status quo, we can guarantee the number of vaccines, the number of drugs, we think this is no problem at all. "}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "So thirdly, finally, the incentive of the corporation after production. We think the incentive of the corporation ended from two perspectives. Firstly, as the leader of the corporation mentioned, they stopped investing in the research and development, because simply the pharmaceutical corporation's R&D ratio is very, very high. That's why tremendous profit is necessary. But if they possibly sell the patent, at some point of time of the pandemic, this profit is particularly limited. But if they continue, for example, in the half a year, vaccination is recommended in Japan, in this case their benefit will be skyrocketing compared to the selling at a certain time of the pandemic. That's why this kind of incentive comparison is particularly significant for the corporation. "}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "And if they still continue investing in the R&D situation, if this kind of precedence of possibly selling or possibly buying of the patent exists, in this particular occasion they stop opening that information, they stop registering the patent. Instead of that, they hinder the process as a know-how of their own corporation. This kind of knowledge sharing, as they mentioned, is never ever achieved. Therefore, even if the Italian benefit outside of this area, we are very proud to oppose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Now on to the reply portion of this debate."}]}
