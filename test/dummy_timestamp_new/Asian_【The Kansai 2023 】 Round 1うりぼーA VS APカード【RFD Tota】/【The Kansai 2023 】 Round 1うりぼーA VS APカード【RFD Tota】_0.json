What we think is very important during the pandemic time is helping as many people as possible and passing those things. In those circumstances, these kind of patents will slow the enhancement of development of new drugs or vaccine or those kind of things, or the accessibility of those things. So we are very happy to propose this motion. "}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "So two things I'm going to talk about in my speech. Firstly, how patents will bother or slow the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. Secondly, how in our society we will be safe, which is the counter of the status quo. "}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "But before moving on, I'm going to talk about a couple of models or definitions. First, like Western Pharmaceutical Company. I think, as you know, it's like Pfizer or Moderna, which has a large pharmaceutical company with large money and those things. And what we mean by the release of patents, first of all, the scope of the patents will be more pandemic related. So it is not like all patents, for example, when it is the COVID time, COVID vaccine or drugs that will be. And also in the world where there are patents, you have to pay fee for using that or maybe those kind of companies have to occupy the knowledge, have a right to knowledge. But what we think from the government side, when there are no patents, it is more open those kind of disclosure of the information of the society or those kind of things. "}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "So moving on to the first argument, how patents will bother the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. "}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "So at the conclusion, I won't say patents will slow and lessen accessibility for three reasons. Firstly, simply, when there are patents, you cannot get the skill or use that skill because the corporation doesn't have the incentive to share those knowledge. And secondly, you have to sell tons of money to use that patent. For example, if you want to use the patent of the company A, company B has to pay a lot of money, which is unlikely to happen. And thirdly, if there are less types of medicine and when there are, first of all, when there are patents, it means there are less types of medicine. In those circumstances, the prices of the drug or the vaccine will be high. So the conclusion here is that patents will slow the development of the new drugs and lessen the accessibility of drugs. "}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "So why is this problematic? For two reasons. Firstly, when there are pandemics, these kind of poor people cannot access the drug or the vaccine. Maybe in a country like Japan, where there is a lot of money, or a rich country, the government has the budget to distribute the money to the citizens. But in the majority of cases, especially in poor countries, they don't have enough money to do that. So that means, in the worst cases, you don't have the right to get the vaccine or get the drug, which means you are dead in those kinds of times. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "And secondly, why it's problematic is that it will slow the development of the new drugs. For example, maybe company A has made an original COVID-19 vaccine, and company B are very specific and talk us through at the Delta Cup or another cup, but in that world, you don't have the patent, you don't have the rights to use the patent, or the patent is not released later, please. And so, company B have to do from the scratch, right? They have to use tons of money, they have to use tons of time to do the clinical trial of those vaccines, right? In those circumstances, it will lessen the development of the new drugs. So why this is important is that when the pandemic comes, you have to get the drugs or the vaccine to help many people. "}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "<POI> We can see that helping people is quite important, but even if it is not a situation of the worldwide pandemic, still there are a lot of patients who are struggling with diseases. Why you can focus on the situation of those kind of worldwide pandemic? Why you can have the right to still do the property that you recover investigation? "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "My partner will answer this question. "}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "So moving on to the second point, how our side is better. What we think is that in the world where the patents will be released, it will fasten the development of the new drugs, because for two reasons. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "Firstly, when the patent is disclosed, it means that many companies have access, more competition will happen, and when there are no patents, many companies have the opportunity to get that information. That means that company A can use that information, and company B can't use it. So in that circumstances, maybe in the world there are patents. This Western first company who has a patent will not feel like making development, but because all the information is disclosed, those companies will be rushed to do another. "}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "And the second reason why it will fasten the development, is that each company can use the proficiency skill, or their specialty of that institute. For example, maybe company A is good at designing clinical trials or using digital tools and twins, like using AI things, or maybe company B can use it. In those circumstances, each company can use their own skill, which means that the development gets scaled from those original information. So we think, because of two reasons, we think it will be fastening the development, and the accessibility of the drug will be opened. For this reason, I'm happy to propose. Thank you."}]}
