This is actually giving benefits to the consumer and society as a whole. That is what we are happy to hear about this motion. "}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "Before moving on to my substantive, let me quickly go back to what the previous speaker said. First of all, he said venture companies do not take action to invest or develop new technology. We don't think so, even in current situations. A lot of venture companies can take enough action. For example, let me take the example of the case of COVID-19. Moderna is actually a venture company. This was built after 2010. Of course, we already know that they do not have enough monetary capacity, but if they can invest in beautiful technology, they can invest it by a lot of investors from the whole of society, and they can earn money from the society. We think even in this house, enough technology is actually made by those kinds of companies. "}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Second of all, he said that the companies just take the short-term benefits. We don't think so also. Because such companies also invest from a lot of people, at the moment, if they just focus on the short-term benefits from the society, on the other hand, they also have to consider long-term benefits. For example, utilizing their patents or continuously selling new products to the society. That's why we think such malicious usage of patents is less likely to happen. Because if they maliciously make so many expensive fees to just use such patents technology, of course, no one would want to use it. That's why we don't think that kind of situation is actually happening. "}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Okay, next, moving on to my substantive. First of all, while releasing the patent is a completely undermined motivation to develop new technology, and unfortunately, the existence of information itself is obviously declining in that part of this house. Secondly, as a property right, why we should not arbitrarily steal such kind of property from the entire company, even in the case of pandemic cases. So, lastly, let me compare each part. "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "First of all, while releasing the patent is completely undermined motivation to develop new technology. So, in that part, the company has two choices. If you develop new technology, first of all, you can share such kind of information as a patent to the whole society. Actually, we can know how to make it, what kind of substance is actually in such kind of drug or something like that. But if you try to use such kind of technology or information itself, at the moment, they have to pay money or something like that. This is the case of the one. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "The second of all, they still have the choice to hinder such kind of information itself to the society because they do not want to share information to the society, even if it deals as a patent. Still, in that society, the company tries to hinder such kind of mechanism or something like that. For example, as my partner already mentioned, such kind of algorithm is actually hindered even in the current situation. In their part of the task, there is no patent at all. As a situation, why such kind of company has a motivation to share information, how to make it those kind of drug itself. In that society, there is no mechanism from the entire government side. That is why, in the first place, they cannot recover such kind of investigation, as my partner already mentioned, or more than that. So, rather, we believe they try to hinder those kind of new technology, the methods to make new products. They try to hinder and just maliciously utilize those kind of methods to earn money. So, that's why we think this is completely problematic. "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "Okay, let's move on to the second substantive. So, why we think that stealing the property shouldn't be tolerated even in any circumstances. As my point of information mentioned, even if it is the situation of the worldwide pandemic, even not the situation of the worldwide pandemic, still, we can find a lot of people, a lot of patients, who are actually struggling with any kind of diseases. In that case of urgency, of course, we have to tackle, we have to solve those kind of patients, even if it is not the case of the worldwide pandemic. "}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "But, unfortunately, they arbitrarily decide a line to distinguish which person should be helped in the case of the worldwide pandemic. We don't think those kinds of situations can be traced. Why is that? Because in our paradigm of this house, existing patterns actually activate new technology or methods in the first place. That is why we think this should be treated as a special thing. "}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "So, let me compare the two perspectives. First of all, the motivation. Even in the short term or long term, we think our side is outweighed. Because, as my partner already mentioned, even if this is an existing pattern, still, a lot of companies can utilize those kind of methods. More than that, companies have the motivation to recover a lot of investigations. "}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "But in their paradigm of this house, they try to hinder such kind of information, or more than that, they try to replace other kinds of investigations, not related to such kind of pandemic or crucial diseases in the worldwide. So, lastly, we shouldn't decide arbitrarily what kind of diseases should be solved. So, that's what we have to do."}]}
