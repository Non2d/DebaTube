We think we find the big contraction from this contradiction from the side of the house because they never explained how to adjust in their counter model. They will adjust the patent or something like that, but how they decide the price or something like that? It's completely unbiased and unclear and that's why we think it's out of this space. It's very big due to theirs. "}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "Their explanation and the meeting if we think of the so we say we think the motivation itself are that this device the same thing? We think we as my father will tell you there are a lot of alternative incentive for that kind of Cooperation and even if the disincentivization to some extent happen winning is still the benefit I said even if we think feel that the incentive of cooperation will remain and that's why we think the development of Our paradigm explanation is much better. "}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "Yeah, I'm gonna talk about two issues. Let me talk about motivation. Secondly, let me talk about the principle model. "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "Before that, let me talk about rebuttal. So they, the DL, will try to say and why? So they ask them why only during the pandemic or something like that. But let me talk about what is the difference between the normal situation and the pandemic is very clear, right? Because that is a very short time and it suddenly happens, right? We think so in normal situation where we can use, for example, the genetic medicine, for example, can be available and it is a better fight. So in several cases and that's why we have a lot of all parties. But in emergency cases in pandemic cases, we don't have any time to wait to generate, for example. We think because that is especially in the emergency cases, we think we should open a release."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "Yeah, let me talk about motivation. They said I think we can share the pattern. So as I put it out their counterfactual is very big in this process, right? Because they said they have the choice corporation still have the choice to hinder or that kind of thing. "}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "But at the same time, they say that they will force the adjuster according to their model. But we think how if we think of the how they adjust the prices of opening the patent, for example. Yeah, probably they're gonna be the pressurization by the society. For example, Yeah, you should do that because you are the big corporation you owe it. There is kind of CSR or that kind of thing, right? And also probably they will, also if we think of the incentive of the government who will restrict or who will adjust the prices of patent, etc, etc. Probably they will cater to the population, right? If the population or the situation in the society, we think about we need the vaccination because that is very important It should be open or that kind of thing, probably they will cater to the population. That means that even in their patent, probably Yeah, so their argument is completely not mutually exclusive to some extent."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "And moreover, we think So And notice that they said, how to say, yeah, yes We have to share but the sharing the information itself means that not only means that you have to share your own information But at the same time you can use other corporation information, right? That brings us the very good argument that my partner tell you, right? Then that real position tries to say that this incentive will happen But they're gonna be still the benefit, right? For example, the reputation is gonna be improved if they can make the first vaccination to the COVID, right? They talk about the case of the Moderna, for example, right? "}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "So if that is true, even if they do not have the patent to some extent, making the vaccination itself The fact itself is enough fact to prove the power of Moderna, for example, the certain corporations. And that means that Investors anyway have the incentive to do that because they have the power to make such kind of wonderful Vaccination, for example, right? In that kind of moment, we think still they're gonna be the benefit for the corporation."}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "<POI> With or without pandemic, every single medical product to some extent save life and somehow critical for some people. Do you also think a multiple corporation should release other type of medical patents such as medical medicine for diabetes or cancer? "}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "It depends, right? Because they Firstly, that is not a mutual exclusive because how they try to deal with that kind of problem is a very unclear process But moreover, we think that they also said adjust, right? It is the same thing So we will we have to think about the benefit of the corporation. But also the situation in society We have to balance that kind of thing If we think of that kind of thing, we think in this pandemic case, we should release that kind of patent."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "Then they also try to talk about so that they're not gonna develop and it is very unclear that whether they're gonna be the necessity to that kind of medicine. That's why they're gonna refrain from making it. But because for example, as my partner also told you, because they have the connection with government, right? They are very known about the lobbying, for example in America In that kind of movement, that is the reason why the Japanese government is requiring three times the vaccination in Japan. In that kind of movement, we think they can maintain the necessity of their development. For that kind of thing that means that they still have the incentive to do that. "}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "And also notice that they are going to be the pressurization by the society, right? Because you dominate a lot of the information, you dominate a lot of the patents, etc, etc. Then they're gonna pressurize you. Why don't you do that?"}, {"start": 412.0, "end": 413.0, "text": "The conclusion here is even if this incentivization is to some extent true. Still they are going to be the benefit for starting kind of their corporation. And once they make new medicine and release the patent, as my partner told you, there are no restrictions from their side of the house, that's development advance, right? For example, because of the competition within the corporation, right? For example, they try to make the vaccination with lighters, high-definition, that kind of things can easily happen."}, {"start": 413.0, "end": 414.0, "text": "Then let me talk about the principle. Firstly, their principle is very general to some extent, right? Because they just talk about how the patent is important. But they never ever explain why that is unique to the pandemic case in the first place, right? "}, {"start": 414.0, "end": 415.0, "text": "But moreover, secondly, they're based on the exploit. So moreover, we can mitigate the damage of that kind of things that they try to talk about, because not all patents are going to be released in our paradigm As my partner clearly told you in the model, just that it's related to the COVID or the pandemic cases, right? In that kind of moment, their case, principle case, is also not unique in the first place and not important in this way. So for these reasons, we think that we can, yeah We can, in the pandemic cases, we can save more people in our paradigm. That's why we propose."}]}
