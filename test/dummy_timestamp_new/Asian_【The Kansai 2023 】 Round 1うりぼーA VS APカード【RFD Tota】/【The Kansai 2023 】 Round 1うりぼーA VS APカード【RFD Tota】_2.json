In order to prove without this policy, malicious utilization of the patent will happen, and they dominate profit by excluding small corporations or venture corporations who have the potential to produce that important medicine or technology as much as possible on their side of the house, which means their counterproposal is too soft to prevent this policy. "}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "We see in the status quo, those large corporations strongly exclude venture corporations or startup corporations on their side of the house. We see large corporations try to purchase the patent, which venture corporations or small corporations also have in the status quo. Therefore, those new important technologies or knowledge will be dominated by large corporations on their side of the house. Also, we see, evergreen, once their patent will be expired, large corporations try to introduce similar patents in order to perpetuate this unfair social structure for the small or venture corporations. Therefore, other consequences, those technologies, medicine, will be totally dominated, and malicious utilization of the patent will happen on their side of the house. "}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Why do you see this actually happen? It's very simple. Because corporations, large corporations, are inherently short-sighted because they have to cater to the interests of the shareholders. We see in the case of the breach of trust, we look at the case of the British. Shareholders can cause lawsuits against a company as long as corporations don't take action to maximize their benefit if they don't cater to the profit of the shareholders. That's why those malicious utilizations strongly happen without a disposal under the model. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "Opposition may say, hey, those corporations have a natural incentive to care about reputation, et cetera. That's why those malicious utilizations are unlikely to happen, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely because, as I already talked to you, corporations are inherently short-sighted and profit-seeking. Therefore, the malicious utilization are likely to happen on their side of the house. "}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "And also, what we got from side of the opposition is that under our model, this incentivization to research and development could happen, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely in the first place. Because when it comes to the pandemic, when it comes to the pharmacy, obviously, large demands strongly exist. In the case of COVID-19, many people try to vaccinate or utilize medicine again and again. For example, in Japan, at least three times, those people have to utilize. Therefore, even if large corporations lose the patent, anyway, those corporations have a natural incentive to enter the industry of the pharmacy, and so they have a natural incentive to commit the research and the development to begin with. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "And secondly, especially when it comes to the pharmacy, their products directly connecting to the reputation, increasing reputation, because their products directly connecting, like saving life, saving precious life. Therefore, if their knowledge of technology will be compromised because of this policy, still those corporations have a natural incentive to enter their industry to begin with. "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "And also, we tell you, disincentivization rather happens on their side of the house. Because, as I already talked to you, many of the technology or medicine will be taught to be dominated by the large corporations, right? Once a venture corporation or small corporation, even if a small corporation or venture corporation tries to opt into that industry, their knowledge, their technology, are totally dominated by the large corporations. Therefore, those corporations who have less financial capacity lose incentive to enter this industry more and more on their side of the house. But before that, yes. "}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "<POI> I understand to some extent, there is a huge demand for medication during the pandemic. But by releasing patent and thousands of companies actually started selling the same products, which is not actually profitable, how still your side of the pharmaceutical corporation has a massive incentive for innovation? "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "Obviously, even if the patent will be disclosed to the public, for example, as my partner already talked to you, each corporation has their own strong point, right? For example, like a specific knowledge, like a corporation A has a specific knowledge of A, corporation B has a specific knowledge of B, or et cetera, et cetera. Therefore, yes, we can see an important basis of the medicine or important basis of the technology are shared by every single corporation. However, another corporation can put additional benefit or additional functionality of the technology or medicine or those kind of things. Therefore, by doing so, each corporation easily differentiates each other. Therefore, those corporations still can gain the benefit on our side of the house. And also we think what we got from their side of the house, like the invasion of the right of the corporation. "}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "But I think, as I already talked to you, when it comes to the pandemic, especially many dying right now, the right of the corporation should be compromised in order to maximize the potential of the corporation to begin with. Because as I already talked to you, those corporations are strongly blocked by the larger corporation in the status quo. Therefore, in terms of corporate social responsibility, I think their rights should be compromised to begin with. Therefore, we think we have to propose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Thank you. \n"}]}
