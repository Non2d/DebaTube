Number one, I will deeply examine the practical consequences, which can actually save more people by encouragement of the medical innovation. Second of all, I will look at the principal argument. Is that actually patent as property, right? It can be compromised in this specific occasion, as governments say, or still we need to preserve it. "}, {"start": 601.0, "end": 602.0, "text": "So let's move on to the first issue about the practical consequences. So actually, let's move on the important question. That's actually government side of pharmaceutical corporation still have motivation for keep investing the research and development of the medical sphere. So we are saying as an opposition, so patent is critically important to create sustainable money, which can be paid off by their important research development fee. So on this point, government say three things. "}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "Number one, so opposition stance also kills medical motivations, right? Because we are also, sometimes it's necessary, we also obligatory introduce license system to avoid a dominance and a fee, which is actually adjusted by government side. So what we are saying from position is this stance is the best compromisation to be able to coexist the medical corporation's motivations and also property rights over the patent, right? "}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "And also, government is actually not decide the unacceptably extremely cheaper price. So government is, of course, to calculate how much is actually acceptable by looking into the cost that pharmaceutical corporation invest on. And of course, they would like to consider the benefit from this patent. That's why the price isn't extremely low and is going to be adjusted. This is the nuance of adjusted price. That's why the still pharmaceutical corporation have massive incentive to keep investing. "}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "And also they say, even in the consequences without a patent, still this kind of vaccination is needed and demand is high. That's why those corporations still have motivation to keep innovating, right? So, but the price is completely different from just a selling one shot of vaccination or medication, which can be priced as 1,000 yen or something like that, versus the patent, which can be sold 1,000,000 yen to a specific corporation. "}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "And we think this 1,000,000 yen is a very important price for this kind of pharmaceutical corporation. So to be able to pay off their cost, which is actually very expensive, human risk in hiring important scientists or engineering team or investing in their machine or mathematical model, right? And of course, this kind of 1,000,000 yen or 2,000% of the very seemingly expensive for public people is still accessible if other pharmaceutical corporation has massive incentive to take advantage of the patent, right? "}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "And other point, they say, that many corporation is going to, other thing we like to say, other corporation is, of course, going to take a free ride, this kind of patent. And this kind of market is going to be certainly red ocean, right? That's why, usually, the free riding is, of course, cheaper in terms of cost of performance. And no other pharmaceutical corporation has the first winner. So that's why, in terms of motivation, unfortunately, their side cannot win. "}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "So moving on to the principal case. So first of all, unfortunately, they never, ever cut the principal importance of fundamental patent as property right in the first place. And they're just saying this is kind of emergency situation. But things like emergency does not justify every single act to limit the human right and also corporation right, as Takai-san say. That's why, in the case of general principal level, we also win. That's why we shouldn't allow government abusive status. "}]}
