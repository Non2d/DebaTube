Patent right has proven to be a powerful engine of innovation, driving progress and fostering unprecedented technological advancement. On this side of the government, unfortunately, disincentivized pharmaceutical corporations not to innovate this kind of important vaccination or medication during times of economic. That's why, unfortunately, from the perspective of practical consequences, the more people will not be able to medicate it, unfortunately. And in the principal consequences, unfortunately, today's government is unfortunately invading the important property rights of the patent. "}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "I have three things to tell you. Number one, I will explain the counter model as opposition. And number two, I will explain the principle argument and why the patent should work as important property right and why government shouldn't invade it. And number three, I will talk about today's government, unfortunately, disincentivizing the medical innovation. And the more people is going to die in their power. "}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So let's move on to the first issue about the model. So first of all, I'm going to support that, of course, the status quo situation, right? So pharmaceutical corporation still has a patent. And so the other company wants to use the technology for a patent. Of course, they need to pay to some extent of money for the corporation. "}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "So number two, and we are very happy to compromise, to introduce license fee to obligatory that kind of the Western pharmaceutical corporation needs to accept a release to some extent of patent with a significant amount of fee. And even if this fee is unacceptable or the sky-high expensive and other corporations not actually accessible, we can, of course, adjust the amount of fee to the acceptable one. So this is the best compromise I can do. "}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "And more than that, we are, of course, very happy to subsidize those medical corporations to actually harsh the development of medical medicine or vaccination. We'll be happy to enhancement of the investment or lending. So this is our model. "}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "So let's move on to the first issue in terms of principle level of the patent, why it has to work as important property, right? So we need to admit Western pharmaceutical company patent as very important as a property, right? So forcing the pharmaceutical corporation to release the patent is invasion of their property, right? So why is that? Because they actually made a lot of effort for many two reasons. "}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "Of course, they are the only one spend so much cost, right? So they, of course, invest on the lab. They develop machine or mathematical model. They, of course, invest massive amount of human resources, hiring outstanding scientists or engineering members and so on, which is a unique effort that other corporation is not doing. That's why they can reach out to the development and they can get patent. "}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "And number two, of course, they spend so much time to develop this kind of patent, right? And this is not a short-term effort. They actually use the technology for a long time and they develop this kind of patent with spending so much long-term perspective, such as 5 to 10 years or not only just a few months, a few days, right? So this kind of consistent effort time and the cost is an important reason. So the result that they develop can actually reach the good innovation, such as effective vaccination, such as mask to eliminate molecule of COVID, such as good medication against the pandemic, like flu, influenza, or so forth, right? "}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "So those all medical development, it's all attributed from corporation's effort, hoping their sustainable profit as a form of patent, right? So government actually ignore this kind of effort and certainly they set the arbitral criteria of emergence and this kind of situation is not acceptable. "}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "Before moving on any... Okay, let's move on to... So analogy of this, why this is not acceptable is, of course, the first would be, so even if there's any scarcity, even if there's any shortage of food or on this kind of situation, of course, government cannot certainly say they're going to nationalize the food factory or food industry, right? Even if the AI development is actually raising and probably this unlock their many trouble in the world, of course, we cannot force AI corporations such as just GPT or Microsoft to release their patent related to AI industry, right? So we are not saying that because we admit the importance of property, right? "}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "So let's move on to the second issue about decentralization of innovation. So of course, as I said, to develop this kind of medical products, it costs actually a lot, right? So like I say, they need to invest a lot and they need to develop their unique mathematical model or something like this, right? And also they are not actually certain whether or not this kind of medication is actually going to be needed in the future because it's very uncertain whether or not the development of the current medicine is going to be effective in the future or whether or not actually another pandemic will come in the future. They can also assess that."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "But as long as there's the patent to create a sustainable money for company, that's why they have actually massive motivation to keep innovating and investing these kinds of products. So for example, in the case of pandemic, of course, vaccine and medicines demand increase. That's a lot of corporation wants to develop effective products. And if one company developing the outstanding product, of course, other corporation is also wants to use the patent to get the technology and they can also have massive incentive to sophisticate the product with the patent, right? That's why this kind of patent is actually important key essence to unlock difficulty of innovating medication. "}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "What's going to happen in after plan? First of all, of course, there's very few profit for pharmaceutical corporation. It's not a profitable situation at all, right? So that's why the research and development fee is going to be cut for this kind of corporation. That's why the important, for example, the medication against the COVID or flu is also going to be cut when they're going to probably move to other industry, such as just the investing on generic medication, which can be effective but not critical for the COVID situation. This kind to save more people, to preserve principle importance of patent."}]}
