What we got from their side of the house, like invasion of the property, etc, etc, but on the other hand, they say they are happy to make property be low, to guarantee the accessibility, etc, etc. I don't think to what extent property rights should be respected, because of their contradictory stance.

What we got from their side of the house, well, some venture corporation like Moderna actually succeeded, etc, etc. But what they try to do is just pick up a useful case, a comfortable case for government opposition. To begin with, they didn't explain in any logic how the relatively vulnerable corporation, like the venture corporation, can override the domination by the large corporation, which government side constantly indicated from the very beginning. "}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "But let's look at their case. What we got from their side of the house is that invasion of the property, right? Like opposition side tried to say, well, government side didn't explain to what extent corporation rights should be compromised, even in emergency cases, etc, etc. But that case, that indication can be set for government side as well, because opposition side, in general, tried to say property rights should be protected, etc, etc. "}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "But they also didn't explain to what extent patent in emergency case, in this motion, particularly important as well. That's why this claim is not mutually exclusive. Yes, we can see government side didn't do well, but on the other hand, opposition side also didn't do well. Therefore, that cannot be the metric to choose which side we win. And also, their argument are completely example-based to begin with, analogy-based to begin with, because maybe opposition will give us logic, but it's too late.

One, this industry have a huge demand to begin with.

Therefore, we think this motion should be judged in terms of a practical manner, whether or not the profit of the corporation are suddenly devastated by taking this motion to begin with. But government side strongly tell you disincentivization are less likely to happen, and because of this motion, competition and research and development will be faster. As a consequence, we can save the people as much as possible. Therefore, we next vote."}]}
