Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal for individual rebuttal for those previous speakers."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "Their argument was like they said that first it's really difficult for it to completely ban and radicalization will be given in today's society. But we believe this is not true because, as we insisted in those POI and as we insisted in constructive arguments, we said that those regulations will make those radical scenes like ban and we believe those in this society like those scenes are now not given, right? "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "Moreover, what the second speaker talked about was that norms will be given and those women's dignity will be taken in those societies. But this is not true because most of those radicalized, for example, those rape porn, it's mostly people know about it's entertainment, people know that it's just entertainment and not like real radicalization or real rape. We believe every people know about that, and we believe this is not a big issue we have to talk about in today's debate."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "Moving on to my clash points, one which will respect these actresses. Government side talked about it will just have a really bad environment for those kinds of people and actress care will collapse. But we believe this is not true. Opposition side will clearly claim that the most quickly that can move is those private companies, right? The quickness is really different. Companies can really quickly move for moving for those actresses, and when those problems will be provided, they can have a solution, right? Moreover, the point we wanted to push is those actress care. Actress care is not about those HIV or those kinds of diseases. We believe mental care should be the most priority. In our side of the house, we can accomplish that."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "So, the last point, the last clash, how entertainment should be. Government will restrict radical scenes, they'll restrict every scene, and the country will control that. But compared to opposition, we will restrict just minimum restriction. We will make a regulation. What we want to push is those entertainment, the company mostly knows about those consumers, right? We believe those porn industry should be shown as entertainment, and humans should be looking at those porn industry as entertainment and fun. For these reasons, we are proud to oppose."}]}
