Firstly, in the status quo, the privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. And secondly, in this policy, it decreases the radicalization of the sex culture and saves many porn actresses. Thirdly, in the comparison, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes a diversified satisfaction of the particular target, the state doesn't prioritize these people. Also, we have to prioritize to save the porn culture."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "So, before that, there are several models to our side of the house. Firstly, we ban all forms of the private porn industry, such as porn videos and porn websites and sex stories and so forth. And the discontent of the porn things by the state only makes it conscious of the not illegal things, not so immoral things, such as sex with the child or sex with the drug and so forth. These kinds of illegal or immoral things are never made by the state. That is the stance from our side of the house."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Moving on to my substantial. The privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. In the status quo, due to the diversity of the privatization of the porn industry, many corporations want to make the profit. And they make many diversified videos, such as the rape video and the pedophilia video and these kinds of immoral videos and so forth. Why is that? The reason is very simple. Basically, the profit-seekers want to get the profit by the many numbers of people. Because if they just focus on the particular target, this profit is not maximized in the first place. That's the reason why the profit-seekers, in order to maximize the profit, they also make these very diversified videos.

What do you think about that?"}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "Firstly, it's impossible to completely supervise this porn industry. Because if the state also makes the right to make this porn industry, some porn industries also make these illegal things. If an illegal thing is banned in the aftermath, that data is at least spread in some terms. That's why the most important thing is that preemptively we don't make that kind of thing. That's the reason why that solution is only nationalized by the porn industry. Secondly, we are talking about why this privatization of this porn industry makes harm to the porn actors."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "Now, this porn industry, there are many numbers of porn industry. Also, there are many people who want to be porn actors. That's why the value of the porn actors is decreasing now in the past. Because if some people criticize this corporation, our wage is very low. That time, corporations easily cut off these porn actors because there are a number of unacceptable people in the past. Now, these porn actors also have to work with a very hard environment. For example, there are very bad environments without their guardians. That's the reason why in the status quo, it's very harmful to these porn actors."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "Secondly, why did this policy decrease the many radicalization of the sex culture and saving these many actors? Because now, the supervisor is the state. That's why the state never makes this violent content. Because if the state makes the violent content, this criticism is very large compared to this private industry. Because also, many of the citizens, many of the stakeholders, are always supervised by the state itself. That's why states also don't have the possibility to make violent content in the past. That's why compared to the status quo, we can only make moderate content of the porn industry. "}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "Secondly, also we can guarantee the value of the porn actors. Because also, the state is not a profit seeker, and also they have much money compared to the private industry. That's why also the state can't guarantee good environment for these porn actors. That's why if these porn actors become the disease, also the state can't guarantee to go to the hospital. Also, they can't save the future of the porn actors. That's the reason why compared to the status quo, this environment of the porn actors is very good in the first place. That's why this policy can decrease the radicalization of the sex culture to save the porn actors."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "Finally, in the conclusion, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes the diversity and the satisfaction of the particular target, why the state doesn't privatize them? This is a valid judgment. We think that also the state also has to maximize the people's happiness and satisfaction. But in the status quo, some number of these porn videos also make the next harm to other people, or make the victim in the past. Because in the existence of the rape video, in the existence of the pedophilia video, some number of people see it, and after that, they mimic this video in the first place. And after the mimicking, they also upload this video to the porn website, for example, Poisonous or something, in the first place.

That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that, compared to the satisfaction of the variety of types of people, to protect the sex culture and protect the sex actors is very important. For those reasons, we are proud to support Poison."}]}
