We simply do not understand why the single-handed most powerful authority of a nation, which is the state, cannot uphold the burden in comparison to a couple of small companies. I'm going to prove to you three things in my speech. First, I'm going to prove to you why, like, according to their, like, um, given the analysis they said, why our side can achieve that much better. Secondly, I'm going to be talking upon, like, their talk about entertainment and why that could be limited. And thirdly, I'm going to be talking to you why our side can uniquely protect the dignity of these actresses."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "First, a couple of refutations. They said, uh, the LO came up here and said that, uh, that, like, these companies can provide care for actors. We say and we concede that this is true, but this is only true only on a surface level. We think that in cases of big companies, they might have the financial, like, opportunity to look after these actresses. But I, I would argue that these small companies are not equally capable of looking after these kind of actresses. We think in the majority of time in, um, in order to like seek the maximum profit, we think they're more likely to abuse. They're more likely to exploit and go to radical videos like rape, which can gather a lot of money by a lot of extremists. We think upon this, we think that our side, when you nationalize this industry, you're able to provide more care for actors because you ensure that there's going to be a sustainable environment. You ensure that there's not going to be no legal behavior and you allow these actresses always a system to opt out by going to court instead of engaging in potentially illegal behavior by small companies."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "Second rebuttal is upon their point about producers. They said that, uh, these companies have a lot of like experts. First, we don't simply understand why our side can't have producers. We think that our side can unilaterally have a lot of producers and a lot of experts and a lot of health professionals that are hired by the state. We think that's not really important. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "But secondly is I think their side is gonna have the likelihood of having producers who like, who could actually like abuse these actresses based on like holding like access to some of the weaknesses and threatened to exploit their kind of weaknesses and to like lure them into like more extreme behavior. I think that kind of like extreme cases will decrease on our side because you're now going to have producers who are controlled and like made, like, monitored by the single hand, most powerful authority in the nation that therefore we say that our side can provide a safe, better, safer, and a better, more expert controlled kind of environment."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "Given that I'm going to prove to you why entertainment can be limited to some extent. They said that, Hey, you need to care about consumer needs that this porn industry is very likely entertainment. We agree that the porn industry is entertainment, but we disagree upon like the point where we say that in the case where some videos cross the line of like legality, we think that that is extent where the government can intervene. We agree that entertainment is like guaranteed in the case of like soft sex of like just having any kind of sexual intercourse. But we think that there's a clear difference between allowing rape and bestiality and pedophilic videos and, and calling that entertainment. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "I think there's two problems. First is that we think that at the borderline where you cross what the like state like allows and organizes, we think that is the extent where it is not entertainment. I think that is like just breaking the law and using it to try to incite the behavior of potential criminals in the future. We think that these kind of videos legitimize these extreme views and we think that is not entertainment. We think that is a form that should be controlled by the government."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "Given that, why does our side save the dignity of women actors? And I'm going to improve the story of why our side is going to just be better or make a better society overall. We think that the porn industry is different from other like industries like movies and theaters because we think that there's a unique difference because we think the sexual images and sexual depiction is, is able to cause and affect attitudes more perniciously. Why is it so? Because we think that the way we view other genders is constructed by the kinds of sexual imagery that is propagated in mass media. That's why in the case of porn, in the porn industry, we think that in order for, in order to generate profit, companies make titles like, hey, for instance, if it's a woman rape, this woman like rolling their eyes, any kind of extreme values that dehumanizes the expression of women."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "We think the privatization, um, we think there's three effects the privatization companies does. First is that this constructs bad norms where women are being treated as a sexual object. We think that LO just said that, hey, we, we regulate this, but we think in the status quo, that's not really true. And we think companies don't have an incentive to control it, anything because that means that's going to mean less profit. "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "Secondly, is it promotes particular body norms. So then you're going to have like really super attractive blonde, big boob girls. We think that those kinds of stakes are going to be reinforced for the sake of profit. We think that the audience can be like very attracted to those unrealistic behavior. And we think that's going to lead to very unhealthy images."}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "But thirdly, as I said earlier, there's no incentive for these private companies to shut out videos. Two reasons. First is because there's a lot of amateur videos, which are unregulated by these companies in the first place. Right. "}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "But secondly, is that there won't be any kind of profit once you take away these kind of rape or extreme videos. That's literally the reason why these kinds of regulations have failed in the past. "}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "We think that given these three effects, there's an, we think the privatization does like create a bad thing, which, um, dehumanizes the dignity of women. How do we combat this through nationalization? It's that we say that the porn industry is when you nationalize something, it is the manifestation of the government's thoughts. That's why we think when our side is able to nationalize and prevent any kind of, well, like amateur video to go out, we've confined the imagery to a very restricted and controlled. We think that the States can like enforce regulations and what's acceptable and what's not much better than a, what a small company can do. We think that when you control a certain pool and shut out everything else, there's going to be four, three effects. "}, {"start": 212.0, "end": 213.0, "text": "First, so you can, for instance, it's going to be easier to enforce the uses of condoms and contraception to women. Secondly, is that we can ban child, child, um, child rape scenes, uh, child porn scenes or like rape scenes in general, because I don't think that the government would want those kinds of images to go out. And thirdly, is that you're going to make sure and restrict having kids access to this private companies who really don't really care about kids watching it, because that just means it's going to be more profit given that I think the profit can be mitigated for the sake of protecting, um, these actual workers for this. We think the entertainment can be diminished and we want to combat the truth."}]}
