The question of this debate, we clarify the question of this debate. Oppositional side said, A, they strongly regulate the content and B, they invest in the porn industry from the government. But if so, what is the exclusivity compared to the government bench? Because even without regulation, even without investigation, also the government can make this content in the first place. And if they strongly regulate, also they don't achieve their goal. Because they are very limited of the diversity in the first place. That's why their argumentation is false. The key, the opposition argument is said."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "So, given that, what is the sole plus point in this debate? Firstly, which side is the larger possibility to decrease the abusement of the porn industry? And secondly, whether we need to satisfy the many consumers by this diversity content? "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "So firstly, which side has the larger possibility to decrease the abusement? They said regulation is enough. But we told you three things. Firstly, the state can't always supervise each corporation. Because there are many members of the corporation and this content itself, making content itself is very black box. And the state can't supervise. "}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "And secondly, B, the diplomats already said, this borderline illegal content and immoral content is very, very vague. That's why it's very difficult to limit preemptively. Once it was made, the Prime Minister already told you that. This video is very easily spread. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "And it's also, this content dehumanized the female. And it's directly make the bad harm into the society. That's the reason why this preemptive measure is very important. That exclusivity is only remain from the government."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "And secondly, so they said, entertainment is not always guaranteed by the private corporation. But we told you that this entertainment is not so important compared to the harm. That argument is, I'm saying from the second point. So whether we need to satisfy the many consumers. So they are afraid of the decline of the entertainment of the quality. Because they say, this corporation always hire this professional producer. But the Prime Minister already said that. Also, it's not a mutual exclusion. Because states also have, also hire this professional producer under the status of supervision. This only excluded is the risk of this bad content in the past years. That's why, as long as this professional producer exists inside. This is not so mutual exclusive. And it doesn't mean, it means this opposition's argument is not stand in the first place."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "So secondly, we already did the comparison of the diversity of the entertainment and the safety of the society. Opposition side always prioritizes the diversity of the entertainment to satisfy the many numbers of the people. But we already told you that. This satisfaction is not important compared to the increasing of the victim. Because if once this video is spread, and many numbers of the violent action also possibly occur. For example, the mimic of the violent content such as the rape, and such a beast, and the upload of poltergeist. So that kind of the violent action is also comparatively occur to the opposition's bench. That's the reason why, if as long as the victim is not saved by the opposition's bench. We don't prioritize this diversity of the entertainment. For those reasons, we proudly propose the motion."}]}
