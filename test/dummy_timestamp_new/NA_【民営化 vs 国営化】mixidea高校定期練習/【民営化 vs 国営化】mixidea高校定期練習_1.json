Um, so, like, in theirs of the house, they talked about that those radicalization is going to like given in porn industry, and it's going to make like these porn industry, like as a, like coercive situation, but we believe this is not true because in the status quo, we can see like lots of restriction that is given, like, such as like, if there's child like abuse, like child porn, like mostly, there's like such regulation that, like, restricts like child abuse.

And for those actress, they have lots of,  care, for example, like having pill or having condoms for like those kind of people.

So we believe, um, firstly, let me make a clear analysis of what is porn industry. Two points, right? One, it's about producer, and two about like consumers, right? So, one, let me talk about like those producer, right? Um, like, let me have like, like rebuttal, like concluding in like my argument, right?

But we believe privatization is the most best solution we have to take, right? Because those producer of like those company are the experts, right? They know about like those actress, right? They did like long time like investigation in like those porn, like, um, actress, right? Why? The reason is really simple, right? His experience is like really different, right? Porn industry was given from like several decades, right? Like many decades, and the company knows about those producer, or those actress, that like which, like, um, like which like method is good, or how we can like have like, like those care of like those actress, right?

Like, that will be like, connecting to my like, second point, right? Those consumers, right? We believe consumers' needs are the important part, right? We have to talk about and guarantee about like those kind of consumers, right? So, like, if we see like those porn industry, like most of the time, like it's entertainment, right? We have to make happiness in those kind of porn industry, right? It's like same as like, for example, like movies, for example, like animation, right? It's same category that is given in like those kind of things, and we believe consumers' needs are important part, right? So, like, maybe like radicalization will be given, and radicalization will be happening in like those kind of adult videos, or like those kind of things, but we believe those radicalization is just an entertainment, right? We are like keeping on for pushing like those entertainment for like those each individual, right?"}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "So, moving on to my second point, what is going to happen by like, um, taking, right, like comparing the government side and opposition side, right? We believe government side is like now having a big failure, right? Having a failure, which they're talking about that, um, the country will, or the state will, like, keep having a good, like, environment for like those consumers and for like those actors, right? But we believe this is not true, right? The country is not like experts, right? They don't know about what is happening, or what is the consumer's feelings, or what is the actor's feelings, right? So, they can, like, appropriately, like, make porn interesting in today's society, so our side will provide, like, more, like, like, more, like, suitable way for consumers and for, like, producers, so these are reasons why we're positive."}]}
