There are three differences. First of all, the people who do jewels know probably they might be killed, right? Because a murderer kills somebody thinking they won't be killed the next day or something like that. So this is the first difference. The next difference is that both have a clear aim to fight. This is because the first speaker has said that there is mutual consent before they go to do duels. So and then the third difference is they do it for themselves and have a strong will for each other. They have a strong will, and I'll talk about it later too, but they have strong wills to fight others. So they have the will to kill by the fight. And this is the difference. So I would like to move on to the rebuttal."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "The opposition side has said mafias do pressure to the member of the gang or something like that. So people who do jewels might be the member of a gangster or etc. So they might have pressure from mafias. But we have two rebuttals. First of all, they will have preceding to do that, as the first speaker has explained at the definition.

So the government will do the research. What are the aims to do duels? These examples are maybe not a good aim to fight. So maybe the government will research about that. Maybe like you cannot do the duel. "}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "And next, we would like to rebut to informed consent. So why this is not true, because they have that risk that the winner says him or herself about he's a bad guy or something like that to fight with. So they have well that like others can say anything about that if he or she loses. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "So I would like to move on to the reconstruction. And they also talk about our second argument and about changing society. So we think that changing, they said if we don't take this motion, we can have less harm. But nowadays, there are many murders. There are many murders to kill someone. But we think that we can reduce the crime by murder because they can reflect their minds by doing duels. This can be a point that can reduce the number of people who don't want to be killed by someone. So this is a benefit for our side."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "So our first argument about our argument was the initial hate. We can respect individual hate and do the drills. So they have rights. And if we don't take this motion, is it difficult to fulfill? Not like difficult to fulfill, right? So if we take this motion, we can reflect their minds that by not being arrested or not illegal, and this is the only choice to reflect their feeling and suffer."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "So next, I would like to talk about it is okay to urge ways to do duels that the government urges ways to do duels. So this is necessary to save the choice that respects the individual. So these drills give people the reflection, right? This means that the government can pursue their freedom. So the government has the responsibility to make options for people to make them happy or make freedom."}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "So maybe they might say mutual contents are not good because not good or like they cannot find the people who have pressure from others. But recently, we had lots of information to research everything, even if it's the information of gangs or other secret organizations. By this research, we can prevent fights that people do drills by tops pressure, tops, or mafia's pressure. So for these reasons, we would like to strongly propose the motion. Thank you."}]}
