Even now, you're prohibited to use hard drugs or take euthanasia by the law of government, right? Well, I know that there may be some stresses because you cannot take those choices, the individual choices, but we we're prohibiting for these things for several reasons. "}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "One is that these things, like the personal lives, are the precious and are the are never going going back or recover after you lose it once. If you lose your life once, you dismiss that your life is not going to be go back again, and if these things are going to dumb by like irrational choices, we think that is very harmful. "}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "However, the government, even there's some kind of like governmental control, we cannot like, we cannot regulate all the things. For example, if in the euthanasia, for example, in Belgium, a lot of people die by the irrational choices that, oh, I, because like, for example, I was being unemployed or like other reasons, and because of these irrational reasons, people die or lose their life by these irrational reasons. We say that the government should intervene and and should not allow any kind of thing because we cannot judge and we should stop any kind of thing. And the government duty is it predicts the students from the life from the irrational choices."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "So we say and and now and we think that now it is better than them because we say that in in the present situation, people don't have these kinds of choices, so they're not going to be rationalized and try to kill a something like a murderer who is strong enough like Muhammad or like death hunting even you're going to die or like that. We think that these things are just going to sacrifice more people of them in the studies and we think that it's unjust, unjust."}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "Secondly, we're going to say that the radicalization in the study is going to happen, and so we are going to prohibit from what is. So we we say that if the government is going to legalize this means the government is going to publicly say it is okay to do like these are like dueling to the death"}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "And the students will say that, oh, these things, these dueling to the death, is a good thing or in the study. So what's going to happen is the radicalization is going to happen, for example, if you if you have some some kind of like choices these choices are going to have more slippery, so these these things will be extended more people will die."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that the radicalization is going to happen because people want to see it, for example, in in the in the ancient Rome a lot of people died in the coruscant and kill other peoples in there, because people want to see more exciting things. For example, if you're going to see porn movies, people may say that they think it's not fun and do not want to watch it anymore. Porn movies are made to try to make more funny things. For example, more radical porn movie. This is the same kind of thing we say that if you're going to have these kind of things. We think that the individuals are going to see these things as entertainment and people are going to people are going to see them for fun. We think that it is morally out in the first place. "}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "But secondly we say that this is going to have more harm for example the exploitation of the poor peoples because they want to get money or like that we think that these things are going to have more radicalization more and more killing more and more death in the studies and we think the government should not allow it."}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "Third reason is that these kind of like we say that it is legitimate to not allow any kind of thing when the harm overrides the benefit. What is their benefit? They said the benefits that they can do by the duelling to the death is that they can maybe take some kind of like stresses or the desire and they can have some kind of like desires. But firstly this is only a small part of the solvency. We think that this solvency is very low and it's not going to be a fundamental solution. I'd like to talk later. "}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "But secondly we say that that the inter that our harm is going to have more and then comparing with them because firstly the people's life are going to be lost. Secondly, we say the government cannot have like give more like moral things but they're going to have more harmful moral for the individuals in the side and it for the children we think that is harmful surely we say that that radicalization of the people kills kmore people because we say that people will try to try to do these I do willing to do this and more people will die in society we think that it is unjust."}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "Fourth reason is that um the pressure and um we think that this kind of like exploitation by the pressure is going to happen for example and as we told you there are like unwilling deaths by the these families or like other members in in like Belgium where euthanasia is going to be realized and even though there are some steps steps or content the individual. And invisible pressure corrupts people's life try to strive people to go to death. It's going to kill these people."}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "We think that these things are unjustifiable. We say that because these harms are significantly outweighing their the harm and the benefit that they're saying that that they can take those stresses or desire we think that it is unjust."}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "But secondly, we like and we like to talk and we like to talk about why their benefits are not going to work well or it's very small. Alright, firstly, um, firstly, um, we think that their model is not going to work because as we told you the governmental control is not an absolute thing. There are going to be some kind of like individual invisible pressure by the studies set by the families or by others. We think that these things are going to happen."}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "But secondly, if you're going to have a strong ability like Muhammad Adi or like this kind of person and if you are strong enough, we say that you're not going to have like, um, because you're going to not going to have like weapons in the opponent. You say that, um, I'm not going to be killed in some kind of like these kind of do willing to the death. We think that these people cannot have any kind of relevancy. But surely, it is unjustifiable to kill criminals. "}, {"start": 514.0, "end": 515.0, "text": "Before we're going to talk about these kind of like undefiable or not, we say that firstly the criminals, they don't have any kind of like in content or they don't have any kind of incentive to take these kind of willing to the death. We think that there is no benefit for these criminals, right? We say that these things are not going to move well."}, {"start": 515.0, "end": 516.0, "text": "But secondly, we say that, as we told you, the courts should decide these things. For example, we have death penalty. And we think that it is better because you have rehabilitation or like other things. But, and moreover, even after killing or even after you can kill this kind of person, what remains is only an emptiness feeling and more stressive that you cannot put away to others. That is actually why we think that this cannot be the solvency, and our side is better therefore. We are happy to oppose. Thank you."}]}
