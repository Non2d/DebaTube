Killed all your family and in a bloody situation and you can't do anything in those kinds of circumstances. We believe in those kinds of situations, those individuals are suffering from those kinds of coercive situations and they can't relieve their stress, relieve their desire in the student school. What we have to do is as a government, we have to respect like those kinds of people's choices and those kinds of people's desire to have to win to them. These are reasons why we are proud to propose.

So like let me have a three-model for today's debate. One, we are fully respecting choices and having a constant between the people who are doing dueling to death, which is having a prescription that is before having dueling to death and several steps are given by doing as a rule. And we are preventing a forceful situation like such as using dueling to death as a bad thing. So what we are going to do is second, having government control, which government can like access those dueling to death quickly. And as I said in the first, like constant and having several prescription, government is having like those kinds of prescriptions and receiving like those kinds of prescriptions. So as like forceful situation will be given, government will like stop like dueling to death. Thirdly, but most importantly, we're making dueling to death as a fight, as an ability, not like using like those kinds of weapons. And that's all."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "So move on to my argument. One, why we can justify this motion by taking into the society. So like firstly, let me like clarify what is happening in the status quo. In the status quo, no regulation to fight and respect choices and like no regulation for respecting people are given, right? So the reason is because this society is now like neglecting from having a duel and neglecting from killing each other, right? But those kinds of virtue given in today's society is now having a horrible situation for individuals. "}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "<POI> What are the situations when people are willing to duel to death, when they know that like in the 50% possibility, they are going to die? Tell me the context of that, of this debate. "}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "Okay, the context is really simple. Like when like those individuals have a certain like desire that wants to kill like such a person, we're going to respect like those kinds of people. And so if they want to kill someone, like maybe like the opponent side won't be like accepted. But when there's a such like situation, when the opponent side like accepts like those kinds of desire, like we will like have dueling to death. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "But I will like explain that more in my constructive speech, right? So as I showed in the status quo, like those kinds of like government is not like having a certain respectful situation for this society, right? But the problem is in the status quo, there's some individual that have a desire that wants to kill people as a reason to hate people, to wanted to kill people, and wanted to like accomplish their like certain suffer in the status quo, right? For example, like when, as I said in the introduction, when family is killed, like in those kinds of situations, individuals are like now having a certain suffer that they want to kill like the criminals, right? So as an extension of like those kinds of choices, we have to respect like those individuals that want to kill like those criminals, or want to kill like those opponent side. "}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "So what is the reason that these kinds of like criminals or like these kinds of persons who have the high possibility to be killed are going to do these kinds of like dueling to the death? Why is it so? So like we're not saying that like 100% this like dueling to death will be given, but we believe that this motion will like at some like part or at some like point, we can respect and we can like accomplish like those kinds of situations. So for like the conclusion of my like first argument, why we can justify is that we have to respect innocent people that suffer from stress, suffering from like desire that are taken, right? So when like both like choices were now accomplished, and when like those both choices at some like point they like accomplished, we will like take this motion and this is justifiable in today's society. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "So second, like how it will like change this society and respect innocent choices. I have like no time, so I will give it to like my second speaker, but we like strongly believe that this motion will like make like those individuals that couldn't like accomplish this desire in the status quo can like accomplish and we can save those people that can't like pursue like in the status quo. So these are reasons why we're part of it."}]}
