The opposition side said that killing is generally seen as morally wrong, like hate speech. However, hate speech hurts a huge group of people without their consent, and the damage that they get lasts for such a long time. However, duels that apply to this emotion are personal, and the only person whose pride will be hurt is the opponent, who is 100% sure that they have enough ability to have a fair fight, and they know that there won't be abuse or torture. If the opponent knew that they would be abused and tortured, they definitely wouldn't give consent."}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "There was an argument that there would be people who would very likely be forced to fight.
