First, someone has heard it from someone or has a desire to kill someone. For example, if one of the family members is killed by murder, they have a strong desire to kill someone and also have strong hatred for someone. Hatred can't be dealt with in other ways. So, when we face this motion, when we face this situation, we can support this motion. "}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "What is the difference between murder and duels? Murderers are not aware that their actions will lead to someone's death, but duelists are aware that their actions will lead to this. Duels are more justified than murder because we are aware that we are going to duel from now on, and this requires the agreement of both parties. By taking this motion, regrets are never formed because we are aware that this action leads to this exact consequence. So, this is justified, and we are going to move on to reconstruction."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "The first and second speakers said to respect their choice. The government legalized in the constitution clearly states that the country respects the nation's freedom rights, but the government doesn't legalize that people don't die by intentional action. For example, in some countries, assisted suicide is accepted by respecting one's decision to choose this. "}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "I know that this example and duels are truly different because assisted suicide does not involve killing others. But the common point between duels and assisted suicide is that both involve a person with strong will. Respecting one's choice is one of the most important things that the government must make everyone aware of. Even if someone was forced by a strong person, whether to die or not is a personal decision, and this decision cannot be made by others. Whether to die or not is a personal decision, so if they decide to duel to the death, we must respect their choice, and this is the government's responsibility. So, for these reasons, we should take this motion."}]}
