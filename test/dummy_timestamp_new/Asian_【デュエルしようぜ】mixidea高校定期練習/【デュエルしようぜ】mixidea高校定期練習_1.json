So even if the loser has already given consent to the risk, that kind of murder is not something that is justified. And we say that choice is not even possible in practical perspective."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "So firstly, I'll get some responses to the Prime Minister. And then the three things. Firstly, what kind of people opt in dwelling? Secondly, why dwelling is not justified? And thirdly, why legal institutions are better?"}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "So firstly, the idea that the Prime Minister gave you is such a nonsense. So they are practically standing for murder. They said when someone wants to kill someone, we should respect their choices, but we don't see any difference from murder. "}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "And moreover, their main example was the revenge by the families of the victim. We have two responses. So firstly, this is completely out of this debate because as for the criminals, we already have justice system that seeks to the fair punishment for those criminals. And those revenge."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "And so secondly, even if the victim needs to kill the criminal, we don't see any difference from death penalty because if the government wants the criminal to be killed, they can introduce death penalty. And that is better for them because the family of victim won't have to risk their lives to commit their revenge. So their argument falls out of this debate."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "And now we want to my constructs. So firstly, why dueling to death is unjustifiable? We say because the choice to opt in dueling is such an irrational and forced choice. So in order to protect people from dying because of the irrational choice, we should not take this motion. "}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "So three reasons why their choices are irrational. So first of all, but before that, we say the kind of people who want to opt in dueling is the people who have troubles that they don't want to solve in courts. But especially, we think mafias are likely to use dueling as their means to solve problems because mafia is a kind of people who can risk their life in their jobs. So and another example is like people who are fighting for their partners. For example, the two men can fight for a woman and those kind of things are so arbitrary and they don't want to settle in courts."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "So having said that, why those choices are irrational? So firstly, as for mafias, the duelers are pursued by their bosses. Why? Because it is likely that the bosses in the gangs don't want to risk their own lives. So they are likely to force their fellow members to get into dueling. And the fellow member has to do dueling because if they reject their job, they will get killed by their boss. So they'll take risk and they engage in dueling."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "So second of all, the circumstances can force people into dueling. In example that the two men are fighting for one woman, the fight heats up and the woman can say things like, show me your power and now get married with one of you that will win the duel. In this case, the both men will have such pressure and will have practically no choice to not get into dueling and still will make irrational choices."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "And thirdly, there is no informed consent. Think about who will talk about the experience of dueling because the loser will no longer exist in this world anymore. People who are considering dueling will only hear stories from survivors. The survivors might talk about how their problems perfectly solved after experiencing dueling, but they won't talk about, they don't talk about how the victim were suffering or something. So this will lead to possible dealers unseeing their risk."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "And fourthly, people cannot experience being harmed, being injured or being killed because that's because of obvious reason."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "And lastly, why irrational choice is so bad? Because the harms cannot be reversed. That in the dueling, people will die and they are no way to return from this. And also they will have a traumatic experience of seeing someone die or huge injury that will make them impossible to walk for their whole life. And there is no going back before the moment of dueling. So we have to protect those citizens. "}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "And even if the choice is irrational, the government has a moral obligation to protect its people. For example, there is a seat belt law. When people don't put on seat belt, no one will get in trouble except those person, but the government asks people to put on seat belts to protect themselves. So states have the right to protect its people."}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "So second, why legal institutions feel better? So the next speaker will explain about this more in detail, but because of obvious reasons, courts have less harm because in courts, no one will die, obviously. "}, {"start": 114.0, "end": 115.0, "text": "And secondly, this will become a more fundamental solution. Why? Because in dueling, even if we introduce more fair power, people who have more power will live. And this is not something that is justified and the government has to protect especially weak people. Therefore, in order to protect its people, we should not take this motion. Thank you."}]}
