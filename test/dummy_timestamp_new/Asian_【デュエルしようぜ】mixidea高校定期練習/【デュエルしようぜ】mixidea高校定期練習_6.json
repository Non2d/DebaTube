Okay, so we have already told you there is no rational consent and choice execution is available under dueling. And we have told you two reasons. A, because this is oftentimes forced choice. Like we say, the gang member, for example, trouble in partnership is going to be a massive reason for someone to start participating in dueling. And obviously, there is no rational consideration behind that. If gang members, lower-class persons, are forced or told to participate in dueling for financial reasons or land traveling reasons, there is no optional choice to reject that, right? "}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "Partnership reasons are, of course, the same, that if a girl says, I am going to choose someone who won the game, who wins the game. Obviously, two men have no choice to reject, to actively appeal, you are weaker than the other, right? That's why there is no rationally free choice, which is free from forced choice. There is no such a beautiful environment is guaranteed."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "On this point, the government says, in case only this is a good aim, we are going to legalize it. But there is no clarification of the definition. What's the difference between good reason and bad reason? So we reject that definition in the very first places. That's why in the very first step, there is a massively forced choice. So this is invalid."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "And the second one is that they don't know the consequences. That's why they cannot make a rational decision. Government say, because they know the consequences and they concede it to the death, it's okay to legalize it. But we reject that premise in the very first place. Ordinary people don't really know how actually they are going to be hospitalized. What does it mean to break the bones? What does it mean to dysfunctionalize their organ in the dueling in the very first place?

For example, if they are professional boxer or MMA fighter who are really trained well, who already know the pain well, and when they get a professional license, at that moment, they are legalized to fight in the Kurosu-Yodogama Stadium, ladies and gentlemen. That's why in comparison to these kind of ordinary people who don't really know anything, we shouldn't legalize it.

That's why this is not a valid choice."}, {"start": 608.0, "end": 609.0, "text": "Moving on to the solving a problem issue. So I have a few issues here. First of all, this debate is not about whether or not the private punishment by a victim is allowed. This is not the debate, right? So of course, that benefit, all the benefit is not gonna happen when the criminal actually rejects the offer of the dueling in the very first place. That's why the victim does not necessarily have to be satisfied."}, {"start": 609.0, "end": 610.0, "text": "And the second of all, even if they somehow win, even if they somehow win, still it's not good because there is no root cause identification why the criminals happen and what kind of the rationale behind the criminal. And there is no actual compensation in terms of finance or in terms of the imprisonment of the criminal, ladies and gentlemen. So for all these two reasons, we will be happy to vote."}]}
