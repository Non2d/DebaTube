"}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "On the other hand, when the Prime Minister told us that the desire to kill other people is justified and the government needs to respect that, we don't really understand where the criteria are being drawn to begin with. "}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "But second of all, we told you that that criteria in itself is obviously going to be arbitrary. They either have to ban everything or they need to allow individuals to duel to death in any circumstances at the point when the Prime Minister told us that the primary principle why we have to allow it is the desire to kill other people and the rational mindset that they have. When the fight between relationships is due to the rational mindset, as they say, we think that they have to agree in the contextualization that we have provided from the side opposition."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Several independent responses to a side opposition. First of all, they told us they have this desire to kill other people and the government needs to respect that. I'm going to have a substantial why killing other people in itself is morally wrong. But before several independent responses, number one, we tell you that it's completely an unrealistic characterization where many people have this desire to kill other people. You don't often see those people to begin with because your morality in itself is going to pressurize your desire to kill other people. And obviously, I think in the vast majority of cases, people will even think about killing other people as their desires. "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "But second of all, even if you agree to a certain extent that those psychopaths exist under the status quo, those people wouldn't be fulfilled by dueling to death. Because most of the time, those psychopaths' aim is not to kill other people by fighting. Their goal is to batter others, is to abuse others and to torture others with you standing upon the person who you are torturing upon, right? Those cases happen when people sexually assault other people and after that, murder that person. Or those instances come when people use your gun and mass shoot everywhere. That's the desire that those individuals want to have, the desire that you are actually oppressing those individuals and that person cannot even revenge to you. These kinds of emotions are urging them to kill other people and we don't think fighting with other people by fist to fist is going to help their desires to begin with. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "But secondly, they told us that the criminal justice system people, like the victims, want to kill other people, want to kill the perpetrators that killed your family. Several independent responses to that. Number one, we tell you that those murderers are going to be put on justice in the criminal justice system and we don't necessarily think that this is inside the debate to begin with. We think that it's irrelevant. "}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "But secondly, we tell you, even if that is true to a certain extent, we tell you that obviously that perpetrator is not going to agree to the fight where he has the possibility to be killed. I don't know what they are talking about to begin with. We don't think that the benefit that they are talking about is actually going to be tangible."}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "So two things that I'm going to be talking about in my debate. Number one, I'm going to be talking about why the counterfactual on their side is going to be worse off and why the counterfactual is going to be better off on our side of the house. Number two, I'm going to be talking about why killing other people in itself is something morally wrong."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "First of all, talking about why the counterfactual is going to look like. I think that the leader of opposition did a really great job by providing a certain kind of context that we need to debate in this debate, right? These kinds of contexts are like arguing between a relationship or arguing between gangs or financial troubles that happen under the status quo. "}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "So let's look at it one by one. First of all, when it comes to the context of the relationship, I think that it wouldn't be solved in any kind of circumstances to begin with, right? Even if you win by killing or harming other people, the fact that you killed someone and the fact that you harmed the other person is going to force you to have a sense of regret, right? Because in general, in society, it's regarded to kill other people as a morally wrong thing. It is regarded morally wrong to harm other people, right? And I don't think that it's going to change even after taking this motion. The vast majority of citizens are going to think like that, right? And that influences your idea as well. So even if you win that case, even if you get that female, we think that it is not going to make them happy. But rather, like whenever you look at your partner that you have won by dueling to death, you have this sense of regret that you actually have killed that person and that you did something morally wrong that you shouldn't even exist under the society, right? "}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "But secondly, we tell you that when it comes to like financial trouble, we say that the counterfactual is far more likely better than we can provide on our side of the house, right? The court can objectively decide who actually has the responsibility to pay to someone. And we think that this is completely better because it doesn't involve an arbitrary factor, right? "}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "So when it comes to dueling to death, your strength or like the fortune that you had is going to matter in the vast majority of cases. "}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "On the other hand, when it comes to courts, courts can decide objectively based on evidence, based on facts, right? We tell you that it's far more better for courts to decide in those instances as well. Even for the relationship case, we tell you that like talking with the other person is definitely going to be better because you will no longer have this sense of regret even if you can win that person. When you win that person, you can win that person and that is going to be, that's going to satisfy you for a long time."}, {"start": 313.0, "end": 314.0, "text": "Briefly, why killing another person is regarded as morally wrong thing? Like I think in general, people would agree that killing other people is morally wrong thing even with a consent, right? Even when you see the instance of gang having a dispute with consent, still you regard that as something morally wrong thing, right? "}, {"start": 314.0, "end": 315.0, "text": "And we tell you that the states have to follow the general principle that society has in general, right? That means that when people regard something as a morally wrong thing, when people regard hate speech as a morally wrong thing, obviously you need to ban that. The same thing applies here as well. Even if there's consent, like when people regard like dispute against, dispute between gangs or helping in committing suicide is a morally wrong thing, we tell you that the state needs to follow that. Therefore, we are happy to oppose."}]}
