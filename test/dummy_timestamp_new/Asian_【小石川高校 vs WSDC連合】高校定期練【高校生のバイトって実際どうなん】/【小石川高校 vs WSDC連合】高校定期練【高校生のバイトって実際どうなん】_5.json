And then we think that there wasn't any kind of clear description and explanation of the mutually exclusiveness of part-time jobs. I'm very happy to propose."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "Two things I'll be talking about. First, I'll be explaining what high school students really want. And secondly, I'll be explaining what part-time jobs bring and why, in the majority of instances, there are going to be more harms than benefits of experiencing part-time jobs as uniquely as a high school student."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "So first, what do high school students want? I'll be using the classification that the prime minister brings, which is first, people who want to go to universities and people who don't want to go to universities. I'll be explaining why, in both of these situations, there's going to be much bigger harms."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "So first, let's look at students who want to go to university. Given that around 90 to 95% of high school students usually want to go to universities, and this is a debate about whether part-time jobs have benefits or harms as a majority. We think this point should be more important than the whip speeches wholly talking about students who don't want to go to universities. We think it's much better on our side if you don't experience part-time jobs for two reasons."}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "First is because you gain more time to prepare and be provided and you have more opportunities provided to see what you want to do in the future than spending and wasting your time on part-time jobs, right? You're able to study, you're able to gain important skills and knowledge, which is essential to choosing universities and careers because you need to actually have information to do so. For instance, we think it's much better if you study biology to be a biologist, or if you study law to be a lawyer, or play sports to be a professional player. And we think these points are much more important, much more feasible and robust than just, than just, I don't know, for instance, smiling at Burger King or McDonald's, right? We think it's much better.\u3000This is especially important when you consider that you are a high school student and you only have a limited time of three years. We think it's most important to know how to use time management. We think it's much better on our side where you actually have more time to absolutely dedicate all your time on things that are actually important."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "On their side, they say that, hey, we could also do club activities and you could just do both club activities and part-time jobs. Notice how this point specifically neglects the variable of high school students because a high school student usually has homework they have to prepare for universities. They also want to have fun with friends, right? The physical burden on mental stress is accelerated when you have to have both clubs and part-time jobs, right? Just one day is enough to save my energy and me having to go to a five-hour shift after that washing dishes for no reason is, I think, rather like meaningless and something that is rather unfeasible. On our side, we do not have these distractions. We also have time to work to polish our resumes for extracurriculars to provide to universities, for instance, which we think part-time jobs rather distracts you. So we say on our side, our side has much more benefits."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "But secondly, we say it's much better for poor people because it's going to be a much better investment of trying to go to universities and actually find a good job and a good career and gaining much better income instead of sacrificing your time during your limited three years of high school trying to do something you don't know if you want to do that in the future. Instead, we think that it's irrational for the government side to come up here and just say that these high school students are always going to know what to do from just doing part-time jobs."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "But let's look at the second case, right, of students who don't want to go to a university. The problem is this, is that they haven't been able to characterize these people, right? People usually who don't want to go to universities and immediately work are people who want to work at their parents' shop or being a fisherman or people with fixed jobs, right? These people already have jobs they want to do, so this negates proposition's own premise that these people would know what to do from doing part-time jobs because they already have jobs they want to do, right? At this point, we think this is meaningless and this is a waste of time because now they have to do things that won't help you at all."}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "The government says that academics aren't so important, but we say it is, right? Because if you want to work after your parents' shop, you should rather spend your time being able to focus on what the shop wants looking after all its geographical locations and how it's doing in the economy in the market, for instance, much than just working at a part-time jobs which you're never going to be affiliated without in the future. Therefore, we say it's better for these people to spend time on focusing on the job you're getting rather on their side. That's why for the first point, for what high school students want, our side is able to match the benefits more."}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "But secondly, let's characterize what part-time jobs and what part-time jobs brings. The whole bench of our proposition was that the part-time jobs extend high school students' vision of the future. This is problematic for two reasons. First, because it simply cannot because part-time jobs offered to high school students is usually the things like washing dishes at Caesarea, pushing buttons at 7-Eleven, or creating fake smiles at Burger King. Why is this so? Because we say there's a structural system in society which makes high school students have to do manual labor. "}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "This is for two reasons. First is because as high school students, we don't have the certificate or achievements as other people who are higher of age. There's a lack of credibility for high school students which makes them have to do manual labor instead of in kind of high-tech programming, for instance. That's why it's worse on their side and it's much better on our side because we get to prioritize these friends. We get to prioritize our limited time at high school. We say we're much better in not having to waste time in all these meaningless manual labor, which you probably never have to use in the future."}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "But secondly, even if you neglect all our points coming up for now, we say that their side wasn't able to provide any kind of mutually exclusivity for this point. The only thing that came up here was that, hey, we could just do clubs too. I already explained why that doesn't work. The only unique thing that came up here was that apparently, you know how to use your money management. "}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "The problem is, right after the second speaker came up here and said that if parents are able to control the money of high school students, that doesn't teach money management, right? It simply doesn't make sense. And it's also not related to the point where part-time jobs offer you money but don't teach you how to manage your money properly. If you want to know how to manage money, you should just do that with the allowance your parents provide you."}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "At this point, we think that failing in explaining the difference between part-time jobs while we explain it uniquely just in clubs or prioritizing your friends is much better. Because we prioritize the needs of students and talk to you about how part-time jobs bring more harms, I'm happy to oppose."}]}
