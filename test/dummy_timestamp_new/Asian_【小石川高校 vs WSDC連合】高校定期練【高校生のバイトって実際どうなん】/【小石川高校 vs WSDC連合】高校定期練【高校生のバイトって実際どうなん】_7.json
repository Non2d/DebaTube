At a point that the manners are written and they have to behave responsibly, and they can learn how to use the money. At this point, we strongly believe today's motion. So, today we have two main points here. The first point is about the academic skills, and the second point is about the social skills."}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "So, first, let me talk about the academic skills. We believe that the students can also maintain a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. So, high school students have enough chance to think of the future. No one will do a part-time job all day when the entrance exam will be held two months later. So, they will be able to maintain the balance between studying and part-time job. "}, {"start": 702.0, "end": 703.0, "text": "And this is also done when it comes to club activities. Students are able to maintain, even now, the balance between studying and club activities, which is club activities are the same as part-time jobs. At a point that they spend about 10 hours a week, which is completely different from studying. We believe that they can maintain the balance between the part-time jobs and studying. And if they cannot do that, it can also be said that they cannot maintain the balance between club activities and studying. So, we believe that there will be no difference between the people who are doing club activities and people who are doing the part-time jobs and club activities."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "Next, let me talk about the social skills, which is the most important thing in the participation. So, they said that they can learn a lot of social skills in the club activities. They said that they can learn how to behave against seniors. However, they can learn a lot of social skills, for example, how to behave against senior people. However, we believe that club activities are completely different from part-time jobs. To the point that they can quit easily the club activities when they have some difficulty in the club activities. "}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "And also, the rules are not written. So, it is difficult for students to know the rules. Feeling the atmosphere and changing behavior is so difficult for high school students. On the other hand, in part-time jobs, first of all, the manners are written. So, it is easier for students to learn social skills because they can learn the manners while they are doing part-time jobs because the manners are written."}, {"start": 705.0, "end": 706.0, "text": "The second point is that they have to behave responsibly, and they can somehow find a way to get along with who they hate. And the salary can be a huge motivation for these kinds of things which cannot be done when they are in the club activities. Because if there are some people they hate, they can quit easily. But salary can be a huge motivation in the part-time jobs."}, {"start": 706.0, "end": 707.0, "text": "The third thing is about how to use money. So, what will happen if they do not do part-time jobs in high school and they just get a lot of huge money when they are in the universities? So, when they are in the universities, they can do a lot of part-time jobs and they will get a lot of money. However, there is no one who can tell the importance and tell how to use the money. So, at the point when they are high school students, parents can control to some extent. "}, {"start": 707.0, "end": 708.0, "text": "And this is important because the parents can realize, can make them know how it is important to use and how they can truly use the money for themselves. And in this point, we believe that the social skills gained by the part-time jobs are bigger than only done in the club activities. So, that's why we strongly believe this motion. Thank you."}]}
