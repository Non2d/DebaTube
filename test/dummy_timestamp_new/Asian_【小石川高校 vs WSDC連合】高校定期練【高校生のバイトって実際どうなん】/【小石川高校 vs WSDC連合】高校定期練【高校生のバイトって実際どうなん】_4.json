So there's two analysis. First is what is high schoolers. So let me analyze high schoolers. There's two analysis. First, those go to college. And the second, those not go to college, as the first speaker said. So the important thing of this analysis is majority of students will work after high school. So let me move on to second one."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "So skills they claim, the opposition side claim to be needed. So they argue two points. First, we need communication skills. And secondly, we need academic skills for high schoolers. So they focused on the harm, the harm part-time job have. For example, they, so their first point was harm to academic skills. However, we're very skeptical about the need for academic skills. So as we argued, the majority of students work after, will work after high school, meaning not going to university. So academic skill is not needed for like work, right? So just get into the university. So even though there's a little harm, which club activities will not have that part-time job has to academic skills, it doesn't matter because a lot of, a majority of high schoolers will work after high school. So as we argued, as we argued in the first speaker, primary working, part-time job, primary working experience is good for those students who works after college. "}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "And secondly, they argued club activity is enough for what we need. So let me compare club activities and part-time jobs. So there's two axes. First, age. So in club activities, there's just like a two-year difference between senpai and kohai. And also, they go to the, because they go to the same school, they have, they have common background. Meanwhile, part-time, in part-time job, the co-worker, the age and backgrounds of co-workers will vary. So communication skills or like some special experience towards a wider variety of people will be there in the part-time job."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "And the second axis is responsibility. So they, the opposition side argued club is not the place. So we can, we can have a sense of responsibility throughout the club activities. However, it is not enough because the club is not the place for responsibility. It's, so it's, it's the place for just fun. So even though there's, there's a few club activities which require responsibility, for example, like very strict physical clubs, there is, it really depends on the club's atmosphere. For example, so as we, I said, the club is just for fun. So generally, generally, there's no need to be responsible.

So there's, and also there's an exchange of money. There's an exchange of money in exchange for their labor. So, and also as the second speaker said, there's, there's always the risk of getting fired. So incentive, incentive for, to be responsible, it's far more stronger in part-time job."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "So let me conclude my speech. So because the opposition side misunderstood what they needed, meaning they, so they misunderstandingly believe that academic, academic skill is needed. The harm they argued is meaningless. The harm they argued is meaningless. And also because, and also because club activities will not be the counterpart of the part-time jobs, we are happy to propose. Thank you."}]}
