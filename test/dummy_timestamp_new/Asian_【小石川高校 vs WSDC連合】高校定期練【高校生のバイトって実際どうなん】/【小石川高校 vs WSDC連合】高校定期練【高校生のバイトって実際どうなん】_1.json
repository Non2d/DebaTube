It's not like an internship that is available for university students. You don't acquire any knowledge. You don't acquire any particular skill that is going to widen your future choices. And it's just you're going to probably be exploited. You're going to be you're going to have to dish like wash dishes in Siberia. That's the kind of experience that you're going to have. It's not going to be in any way valuable for high school students. Therefore, we think that high school is better if high school students never experience part-time jobs during their school days."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "Now, two things to talk about. Firstly, I'm going to talk about why part-time job is uniquely harmful. Secondly, I'm going to talk about, in comparison to other alternatives, why part-time job is particularly worse on comparative. But just before we go on, just what are our stances and clarification? And then I move on to rebuttals to the side government."}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "Now, what are our stances and clarification? We support academic and club activities of high schoolers. We don't support part-time jobs. And furthermore, we also think that the context of this debate needs to be probably about a developed nation."}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Given that the majority of high school students who are from poor households in developing nations probably cannot afford school in the first place, probably are working full-time jobs, you know, as child labor or whatever. And furthermore, we think that this debate, I think the government would probably concede, should genuinely be about which side can provide better outcomes for high school students in the future, whether or not to experience this sort of part-time job or not to experience this."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "And the premise of our arguments is going to be that, I think the government is probably going to agree with me, that once you experience part-time job, you're likely to be encouraged to do so later, or you're going to be trapped in the cycle of working as a part-time job. Because the reason being that the fact that you get money, the fact that you get slightly economic independence from your parents is likely to attract many high schoolers and they're likely to prioritize the part-time job over school or over the club activities. We think that's a very likely situation that once you experience this, you're going to continuously work in a part-time job."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Now, what then? So let's move on to the response to the side of government. What we heard from the government side, firstly, we heard that, you know, high school students should interact with people from different ages because in high school, you only interact with people from the same age. Firstly, the existence of teachers and parents are the counterexamples of this. "}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "But secondly, we told you that like when you are in club activity, you would probably like carefully use, you know, respectful word which is keigo to your senpai or you would behave like in a way that you would behave yourself in front of your kohai and that sort of thing. You can still learn what you do in your communicative skill and social skill, even in the framework of school.

They fundamentally mischaracterize what part-time job is going to be."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "Now, let's move on to the first point. Why part-time job is uniquely harmful. There are two things to talk about. First is that the part-time job is probably going to be manual labor in the vast majority of cases, like dish, like washing dish in restaurants, in McDonald's, that sort of thing. Because those sorts of jobs do not provide any knowledge, do not provide any actual experience that is going to be valuable in the long run. And they might talk about like internships, for instance, but in the majority of cases, like as for internships, the sphere of choice is extremely narrow because not many corporations offer internships to high school students, even though it's available in the vast majority of cases only and exclusively for university students. "}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "But secondly, no thank you, is that they're likely to be exploited under the cheap wage because they're just high schoolers, right? They're not from any elite university. They're just high schoolers who are kids, right? So they're likely to work in really, really cheap wage. So we think that it's uniquely harmful."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "Second point, in comparison to alternative, why part-time is bad. Now, there are two kinds of skills that I think matter in consideration of the future choices that children are going to have. One is communicative skill and two is academic skill. We think both are equally important, like when it comes to expanding the future of children as much as possible."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "Now, firstly, as for communicative skill, we think that it can be acquired through club activities, for instance, within the framework of school activities like you do, like you do debating, you do basketball, you do baseball, you do soccer, that sort of thing. Firstly, you're going to be able to learn how to interact with others, how to interact with your senior, with your junior. But secondly, like you're able to find what is fun for you, right? The fact that I was able to find my hobby, which is debating, has expanded my future opportunity in a great way, right? Now, I'm able to interact with these great, great people who are online right now, right?"}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "Now, secondly, as for academic skill, we think it's important to note that in developed nations, there's a prevailing norm that going to university is the prerequisite for your success. That is to say, when you apply for a job, you have to graduate from an elite university in order to expand the choice that you have in the first place. If you have a job that you want to apply for, you need to have graduated from an elite university. That's why we think that in high school, it's particularly important for you to go to a summer program in Tetsuryokukai, which is a cram school for students who want to go to the University of Tokyo, instead of wasting your time, like washing dishes in McDonald's."}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "But furthermore, the unique benefits that come in high school is that high school is a precious time, right? It's only three years. And in university, we say that there's not much like club activities, for instance. And we think that's why we provided the unique benefits that come with not experiencing and by experiencing other alternatives that are available for students. For all these reasons, we proudly propose."}]}
