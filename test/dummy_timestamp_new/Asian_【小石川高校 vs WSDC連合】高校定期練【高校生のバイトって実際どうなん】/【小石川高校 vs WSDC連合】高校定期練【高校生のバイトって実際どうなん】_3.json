I also think that washing dirty dishes for 10 hours a week wouldn't widen your perspective or help you recognize your dream job in any way. We think that part-time jobs are a meaningless distraction that prevents you from focusing on stuff like studying or like club activities or any other action that is actually needed for your life, and that is why we are so proud to oppose today's notion."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "A couple of reputations to the previous speaker before I move on to my main points. Firstly, they talked about how part-time jobs are better because you get more risk, you get a bigger sense of responsibility. He explained that because there's a risk of getting fired, you learn to be responsible and not to be rude and stuff like that, but we think that this kind of sense of responsibility or respect towards people who are above you can also be gained through clubs. We think that even if you do not get fired for being rude at club, you still have social status that you have to protect as club member, and in order to maintain the social status, you will be careful to be polite to seniors, teachers, and so on. So, you don't necessarily have legal contract with your boss to learn how to be responsible. So we think that the benefits are not mutually exclusive."}, {"start": 302.0, "end": 303.0, "text": "Then they also talked about how you can interact with many. The first speaker talked about how you can interact with people from different ages, but as I said in the beginning, we think that the characterization of part-time jobs, that it's mostly manual labor, it doesn't really require this communication skills that you actually need, and all in all we think that like interaction can be further achieved on stuff like club activities with your friends or your seniors or your teachers, etc. etc., but you take him.

But like first of all, I don't think we have that much of a burden to say that high schoolers have to be 100% within club activities because we also say that not all high schoolers would be 100% polite once they start like doing a part-time job, even if you have that legal contract. I think like that doesn't necessarily mean that all kinds of high schoolers would like suddenly be polite.So all in all what we basically want to see is that this kind of legal contract or your fear of being fired is not enough of a reason to say that like you, that say that part-time jobs are necessary to gain this kind of sense of responsibility. "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "Secondly, they also talked about how, and I was talking about how you have to interact with like you get to interact with many people but because there's like a lot of, but because there's a lot of like manual labor involved in part-time jobs, this is not necessarily the case."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "Finally, they also talked about the sense of responsibility of using money that can be gained through part-time jobs, but we think that firstly they already contradict their main point when they say that students can learn how to take care of money, but at the same time they also say that parents would control it. We think that like this kind of control from their parents like your own like autonomy as like a. As like a spender wouldn't like be able to coexist so it'll either be the student like freely using their money or like the parents getting like a complete hold of their salary. So like either way, I don't get why they would be able to learn this kind of responsibility in the first place. "}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "And even then we still don't see the specific reason why they have to gain this kind of sense of responsibility while they're in high school. Especially if they have another four years or like for some people like six years in university. So in the end, we think that this kind of skill is not necessarily something that should be gained within the three years of high school life, but what we really need to gain during our three years of high school life is things like academic skills."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "For communicative skills that my first speaker talked about which brings us back to our main points. Firstly, the role of high school education. A side opposition believes it's to learn like the basis of how to live in society in the future and like in the long-term, right? In order to do that, firstly, you need to gain like a lot of knowledge to either get into university or maybe it's to get into a specific job or whatever reason. Then you also need to gain things like communication skills, teamwork, or leadership skills, or other soft skills that you need to survive in society. You gain that through daily classes at school and after-school activities, clubs, and we think that these kinds of activities are something that you could only gain in the three years of high school education. Specifically, this kind of opportunity should be the highest priority for students."}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "Secondly, I'll explain to you why this kind of opportunity would not be able to be achieved once students start gaining a part-time job. So ... the government second speaker said that the wage is not that cheap for part-time jobs, like it's enough for them to sustain themselves and have fun. We think that this is the specific reason why a lot of high school students will keep doing their part-time jobs even at the expense of their academic career getting damaged. Because you're able to gain that money to buy things like bubble tea or go to karaoke or whatever."}, {"start": 310.0, "end": 311.0, "text": "This kind of immediate pleasure and immediate financial gain that you can get from part-time jobs is what keeps the students going, and we think that this is very harmful because they don't realize that the long-term benefits that could be gained from studying or going to clubs would not be achieved. But then they prioritize this short-term gain that they can have from part-time jobs, and therefore they keep working. As a result, this is going to be a huge distraction that severely harms their future in the long term. Imagine you have to spend, they said that it could be like 10 hours or so, but we think 10 hours is pretty long for you to spend washing dishes or asking customers what they want for dinner."}, {"start": 311.0, "end": 312.0, "text": "We think that this is like a huge distraction for their lives, especially if they have this financial incentive that keeps them going at all costs. The specific difference between clubs and part-time jobs is that clubs in school are made to coexist with the school work. That is to say, like, you can only practice until a certain time. For instance, if you go to a club, there's probably a limit to the time that you can stay at school. Then, you also have a schedule of the club that is suited to your academic work. Maybe you don't have clubs during the test periods, for example."}, {"start": 312.0, "end": 313.0, "text": "So, we think that clubs are made to coexist within the school system, and therefore, it's really easy to balance your studying and all the other stuff. The unique thing about part-time jobs is that it's just not made to coexist in the first place. Therefore, what ultimately happens is you either get exploited or pressured by your boss to keep working at all costs and keep working for that money. This leads to getting distracted from a lot of the academic activities that you need to gain during your high school years. This would be a huge harm to your long-term prospects. For all these reasons, we're so proud to oppose."}]}
