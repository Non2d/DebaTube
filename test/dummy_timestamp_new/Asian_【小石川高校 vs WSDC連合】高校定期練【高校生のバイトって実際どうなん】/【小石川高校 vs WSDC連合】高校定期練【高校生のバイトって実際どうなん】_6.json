That is why we're so proud to oppose today's motion."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "So let's go over today's debate. The two main clashes are which side has long term benefits that are actually useful for the child's future. All in all, we think that as a premise, we see the high schoolers because they don't have any academic record or a cool master's degree or something. We simply don't have the capability nor credibility to get into a really high skill job. So as a result, the majority of the part-time jobs that they will be experiencing is manual labor. This is like washing dishes or doing like asking what they want to eat for dinner or stuff like that. And we think that as a result, opposition fails to clarify the specific benefits that you can gain from these kinds of part-time jobs."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "So let's take their best case and assume that this kind of legal contract makes you like a more responsible person. Even if that is the case, we still see that the kind of responsibility that you do gain out of it is quite marginal. We think that all you have to do to be responsible in a part-time job is simply to be at that shop at the designated time and do some chores. Right. And then you're like counted as responsible. We think that this kind of responsibility is not really valuable compared to the responsibility that you gain as a member of a sport team or like fulfilling your role as like a reply speaker or like whatever thing you do in clubs. We think that the kind of skills and the kind of responsibility that you ultimately get out of part-time jobs is quite small compared to the benefits that can be achieved on our side."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "And secondly, the other benefit that they talked about was about this kind of interaction that you can gain between people. Firstly, we say that their model already contradicts with their stance because it seems that high schoolers only get to work for like 10 hours a week. But still, we also see that like the kind of like manual labor prevents them from like any kind of like constructive communication with like peers or like people older than you in the first place. So compared to that, again, the communication that you can gain within the school is more sufficient and more beneficial for these students."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "But finally, they also talk about the financial responsibility that they can gain through the motion. But we think that this ends up in like two spectrums. It's either you waste off all your salary on bubble tea or like your parents take all the cash. Right. So in the end, we don't think the high schoolers are capable and nor is it feasible for them to gain this kind of financial responsibility once they start doing a part-time job."}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "So let's look at the comparative. Right. What can we actually gain by preventing them from doing part-time jobs? We think that by focusing on your school life, whether it's like academic or whether it's something to do with clubs, we think that this has like a long term benefit on the students because first of all, they gain these kinds of soft skills, right? Like communication skills or like teamwork or like learning to respect your seniors or like fulfilling your role in like a team or like leadership and like other other skills."}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "And let's look at like academic skills. Right. So again, let's take their best case and say that like most students don't go to university anyway. So academic skills are important. We think that like firstly, we think that academic skills are not necessarily like getting into that university or having like an elite record. We think that like even if you don't go to university in the end, like working hard to get that good grade on the test or like studying and like sharing your thoughts together with your peers is in itself like a valuable experience. Even if you don't go to university in the future. "}, {"start": 608.0, "end": 609.0, "text": "And compared to that, the kind of like tedious and repetitive manual labor that you're going to experience through a part-time job is like a meaningless act. And that doesn't lead to any useful skills compared to what you could gain from working hard studying."}, {"start": 609.0, "end": 610.0, "text": "So all in all, regardless of what kind of future that you are going into for the long term benefit and the happiness of the students as a whole, we think that they should never experience part-time jobs during their high school career. And that is why we're so proud to oppose. Thank you."}]}
