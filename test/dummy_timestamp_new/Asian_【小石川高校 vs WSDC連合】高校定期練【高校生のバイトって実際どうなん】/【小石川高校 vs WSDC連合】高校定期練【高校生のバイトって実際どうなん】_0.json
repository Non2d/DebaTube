So we, the government side, follow the current law for part-time workers by which we allow students to work for no more than 10 hours a week. We set these hours because high schoolers should spend a certain amount of time on studying, not only part-time jobs. And also, if they extend these hours to the late night, there might be more dangerous jobs, more dangerous part-time jobs for high schoolers. So we fought to prevent those dangerous jobs. And for the first reason, we set these hours."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "So, first of all, let me tell you what part-time job brings about for high schoolers. So, I'm going to talk about one thing. This is experience of society and working. Let's take an example of doing a part-time job in a family restaurant. There, we can interact with people of various ages. For example, from people of high schoolers and people of 30 years old and people of 60 years old. So, there are a lot of ages in having a restaurant."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "And by interacting with those people, interacting with those people is not experience that high schoolers can get in high school. This is because in high school, there is almost... High schoolers interact with only people of the same age, right? And even if they interact with people of different age, this is like one year older or one year younger. Students don't that much, that often interact with teachers. By doing part-time job, they can experience of society and working, in which there are a lot of people of various ages from young to old."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "So, how is this? How is experience of society and working good for high schoolers? So, let me divide high schoolers into two groups. First, high schoolers who will go to college after graduation. So, for those people, doing part-time job can broaden their interest and know what they are suitable for and what they are not suitable for before college. This is really good for high schoolers because in college, they will do what they are interested in or what they want to do or something that is good for their future. By experiencing part-time job before college, in which they do what they are interested in, they can know what they should do in college or what is good for them before college. So, they can learn and they can do better things in college. The second group is people who will not go to college."}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "<POI>How does washing dishes at Saizeriya benefit people who want to be, for instance, scientists or soccer players?

Because if they want to be a professional soccer player, they should practice.

So, I'm going to talk about how is this good for high schoolers who will not go to college. So, for those people, doing experience part-time job is still good too. So, this is because they can experience society in advance. So, for example, if they start part-time job from the first year of their high school life, they can experience society for three years before being exposed to society, before the graduation."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "This is really good for high schoolers who will not go to college because if they are not going to college, after graduation, they will just go to society and start working. So, by experiencing society in advance, they can learn what to do in society or how to interact with people in society. So, that means letting high schoolers doing part-time job during their high school days means that there will be much more time for preparation for society. So, this is also good for students who will not go to college. So, in conclusion, part-time gives high schoolers a lot of benefits for the future. As I mentioned, that's why we, the government, are happy to propose. Thank you."}]}
