If you do such a rude thing for the customer, you will be fired. At this point, we believe that the part-time job is completely different from club activities, which they can gain. And we believe that high school students should also have the time to do part-time jobs. And that's why we strongly believe this motion."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "So, let me rebut the arguments first. So, the first argument is about the cheap wage. They said that because of the part-time jobs, they are accepting high school students. The wage will be so much cheap and it will be quite uniquely harmful for high school students. However, we don't think so that the wage is cheap for the high school students. As long as they are high school students, we believe that the money got by the part-time job will be enough for themselves to use things."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "For example, they are not going to use money for their living. For example, like to buy a house or to pay the money for the house or to pay money for water, electricity. These kinds of things can be done by their parents, but they can use the money for the things which they like to do. For example, tapioca or soccer tools or something like that. So, we believe that this is not the cheap wage and it will be uniquely harmful for high school students."}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "And the second point is about the students' future. So, they said that communication skill and academic skill are both important. And we completely believe that. We also agree that these both two skills are important. And they said that for the academic skill, they said that they have to graduate from an elite university. And because of this, they believe that they have to go to the Kyokai Ojuku."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "However, this is completely against the first thing that they also think that club activity is important. We believe that we can use the time spent for club activity. We can spend the time used for club activity for the part-time job.

And interacting with people is the important thing. And it can be also done for the club activity. However, we believe that all the things done in the high school students, students have no responsibility to interact with others. So, they are not forced to talk in a polite way for their seniors."}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "However, in the part-time jobs, they have to act in a polite way.

Our second argument is that set the fundamental sense for using money. So, what is high school students? So, when you are a high school student, it is easier for them to use their money for what they like. For example, tapioca, games, perfume, for traveling. All these kinds of things are much more easier than when they are in junior high school or elementary school."}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "The second point is that they will use a considerable amount of money compared to junior high school or elementary school.

So, this is because when they are university students, parents cannot control the usage of the money they gain.

Parents can control the usage of the money to some extent."}, {"start": 212.0, "end": 213.0, "text": "Parents can teach the important things, can teach the way how to use money. For example, when they are using all the money they gain from part-time jobs, using for games, only for games, and do not deposit some of them, parents can teach them that depositing money is also important for themselves when they think of the future. So, we believe that parents can teach the usage of the money to some extent, which is completely different from the university students' period."}, {"start": 213.0, "end": 214.0, "text": "So, why is this important? When they are high school students, they use money without thinking. They use money just for themselves and not think about the money, how their parents work, and do not realize the importance of money. However, if they do part-time jobs, they can realize how it is hard for themselves to gain money. We believe that if they realize such important things, they can use their money in a much better way because they will think much more deeply about their money. At this point, we believe that we can set a fundamental sense for using money, and that's why we believe this notion. Thank you."}]}
