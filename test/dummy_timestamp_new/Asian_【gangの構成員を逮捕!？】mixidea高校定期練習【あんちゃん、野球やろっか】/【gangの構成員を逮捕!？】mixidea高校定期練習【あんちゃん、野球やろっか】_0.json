But the police isn't currently authorized to look after them or prosecute them based on the law, that it is not, like, not, it is okay for them to be a part of gangs because there's no evidence that they have committed a crime."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "We think that the importance and the purpose of the criminal justice system is to not just prosecute current crimes. It is also to prevent and deter the occurrence and actions of crimes. And we say on the proposition that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter current crimes as well, but also future crimes, and we think that's the burden we have in this debate."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "How do we define what a gang is? Three layers. First is that we think the gang is when a member collectively identifies and adopts a group identity, and they create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation. This could look like holding a lot of tattoos, Mr. Speaker, where you collectively identify through group tattoos or any kind of weapons or certain weapons or certain drugs. Secondly, we define what a gang is when the purpose is to literally pursue violence in a crime as a whole organization. And thirdly, we say that in the case that we criminalize gang membership and the police is able to prosecute certain members by identifying that they were part of a gang, we're happy to put them through extensive rehabilitation at the moment in which they still don't have deep ties with the gang yet. In case that they are deeply involved with the gangs, we'll make sure that they go through rehabilitation and they're not part of gang culture, such as in countries like America, and make sure that they cut absolutely every single tie with the gangs for the sake of crime."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "With this in mind, I'm going to talk about three things. First, I'm going to talk about the criteria to criminalize. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about why this is a just and necessary policy. And thirdly, I'll be talking about why we decrease crime."}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "Quickly, on terms of the criteria to criminalize, we say that if we prove this criteria applies for the sake of gang membership, we should take this debate. We think criminalization comes with two metrics. First, is that if we ensure that criminalization is able to deter the occurrence of crime. That's why, for instance, we criminalize guns in a lot of nations because we think that guns are deeply correlated with the actions of crimes, even when guns aren't literally the sake of crimes. But just because in terms of correlation, we think that when criminalization deters crime, we think that is okay. "}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "And secondly, we think it is important to protect the sustenance of society and make sure that society is a more safer and more sustainable place for innocent citizens to live on. If we prove that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter crime or prove that society is going to be a better place, we should take this debate."}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "With this in mind, I'm going to talk about my positive manner. First, let's talk about why this is a just and necessary policy. I have two layers in this argument. First, let me contextualize what gang members first do. We concede that membership does not equal violence, Mr. Speaker, but we say that gangs are inherently about committing violence and committing crimes."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "I think that the fact that you are trying to opt into this cycle, in this organization of violence, in and of itself, is self-indicative of the fact that you are interested in crime. That you want to commit crimes, or you want to steal someone, or you want to brutally murder someone, or you want to rape someone. I think the criminal justice system is there in order to prevent any incentive to commit crimes, and we think that on our side, it's more important to stop before actual casualties happen."}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "How do we see this in the current status quo? It comes like we prevent strangers from lurking around schools because just the fact that you might be a pedophile isn't necessary, and trying to prevent it before any kind of pedophile takes action on a children, in and of itself, is important. "}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "Similarly, we think this is analogous to this motion because we say that in the case of gangs, we think just the fact that there are gangs is enough evidence that they're probably going to commit crimes in the future, and we want to prevent any kind of casualties from happening. We think that based on this, we think we should win. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "But the second layer is that we think that there's many cases where usually youths or juveniles are coerced into this system. Given this, we think our side is going to be much better at preventing coercion. Why is this? Because we think the coercion by force, in and of itself, is firstly an unjust principle, that we should allow these people who have to coerce by using this illegality and this criminalization as an excuse to prevent entering these gangs in the first place. We think that given that youth and juveniles usually enter gangs because of this mild nuance that like, hey, being a part of a gang is cool, especially in countries like Mexico or Colombia, we are able to prevent this because we think that by the state in and of itself saying that gang membership is something illegal, that it is dangerous."}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "We think that youth and juveniles, first of all, won't have any incentives to go on, but secondly, they won't be able to be coerced as much because these other gang members know that they themselves are in a predicament where they can be arrested and have their futures taken away. So given this, we think that it is just and necessary because first, we have to prevent future crimes and deterrence. And I think that the fact that you are in a gang means that you're more likely to commit a crime than not doing so. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "And that the comparative is that it's too late on their side because you can only arrest gangs at the moment in which they do commit a crime, where there are actual casualties, where there's going to be raped victims, murdered victims, or any kind of casualties in general.

All right."}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "<POI> So if you're going to say that criminalizing is going to be a deterrent, why there are a lot of drug smugglers or doing other frauds, even you're a minor, and even you're going to be arrested if you did some of these kind of things, what do you think?"}, {"start": 14.0, "end": 15.0, "text": "Let me talk about my case about why we decrease crime, and I'm pretty sure that's going to be self-explanatory. Two layers. First, is that we actually reduce gangs in the first place. And I'm sure just in the POI, opposition might say it has no effect. The reason why this is effective is for two reasons. "}, {"start": 15.0, "end": 16.0, "text": "First is because I think the fact the state is saying that it is dangerous in and of itself is important. They talked about in the case of scams, but we're able to decrease that because we're saying that even trying to be a part of an organization that does scam in the first place is bad. Given in the status quo, there's not enough deterrence. We think our side is just like an enhanced version of this. "}, {"start": 16.0, "end": 17.0, "text": "But secondly, it's because I think that on our side, like there's a lot of cases where police can't do anything, even when people are on motorcycles or holding bats. But on our side, we allow the police to prosecute them at any moment when they are suspect of being a gang. Why is this so important? Because we think organized crime is more important than individual crimes. The fact that youth and juveniles, this is going to be more like magnitude of crimes because just in terms of influence and money and authority, we think the gangs are much more dangerous.
