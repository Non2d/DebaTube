So, why we want to criminalise? It is not because we want to exile the criminals or the gangs from the society, but our purpose is to help those criminals or the gangs rehabilitate and get back to the normal society. And the second purpose is to prevent the future crimes. So, that is our purpose."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "And also, the opposition side said that the criteria for determining the gangs is vague. However, as the first piece of clearly explained, what gangs are, and which is that the group, which is the gangs, is the group where they encourage both directly or indirectly committing crimes. And because of this clear criteria, the judge, we think that the judge is also capable of determining whether a group belongs to the categorisation of a gang."}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "And, okay, so next, I'd like to revert to the opposition side's claim that this motion will not act as the deterrent. Well, even though the opposition side said so, as the first speaker clearly showed, there is a clear step that, by taking this motion, gangs will decrease and then eventually the crime number will decrease. And even if we hypothesise that it will not have direct results, such as the decrease of the crime, we believe that it is very important for a country to clearly show their stance."}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "So, currently, the government stance is very vague. And even though they criminalise the action that the gangs take, they haven't directly banned the gangs itself. However, as we all know, the police are always trying to disassemble those gangs by trying to find those crimes that they commit. So, there's this contradiction between the government and the police. Even though the government doesn't directly say that the gangs are out of law, the police is taking action that clearly shows that gangs are not under the law. And this is creating a confusion within the public, especially to the juvenile, as our first speaker briefly mentioned."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "Because the government is standing on an unstable and unclear stance, the public do not have this strong understanding that being a gang member is a crime. But if we take this motion, this will change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime without conscience, and there's no doubt within it. Because we know, because the government is clearly stating that it is a crime to kill someone."}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "And so, this will apply similarly to this case too. And if the government clearly shows that being a gang member is a crime, even the youngs will eventually know and understand clearly that being a gang member is a crime. And by establishing this circumstance, we'll be able to decrease the number of youngs getting into the gangs, because they think that being a gang member is cruel. So, we believe that it is very important for the government to state their stance, even if we think that this motion will not have a direct effect."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "And also, it may be questionable whether a gang member actually committed a crime. Well, it is true that not every single member of gangs does not commit a crime. However, if we compare the possibility of committing a crime between a gang member and a non-gang member, it is apparent that the gang member has a higher possibility of committing a crime. "}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "And the government's job is to... As I clearly stated in the beginning of my speech, our purpose is to prevent the future crimes. And by banning the action that comes before committing a crime, which is becoming a gang member, we'll be able to decrease the number of crimes, even if we're not sure whether the person is actually going to commit a crime after being a gang member. So, for these reasons, we propose this motion. Thank you."}]}
