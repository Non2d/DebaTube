We think that these things, well, if we can do it, we think that it's good. But even now, in the present situation, even if you criminalize some kind of like drugs or drug smuggling or like fraud, it doesn't be a deterrent. Rather, it's going to say that these cases are going to increase on the case of like minors or others. And actually, we think that it's going to actually harm the society. That's actually why we're going to say that we should not criminalize gang star membership because we want to protect the future of the minors and others."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "All right. Before going to our argument, I'd like to talk about, I'd like to say about two things. Well, firstly, they say that these kind of people who are a gang member, it's the people who are going to do future crime, to rebuttal here. Firstly, this is actually one of the stigmatization, right? If they say that as if all members of the gang member is going to commit a crime, we say that this is not true. Because there are a lot of people like the people who are doing like cooking or like others, it doesn't commit a crime. "}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "Or like, secondly, we say that other people, and secondly, we say that it is very vague until who you're going to punish. It is very vague for it.

Going to our argument, we have three things to talk about. Firstly, we'd like to talk about the fundamental ideology of punishing individuals. Well, firstly, as our stance, we'd like to say that we are going to welcome punishing the gang members who committed the crime. We oppose punishing the gangs who didn't commit the crime. For example, the cooks or the people who are like cleaning the room or like, yeah, these people doesn't commit harm others or doesn't did something wrong. And some people also didn't know the truth that they like cleaned the room of the gangs or like death. So we think these things are unjust for three reasons."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "One is that there are the cases that you didn't know, for example, the Yami Egiro Mondays or like other cases. Even these people don't know. We think that some kind of like cooks or like other people are going to like be criminalized because you did something for the gangs or like other things in their paradigm. Right. We think that it is ridiculous because they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill anybody. They didn't rape somebody or like death. But they're going to be punished. We think that it is unjust."}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that the criteria and criteria is very big. So we think that it's going to isolate these people because if we say like other people want to help these like people who are in the gang and they want to go out of the gang. However, if these people are going to like help these individuals in the gang, maybe the police are going to have those like stigmatization that the people who are related to these like gang members or have the possibility of being a gang membership, we think that these people have the possibility to be punished. And because of this, the other people are going to have more hardship to help these people. Right. We think that because of this, we think it is actually not going to be a deterrent, but rather these people are going to be in these like gangs and no one is going to help them. We think it is. It is very harmful."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "Actually, the third reason is that principally we think that if you're if you did something wrong, we think that these people should not be punished. For example, if you did something, if you didn't kill somebody or if you didn't do some kind of crime, we think that these individuals should not have any kind of any kind of like punishment or like death. Right. And people have the right to have and have the right to not to have like criminalization or like others."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "We would like to talk in our second point. All right. Our second point is the rehabilitation just needs to infect the underlying and underling to cause more crime. All right. So firstly, now in the present situation, we say that the rehabilitation just just for these individuals to do more like work or like the simple work or like other things. And it's not going to be a fundamental solution for this. Right. And moreover, we think it is causing more harm because even though even now there are two people. One is the people who have rehabilitated. Second is the people who had not rehabilitated. Even they did all the terms of the rehabilitation. We think that these two people are existing."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "However, even though there are these two people, these like the companies or the corporations are not going to accept these people because they're going to prioritize the main value or other things. And we say that these profit speakers are going to know, going to try to see what kind of crime, what kind of things they didn't have, including these like criminal records. So actually, if they become an applicant, these corporations, it's actually not taking, not going to adapt these people into their companies."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "Actually, this rehabilitation is not working well. This means that these people are going to be excluded from society. What's going to happen? We say that these criminals are going to have more unionized cases and they are going to do more crimes because they don't have any weight or like any kind of like work that we think that these people have more possibilities, that they're going to commit more crimes, more or like make more like organized crimes or like organized gangs. And actually, we think that this is going to make a vicious cycle, which leads to more crimes because these organized gangs are going to do more crimes because they want to have money like drug smuggling or like others. And we think that it is very harmful."}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "And surely we like to talk that how these things, it's not going to, and even now, even though they are going to criminalize, we think that this is not going to be a fundamental solution because if it's going to be something like an organized crime now or like in the future, we think that the people who are going to be arrested, it's only these like the underling, which is the lower position people who have this, who are the minors or like who are the low position members. And we think that these people are going to be arrested. But if it's going to be an organized crime, it is very hard for to know who is the top leader or where is the top leader now. And we think that because of this, these people are going to put all of these crimes to these lower members people, and these lower members people are going to make more crimes in the future."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "That's actually why we're going to say that these things are not never going to be solved, and it's going to increase the crime. That's actually why we're going to oppose. Thank you."}]}
