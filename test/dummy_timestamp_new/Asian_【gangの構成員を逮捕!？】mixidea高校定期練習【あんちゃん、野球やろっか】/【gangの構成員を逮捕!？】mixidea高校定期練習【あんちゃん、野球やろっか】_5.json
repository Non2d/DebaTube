The government side said that we can hide criminal records, but even if we hide the criminal records, the company cares about profit seeking, and the company's main value. And so, after all, they don't employ employees, so this is not true. And also, we can ask support to detectives or experts, and we can ask the criminal records. So, this is not true."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "Then, I'm talking about the arraignment of our issues. First, the government side said that if we take this motion, we can prevent future crime, and protect the society, we're safer. But we think that if we take this motion, young members are must be rehabilitated by punishment. So, in this situation, they may contain the more bad group, and we can know about how to escape those agreements. And we think that they can think of a wiser way to escape this.

And which is better, to prevent crime before they do, or not prevent at that time, but after more bigger crime can be saved. I think that not take this motion is more safety for society. And take this motion is less bad effect for society. Because, I told before, we are company, we become a bad company in the gang member. And so, this is bad effect for society anymore."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "And the opposition side also said, if we take this motion, even if we take this motion, we can only find weak gang members.

But, this is not true, because to find those gang members is difficult, because they know how to escape this. And we are always thinking about how to escape that."}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "So, after all, we can only find weak or not big gang members.
