First of all, I would like to make an argument that it is difficult to draw lines that who is a gang member or not. And secondly, I would like to make an argument about the invitation."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "As for the first argument, nowadays it is too difficult to draw lines on who is a gang member or not. Even if the gang organization and a person who made a contract or has the same tattoo in one organization and becomes a member, it is difficult to know who is a member because they will hide that he or she made a contract or hide the tattoo. Police cannot search enough evidence that the person is a member or is a gang member. So, it is difficult to invest and arrest them.

Even if we take this motion, we cannot find a person who is a member. So, even if we take this motion, we cannot have real meaning to achieve their purpose."}, {"start": 303.0, "end": 304.0, "text": "Secondly, about the invitation. Firstly, they have a bias that gang members commit crimes. But this is not true, right? These days, many people have been invited by strange religion at the university or some other places and become a member of that, right? And this is a problem mostly in Japan. Those people have almost never mind to become a member, right? Because they will have interest by their, like, not, like, they might have, like, saying something about good for themselves by some strange religion. "}, {"start": 304.0, "end": 305.0, "text": "But this happens the same in the invitation of gang organization, right? Because gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, if we take this motion, we have to criminalize these people who have less or no feeling to commit a crime, commit crimes, or even become a member of the gang, right? "}, {"start": 305.0, "end": 306.0, "text": "So, we have to, the government has to protect them because they are almost victims. Gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, they might, they will invite many people that they want a member of our organization. And maybe, or definitely, they said the member of the gang, gang member will say this organization is not a bad organization. So, if we take this motion, these cases will occur so many times. So, we can't protect them by taking this motion."}, {"start": 306.0, "end": 307.0, "text": "We would like to move on to the rebuttal and a little bit of reconstruction. First of all, they think that they can decrease criminals by taking this motion, and they can prevent crimes by taking this motion. But there are lots of gang organizations, and by taking this motion, we might criminalize the member of the gang, a few. But this is much harm more, like, because these people who are arrested mostly are in the low position, as the first speaker has said. So, they have less will to do crimes than people who are in the top of the organization. "}, {"start": 307.0, "end": 308.0, "text": "And they, and sometimes the people who are in the low position have strong will, but the less will, the people who have less will are existed. So, if those people are in the prison, those people or more wicked people are in the prison, right? So, we think we cannot put them who has the member of the gang in their old life, right? So, they will return to the society in the future."}, {"start": 308.0, "end": 309.0, "text": "As the first speaker has explained, if we take this motion, we will make the network between criminals by having a community with them, right? So, they said that by taking this motion, it is very safe and sustainable, but if we take this motion, will the crime decrease? No, right? Not, because they will make a network and know what's the crime or what's the good way to do crimes by not to know by the police or something like that. So, this occurs that people commit crimes again. "}, {"start": 309.0, "end": 310.0, "text": "So, their purpose was to prevent future crimes, but our side is more better, because as I said that it is important way or exacting way to protect this society by taking this, but even if you take this motion, we can't eradicate the real organization. That's the first speaker has to say, right? So, for this reason, we would like to oppose. Thank you."}]}
