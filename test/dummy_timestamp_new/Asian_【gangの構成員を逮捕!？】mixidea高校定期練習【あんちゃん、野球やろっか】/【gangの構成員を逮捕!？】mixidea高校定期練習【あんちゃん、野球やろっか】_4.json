That is, that they failed in providing a counterfactual, where in their world, gangs are still going to exist, where there's still going to be violent gangs, and how on their side, they are able to uniquely decrease crime. All we got was that, oh, that the concept of gang is very vague, very subjective, but we think that there was no actual critical feedback or any kind of rebuttal coming to a bulk of violent, like the majority of gangs which are violent on our side, how we decrease crimes, and we think the moment in which they failed to provide a counterfactual, they lost this debate."}, {"start": 401.0, "end": 402.0, "text": "I'm going to be talking about two issues. First is about the bulk of their argument, which was about this metric of what a gang is. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about which side is able to prevent the occurrence of crimes, and I'm going to be talking about this in a couple of layers."}, {"start": 402.0, "end": 403.0, "text": "First, in terms of metric, opposition fundamentally failed in explaining and replying to the majority of the bulk of our argument in our metric, which was that there are a lot of violent gangs, like the Crips and Bloods in LA, or Sinaloa cartels in Mexico, whose literal intent is to commit crimes and create a community of violence. The fact that they didn't respond to this is a concession that these gangs are dangerous, and that we have to stop them, and they concede that in the case of violent gangs, it is necessary to criminalize gang membership. And at the moment in which they failed in replying to any of our argument about this community of violence, we think they dropped our argument that gangs are fundamentally dangerous and that we ought to prosecute them."}, {"start": 403.0, "end": 404.0, "text": "But secondly, is that the only reply we got was that there could be gangs that clean up rooms. I think this is a pretty inaccurate description of what a gang is, right? I think the only time these gangs are going to clean up a room is when they murdered someone in the room and they're having to clean it up. But let's assume that these gangs can be so fluffy that maybe their only intent is to hold a tea party and just eat cookies. Let's take this. But we think that this argument still neglects the premise and the incentive of these members who want to enter gangs."}, {"start": 404.0, "end": 405.0, "text": "We think the incentive of these gang members is to commit violence, are to commit crimes. Youths who are potentially cursed or youths who are just interested in this slavish ways of violence and crimes. We think that if you want to just clean up rooms, it's much better on the counterfactual, where on our side, we're still going to provide things like regulated government offices where if you want to clean up stuff, you can enter the Red Cross or UNICEF. And I think this is much better on their side, regardless of what incentive there is. It's better than some unregulated, potentially dangerous, unorganized group. We think that counterfactual is good."}, {"start": 405.0, "end": 406.0, "text": "Look, the comparison is that even if it is vague, that is not a reason why you have to oppose criminalization. Although, for instance, we do criminalize hate speech in a lot of countries, even if the metric of hate is pretty subjective and vague, we think that this ignores opposition. The reason why we are able to criminalize gangs, even if it is vague, because we think on our side, we include courts in the equation of criminalization, which opposition absolutely neglected. That is that we think the courts are able to at least determine what is violence and what is not through the legislative procedure. And that's why we're able to criminalize hate speech."}, {"start": 406.0, "end": 407.0, "text": "And we think this mirrors the logic, and we think that we're able to criminalize gang membership because we do have this final barrier that is able to determine what is violence, what is not. And I gave you a very explicit model in the first place of what a gang is, so it simply wasn't enough. And therefore, 50-minute speeches absolutely drops because this metric of vagueness is not a reason to oppose the criminalization of gang membership. Just in the same way that we have to look at incentive, and we prosecute attempted murder and not murder, but the intent of committing murder is in and of itself important. So the incentive of committing crimes is enough reason of criminalizing gang membership in the first place. Therefore, we think that their whole argument falls."}, {"start": 407.0, "end": 408.0, "text": "Let's look at the more important question then, the occurrence of criminalization. Opposition told us three things. First, they told us that companies were important. I'm going to look at this in a lot of ways."}, {"start": 408.0, "end": 409.0, "text": "Firstly, we think that in the counterfactual, gangs are going to exist. Given that gangs are going to exist, we think that companies have a certain right to know whether they were a gang member or not. Look, just imagine the top gang of Mexico, which is the Sinaloa Cartel, to be a part of a company of a gun shop, Mr. Speaker. We think that in these cases, they're still going to be much worse because companies don't know they're hiring literal criminals inside their pretty dangerous organization, which holds, handles weapons, for instance. Or just imagine an organization of scammers, of a gang that only commits thieves and burglaries to enter a very important finance company, we think, like Golden Saks, right?"}, {"start": 409.0, "end": 410.0, "text": "We think that's bad because companies have a certain right to know that they have to protect other employees who are not gangs, and on their side, we think that it's simply, we think that it's good that companies do know if they're gangs or not because that's literally the point of criminalization, right, to ensure the benefit of society. They weren't able to engage with this."}, {"start": 410.0, "end": 411.0, "text": "However, let's say that we still want these criminals to employ these ex-convicts, right? Why is this better on our side? Because we think just in the same way we do for juveniles, we could just hide their identity up, that is, that we don't allow criminal, like, companies to give access to criminal records, and on our side, we're telling you that we're going to give rehab, job training, and community sentencing. We think this is more than enough incentive for companies to employ them in the first place. They weren't able to give a counterfactual, and thirdly, I'm going to prove to you why on their side, they aren't able to, like, have effective rehabilitation."}, {"start": 411.0, "end": 412.0, "text": "Why is this the case? Because under their side, when these gang members enter prison, they're still deeply tied with gangs, that is, that they have to stay with gangs to survive, especially in countries like America or Colombia, where most, like, most prison inmates are usually gang members, so they're forced to hold ties with gangs, they're forced into a community of hatred and violence, and we think just in terms of broken window theory, which is that if you are in a community of violence, you're more likely to commit violence, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective, because you still have to, you're surrounded by a lot of people who commit crimes."}, {"start": 412.0, "end": 413.0, "text": "Just in the same way that if you're holding an anger management class, but you're literally forced into this gang or gang community and seeing, like, a lot of fights every day, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective. On our side, we told you, so we separate them from these groups because we, like, we take them out of the equation of gangs, the moment in which they try to enter, so they still don't have deep ties with these gang members yet, therefore, we're able to prevent them from holding deep ties and allowing them a better integrating society by having a lot of rehabilitation, so we think that in terms of rehabilitation and reintegrating society, we do it better on our side."}, {"start": 413.0, "end": 414.0, "text": "Look, the failure of opposition was that they weren't able to provide any reason why, like, the whole existence and allowing and accepting gang members to be in society is actually able to deter crime. We told you explicitly one. I'm very happy for this."}]}
