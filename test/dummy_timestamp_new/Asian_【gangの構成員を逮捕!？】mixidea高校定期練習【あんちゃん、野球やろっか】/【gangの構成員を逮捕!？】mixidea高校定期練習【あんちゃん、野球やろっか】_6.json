One is that the government should have the staff to oppose gang members, and it is important. But we, and secondly, they say that even, and secondly, they say that we should protect these kind of like societies rather than these individuals. And surely they say that even these kind of like gang members, the ex-gang members are going to be isolated in the societies rather it is better. We actually oppose to these three things."}, {"start": 601.0, "end": 602.0, "text": "Alright, why our side is better? We like talking our point. Well, firstly, we actually told us that, we actually listened to them, that why should we prioritize government staff rather than these kind of like retribution or like other things, right? Because we say the retribution, or we say the retribution is just the thing that even there is no like victims or other people, there is no reason that we have to prioritize like other things. Rather we say that we should like prioritize these like rehabilitation of the individuals or like that. We are going to talk about why our side is better. Alright."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "And before that, I'd like to do one rebuttal. Well, even now, the government is saying that being gang members corrupts our lives, or we have some kind of like posters or like other things. Why these individuals are not having like, are still going to be like gang members or other things? Because, and it's their thing that if these kind of like posters or other things are being noticed, and all things, it's going to change. What is the difference between criminalizing or like other things? We don't think that there is a clear difference, because even the minors are now doing like drug smuggling, and it is increasing every year. And actually, even if it's a crime, these individuals are going to do because they want to have money or like other, like fame for others. That's actually why we are going to think that this is not going to be solved."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "Alright. Moving to our argument, we actually told you three things. One is the rehabilitation moves well or not. Well, actually, they didn't really engage on this point. And actually, they admitted that this rehabilitation is not going to work well, and the corporation or like other organizations are not going to be employed. Alright. And even, and one thing they say is that, well, all right, well, the government can prohibit to have like those criminal, to notice those criminal records of these like companies or like others. But actually, we think that it is very, it is impossible, because these like, as our week speaker told you, that these kind of like companies or corporations, they are profit seekers, and they're just going to know about these criminal records from like other people, from the third person. And we think that it is inevitable. And we think that it's unjust."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "Secondly, we say that even we're going to like criminalize, sorry, secondly, we're going to say that it is going to, if this kind of like rehabilitation is not going to work, how these individuals are going to, going to like move for society. We say that if you're not going to be in society, and you're going to be isolated, rather these people are going to be a gang member again, to commit crime, because this is the only way that you're going to live, we think that these things are not going to be solved, rather it's going to be more radicalized, and the individuals, the minors who want to have money or like other like things, who are going to be inside these groups, and rather we say that these kind of crimes is going to increase, never going to be solved in their paradigm too, because there is no rehabilitation. That's actually why we're going to say it's harmful, and because the site is going to be harmed too."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "And thirdly, we say that because these like organizations are not going to like fundamentally harm, and so we say that people who are doing like crips or like other people are going to have infected, they're going to be more a gang, and actually we think these things are going to increase more crimes, more things in society, which means that these organized crimes are going to be going to have more, which is going to harm the society, which they want to say, so actually their stance is very vague, because our site is going to say that there is more harm to them.
