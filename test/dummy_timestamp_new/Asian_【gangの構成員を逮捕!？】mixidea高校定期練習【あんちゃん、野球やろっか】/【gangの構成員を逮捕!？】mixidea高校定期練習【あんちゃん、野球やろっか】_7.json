They said that there are drug smugglers, but we can see that they'll presumably exist on both sides and mutually exclusive. And what we're talking about is domestic gangs who usually hide violent and criminal activities and act tough in public with the police, unable to prosecute them until there's going to be victims.

The opposition side failed to explain how the status quo would decrease the number of crimes compared to the motion. However, we showed that even if criminals make a more complicated network, this motion will be effective because gangs already have this network. But after plan, it will become easier for the police to catch those networks because the police's capability of finding crimes will be bigger and therefore leading to a more effective way of catching criminals."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "If the opposition side was so worried about catching those who haven't committed crimes, then new gang members who want to show that they're innocent shouldn't act tough in public. And our goal is to reduce the number of crimes such as scams and frauds. And why does it specifically have to be this motion? Because gangs are almost always committing crimes and many get away with committing crimes like frauds. And if we let them join a gang, the power of gangs will only get bigger and stronger and better with getting away with crimes."}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "And we think that the opposition side is too optimistic about the reality. Every year many criminals get away with committing scams and frauds and if we retain the status quo, this situation is not going to get any better. And we on the other hand understand how serious this situation is and how this motion would help the gangs rehabilitate and learn about how they could actually earn money without damaging other people in society. And we also want to say that because to compare the status quo and the motion, we want to say that the damage done to gangs is smaller than the damage done to their victims. As we said, we understand how serious the situation is and we want to decrease the number of victims as much as possible. And this motion will help decrease the number of victims, therefore we're superior."}]}
