Firstly, we are fine that if it is in the interest of the employers, they are voluntarily going to do so. And the current rise of these trends is actually increasing, meaning that there are other companies that are able to allow the employees to work from home.

We agree that to a certain extent, employees have a right, but employers also have a right to a certain extent. This is a matter of extent; therefore, we have to assess the pragmatic consequences as to why or whether this policy is uniquely beneficial or harmful for each actor."}, {"start": 602.0, "end": 603.0, "text": "Moving on to the first issue - the interest of the employees. The problem with their case is that many of their problem depictions were not uniquely relevant to the motion. They expected the problem of the child raising issue or disabled people or the stress due to the working. We think those kinds of things are already measured by countermeasures such as the mandate of childcare leave or the mandate of hiring disabled people. Also, the annual aggregate working hour is quite limited by the law.

We think that if these employees feel pressured by the corporations to work well, as they characterize, probably they're always thinking about working during breakfast, for example, during dinnertime or immediately before sleeping. They may be pressured to start to open the computer and start to work. We think that this is a thing that currently many employees are actually claiming in the status quo."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "Therefore, the conclusion here is that the benefit or interest of the employers they describe can be better in certain instances, but it can be worse in other instances.

We think due to that, their work may delay one day, one hour, or maybe weeks. We think those kinds of marginal time differences are critical when it comes to the tech company like fighting against the finance, errors, or bugs in systems, or maybe that if companies have to negotiate with the customers and the business partners in the limited time.

What this is, as I already told you, that got failed to explain or depict in the picture why this policy is uniquely necessary, other than any other measures in the first place.
