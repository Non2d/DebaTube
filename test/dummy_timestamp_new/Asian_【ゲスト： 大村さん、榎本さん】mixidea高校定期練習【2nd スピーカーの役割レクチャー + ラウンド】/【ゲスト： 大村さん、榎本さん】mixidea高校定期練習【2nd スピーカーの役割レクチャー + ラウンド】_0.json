We think this motion has the tolerance of the employees' rights, employers' rights to maximize the profit of the corporation, and the employees' right to expand their choice. But we, as a government, prioritize the employees' rights, even if the employees have some damage by this motion."}, {"start": 1.0, "end": 2.0, "text": "So three things from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, an employee receives harm by the force to come to the corporation in the building. Secondly, in the step-down, the employee can't expand the right-side choice, and the government has to prioritize. And thirdly, the employer's right just to maximize the profit is not prioritized, rather than the employee's right."}, {"start": 2.0, "end": 3.0, "text": "Before moving on, I'll explain regarding the policy. Firstly, we think the employer has to make the effort to guarantee the environment to all of the employees to take the telework. For example, if possible, they have to introduce the internet environment, and if possible, they have to make the new chat room in the corporation. But as long as possible, the employer has the right, has the moral obligation to make the new environment to the telework, so that is the stance from our side of the house."}, {"start": 3.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "Firstly, the employee receives harm by the force to come to the workplace. In the status quo, many people who have the difficulty to go out, there is a very similar. For example, some people have to care for their parents, and some people have to raise their children. And some other people, they are very difficult to work, to come to this workplace. For example, they are very disabled, and they are very difficult to work, and so they are very difficult to long-distance transfer. So that's why many people, right now, have very difficulty to come to the work. Why is it? "}, {"start": 4.0, "end": 5.0, "text": "<POI> So if these employees have to take a look after these parents at home, how can you guarantee that they'll be able to concentrate on their work?"}, {"start": 5.0, "end": 6.0, "text": "I think also in the special treatment, it's also existing in the status quo. But we think, without admitting all of the employees, also these people have the difficulty. That is also explained by this argumentation. "}, {"start": 6.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "So why is this new specialty, sorry, why only some people are admitted, and it's so difficult in these workplaces? Firstly, the other member feels uncomfortable with the special treatment. Sometimes, this colleague thinks they are very subordinate at home, they are very cheating in this workplace. But also, these targeted people are also uncomfortable, because they also know that other people don't have the satisfaction to meet. So that's the reason why, in this special treatment, it's also harm to these people, they have the difficulty to come to these workplaces. That's the reason, I mean, as they're abiding to the protection of all of the employees, this, all of the admission is very important. So that's the reason why we think the norm, the employee come to workplaces is already normalized. So to break up this norm, we think that to admit all of the members is very necessary in the first place."}, {"start": 7.0, "end": 8.0, "text": "Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, in the after-plan, they can expand the lifestyle choices. For example, in the after-plan, the reason is very simple, the mother and the father who can't find this kindergarten, and this is a very small number of the kindergarten, basically in the social program. However, in the after-plan, even if they cannot find this kindergarten, also they can, both of the parents can work at home, and at the same time, they can also care about the children. That's the reason why many different and diverse people can equally work at home. Also, sometimes if they live in Shimane, but they want to work in Tokyo, regardless of the birth rate, regardless of the condition, they can get the benefit at the same time in the first place. "}, {"start": 8.0, "end": 9.0, "text": "That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, after taking this policy, what is the sole benefit? Firstly, regardless of people's environment, regardless of their condition, they can fairly work. That's the reason why in the status quo, only the people who are very, very hard person to work with are only unfairly disenfranchised to get the benefit in the first place. That's why to diminish this unfair damage, this policy is very important in this case."}, {"start": 9.0, "end": 10.0, "text": "Thirdly, why the employee's right is not so important compared to the employee's right. Opposition might say the employer also has the right to make a maximized profit, and without a maximized profit, also it gets harm to this employer. That's why this employer's right is also important. But we think, as long as possible, the employer has to prioritize the employee's right. "}, {"start": 10.0, "end": 11.0, "text": "The reason is very simple. Firstly, the employee is very weaker than this employer, so they can't resist against this employer, because if they are against the employer, they have also the possibility to be fired by this employer. That's the reason why, even there are some difficulties, this employee can't resist against this employer. That's why, as a moral duty, this employer has to protect this weaker position in the first place. "}, {"start": 11.0, "end": 12.0, "text": "Secondly, this employer doesn't get the harm so huge, because the reason is very simple. Also, by this policy, this employer has the chance to hire many diverse people, even in the theater and graduate in Harvard, even in this workplace in Shimane. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, also, if we can expand the admission, this employer also has the possibility to get the benefit. That's the reason why, as long as this employee also has the chance to benefit, this employer's right is not so important in the first place. "}, {"start": 12.0, "end": 13.0, "text": "Thirdly, also, society already admits to protect the weaker position, even if the employer has the harm. For example, in the society, also, this society holds to the cooperation to hire the disabled people. Of course, if we can hire some percentage of the disabled people, this maximizes our profit. Unfortunately, it's not so achievable in the first place. "}, {"start": 13.0, "end": 14.0, "text": "But, ladies and gentlemen, this workplace is very important to live. Without this workplace, many people can't live in the first place. That's the reason why, in order to protect all members of the society, this society already admits to the employer's harm in the first place. That's the reason why, in this policy, it's also applicable to protect the minority people so we get the support."}]}
