Because of this, we believe that, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. Their salaries are low compared to their employers, and their social status is unstable, and they are easily fired by the company when the company faces depression. And we believe that, at this point, the most vulnerable actor in this debate is that employee. And we believe that that's why we have to force all companies to allow their employees to work from home. And that's why we have to take this plan."}, {"start": 201.0, "end": 202.0, "text": "So, first of all, let me rebut the first argument. So, they talked about the productivity will decrease because of the work in the home. So, we have three rebuts here. First rebut is about the employees' benefits. As our first speaker told you, this plan is giving employees more options. And because of this, more employees can work in the company. For example, people who live in Shimane can also work in Tokyo. And not only people in Japan, but also people in a foreign country can also have a large capability of working. The company can also hire these kinds of people if we take this plan. And it will be easier for them to hire these kinds of people. So, first of all, again, there is some benefit for the employers. "}, {"start": 202.0, "end": 203.0, "text": "And the second rebut is about the productivity. So, they said that productivity will decrease. However, in the 21st century, we believe that most of the work is done by facing the PC. So, the desk work is prioritized in the company. So, we believe that these kinds of work can also be done in the home. Although they are in the home. Because they also have enough facility in their home. "}, {"start": 203.0, "end": 204.0, "text": "And the third rebut is that even if it decreases the productivity of the company, we believe that the government has the right to force employers to accept these kinds of damage to some extent. For example, as our first speaker told you about giving example of that company has to hire disabled people to some extent. So, we believe that even if it decreases the productivity, it should be allowed."}, {"start": 204.0, "end": 205.0, "text": "So, let me talk about three things in my speech. "}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "<POI>So, the world you're envisioning is where you're going to have teachers. You're going to have all these employees working at home. How can you guarantee all these security issues are going to be resolved under your house? "}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "So, we believe that the security issue of this debate, security can also be well done in our paradigm. Because we believe that in taking after this plan, we believe that almost all companies will have the environment for providing these kinds of facilities. And we believe that these kinds of home working will be much more done in our paradigm. We believe that much more technique will be developed in our paradigm. So, we believe that these kinds of security problems can be solved in our paradigm."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "So, let me talk about who should we save in this debate. So, who is the most vulnerable actor in this debate? So, this is the employee. First, the point is that employees are more sensitive. Let me talk about the employers. They are top of the company. Their salary is high and their social status is stable. So, they will not be damaged by some minor change. And they only face difficulty when the company has a huge debt. And these kinds of things are much less possibility. "}, {"start": 208.0, "end": 209.0, "text": "And compared to employers, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. So, their salaries are low and their social status is unstable. Because they are easily fired by the company when they face this depression. So, we believe that at this point, employees are more sensitive. And because of this, they are the most vulnerable actor in this debate. "}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "The second point is why do we have to protect the most vulnerable actor? Why do the employers have the duty to protect these kinds of things? This is because the employers get benefits from the employees. So, they have the duty to protect all of the employees. And especially have to protect workers, vulnerable workers. For example, like people who have to raise their children. Who have to care of their parents. Who have difficulty in commuting because they are disabled. They have handicaps. And these kinds of people will be most harmed without help. So, we have to save these kinds of people. "}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "And for example, like in Japan. As I told you, there is a law that employees should hire some number of disabled employees. And so, we believe that in this reason, we have to protect most vulnerable employees. And that's why we have to take this plan."}, {"start": 211.0, "end": 212.0, "text": "And let me talk about why forcing all employees is important. So, first of all, this is because it is difficult for employees to say out when there are some exceptions. So, employees have less power than the employers. So, it's difficult for the employees to say that I would like to work in their home because of their childcare. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all of them not to make these kinds of victims. Thank you."}]}
