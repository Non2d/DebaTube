I will explain the merit of employees and how to go to the companies. In the first place, if a lot of employees don't go to the company, there is no reason to go to the office. It is a very serious point. As the first speaker told you about communication, if an employee wants to do a meeting, they can't do it smoothly because their house is built out of bad reasons. I will explain later. Also, the employee can't correspond quickly to work at home. I will explain this reason."}, {"start": 301.0, "end": 302.0, "text": "First of all, I will explain in the case of employees. Why is it important to go to the company? Because they can limit the quality of life of the company. This reason is that employees can separate their time to their life and working time. The company is a very important space to work.

First reason is that they can't concentrate on their work. For example, if there are a lot of young children at home, they will cry. They want to pray for their parents. It is very serious because the father or the parents can't do their work or can't do the meeting. Also, the case of women is very serious. Of course, women want to take care of their children. However, if working from home is okay, women have to take care of their children. It is impossible to concentrate on their work.
