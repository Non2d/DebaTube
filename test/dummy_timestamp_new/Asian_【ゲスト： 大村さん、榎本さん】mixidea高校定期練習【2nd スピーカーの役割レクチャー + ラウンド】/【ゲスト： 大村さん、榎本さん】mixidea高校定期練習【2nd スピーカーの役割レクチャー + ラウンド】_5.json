The funny thing is, they claimed that employees were vulnerable, but it seemed to me that at the moment in which they introduced this forcible plan, I think it's pretty clear to say they're going to be exploiting them more."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "I'm going to be looking at this debate in two metrics.

I'm going to be talking about two things here. Let's look at the argument of a birth lottery, and you could just work anywhere. They came up here and just stuck to this example of you can hire graduates of Harvard working at a company in Shikimane. First, I don't know how realistic that example is. "}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "I think that's a pretty minor case, but let's say that's a very prominent issue and that we need to actually look at this. I think the issue is that there was no process. I will stress that the biggest issue is that there's probably going to be no central institution because everyone's going to be working at home. What this means is that there's going to be things like online interviews, online meetings, and the issue is this, is that there's no transparency, right? Just because you're a graduate from Harvard doesn't mean they're necessarily capable or that they're capable of doing everything without any kind of mystique. "}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "I think that there are issues like miscommunication when you work at home, that I think these kind of miscommunication and just an increase of procrastination are a lot of things that are very viable. I think that the comparison we need to make is that when you're together and you're able to talk together and you're able to monitor each other to see if they're doing the correct thing, we think that's going to be much better. Therefore, we think that the issue about having graduates from Harvard isn't something so necessary"}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "But I will argue that even if it was so important, I think it's possible on our side because if a multinational company, I think it's possible to have a lot of companies in different places. So the talk about Tokyo and Shimane is also achievable on our side. I think the talk about different companies around the world is also an issue that is very resolvable on our side. Therefore, I think this talk about birth lottery is something that's rather much better on our side."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "Secondly, let's talk about the quality of life. The context they gave was that, hey, have to look after children or hey, that these children have to look after their elderly because they're weak. Given that this is a debate about all employers forcing all employees to work at home, I think they also needed to defend the cases where they didn't have anything. They didn't have any kind of children. They didn't have any parents living with them. I still, given this context, I don't think there's any just reason to forcibly make people stay at home and work there where there could be a lot of security issues, a lot of miscommunication and force these people to stay at home. "}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "But let's say, and let's look at these contexts of having children and grandpa. There's two issues. First is that they say that you could concentrate at home, but I don't think you could really concentrate with a crying baby in the background. I think you're going to be rather focused. I don't think that having your own internal issues at home, but also job issues is necessarily a good thing."}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "But we agree that this argument, this rebuttal isn't enough to resolve this certain issue of, well, having these elderly or having children. And I think that the biggest thing that I want to stress and the thing that government whip never addressed was that these problems like women's issue, like unequal pay, no maternity leave is not a problem of employers not allowing their employees to work from home. I think it is an issue of employers not taking any active and sustainable measures to ensure a sustainable environment. Therefore, I think that what we could do on our side is to make sure that there's going to be maternity leave, make sure there's going to be a sustainable environment, make sure that people don't have to suffer when they go from home and make sure that they have enough opportunities to look after their parents or children. "}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "The government whip only refuted this by saying that, hey, this is only happening a little in the current status quo. Then, hey, if that's the issue, then we will mandate it, right? We don't think that it's necessary to just make it voluntary on our side. We're happy to reinforce these kinds of articles and laws. Therefore, I think in the general quality of life, our side is going to be much better because you don't blur the line between work and life."}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "Anyway, miscommunication happens in the workplace. Why does this extend to become a reason to oppose emotional? I'll talk about that in my next point about companies, and I'm going to involve that in the story about security. There's two points to look at company benefits, and I think it's first, security, and second, productivity and profit overall. "}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "First, let's look at security. I think this is a very important point because these kinds of miscommunications, these kinds of information processing, and the privacy is literally what is able to maintain a company's life. That is the information of a new product or consumer data is something that is really important, and I think it wasn't simply enough for government whip to say, hey, it wasn't so important."}, {"start": 513.0, "end": 514.0, "text": "They said that, hey, it happens on our side, but I think that the biggest issue is that it's going to happen more on their side because I think the security breaches and hacking is a very urgent issue that has to be ultimately resulted where people are able to simultaneously work together in a working environment and try to combat that issue."}, {"start": 514.0, "end": 515.0, "text": "The problem is, on their side, you're going to have people perhaps sleeping at different times, and if you're going to be living in different time zones, you won't be able to simultaneously deal with these kinds of things or miscommunications, which could potentially lead to different products and different types of chaos. I think that when you're separated, you're not going to be able to face these issues much better unless you're going to be in this cooperative environment. Therefore, upon security, I think it's a big issue, and I think it's something that's going to be worse on their side. "}, {"start": 515.0, "end": 516.0, "text": "Lastly, let's look at productivity very simply. They said that, hey, if people don't concentrate, you can fire them. The issue is twofold. First is that it's going to be hard to see if they're concentrating in the first place. That's why it's going to be extremely hard to regulate this."}, {"start": 516.0, "end": 517.0, "text": "But second, it's not easy for the company to fire people because they're literally the companions of a company. I think if every employee is procrastinating, you can't fire everyone. Therefore, upon productivity, we see it's going to be much worse on their side. "}, {"start": 517.0, "end": 518.0, "text": "We think there's going to be security breaches, miscommunication, and a lot of overall breaches of employers' rights.
