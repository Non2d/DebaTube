Firstly, I will talk about why forcing all employees to be in office is critically important in certain instances in order to maximize productivity. Secondly, I will talk about why the corporations, in general, have the right to force employees to act in a certain way. But before that, I will give a response to the House."}, {"start": 101.0, "end": 102.0, "text": "Firstly, they generally talk about the interests of the employees. Firstly, we are not going to oppose a voluntary implementation of work from home by the employer in the first place. If the employer feels it's necessary or it fits the current trend, the employer will voluntarily do so. And recently, those kinds of corporations are actually increasing, especially in the current outbreak of COVID-19. So we think that candidates of those kinds of job hunting have a certain choice to move to another company if there is a dire necessity to work from home. "}, {"start": 102.0, "end": 103.0, "text": "But secondly, in special instances, for example, the mother or father who has to take care of the child all day, or maybe the disabled person, we think in this kind of exceptional case, the states are already enforcing certain welfare for the employees in the first place. For example, the companies have to allow the employees to take care of the elderly, or the company has to hire disabled people. So we think in that kind of instances, the companies probably have a voluntary incentive to allow those disabled employees to work from home if there is a dire necessity. But we think that forcing all employees to work from home is damaging for some instances, which I'll explain later. "}, {"start": 103.0, "end": 104.0, "text": "Secondly, they talk about, well, this is also beneficial for the employees as well. Once again, we are not going to oppose voluntary allowance of these work from home. So we don't think it's an issue in today's debate."}, {"start": 104.0, "end": 105.0, "text": "<POI>Under special treatment, for example, in parental leave, the other employee doesn't regard them as the same employee. Also, this norm is also harmful to these people. Why is it so justifiable? "}, {"start": 105.0, "end": 106.0, "text": "Well, we don't think this is going to be a huge stigma in the first place. The mandate of child care leave or maternity leave is already spreading in society. And also, the mandate of hiring disabled people, or those kinds of norms, is generally spread in Western democracy. We don't think it's a huge deal in today's debate."}, {"start": 106.0, "end": 107.0, "text": "So on to the first issue, why forcing all employees to be in office is in certain instances critically important. So we have the three-level analysis as to why being in office is critically important for increasing productivity or efficiency or speed. Firstly, we think that transparency so that employers are able to check whether the employees are effectively working is quite important. Because if an individual works from home, for example, they can be distracted because of their children. Maybe they talk to them, or maybe they have to talk to their families, and so forth. They may not be able to be focused on the work all the time and all the day."}, {"start": 107.0, "end": 108.0, "text": "And also, there are certain communication barriers that are going to increase. Because if, for example, two employees are in the office, they are able to cooperate."}, {"start": 108.0, "end": 109.0, "text": "Thirdly, we think that in terms of security, being in the office is critically important. Because if individuals are allowed to work from home, maybe their information in the personal computer may be seen by their families or their friends. Or maybe, for example, if people are able to work from home, they can work at a cafe or outside their home. In that kind of instances, there's a certain possibility those kinds of information may be revealed to the member other than the corporation employees. But we think that for these reasons, the productivity or efficiency or speed may decrease."}, {"start": 109.0, "end": 110.0, "text": "And the government might say, well, this efficiency or productivity is marginal. But we don't think it's marginal. We think in certain instances, this lack of efficiency or a bit of delay of the work is critically damaging for the corporation. Because oftentimes, these corporations have to conduct their working in a limited time. For example, in case of the insurance industry, usually March or December is the renewal period. And during that limited period, these kind of workers have to do a lot of work. They have a lot of tons of negotiations. They have to prepare for a lot of presentation or paper material so that they are able to negotiate. And one delay or one day delay or one hour delay may lead to a decrease of the profit, decrease of the premium from those kind of companies. Or in case of tech companies, for example, that people have to repair the error or bugs in the system. We see, for example, this is a finance system, that the one day or one hour delay of repairing those kind of bugs lead to the massive loss for the company or massive loss of trust from the customers. We think this is going to be damaging for the company in certain instances. "}, {"start": 110.0, "end": 111.0, "text": "Therefore, that these kind of corporations are more likely to not allow, no thank you, to employees to work from home. And we think that being in the office and doing the work as efficient as possible is extremely necessary. Therefore, we think that corporations have to do so."}, {"start": 111.0, "end": 112.0, "text": "Secondly, the corporation right, right? So, generally, corporations have the right to limit the employees' choice. In other words, they require employees to act in a certain way. Because the fact that the corporation are imposing the working, meaning that the corporation are already depriving their work, their time in the first place. Or if necessary, for example, the corporation are able to require getting certain qualification in case of the accountants are actually in accordance with the need for the work. Or in case of the teacher, teacher cannot express political opinion during the school, whatever, so forth, because it's required as a job, right? So, in accordance with the job, that corporation are able to limit the action of the employee in a certain way, right? "}, {"start": 112.0, "end": 113.0, "text": "And we think this applies to this motion as well. Because, as I said, that being in the office and increasing the efficiency is critically important in some way, right? "}, {"start": 113.0, "end": 114.0, "text": "And we think the only exception we have that the corporation are not able to do so is that there is a dire need in the first place. For example, in case of child care leaving, like requirement of having disabled employees. Or maybe that, for example, the corporation have to, corporation, like, there's a certain limit on the working times. We agree to that. "}, {"start": 114.0, "end": 115.0, "text": "But we think that as long as corporation are fulfilling those kind of minimum level of the requirement by the government, we think that it's immoral for the government to require even further. Because those kind of efficiency is extremely and critically important for the corporation's sustenance, for the stakeholders as well. Therefore, we beg to oppose."}]}
