You cannot tell other people that you want to do some kind of work or other things. But firstly, if it's that kind of situation, we think that we should introduce this kind of telework to all people. Because if you are the least person who is only doing telework, it's very hard to tell other people that you want to do something at home. For example, I want to take care of our parents at home. It's very hard to say. Because of this, it is very harmful for the individuals because individuals cannot choose these kinds of things.

That's actually why we're going to say that all employees should be allowed to do telework. Because we want to liberalize all people by forcing it.
