So first of all, we are not forcing all employers to like employers to work in telework. "}, {"start": 701.0, "end": 702.0, "text": "So and why we have to force all employers to allow employees to do telework two reasons here is that the first reason is that it is difficult for an employee to claim when they are not all allowed. So only one employer has less power, and it's difficult for them to say that they want to do telework. Although all other employees are working in a company, they will be feared to be fired by the company, and they cannot say such a thing, and they will have a problem in the care of their parents or care of their children or in the commuting.

And we believe that in this point, we have to force all employers to allow their employees to work in their home because without these kinds of things without these kinds of things that which forces all almost all companies will not allow them to work in their home."}, {"start": 703.0, "end": 704.0, "text": "What was our proposal? What was our proposition goal? Proposition goal was that giving more opportunities for people to work, for example, like people who have to care parents or children. And this impact is big because these kinds of people will be face difficulty in finance if they cannot work. We, the government side of proposition side, are giving these kinds of people the opportunity to do work, even though, although even they have some say how they have some how they have to care their parents or children. And why did and what was the opposition side thinks? The opposition side was about productivity."}, {"start": 704.0, "end": 705.0, "text": "So what was our refutation? First about this communication. So today, there is no need to we do have no there's no need to communicate face by face. For example, like we gave the example of email or line or Twitter. This communication will not will not occur and will will not occur in these kinds of paradigms. "}, {"start": 705.0, "end": 706.0, "text": "And second about the security issue. First of all, we think that these kinds of things are out of the debate because it means that it is technically technically impossible to secure these kinds of security. However, even if it is in this debate, we believe that the security company will have the huge incentive to develop the technique, and they will do it will be realized that they have no security issue until work.
