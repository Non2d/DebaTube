Is the dominance of the NIDILSC important and better assured?\nSecond, could the dominance be toxic?

We told you that this vulnerability leads to more social pressure to check on the situation of women, and that social pressure collectively moves the government, collectively moves international organisations, collectively moves the United Nations to change conditions."}, {"start": 603.0, "end": 604.0, "text": "Second, we told you that it creates at least more aid. The pie is an exclusive thing, they get less.\nTheir response is that, you know, children are enough to create sympathy, but also people don't care about the oily aid, which my partner dealt with.\nIt's that the combination of children and women are the relative context, and that's why people are more able to sympathise with it."}, {"start": 604.0, "end": 605.0, "text": "But they don't engage with the nuance of the fact that some people might sympathise with children, but you have to recognise some people also increasingly sympathise with women more than children.\nWe are able to grab the minds of these people, which means that we are able to have more people driven to say that they want to send goods to these areas, they want to donate to these areas, and things like that.\nSo children might be sufficient, but they miss out on important individuals and contexts, like feminists or other individuals."}, {"start": 605.0, "end": 606.0, "text": "But also, see, it also lacks a nuance when we tell you that, you know, it's women that are particularly vulnerable because they are associated with sexual bullying, like rape, or gruesome attacks and things like that.\nThat sort of narrative is impossible when you only use children.\nThat is the most tragic and constant, detrimental situation that people don't even imagine, and that's why they want to help the situation."}, {"start": 606.0, "end": 607.0, "text": "They are moved viscerally that they have to help the situation. That is why women are particularly an important tool in showing the vulnerability of the situation, and it simply does us very negative in the attempt to say that it's no different.\nSince they have a unique power, we get more power to provide aid and whether it's a better issue.\nBut we also told you that it's important that we have a better understanding of the conflict situation."}, {"start": 607.0, "end": 608.0, "text": "It's not that you need more firepower to protect against guerrillas, you need charity provisions, you need more protection about privacy, or better allocation of refugees to avoid rape between men attacking women and things like that.\nAnd their response was that, you know, it's the NGOs that have to understand it.\nBut that's not the point.
