they must have proven two things, which actually are badly explained coming from government side.\nFirst thing is, by removing his dominant narrative, women are going to fight against men, and successfully fight against men, and also men are going to hesitate to attack men to some extent, even though it's 100% men will change to some extent."}, {"start": 501.0, "end": 502.0, "text": "Second thing is, without this narrative, women are going to suddenly make contribution in conflicts, and they are admitted as legitimate actors and not recognized as secondary human beings or so forth.\nBut they never substantiated how women are going to contribute to a conflict society, in a conflict situation, and going to be rewarded, for example, after a conflict, even though they told us in so many situations there's already sexist context in their side of the house."}, {"start": 502.0, "end": 503.0, "text": "And also, I want to clarify what kind of narrative we are supporting from our side of the house.\nBecause government suddenly rejected the narrative they identified from Prime Minister."}, {"start": 503.0, "end": 504.0, "text": "From Prime Minister, they told us, we are talking about shocking image in broadcasting of Western media, and those kind of shocking image creating dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, women are non-violent, that is a setup coming from Prime Minister.\nThen suddenly government said, it's about theoretical dominant narrative, women are vulnerable, and 100% they go against rape, or those kind of attack, and it's 100% safe for men to rape women, those kind of theoretical narrative from their side of the house.\nI don't think it's realistic, right?"}, {"start": 504.0, "end": 505.0, "text": "Because even though we have dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, it's not 100% safe.\nMaybe sometimes women are going against rape, going to fight against men, and sometimes not.\nThat's exactly what we are talking about.\nSo we are arguing how shocking image, or those kind of messed up by MG, or those kind of Western media, is actually beneficial, harmful, for protection of people in need.\nAlso, those kind of depiction is better for post-conflict sexism that Prime Minister has set up recently."}, {"start": 505.0, "end": 506.0, "text": "With that being said, I'll talk about two things in my speech.\nFirst of all, during conflict, this side can better protect people in need, including men."}, {"start": 506.0, "end": 507.0, "text": "And also, we talked about special care for women.\nBut firstly, it's inconsistent with Prime Minister, because they are saying that rape, women, or those kind of depiction is very effective for Western media to attract audiences in their side of the house.\nAnd also, pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate children and women, because in a conflict situation, in many cases, children and women are running to each other, to other safe spaces, and they are detected to each other in their side of the house."}, {"start": 507.0, "end": 508.0, "text": "That's why we think, pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate women and children as the bounder walker in their side of the house.\nThat's why, Mr. Speaker, we think our side is even better for men, because total pile of AIDS will increase in our side of the house.\nAnd also, it is going to increase more accessibility for men, because PKO and people in PKO don't say, because you are men, you shouldn't receive this kind of medicine and this kind of support."}, {"start": 508.0, "end": 509.0, "text": "Also, we told you that big narrative is not so important for militants there.\nAnyway, terrorists kill many people.\nAnyway, those kinds of conservative people will kill and rape women.\nBut we told you, at least militants in legitimate entity are carrying it because they recognize a crime against humanity or those things."}, {"start": 509.0, "end": 510.0, "text": "That's why, in a comparative manner, we think that we are trying to, we are successfully helping more women in the outside world.\nSo, above all, their case might be standing in law school level.\nBut after we explain the context and characterization of the situation of people there, their argument wasn't realistic.\nIn most chaotic situations in the world, they don't care about those kinds of human rights."}, {"start": 510.0, "end": 511.0, "text": "From their side of the house, they said the reason why women are less treated in the post-conflict society was that male victims weren't safe while women are already safe.\nAnd also that men feel they deserve reward or higher rights because they contribute to the ends of conflicts than women.\nBut, Mr. Speaker, regardless of the existence of this narrative, usually women have relatively more difficulty in contributing to the conflict or humanitarian crisis in this military purpose of physical contribution."}, {"start": 511.0, "end": 512.0, "text": "Because just because we remove those kinds of narratives, women are not suddenly going to participate in militaries or not trying to solve the humanitarian crisis in their side of the house.\nSo, which is better?\nIn their side, women are recognized as non-vulnerable and maybe sometimes violent, but they are not contributing to the conflict.\nBut in our side of the house, women have justification not to contribute to the conflict because they are vulnerable, they are physically comparatively weaker.\nThat's why they systematically couldn't contribute to the conflict.\nThat's why, even though they didn't contribute to the conflict, they are not recognized as irresponsible actors or those kind of things.\nWe told you how, right?"}, {"start": 512.0, "end": 513.0, "text": "And also they are saying that in post-conflict society, women are targeted on the street and women at all, not to wear slutty clothes and those kind of things.\nBut we are not talking about those kinds of narratives.\nBecause we are talking about narrative in a conflict, right?\nMaybe when it comes to real society, when it comes to safer places, there are different dominant narratives.\nWomen can do anything that they want.\nWe are talking about the narrative during the conflict situation.\nFor that reason, we think even though logically there is some understanding, we think even though post-conflict female right, we are staying outside the house."}]}
