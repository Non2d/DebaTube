of the house.\nSo the leader of the option refuted to my partner that men will always make an excuse to actually exploit women.\nBut we think that may be true, but if there's less excuses, that means that there are less reasons that they can justify their actions."}, {"start": 205.0, "end": 206.0, "text": "So we think that if there are less excuses, for example, women can fight back and say that

have the right to decide to go outside because I can actually protect myself."}, {"start": 206.0, "end": 207.0, "text": "So first, I want to talk about why aid is still going to go in those kind of conflicts.\nSo even if there's not a dominant narrative, that women are not violent and vulnerable.\nSo we were talking about like, so they talked about we have to show images that women are getting raped, that women are getting, like for example, there's need to dominate narratives of women being harmed and raped or those kind of things."}, {"start": 207.0, "end": 208.0, "text": "But we think that in places where in conflict zone, we think that not only women are suffering of getting raped.\nFor example, in places like in Congo, there are many children and many also men getting killed

not being raped and they don't show a dominant narrative of women being raped, we think that it can also attract the media's attention if some people are actually suffering.\nAnd we think that because there's an overt dominant narrative that women are getting, like for example, suffering, we think that the amount of resources used to save the men or other people are not going to be used.\nAnd we think at the end of the day, we think that the amount of people that can be saved are going to be the same."}, {"start": 209.0, "end": 210.0, "text": "We think on our side, maybe fewer women are saved.\nWe can see to that.\nBut at least maybe more men are going to be saved because of this less dominant narrative.\nAnd we think that in itself is not really a bad thing.\nAnd we don't understand why they want to prioritize women over men.\nWe think all lives are equal.\nAnd if men are maybe more protected, we think that in itself is not really a bad thing.\nAnd we think there are a lot of men who are suffering.\nAnd we think at the end of the day, the number of people who are going to be saved is the same."}, {"start": 210.0, "end": 211.0, "text": "Secondly, I want to talk about which is

actually maybe arm themselves because the West is there to protect them.\nAnd because the West thinks that you have to be protected.\nWe think that is why women themselves do not arm themselves.\nThey

they are capable to arm themselves, they won't be able to do it.\nBecause this dominant narrative is so strong, they are not able to arm themselves.\nThey think that they are vulnerable.\nThey lose hope and protect themselves.\nAnd that actually leads the women to be targets of, for example, a lot of terrorist groups.\nOr they are getting targets of getting raped.\nWe think this narrative in

are seen as people who did not contribute during the conflict zone.\nMaybe they did house chores.\nOr maybe they supported it.\nBut they are seen as secondary individuals, second-class citizens.\nBecause there was less contribution.\nAnd because we are seeing that these people are vulnerable and they did not contribute, we are making society can create a norm.\nThe woman is less
