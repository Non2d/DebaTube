0.0,10.0," The brutality of the Yugoslav war left us with an aftermath that can only be characterized as individuals losing access to basic social and economic rights,"
10.0,18.0," fragile peace that lacks sustainability, and people not knowing where their loved ones are after the chaos of the war has unveiled."
18.0,29.94," Instead of prioritizing the reconciliation of the region and the rehabilitation of the most vulnerable in the region, we see the ICTY to fully focus and fixate on the weakest form of quote-unquote justice, which"
29.94,34.32," is the punitive form. We stand for a more effective form of justice, a more reformative"
34.32,41.32," form of justice. We also value the betterment of civil society, incredibly proud to propose."
41.32,51.12," Before I get into my argumentation, a few points of framing and setup. First, what does our world look like? Our world is one where there are eight"
51.12,56.12, national TRCs in each country within the Yugoslavian region. They report back to one regional TRC.
56.4,60.46, These TRCs are going to be implemented by a local decree with the help and support of
60.46,66.24," the UN, similar to Syria and Union. Those TRCs are going to be non-judicial internal"
66.24,69.16, bodies created from the people and not to the people.
69.6,72.02, We see those TRCs to be made out of three fundamental committees.
72.3,78.2, The first is one that receives and processes applications for amnesty and conducting public
78.2,78.52, hearings.
78.88,82.9, The second is one that is responsible for compensating and rehabilitating victims of
82.9,87.0," the war and the most vulnerable, similar to the R&R within South Africa."
87.0,91.0, And the third and final one is a committee that is responsible for giving out recommendations.
91.0,93.0, Recommendations in three different ways.
93.0,100.0, The first is recommendations of reparation actions to be adopted by the UN and local governments that seek to help and reconciliate.
100.0,105.42, The second is recommendations of prosecutions to national courts.
105.78,109.72," And thirdly, publishing a joint historical record every two or three years"
109.72,111.98, to continuously update the historical record of the war
111.98,114.32, and to not miss any details of atrocities or crimes that are committed.
115.86,120.08," Second idea is, what are the conditions of the amnesty that will be given or asked of the House?"
120.3,121.86, We see three conditions.
122.24,126.12," First, full disclosure on all atrocities or crimes committed and or witnessed."
126.5,129.0," Secondly, the crimes that are committed will have to be politically motivated."
129.8,136.18, An individual has to have a certain level of authority forcing him to do that crime in order for amnesty to be valid and to be granted in the first place.
136.5,148.42," Thirdly and finally, agreeing on doing public hearings and giving our testimonies to the public and giving the public full access to the testimonies that are given by individuals who got amnesty. Thirdly, we think that the implementation of those TRCs is likely to"
148.42,152.64," be effective on our side of the House because of local and presidential decree, funds and"
152.64,156.78," administrative power that is given by the UN, and the fact that the commissioners of"
156.78,161.18," the TRC in the first place are likely to be individuals who are civil society leaders,"
161.18,170.0, are likely to be experts of diplomacy and reconciliation. Fourthly and finally is the fact that the kind of justice that we're explicitly following and pursuing on our side of the house
170.0,174.5, is a reformative type of justice and not the punitive kind that ICTY supports.
174.5,180.5, Our stand is victim-oriented. We don't think that victims get justice when they see a leader who's committed multiple genocides
180.5,189.3," being put behind bars for eight years. We don't think that that's the kind of justice that victims seek on our side of the house. When it comes to argumentation, three arguments."
189.66,194.36," First, on how TRCs lead to better victim satisfaction. Secondly, on how we establish peace in the"
194.36,199.9," region. Thirdly and finally, on how TRCs on our side of the house achieve better governance"
199.9,203.2," in the region. When it comes to the first argument, we prove this in three ways. The"
203.2,207.36, first idea is compensation and access to mental health facilities. It's very important to
207.36,210.72, know for a fact that the incentives of the UN to participate in the region will likely
210.72,215.4, remain the same on our side of the house. We see any kind of financial support from
215.4,221.14, the UN to be reallocated towards establishing the necessary facilities and to provide mental
221.14,228.32, health support for victims and individuals who are most vulnerable of the war and we also see direct financial compensation being given to such people.
228.32,234.92," Secondly, we see scores from NGOs and donors because of more information that we get through"
234.92,241.16," accessing more testimonies, because we are able to record and report on more atrocities"
241.16,247.2," and crimes that are likely to happen, we accumulate records for such crimes and atrocities that happen,"
247.2,250.74," we get a better understanding and a better record on what actually happened,"
250.74,254.28, this is fundamentally important because it gets the region more
254.28,257.58, attention from NGOs who will likely support the civil society. And with the
257.58,261.28, fact that we get victim testimonies and the fact that we allow victims to
261.28,264.48, access the necessary platform in the first place to share their
264.48,266.22," stories and to share these experiences,"
266.6,270.82, this mobilizes individuals that are more sympathetic on our side of the house
270.82,274.08, to support these individuals and to support the region and to donate to it
274.08,276.84, and to volunteer in the region in a way that is supportive
276.84,278.8, and in a way that benefits the most vulnerable.
279.62,283.0," And also, the supportive NGOs will likely be more effective on our side of the house,"
283.2,285.56," no thank you, will likely be more effective on our side of the house because of the recommendations and records that are likely to be given be more effective on our side of the house"
285.56,288.64, because of the recommendations and records that are likely to be given by TRCs on our
288.64,289.64, side of the house.
289.64,293.88, Any NGO that wants to support and be active in supporting the region on our side of the
293.88,297.34, house will have access to information and will have access to more details that is likely
297.34,301.84, to help them and make the allocation of their resources to be fundamentally more effective
301.84,302.84, on our side of the house.
302.84,306.72, The impact of this analysis is that we get better approach towards
306.72,309.92, healing generational trauma and establishing more efficiency
309.92,312.56, in managing resources in the first place and allocating them
312.56,316.08, more effectively towards empowering the civil society.
316.08,317.92," Before I move on to my next mechanism, go on."
317.92,323.2, PRC relies on a passive system where perpetrators have to willingly come out
323.2,327.76, and apologize. Why will it work specifically in the context of Yugoslavia?
327.76,330.6, We think that perpetrators will come out and choose to take the amnesty because they fear
330.6,332.24, to be prosecuted in the first place.
332.24,335.76, They see this as an opportunity to alleviate some of the prosecution that might likely
335.76,338.32, happen to them.
338.32,342.08, We see incentives for them to participate in the TRC to take amnesties and to give out
342.08,344.38, testimony so that they do escape prosecution.
344.38,348.0," Second idea on a more accurate historical record, we have more witnesses on our side of the house"
348.0,353.0, that are testifying from civilians and victims because they do have the incentives on our side of the house
353.0,357.0," to participate because of things like A, platform that is not available in the ICTY,"
357.0,361.0," not everybody can actually go, not all victims can go and testify in the ICTY,"
361.0,363.0, not every individual has access to such platforms.
363.0,367.04," B, the opportunities to face the perpetrator and actually tell the story and actually have"
367.04,371.44," the perpetrator acknowledge the suffering that they have caused to them. C, access to compensation"
371.44,376.0, that is likely to only be granted in case of testifying and actually going out and speaking
376.0,381.12," in the TRC. And finally, the fact that we actually build more momentum to testify because once"
381.12,385.42, individuals who were fit of prosecution choose to step up and testify
385.42,388.82," in the first place, we see that people on the ground are likely to become more committed"
388.82,393.72," and to get a certain level of momentum towards giving out testimonies, they themselves, which"
393.72,397.28, will get us more valuable testimonies because these individuals or people on the ground
397.28,399.02, are more quantity in testimony than the first place.
399.34,404.14, This means that we establish a better joint historical record in the first place that
404.14,405.6, is likely to be written which will help
405.6,410.24, which will help reconciliating experts and will give us the necessary perspective
410.24,413.36, of different victims and different perpetrators.
413.36,416.72, The second idea is that we actually get less toxic nationalism and media war.
416.72,419.68, Less toxic nationalism because we actually now have better education
419.68,422.56, because we give people a better historical record on what actually happened.
422.56,430.04," We focus more on heroic stories that actually show some initiatives of soldiers, for example,"
430.9,434.4, who are supportive to minorities or who are supportive to victims in the region.
434.64,438.64, And we also get better testimonies that give us a better collective image on what actually happened.
438.92,444.16, But what is fundamentally one of the biggest failures of the ICTY is the fact that they failed to manage the media war.
444.16,446.78," On their side of the house, they have narratives that say that Slobodan"
446.78,449.54, Milizavich is a hero. On their side of the house they have narratives that say that
449.54,452.56, these individuals are actually not the perpetrators but are
452.56,457.82, actually the victim. Each country within the region is saying no we're
457.82,461.08," victims, they're victimizing themselves but they're not willing to"
461.08,464.42, accept the fact that they were perpetrators at a certain point.
464.42,467.5, Second argument is on the fact on how we establish better peace in the region.
467.5,470.0," Because of the joint historical record that we get on our side of the house,"
470.0,472.5," by focusing on journalism and public hearing,"
472.5,476.0," on our side of the house, soldiers will only kill and commit crimes,"
476.0,480.0, and do things that are detrimental if they're incredibly pushed to do so.
480.0,485.0," On our side of the house, we have less soldiers who have the mindset of going out and simply obliterating individuals against them"
485.0,490.0, because they do understand that to a certain extent they too are perpetrators and not only the victims in the case.
490.0,496.0," This means that we get more possibility of peace talks, especially because of the social pressure that is likely to manifest on our side of the house"
496.0,499.0, as we're seeing a shift in democracy in the region after the war.
499.0,508.2," Over 200 political parties were established after the war and with the less toxic nationalism that's produced on our side of the house, we bring more possibility for diplomatic and peace talks, war is used"
508.2,509.32, as we are proud to propose.
510.08,514.0," Justice is a prerequisite to reconciliation, not an alternative."
514.62,516.04, We are extremely proud to oppose.
516.4,517.64, I'll do a few things in my speech.
517.9,519.22," First, I'll talk about characterization."
519.9,521.74," Second, some responses to the Prime Minister."
522.2,524.34," And third, I'll forward two arguments from Team Japan."
524.72,527.02," First, on why we better achieve justice for victims."
527.36,529.5," And second, on the achievement of regional stability."
529.98,533.24," Before argumentation, I want to note a few things on praying we do not agree with."
533.62,539.04, We think there are three major differences between the ICTY and the hypothetical TRC we must note.
539.38,541.12," First, on the existence of punishment."
541.6,545.1, The ICTY's main goal was to persecute the most important leaders who
545.1,550.64," spearheaded the war. On the flip, the TRC's goal was to move on. They almost always granted amnesty"
550.64,555.36," to war criminals, meaning this TRC was also systematically unable to persecute individuals."
556.04,561.92," Secondly, on who has authority in each of these institutions. The ICTI was created and is"
561.92,567.08, controlled by the UN to ensure fairness. It was established outside the region by a third party.
567.08,571.28," The TRC on the other hand is created more locally, often by the new government."
571.28,575.74," In this specific scenario, it would be difficult to choose where to place the TRC, but the"
575.74,578.12, point is it would be done inside Yugoslavia.
578.12,583.52," Thirdly, on the budget, the ICTI had a massive budget incomparable of that to the TRC, reaching"
583.52,589.38," ten times the budget of most TRCs. That being said, I want to make a few engagements with the PM and disprove"
589.38,593.62," their claims. On the first thing, they talked in their characterization as how this is going"
593.62,597.92," to work miraculously, where you're going to place different TRCs in eight different countries"
597.92,601.84," and we're going to have one main TRC that's going to work. However, I don't agree with"
601.84,609.3," this because they never, I'm confused by this on two levels. Firstly, this is not going to work, right? There's no incentive for a Serbian to go"
609.3,614.62, to a Croatian TRC and confess. You're seen as a traitor by all your friends and family. You have
614.62,619.4," to get on a plane, travel miles to Croatia just to apologize. But secondly, and most importantly,"
619.68,624.38," the perpetrators are literally in other countries, right? I don't see how this is going to work."
624.54,625.74, This needs to be explained better.
626.24,630.62," The second response I have, their first argument is about better victim satisfaction."
630.8,632.24, I have two problems with this argument.
632.64,636.88," Firstly, they never answer why people will come and testify in the first place."
636.88,639.5, Their only response is that they want to escape persecution.
639.78,649.08," But the fact is that when people do not come and confess in TRCs, they often get away with it with no punishment. Look at South Africa, look at other cases of TRCs. We think there's literally no"
649.08,653.66, incentive for people to come to TRCs. But the second problem they miss is that why people are
653.66,657.2, going to accept their apologies in the first place. We're talking about victims who have been
657.2,661.38," raped, who have had their families killed. We think it is impossible for someone to just accept"
661.38,669.76," an apology when they go to a TRC. They need to prove this from DTF. Moving on to the first argument then, on how the thesis of this argument is that the ICTY"
669.76,674.04, provided better closure and catharsis for the victims who suffered from the war. There are two
674.04,678.66, mechanisms for this argument. The first mechanism is that the leaders got retribution and punishment.
678.66,683.88," Under the TRC, the victims got a tokenistic apology from soldiers. This was inadequate in"
683.88,686.64, curing the deep pain these victims experienced.
686.64,690.96, There are two reasons why the apologies done in the TRC were seen as tokenistic.
690.96,694.32," First, because the only people who went to the TRC were those who,"
694.32,697.36," for entirely selfish reasons, wanted to get amnesty."
697.36,700.08, They didn't come to apologize because they felt sorry.
700.08,702.24, They came so they could justify their actions
702.24,705.26," and show that it was politically motivated, as PM conceded."
705.62,708.8, Those who apologized for selfish reasons did not make genuine apologies.
709.28,713.34," But second, even if the perpetrator were to give an apology from the bottom of their heart,"
713.58,719.7," victims were likely to perceive the apology as tokenistic, as you envision the perpetrators to be inhumane."
720.04,724.38," To these survivors, justice and resolution were unachievable by an insincere apology."
724.74,729.4, It is cruel and wrong to say that a sorry could pay for the suffering these people had faced.
729.78,733.66," In the comparative, under the ICQI, leaders were effectively imprisoned."
733.78,734.38, I'll take it later.
736.86,742.08," This meant that the leaders, the ones who were responsible for all actions committed, were punished."
742.56,745.76," Soldiers and local military generals were merely puppets of the leaders,"
746.06,747.84, cogs in an ever-turning car machine.
748.06,749.18, We punished the real villain.
749.5,750.14, We did it right.
750.24,752.06," We placed the blame where it rightly belongs,"
752.16,753.48, and we brought justice for the infighting.
753.6,754.16, I'll take it later.
754.16,758.9, The second mechanism is that ICTY brought justice even to those who could not speak out.
759.16,762.9," In both worlds, many people were unable to speak out due to extreme trauma."
763.24,768.78, They are individuals who went through such horrific crimes that they are unable to come forward due to humiliation and trauma.
769.04,773.16, It is forcing people to remember the worst moments of their life.
773.84,778.82," The people that come to court hearings are the brave ones, but hundreds and thousands have to scream in silence."
778.82,782.06," For those people, the ICTY can uniquely achieve closure."
782.48,786.52," Under the ICTY, we covered everyone by punishing the leaders who ordered the horrors."
786.76,790.28," This means that when Milosevic got jailed, when people heard this on the news,"
790.68,792.94, all victims of his horrors could place the blame on him.
793.02,794.24, They could point the finger at him.
794.24,796.56," They all felt some catharsis and reprieve,"
796.66,800.3, even if the specific individual who committed some crime upon them was in jail.
800.66,804.26," The ICTY gave everyone, including the most vulnerable, a sense of justice."
804.5,809.0," The conclusion of my argument is simple. We protect victims, we give them catharsis, we give them justice."
809.0,811.0," But before moving on to the second argument, I'll take your QI."
811.0,820.0," On your side of the house, the ICTY punished... there was an arbitrary punishment in which a 75-year-old person was prosecuted and imprisoned,"
820.0,825.24, and Milosović specifically died before the verdict. He died before found guilty.
825.24,827.88, So how do you solve for this arbitrary prosecution?
827.88,832.44, I think you're missing the point because the comparative on your side is you do not punish Milosevic at all.
832.44,834.44, We think it is rather worse on your side of the house.
834.44,836.44, Moving on to the second argument.
836.44,838.44, The second argument from Japan is on peace.
838.44,843.94," The thesis of this argument is that the persecution of the most dangerous leaders is necessary for safety and peace,"
843.94,847.68, which was uniquely achievable under the ICTY. The premise of this
847.68,852.18," argumentation is that under the TRC, wartime leaders stayed in politics. This"
852.18,856.5," fundamental function of the TRC, which centered around not punishing, means that"
856.5,860.22, leaders went unscapped and could stay in politics. Why then would the
860.22,863.76, proposition's world where leaders stay in politics have inflamed conflict and
863.76,869.54," hampered development? Two mechanisms. First, wartime leaders and their ideologies would lead them"
869.54,874.34, to engage in massively harmful actions. These ruthless leaders who committed war crimes are
874.34,879.66, going to continue this foreign ideology. This is because these leaders have to maintain a strong
879.66,885.72, man leader object to maintain where they must be must be seen as a consistent leader and one that
885.72,886.72, will continue to fight.
886.72,890.54, This is amplified especially in chaotic times like war.
890.54,893.18, Leaders are therefore unable to change course or moderate.
893.18,897.66," These leaders, the masterminds behind these mass massacres, continue to rule and continue"
897.66,898.66, to destroy.
898.66,902.88," But secondly, even if these leaders moderate, the existence of these leaders in politics"
902.88,904.44, in of itself would have been harmful.
904.44,907.62," There are three reasons why this is true. Firstly, nations in the"
907.62,911.94, Yugoslav region obviously feel antipathy and antagonism towards opposing nation's
911.94,916.16," leaders. Secondly, major Western institutions like NATO and EU is highly"
916.16,920.46, unlikely to admit post-Yugoslav nations as they are seen as unchanged. This means
920.46,926.16, that nations are unable to access a lot of the monetary and military benefits these institutions offer.
926.76,933.94," Third, and finally, many economic powerhouses in the West, like America, are likely to never reinstate their social economic ties with these nations."
933.94,950.0," The fact that an authoritarian dictator like Milosevic continued to wield power was enough, but the leaders' firm anti-West stance further exacerbated this. This all means that when these leaders maintain power, countries are less likely to negotiate trade deals, maintain regional cooperation,"
950.22,955.84," create economic ties, and improve post-EUCO class stability. So the question is, why was the ICTY"
955.84,960.6, able to solve this? The mechanism by which we achieve solvency is extremely simple. We have
960.6,965.02, jailed tens of these genocidal leaders. The fact of the matter is that people want change.
965.24,967.12, The citizens' will is to create change.
967.42,969.4," Therefore, new leaders will cater to this will."
969.6,973.82," They created a new age of leadership, one that was more democratic and one that was more moderate."
974.22,976.18, The empirical evidence is clear on this matter.
976.48,979.96, Croatia's new leader democratized Croatia and stabilized regional conflicts.
980.34,983.74, Serbia worked to democratize the nation and integrate with Europe.
984.2,986.6, Slovenia and Croatia have returned to the EU.
986.6,989.6, Serbia and Montenegro are candidate countries of the EU.
989.6,992.6, This leads to the conclusion of my speech.
992.6,995.2, ICTY allowed for peace to be achieved in the region.
995.2,998.0, This is why we are able to compete here in Serbia today.
998.0,999.2, Extremely proud of those.
999.2,1005.94," Side opposition is supporting a word in which ICT wise, first of all"
1005.94,1008.14, the punishments were
1008.14,1009.94, not effective. We are seeing
1009.94,1012.14, 75 year old grandpas being
1012.14,1013.78, imprisoned and prosecuted
1013.78,1016.04, and some of them died before having
1016.04,1017.64, a guilty verdict.
1017.96,1019.4, Milosevic died before
1019.4,1022.16, being found guilty. And even
1022.16,1024.02," when they are imprisoned, they are imprisoned"
1024.02,1025.6," in five starstar hotels,"
1025.6,1028.1, tour-prisons. They are not even prisons.
1028.1,1032.8," There are hotels with television, with access to gyms, libraries, etc."
1032.8,1035.9, So we are not looking into real punishment on their side of the house.
1035.9,1040.8, This punishment is an arbitrary punishment that does not allow the victims to reconciliate
1040.8,1046.0," and does not allow the victims to take their rights, their rightful rights on their side of the house."
1046.0,1050.0, So what am I going to do in this speech? I'm going to do three main things in this speech.
1050.0,1054.0," The first of which is rebuttal, the second of which is present my third argument,"
1054.0,1059.0, and the third is to show how we win this debate and how Team Japan needs to respond to us.
1059.0,1065.82," For the first thing on rebuttals, on prosecution, they told us that we do not get prosecutions on our side of the house."
1065.82,1067.14, We would argue two main things.
1067.14,1071.86," First of all, that their prosecutions are arbitrary, they cost a lot of resources, and"
1071.86,1074.82," second of all, they are not really effective for the victims."
1074.82,1079.38," For the victims, I do not really care if the president is in prison, I would really care"
1079.38,1082.44, if my rapist is acknowledging that he raped me.
1082.44,1087.0, I would really care if my rapist failed to apply for amnesty to be prosecuted.
1087.0,1092.0," If my rapist doesn't have the courage to apologize, even if he does not mean it,"
1092.0,1099.0, it's way more important than prosecuting individuals who are not directly my perpetrators.
1099.0,1103.0," We know that they've ordered these things, yet they're not my direct perpetrator."
1103.0,1108.88, They did not rape me on the field. This other person rate me on the ground. This is what
1108.88,1112.9," justice we're looking at. But second of all, on prosecution, on our side of the house,"
1112.9,1117.28," people who fail to apply for amnesty or fail to get amnesty, these individuals"
1117.28,1121.6," are going to be prosecuted by national authority, so we do not lose prosecution."
1121.6,1126.32," On your side of the house, these are the individuals who are going to live without prosecution."
1126.66,1131.24," Why? Because the ICTY focuses on certain atrocities, certain problems."
1131.88,1135.04, Other people are getting out without any punishment.
1135.4,1136.38, They're not being imprisoned.
1136.54,1138.84," On our side of the house, we're focusing on the little ones."
1138.9,1139.72, I'm not going to take it.
1139.96,1141.52, Then we're focusing on the others.
1142.1,1144.3, On the idea of corruption and budget.
1144.3,1147.08, We've told you that the UN is going to participate
1147.08,1148.5," and is going to offer help,"
1148.74,1150.74, as they did in Sierra Leone before.
1151.06,1152.26, So we're not talking about something
1152.26,1153.9," that did not happen before, first of all."
1154.18,1155.0," But second of all,"
1155.26,1158.24, the UN has symmetrical incentives to be part of this
1158.24,1160.36, as they've initiated the ICTY.
1160.64,1162.46," They have the same incentives to create peace,"
1162.68,1164.62, the same incentives to help the victims
1164.62,1165.0," on our side of the house. We believe that the UN is going to peace, the same incentives to help the victims."
1165.0,1170.0," On our side of the house, we believe that the UN is going to participate, so you cannot argue corruption, you cannot argue budget,"
1170.0,1175.0, because it's actually the same between the RCTY and the TRC.
1175.0,1179.0, Moving into why the Syrians are going to testify in other countries.
1179.0,1182.0," We're not saying that these individuals should testify in other countries,"
1182.0,1187.72," we're saying that these individuals should testify in their own country in order for them to get amnesty, so we're not looking"
1187.72,1191.2, to testify in Croatia or other places.
1191.2,1192.8, So what do we get then?
1192.8,1195.38, Why are these testimonies important?
1195.38,1198.76," Because on our side of the house, as we've told you before, we're creating a regional"
1198.76,1206.0, TRC in which it's getting the reports from national TRCs and then it's pushing for a mega narrative that's
1206.0,1211.12, collected from all the national TRCs.
1211.12,1218.16," And moreover on retribution, they told us that retribution is actually effective."
1218.16,1221.84," We did not see how it's effective, we did not see how the people are satisfied."
1221.84,1225.24," This is our status quo. In our status quo, there's fragile peace."
1226.06,1226.32, There's still hatred.
1227.18,1227.76, There's still discrimination.
1228.46,1229.66, This is not... I'm not going to take it right now.
1229.86,1232.1, This is not what we're looking for.
1232.78,1235.1, And why are they going to participate?
1235.28,1235.86, Two main things.
1236.22,1237.68, The individuals who are going to participate
1237.68,1239.78, are individuals who are afraid of being prosecuted
1239.78,1240.58," without amnesty,"
1240.9,1241.88, so they're going to participate.
1242.18,1242.72," But second of all,"
1242.8,1248.48," societal pressure is going to push them into participating. It's a domino effect. When someone's going to participate, the others're going to participate but second of all societal pressure is going to push them into participating it's a domino effect when someone's going to participate the others are"
1248.48,1253.36, going to participate in in the fear of getting prosecuted in the fear of societal pressure but
1253.36,1257.44, second of all we would argue that the victims participation is way more important than the
1257.44,1261.52, perpetrators because the victims are going to participate and they're going to testify
1261.52,1272.5," it helps them in reconciliation helps them in their in their healing passage. But second of all, these testimonies could be used for prosecution"
1272.5,1278.12," of individuals who did not apply for amnesty, who weren't granted amnesty. So I'm going"
1278.12,1279.12, to take it from here.
1279.12,1284.68," Yeah, just to clarify your model, can the Serbian sect of the TRC grant amnesty to individuals"
1284.68,1286.0, who come to the Serbian sect of the TRC grant amnesty to individuals who come to the Serbian TRC?
1286.0,1293.0," Yes, they can, but on our side of the house, these TRC commissioners are not going to be people from within the government."
1293.0,1296.0," These commissioners are experts in reconciliation, experts in diplomacy."
1296.0,1299.0, We might use help from other TRCs.
1299.0,1303.0," We might, like Desmond Tutu in South Africa."
1303.0,1308.8," So we're looking into experts in diplomacy, experts in reconciliation, and civil society leaders."
1308.8,1315.84, So they're most likely not going to give amnesty unless this person really deserves amnesty in which there is a criteria.
1316.26,1322.28," And even in the slightest possibility of these individuals getting amnesty when they do not deserve it,"
1322.38,1324.62," if they're going to get amnesty, they're going to testify."
1328.68,1334.1, So their testimony is way more important than your arbitrary prosecution. Moving to the second idea about peace. They told us that wartime leaders are
1334.1,1338.76," going to continue. Well, we did not see this. The ICTY couldn't prosecute Milošević until"
1338.76,1344.34," he was thrown from his power. So the same applies for us. On our side of the house,"
1344.44,1349.0, the only thing that's different is that we're pushing for more societal pressure in order to achieve change.
1349.0,1357.0," But second of all, on peace, they did not show us how we achieved peace on their side of the house. On their side of the house, peace is not achieved."
1357.0,1370.38," We're seeing military tensions between countries. We're seeing Kosovo and Serbia still now having their conflicts, so they did not achieve peace. What they achieved is a fragile peace that is not important."
1370.38,1379.04," And moving on to my argument, my third argument is about creating better governance. First"
1379.04,1382.36," of all, civil society is going to be hard on our side of the house and our side of the"
1382.36,1388.52," house only, because the NGOs and the commissioners are getting more power. NGOs are participating more when"
1388.52,1392.62," they have more knowledge about what happened. But second of all, commissioners are getting"
1392.62,1397.6," more power in our... these commissioners are civil society leaders, they are religious"
1397.6,1402.16," leaders like Desmond Tutu and like many others. So these individuals, when they are getting"
1402.16,1405.96," more power, we are improving the civil society, which achieves more democracy."
1406.12,1409.92," If they are going to argue democracy, we would argue that democracy is better on our side of the house."
1410.2,1414.74, The second point is delegitimizing mid-rank generals on their side of the house.
1415.12,1420.88, Toxic mid-rank generals are going to stay in power because they are not prosecuted by the ITTY on our side of the house.
1420.98,1423.68, They are either going to apply for amnesty or going to be prosecuted.
1423.84,1428.2," Either way, they are going to be delegitimized and they're going to be thrown out of the government."
1428.2,1431.0, So we achieved this in the worst-case scenario.
1431.0,1436.5," And moving on to why do we create better relations, international relations?"
1436.5,1440.3," Less toxic nationalism. On this side of the house, there are narratives such as"
1440.3,1445.06," the only massacre that happened, the only genocide that happened in the Balkans is against"
1445.06,1449.24, Serbia. These narratives do not allow for international relations and these narratives
1449.24,1452.44," are exclusive to their side of the house. On our side of the house, we achieve less"
1452.44,1457.28, toxic nationalism through better historical records in which individual victims are participating
1457.28,1469.4," in it. It's being written by reconciliation experts. Moreover, we also get better testimonies and records because if I know that an ICTY"
1469.4,1474.7," is going to be established, I'm going to preserve the records which allows me to get better"
1474.7,1481.7," records. So that's why we get better records. So on who achieves justice, we achieve justice"
1481.7,1487.0," that's better for victims. On who achieves better collective historical record, we achieve it,"
1487.0,1494.0," and on who creates better governance and better civil society on our side of the house, we empower all of these."
1494.0,1495.0, So proud to propose.
1498.0,1503.0, The wounds that people have from the Yugoslav war are never healed with a simple apology.
1503.0,1508.44," To the survivors, justice denied is a profound insult, a mockery of their pain and resilience."
1508.44,1514.24," It is a cruel reminder that a world can turn a blind eye to their suffering, proud to oppose."
1514.24,1516.44, My speech will consist of three main aspects.
1516.44,1519.44," First, some top-level engagement as well as clarifications."
1519.44,1520.8," Then, on victims."
1520.8,1521.8," Finally, on peace."
1521.8,1525.36," Firstly, I have three main notes I want to make at the top that"
1525.36,1530.6," largely deals with a lot of their claims. Firstly, that proposition has massive burdens to fulfill in"
1530.6,1534.96, this debate that still go unfulfilled at this point in this debate. They have to prove to us
1534.96,1540.1, that individuals are actively going to come to the TRC and the deputy's one-second response to this
1540.1,1545.2, POI cannot stand in this debate. Proposition wants you to believe two main reasons why people are
1545.2,1550.32, actively going to come to the TRC. They firstly tell you that these individuals want amnesty and
1550.32,1554.8," fear persecution, then secondly on societal pressure. About the first one, I'm going to deal"
1554.8,1560.08," with this in two main ways. One, that people are not persecuted under the TRC. Second, that these"
1560.08,1566.62," leaders especially have very little incentive to put themselves in. Firstly, people are not persecuted under the TRC."
1566.72,1570.9, There are so many people who do not come to the TRC that the TRC and the national court
1570.9,1575.66," system lacks the manpower to persecute everybody, which is why tens of thousands of individuals"
1575.66,1580.22, whose amnesty proposals got denied in South Africa never got persecuted and walk free
1580.22,1581.02, to this day.
1581.34,1585.4, This means that people do not have to fear persecution and proposition
1585.4,1589.92," because people are unable to get persecuted. But secondly, I also want to note that leaders"
1589.92,1593.78," have very little incentive to turn themselves in, especially because these institutions"
1593.78,1598.54, can massively be coerced by themselves. The fact that there is a Serbian sect of the TRC
1598.54,1602.1, and that it is the only organization to which Serbian individuals have to be accountable
1602.1,1605.44, for means that the Serbian leaders no longer have to feel accountable.
1605.44,1608.18, They have so much power in this institution.
1608.18,1611.9, The second problem analysis you get is to say that there is societal pressure.
1611.9,1617.18, This is just wrong because the prerequisite of societal pressure existing is for some
1617.18,1619.5, people at the beginning to be pressured in the first place.
1619.5,1622.04, We proved to you that nobody feels this pressure.
1622.04,1627.12, The implication of the first clarification then is that the proposition has to fulfill this burden of people actively coming
1627.12,1633.2, to the TRC. The second clarification is that the fact that
1633.2,1636.98, proposition wants to clean this idea of a multinational TRC that extends beyond
1636.98,1641.36, borders is the entire downfall of their case. From Contaro's speech we give you
1641.36,1648.02," three main reasons why this is likely to fail to which the only response we get from proposition is to say, well, the incentive to create peace"
1648.02,1650.68, and to be good for victims exists in all of these countries.
1650.98,1651.98, Two problems with this.
1652.24,1655.52," Number one, each country has different ways by which they accomplish this."
1655.72,1658.16, This is why the ICTY was especially functional.
1658.52,1662.9," But also secondly, the ICTY was uniquely forced when in comparison the TRC is voluntary."
1663.3,1669.6, Nations and these wartime leaders who still retain power after the war ended have very little incentive to actively cooperate with the
1669.6,1674.72," TRC, which is an institution that is coming out to get them. I also want to note that this idea"
1674.72,1680.48," of a multinational TRC, and especially the response to the POI I give them, is massively"
1680.48,1688.76," detrimental to their case, because I ask them if the Serbian sect of the TRC can grant amnesty. They say yes. The problem with this is that"
1688.76,1692.78," there's massive bias that remains inside the TRC. This is why, for example,"
1692.78,1697.28," when you look at the South African TRC, zero cases of war crimes committed by"
1697.28,1701.1, black individuals was ever persecuted because the leaders who they claim are
1701.1,1708.68," experts, people like Desmond Tutu, were incredibly biased against white people, which means that TRC was only functional in one way, justice, not"
1708.68,1709.68, multinational justice.
1709.68,1713.18," I want to talk about victims now, but before that, PY, go ahead."
1713.18,1715.78, You're talking about punishing those individuals.
1715.78,1720.24," On your side of the house, you were only punishing less than 161 individuals."
1720.24,1723.72," On our side of the house, even if we do not get debate leaders, at least on our side of"
1723.72,1724.72," the house, there are..."
1724.72,1729.34," Yes, but we punish the right individuals. On victims, our argumentation tells you that the TRC"
1729.34,1734.62, and the victims get tokenistic apologies on proposition. We also tell you that many of our
1734.62,1738.9," individuals are too vulnerable and a lot of individuals are unable to speak out, which means"
1738.9,1742.94," comparatively, uniquely, when we bring justice from the top, we can target everybody, we can bring"
1742.94,1746.12, justice for everybody. We get zero response to this argumentation.
1746.2,1748.14, I think that this massively harms their case.
1748.56,1750.76, Let's look at their argumentation you get from PM.
1751.26,1752.5, They give you a couple of things.
1752.58,1756.78," The first thing Proposition wants you to believe is that the UN is going to spend a lot of money in these reasons,"
1756.98,1759.16, and this is going to help things like mental health efforts.
1759.16,1759.96, Two things.
1760.3,1764.0," One, in the history of the United Nations and the history of the TRC,"
1764.3,1765.16," the UN has never established significant the history of the TRC, the UN has never"
1765.16,1769.72, established significant monetary support alongside the TRC.
1769.72,1773.88, It has only been always through the TRC because the TRC is obviously out of their control.
1773.88,1778.68," But secondly, even if you don't state that, specifically in this situation, in this post-Yugoslav"
1778.68,1783.9," society, it is unlikely that the UN does this because the TRC is dysfunctional."
1783.9,1785.68, All of our other mechanisms are prerequisited
1785.68,1790.34, upon this unless they can improve the functionality of the TRC. The UN has no incentive to drain
1790.34,1791.76, their resources into this.
1791.76,1797.94," The second prop claim to get is on NGO support. We agree, NGOs, amazing institutions, brilliant."
1797.94,1801.98, The problem is that this is a comparative debate. There is zero analysis as to why NGOs
1801.98,1805.36, are in any way unique. NGOs exist in the world as well.
1805.78,1809.44," Thirdly, proposition will have you believe that they create a better historical record,"
1809.72,1813.72, but the ICTY is just as well able to gather information. But let's take their best case.
1813.74,1817.24, Let's say they're talking about different kinds of information. Maybe they're talking about more
1817.24,1821.72, victim-centric information. The problem with this analysis is that we prefer a world in which
1821.72,1827.36," victims are unaware of what happened to their relatives, because we believe that this allows for better rationalization."
1827.78,1832.22, It is better to have information hidden from you as it allows you to rationalize and deal with the trauma.
1832.56,1835.1," Rather than finding out that your son was abused and tortured,"
1835.4,1838.92, you craft this idea in your head that he died an honorable death in the battlefield.
1839.32,1842.16," Rather than finding out that your mother was raped and beaten to death,"
1842.34,1844.7, you believe she died peacefully in your father's arms.
1844.98,1847.76, Imagination is the antithesis of depression.
1847.76,1851.6," I finally want to talk about this case that you get from the intro, that these individuals can"
1851.6,1856.48, just forgive and move on because of the wonderful institution that is the TRC. The problem with this
1856.48,1861.28," case is that forgiveness cannot happen. An apology cannot redeem a person who raped you, who abused"
1861.28,1868.16," you, and who basically messed with your entire life. Maybe a few people will forgive their perpetrators, but for the vast majority of individuals who"
1868.16,1871.52," are not going to look a murderer in your eye, once they say sorry you just go,"
1871.52,1876.96," oh all is forgiven, let me move on with my life. This victim argumentation is massively important"
1876.96,1881.36, because this argumentation is the only argumentation that holds any ground in this
1881.36,1885.48, debate. The ICTY and TRC are just fundamentally not strong enough
1885.48,1887.26, to create massive change in society.
1887.58,1890.26, They're unable to do things that create massive scales of peace
1890.26,1891.68, or massive scales of conflict.
1891.96,1894.22, We think that the only large impact in this debate
1894.22,1896.78, and the only impact that is massively important in this debate
1896.78,1897.56, is on victims.
1898.28,1899.8," Next, I want to deal with peace."
1900.32,1902.16, Proposition has a couple of analysis here.
1902.24,1903.2, The first thing is NGOs.
1903.34,1906.24, I've already told you NGOs exist just as much in our world.
1906.24,1908.34," Secondly, they tell you about mid-rank generals."
1908.34,1910.24," But once again, there are two problems with this."
1910.24,1914.2," One, that you get no analysis as to why mid-rank generals even come to the TRC."
1914.2,1917.14," And second, that they're unable to prove the comparative to you, that mid-rank generals"
1917.14,1921.76," are not prosecuted under the TRC, that the TRC does not prosecute individuals."
1921.76,1925.44," Thirdly, proposition tells you a case about finger pointing and how"
1925.44,1930.72, we uniquely bring this idea that we point fingers at each other saying the other person is wrong.
1930.72,1934.88, The problem with this is that finger pointing is not against ethnicities in our world but rather to
1934.88,1939.84, wartime leaders. The ICT right specifically focused persecution on leaders and did not label one
1939.84,1944.16, ethnicity as the bad guy which means finger pointing did not happen in our world. But I
1944.16,1947.44, also want to flip this argumentation because because the finger-pointing that the leaders
1947.44,1950.78, did rather reduced ethnic division.
1951.12,1954.72, This is to say that once you're able to blame the leaders for the conflict and see that
1954.72,1958.38," they are the fundamental reason why conflicts happen, and that they are the demons that"
1958.38,1962.78," manipulated others to orchestrate feelings, that is when you can vent your anger."
1963.26,1968.8," The conclusion of this argument, and the conclusion of this debate, is that Team Japan takes this debate in two main ways. First, we"
1968.8,1973.24," protect victims. This is the most important class and this is debate 20. But second, we win on"
1973.24,1980.16," propositions metric on peace. We do not think the ICTY is perfect, but the TRC is a dysfunctional"
1980.16,1985.92," mess of prejudiced individuals that does nothing to solve the post-Yugoslav crisis, to absolve"
1985.92,1991.78," the traumatized individuals, or at the very least to ease their pain, the ICTY was absolutely necessary."
1992.32,1997.04," We believe that in this debate, side opposition was blinded by the idea of prosecution that"
1997.04,2002.4," supposedly satisfied victims as well as served the nation justice. We believe that, as they said,"
2002.4,2008.68, the only mechanism for them to prove this case was through the prosecution of these oppressors. We believe that their
2008.68,2013.68, entire case neglected three core ideas within our speeches which is first of
2013.68,2017.34, all we get a platform in which accurate history is written. This has a lot of
2017.34,2021.72, benefits for victims as well as the nation. Second on the idea of closure and
2021.72,2033.96," how beneficial it is for these victims lives and lastly on acknowledgement of atroc, which is fundamental in a way in which we allow these victims to feel that these oppressors acknowledge the oppression that occurred,"
2034.24,2037.34, as well as taking responsibility of all the atrocities that they committed.
2037.6,2039.66, We believe that we win on two main points.
2039.78,2043.22," First, on the idea of providing victim relief and the right to know."
2043.32,2048.16," And second, on the idea of how we better deal with the aftermath of the war and therefore we get better outcomes"
2048.16,2049.02, for the nation.
2049.3,2055.22," First off, we agree completely with what opposition said, which is the goal of the TRC was never"
2055.22,2056.06, about prosecution.
2056.26,2058.14, This was never a priority within our case.
2058.34,2062.16, We believe that the prosecution that they were fighting for within their entire case
2062.16,2069.82, simply did not work in the status quo. What we saw was is that people on the edge of their grave are getting prosecuted for
2069.82,2072.94, like four years after like 17 years of trial.
2073.22,2074.54, This was a waste of resources.
2074.54,2081.28," This was a long, long-waited verdict that simply did not serve these victims anything"
2081.28,2085.56, beneficial because these leaders were not
2085.56,2089.76, put in a corner in which they had to confess for the crimes they did. They still had
2089.76,2093.88," legitimacy to deny everything they did, they still had the legitimacy to get out of"
2093.88,2098.26, jail and continue living their lives with a lot more legitimacy than
2098.26,2101.56, they would have on their earth at the house because of things like narratives that
2101.56,2107.94, Milozovic was still a hero even after he was prosecuted because the guy didn't even acknowledge the atrocity that he committed towards his own
2107.94,2108.26, people.
2108.58,2113.96," Therefore, an important note to highlight here is that even if we assume that something"
2113.96,2117.72," like this was very detrimental when we're talking about no prosecution, we still did"
2117.72,2122.32, not get full access to amnesty to whoever wanted it.
2122.32,2125.44, We gave very specific metrics as to how the CRC
2125.44,2130.26, globally worked. It was meticulous ways in which individuals needed to provide
2130.26,2134.7, significant information. They needed to be cooperative with the court. They could
2134.7,2138.6," not get amnesty as they pleased. They had to abide by certain criteria. Therefore, we"
2138.6,2142.64, do not see how their points on how these individuals can simply still walk freely
2142.64,2149.08, is true. Even if we do not get their prosecution we still believe that we win on a lot more by delegitimizing these politicians which
2149.08,2153.28, I'll be getting into later on in my speech but even with our worst case scenario in which
2153.28,2157.6, prosecution simply does not exist under our side of the house we have a lot more mechanisms as to
2157.6,2162.6, how we benefit the people within our status quo when we're talking about the idea that victims
2162.6,2186.56," will not be satisfied if their oppressor continuously denies everything they committed to them, continuously sells out narratives in which they are not victims at all, we believe that this is simply an injustice that side opposition needs to concede to. because of a lot of points. When we're talking about victims and normal citizens, a lot of individuals are very vulnerable"
2186.56,2189.06, when it comes to the ability of national courts
2189.06,2190.04, to prosecute them.
2190.08,2192.24, We are not only talking about leaders of nations
2192.24,2193.74, or highest-ranking officials.
2193.74,2195.56, We are also talking about millions
2195.56,2197.16, who contributed to the oppression.
2197.44,2199.48, If we are not getting the 5% of individuals
2199.48,2201.8," that contributed to these atrocities,"
2201.92,2203.82, we are getting a lot more than they are
2203.82,2206.96, when we are talking about less resources being spent forcing the truth out of these
2206.96,2210.92, individuals because of the idea that they willingly get up because they are
2210.92,2214.4, far more afraid of prosecution and second all the idea of victims and
2214.4,2218.82, trauma and how they will likely not get up and testify. We believe that a lot of
2218.82,2227.76," individuals are filled with malice in which they need to face these oppressors, in which they do not have"
2227.76,2231.5," any other platforms on the very side of the house to gain legitimacy in Jerusalem, we"
2231.5,2235.86, believe that the TRC provides an exclusive way in which these victims can raise their
2235.86,2236.12, voices.
2236.26,2240.2," On the clash of victims, then, we believe that we win this idea on three main points."
2240.28,2247.24," First, on the idea of acknowledgement of oppression, they needed to concede to why acknowledgement of oppression is significantly fundamental"
2247.24,2250.22," when it comes to moving on from these oppressions,"
2250.44,2252.82, when it comes to these victims actually feeling the satisfaction
2252.82,2254.62, not just seeing these oppressors behind bars.
2254.8,2255.94, When we're talking about perpetrators
2255.94,2257.58, continuously denying responsibility
2257.58,2258.82, of the crimes that they committed
2258.82,2261.92, and delegitimizing the impact on the victims
2261.92,2264.76," and sometimes outright denying the occurrence of the crime in general,"
2267.0,2271.2," the comparative then panel is, under side opposition, we get the idea that they have the legitimacy to deny, they have"
2271.2,2274.64, the legitimacy to get in and out of jail and still gain power when we're not
2274.64,2279.2, seeing actual confessions and other people willingly exposing other
2279.2,2282.5, commanders. When we gave you the analysis on toxic nationalism and how we decrease
2282.5,2308.4," that, there was very specific analysis when we were talking about the dynamics in which individuals, when they recognize the existence of the TRC, they now want to protect themselves through exposing other criminals, criminals above them they have been trying to fight for when we're talking about victims um they won't necessarily care"
2308.4,2312.8, enough if the same oppressor simply denied the oppression that happened and still claimed
2312.8,2318.32, innocence even if he is behind bars they needed to prove why the actual action of them being in jail
2318.32,2322.88, was enough for all of these people to just nod their head and simply move on from the case and
2322.88,2328.6," actually be satisfied under our said the house first, we either get confessions in our best case scenario and in our"
2328.6,2333.2," risky scenario, we get a lot of people willingly exposing individuals because they can get away"
2333.2,2337.3," with a lot of things that they were forced to do, as well as the idea of wanting to move on as"
2337.3,2342.14," citizens who are also very affected by the war. But second, on the idea of closure, when we're"
2342.14,2345.18," looking at a mother who saw her son leave and never come back,"
2345.22,2349.24," she will wait 15, 20 years for him to come back, never knowing if he died or not."
2349.42,2351.44, This is something that keeps them up day and night.
2351.62,2357.14," This is stress that they cannot deal with, that they do not have mental institutions for them to go and seek help from."
2357.14,2362.86," Under arson, the house, even if it is very detrimental for these individuals mentally to know about all of these things,"
2363.22,2367.62," in the status quo, I believe that it is very good for these individuals to know about the truth"
2367.62,2371.58, first off on the idea of closure but second very important when we're talking
2371.58,2375.0, about knowing what happened knowing what others committed to the people you love
2375.0,2378.32, you can now hold them accountable if I am living in a false reality in which
2378.32,2383.36, the same oppressor I simply do not know what he committed to the
2383.36,2387.54, people I love I will not have the incentive to push for justice
2387.54,2389.34, because I do not know that he raped my mother.
2389.56,2391.1, I do not know that he kidnapped my son.
2391.34,2393.02, These are all things that we get under oath in the House.
2393.28,2395.56," Lastly, on the idea of compensation, which is exclusive."
2395.82,2398.54, They tried to mitigate this on the idea that the UN doesn't have incentives
2398.54,2400.12, and that NGOs are symmetrical.
2400.44,2403.46," First off, the UN and the EU have had incentives"
2403.46,2405.5, to pump a lot of resources into the ICTY.
2405.5,2410.5," When we're talking about $4 million spent on one case in the ICTY, we see the capability"
2410.5,2411.5, of pushing resources.
2411.5,2414.5, We also see the incentive of actually securing peace.
2414.5,2416.5, This is something that does not change on our side of the house.
2416.5,2421.0," And when we're talking about NGOs, which is very significant, NGOs need an incentive"
2421.0,2422.0, to push more resources.
2422.0,2426.6," When we see the actual transparency of atrocities, when we're seeing the extent of oppression,"
2426.86,2428.9, these NGOs have even more of an obligation
2428.9,2432.22, because there's even more harm for them to actually interfere.
2432.48,2433.66," We believe that under our civil house,"
2433.8,2436.46," once these victims have an incentive to gain compensation,"
2436.64,2438.96, this is also something that gets them to testify.
2439.3,2441.2, They will also get a lot of benefits
2441.2,2443.32, when it comes to living their lives in a better way.
2443.4,2448.08," We have seen how they gain job opportunities. We have seen how they gain food, shelter."
2448.3,2451.86, A lot of these things do not exist under opposition side of the house.
2451.98,2456.22," Lastly, on the idea of politicians in government. Both sides agree that the existence of corrupt"
2456.22,2460.18, politicians within government is very bad. But we are talking about
2460.18,2464.22," powerful people and how they characterize them to not care enough. First off, we don't see why they will"
2464.22,2466.32, cooperate on either side of the house if they are saying that they
2466.32,2469.62," have the power, they have the stubbornness, and they have the influence to definitely"
2469.62,2473.48," not cooperate with the TRC. Why would they cooperate with the ICTY, for example? But"
2473.48,2477.74," second, we don't see how, under their side of the house, they do not have the same influence"
2477.74,2483.76," and the same power to highlight the best lawyers, the best team, in order for them to actually"
2483.76,2487.16," win cases. And even if we assume that they do not do that, under their side of the house,"
2487.36,2490.3, trials spend 17 years to actually get a verdict.
2490.54,2493.14," We believe that under our side of the house, we get the truth, we get confession,"
2493.28,2494.34, very proud to propose.
2494.88,2499.42, This is a proposition that will have you believe that people of the eight regions
2499.42,2504.7, will magically and suddenly be able to unite and cooperate with one single TRC.
2505.1,2509.78, This is a proposition that happily believes that perpetrators will willingly come and apologize
2509.78,2515.32," when we tell you that in real world, most of the cases are simply going to go uninvestigated."
2515.58,2520.74, And this is a team that believes that a simple apology is able to liberate so many of the victims
2520.74,2522.98, that went through the struggle on their own.
2522.98,2528.48," This is a team that is simply ungrounded in reality, which is why we use this debate. I want to chat about three things in my"
2528.48,2533.68," speech. Firstly on the implementation of the DRC, secondly on victims, and finally on peace. But"
2533.68,2537.12," before that though, I want to make three clarifications at the top of my speech."
2537.12,2543.28," One, they say this is resource intensive under ICPY. Two responses. Firstly, they never prove"
2543.28,2545.46," why this is actually bad in the first place, right?"
2545.46,2550.4," Because I think you are taking these resources from UN, which is quite well known for how much money they have,"
2550.4,2555.1," it's unclear to me why this is actually a bad thing. And I would flip this and tell you that it is if, like,"
2555.1,2560.76," I think that the fact that you use some sort of resources under TRC and ICPY is metric, and given that the local"
2560.88,2570.14," individuals, for instance Bosnians, don't have much money when compared to the UN, they are more likely to harm the old times of harm that they want to talk about on their side of the house."
2570.36,2575.1," But secondly, I would argue that this ICPY being resource intensive is actually a good thing."
2575.1,2579.72," Because this means that the UN is actually going to use more resources on doing things like investigation,"
2580.1,2583.58," and doing things like using resources to actually catch criminals, for example."
2583.82,2587.18, Which is why they simply cannot throw away the buzzwords of resource-intensive
2587.18,2588.2, and assume it will fly.
2588.38,2590.02, We would tell you that this is actually a good thing.
2590.28,2593.66," Secondly, let's take a look at the strategy of the pro-NGO team in this debate."
2593.94,2596.54," They say, oh, this looks like NGOs and UNs."
2596.7,2600.72," Not only is this symmetric, we in fact do it better on our side of the house."
2600.92,2601.18, Why?
2601.38,2604.38, Because the biggest difference between ICTOI and TRC
2604.38,2605.36, is that TRC
2605.36,2611.68, is locally driven by the people when compared to ICTY which is driven and actually created by the
2611.68,2617.36," UN and therefore if the western countries actually invest in those kind of ICTY in the first place,"
2617.36,2621.68, they have the maximum incentive to actually want the ICTY to succeed to begin with which is the
2621.68,2628.84," exact reason why you are more likely to have things like NGOs and UN actually located in the region to begin with, which is why I think their"
2628.84,2631.24, strategy at this point in time is not standing.
2631.24,2634.12," Finally, they say that the leaders are not going to opt in."
2634.12,2637.62, The reason why this doesn't stand in the debate is that they don't understand how
2637.62,2638.62, ICTY works.
2638.62,2643.24," ICTY under that, I think individuals do not literally get to choose whether to opt in"
2643.24,2644.24, or not.
2644.24,2649.12," Milosevic in fact didn't opt in into ICTY, but he was still prosecuted because he was a war criminal."
2649.12,2653.04," And in fact, what requires opt-in is the TRC on their side of the house."
2653.04,2657.02," Which is why if they want to talk about opt-in, it is worse on their side of the house."
2657.02,2659.02," Firstly, but before that I'll take a point."
2659.02,2663.52, You're talking about these individuals not opt-in the ICTY and the TRC.
2663.52,2666.16," We've seen many cases in the ICTY,"
2666.16,2672.08, many atrocities were not found due to destroying records and many other things. The investigation
2672.08,2676.64," team did not have access to many places because of these individuals. So on your side of the house,"
2676.64,2680.72, yes you do not get these individuals unless they're overthrown from power.
2680.72,2684.72," Comparative. Firstly, let's talk about the implementation. All of their benefits that"
2684.72,2688.48, they want to talk about on things like recourse or more stories and information and
2688.48,2693.28, perpetrators acknowledging the crime were contingent on PRC working in the very first place.
2693.28,2698.48," We tell you two things. First of all, unfeasibility. We want to tell you that the categorical difference"
2698.48,2706.56, between PRC in South Africa and this hypothetical PRC that might happen in Yugoslavia is that when TRC
2706.56,2711.12," came into place in South Africa, the government was already against the discrimination there."
2711.12,2716.48," In the comparison, for Yugoslavia, even after the war ended, Milosevic, the war criminal,"
2716.48,2722.16," was still in power until ICTY detained them. I think this answers the question from them,"
2722.16,2726.68," on ICTY. They say, oh it didn't work because Milosevic already died, right?"
2726.68,2731.38," No, because Milosevic was only able to be removed out of the office when precisely because"
2731.38,2736.32," the ICTY actually prosecuted them and detained them, which is why I think we do the implementation"
2736.32,2737.32, better on our side of the house.
2737.32,2738.32, It simply cannot work.
2738.32,2742.76," But even if the implementation does work, we tell you that simply it's actually bad"
2742.76,2749.2," strategically for their side of the house, since can tell you that for the Serbians, like literally if you can go to a Serbian court,"
2749.2,2753.44," you have no incentive to actually go to the Bosnian court, right? And therefore insofar as"
2753.44,2758.48," biases exist, I think you are much able or much more likely to actually get amnesties. And insofar"
2758.48,2763.36," as a lot of perpetrators are outside of the country, it is simply not going to work on their side of the house."
2763.36,2767.36," Secondly, let's break the premise of the government's case because they say perpetrators of the country, it is simply not going to work on their side of the house. Secondly, let's break the premise of the government's case because they say perpetrators"
2767.36,2770.8, of the crime aren't going to willingly come. The first mechanism they throw is that they want
2770.8,2775.36, amnesty and I think Stacey tells you the reality that most of the crimes are actually under
2775.36,2779.44," investigated in the first place. But secondly, often the leaders have a massive incentive to"
2779.44,2783.04, hide it and hide the past information which has meant that you cannot get the information on
2783.04,2789.0," their side of the house. But third of all, I think the reason why you simply don't get prosecuted on either side of the house,"
2789.0,2794.0," even if you don't simply apologize, is because I think the burden is beyond reasonable doubt,"
2794.0,2797.0," and when there's so many evidence and so many information,"
2797.0,2801.0," you simply cannot, like, simply definitely prove that this person committed a crime 10 years ago,"
2801.0,2807.28," which is the exact reason why this person probably, I agree or not, is not not going to say sorry on their side of the house. Then they say social pressure,"
2807.28,2811.44," but this is contingent on this first mechanism. But secondly, even if there are social pressures,"
2812.56,2816.72, people cannot identify who is perpetrators or not. So I think this social narrative is
2816.72,2822.56," not what we're saying, so thank you. But even if apologies do exist, we tell you that this"
2822.56,2825.0," isn't sincere. And even if it is sincere,"
2825.0,2828.92," victims simply cannot perceive this to be sincere, which is why their lack of response"
2828.92,2832.76, to our first argumentation hits them at its harshest.
2832.76,2834.96," Finally, let's talk about victims."
2834.96,2838.92," The first thing they say is that victims don't want retribution, they want acknowledgement"
2838.92,2841.68, that the rapist admitted that they admit the crime.
2841.68,2848.96," Just notice how unintuitive that case actually is because according to their logic, I kill your mother and I show you the recording of me killing a mother and I"
2848.96,2853.2, apologize and then the victims aren't going to move on. That's simply so unintuitive right? I
2853.2,2857.68," think what they want is like a catharsis, the fact that you are able to actually punish them and put"
2857.68,2862.16, them under bars and actually let them go into the same struggling that they have went through which
2862.16,2870.32," is why I think this is a comparative debate. Second thing they say is that, oh, this, like, justice is simply slow, and that an under-ICTY is so slow."
2870.32,2871.44, There's two responses.
2871.44,2878.0," Firstly, this is untrue. The process by which we achieve justice in the ICTY is cathartic in and of itself."
2878.0,2881.52," The fact is, the fact that Milosevic got sent in the detention center,"
2881.52,2884.0," and the fact that the victim stood up and explained what happened,"
2884.0,2888.4, the fact that a detailed investigation is being conducted in the first place is in and of itself
2888.4,2893.84," cathartic for the victims even if Milosevic is not going to be sent into prison. But secondly,"
2893.84,2898.88," even if you don't buy that judge, it's a best metric because the TRC can only be placed after"
2898.88,2904.56, the war is over as it is to address the aftermath and to move on. The ICTY started before the war
2904.56,2905.28, ended.
2905.28,2907.52," Furthermore, leaders were put into detention centers"
2907.52,2910.04," while waiting for trial, which is why I think,"
2910.04,2912.46," like, ICTY can start before the war ends,"
2912.46,2914.68, which is why I think this is simply better.
2914.68,2917.68," Finally, they say that, oh, you have more information."
2917.68,2919.5, Seiji already tells you that more information
2919.5,2922.02," is actually a bad thing, because I think imagination"
2922.02,2928.64," of you imagining that this, your mother died peacefully, is able to actually give you solace. Finally they say oh this is"
2928.64,2932.36, symmetric right but it's actually not like obviously it's better on their set
2932.36,2935.42, of them on our set of the house you need to be out compared like a little bit
2935.42,2938.96, more comparative here just saying that I think you might have some flaws in it is
2938.96,2943.76, not able to actually win them the debate. But even so even if you finally I want
2943.76,2946.88, to do some bit of weighing here even Even if they take on some levels of
2946.88,2952.48," victims, the one mechanism that is simply not responded to at this point in time is this idea"
2952.48,2957.12," that a lot of the victims simply live under trauma, that they are incapable of actually going"
2957.12,2963.28," up into the court. But on our side of the house, when ICQI literally prosecutes one single leader,"
2963.28,2965.28," for example, who is responsible for"
2965.28,2969.06," a lot of the atrocities, that is at the point at which we are able to actually give these"
2969.06,2973.0," kind of like, catharsis to the most vulnerable victims on our side of the house."
2973.0,2978.5," Finally, on peace, because I think at 24 minutes of side proposition, we still do not respond"
2978.5,2982.62, to our second argument as to why the only way in which you can actually get those leaders
2982.62,2990.72," out of the office is by prosecuting them, and under TRC, Vlasovic would have still had power. For all those reasons, we think we win"
2990.72,2995.74," under methods as well. The proposition in this debate is very, very good at telling us what the"
2995.74,3001.9," problems of the ICTY was because we agree, the ICTY was definitely not perfect. It was oftentimes"
3001.9,3008.0, wrong. It was oftentimes not very good at what it was meant to do. But the problem with the proposition is that they can never prove
3008.0,3012.3, to us that the TRC was in any way better because the TRC is a fundamentally
3012.3,3016.4, passive system that is pre-represented on opt-in. This is the biggest burden the
3016.4,3020.12, proposition had to fulfill in this debate and this is why proposition cannot take
3020.12,3024.54, this debate. I want to firstly deal with one clarification. Can people be
3024.54,3025.66, persecuted under the
3025.66,3034.68," DRC? They say yes, and they say they proved this to you through their model. Our response was that"
3034.68,3038.74," no matter how much you can model, there's a fundamental lack of resources, that you are"
3038.74,3043.78," unable to prosecute the tens of thousands of individuals who aren't granted amnesty, that this"
3043.78,3050.1," is backed up both by their examples and by ours, and that therefore fundamentally, tens of thousands of individuals who aren't granted amnesty, that this is backed up both by their examples and by ours, and that therefore fundamentally, tens of thousands of individuals"
3050.1,3054.16, are going to go unprosecuted even if they do not come in and apologize and even if they
3054.16,3056.36, do not opt in into the TRC.
3056.36,3058.42, The implication of this was twofold.
3058.42,3062.84," Firstly, that this harms a lot of their case which is prerequisited upon buy-in, but also"
3062.84,3068.16," secondly, that people are no longer going to buy into the TRC because they have no active incentive to do so."
3068.16,3072.0," If you have nothing to fear, if there is no prosecuting awaiting you if you do not opt"
3072.0,3077.36," into the TRC, then you are not going to opt in to the TRC and accidentally admit what you did."
3077.92,3081.2," With that said then, let's dissect this debate in two main flashes."
3081.2,3086.08," First, on victims. Proposition throws out a lot of material to you. Let's cover"
3086.08,3090.58, each one. They say four things. They firstly tell you that institutions like non-governmental
3090.58,3095.7, organizations or the United Nations are actively going to invest more resources into this area.
3096.1,3100.62," Our one and simple response to this is that this is largely symmetric, if not better, in our world."
3100.9,3109.88," That the incentives for the UN and NGOs to invest in these worlds, in these areas, exist at the very least in both worlds, and therefore NGOs and their existence"
3109.88,3111.68, in these areas are symmetric.
3111.68,3117.18," Secondly, they claim on, they have the claim on how they get a better historical record."
3117.18,3121.52," Our response to this is very simple, that a better historical record is contingent on"
3121.52,3129.12," opt-in and support, and that this is not only going to not be possible due to the clarification I gave you earlier, but also the fact that"
3129.12,3134.24, they create this institution across borders and create a multinational TRC actively hampers
3134.24,3136.48, their ability to create a historical record.
3136.48,3138.84," Because think about it, gut check this, right?"
3138.84,3143.4, Actively antagonistic leaders of eight nations who were at war for a decade are not going
3143.4,3145.08," to come together and say,"
3148.88,3153.58, this is what history was. We can agree on what the horrors that were committed during the Yugoslav war. Agreement is not going to happen. This multinational framing harms their
3153.58,3158.46, case. The third thing you get from proposition is this idea on how they have more information.
3158.62,3163.18, We prove to you that more information is a bad thing to no response from prop. The fourth claim
3163.18,3166.16," is that the ICQI is slow, to which we say,"
3166.16,3170.64," well, the process by which we achieve justice, even if it were to be slow, which we also contest,"
3170.64,3176.32," is also massively cathartic. Finally, on apology versus leaders, we've given you multiple"
3176.32,3182.48," mechanisms, but I also just want to kind of gut check this, right? I don't think that a rapist"
3182.48,3188.64," saying, I'm sorry, is going to actively redeem a rape victim, but the person who commanded that person going and being"
3188.64,3192.66," sent to jail, being thrown into a jail cell for the rest of their life, that at"
3192.66,3197.1," the very least brings some amount of more catharsis. But finally, we went on"
3197.1,3200.98, the most important types of victims because victims degree on the spectrum.
3200.98,3205.1," People who cannot speak up, people who cannot gain justice in propositions"
3205.1,3210.24," world, people who are unable to say this is what happened to me, I need help, this is the type of"
3210.24,3214.44," perpetrator I'm looking for. Those people, those people are the most harmed on proposition and"
3214.44,3218.68, those people can actively get justice uniquely in our world where we have top-down justice systems
3218.68,3222.16," where we target the leaders. These individuals are the most vulnerable in this debate, these"
3222.16,3225.92, individuals get no justice in proposition. This alone is debate winning.
3225.92,3229.76," But finally, the second clash on peace is obviously going to our bench"
3229.76,3233.2, because they concede to us in this debate that leaders being in power is bad.
3233.4,3236.04, And we prove to you from an unengaged argumentation
3236.2,3238.88, why these leaders can uniquely be ousted in our vote.
3238.88,3241.68, I think that this argumentation alone can take this debate
3241.68,3246.0, to crouch to stand on the opposition bench where we actually care about the victims?
3246.0,3250.0, A late supposed justice is a justice denied.
3250.0,3254.0," This is the side that opposition is defending, on our side of the house."
3254.0,3259.0," Even if we do not achieve prosecution for the leaders, we're not looking for this."
3259.0,3263.0, Because prosecuting the leaders takes more resources and it's arbitrary
3263.0,3265.62," because it's not going to benefit the victims,"
3265.62,3271.28," it's not going to create any change because these leaders, when they were prosecuted,"
3271.28,3275.12, they were thrown out of power before getting prosecuted.
3275.12,3277.62, So the prosecution is actually arbitrary.
3277.62,3281.94, What's more important is delegitimizing toxic mid-rank generals.
3281.94,3285.36, This was analysis that was never engaged with from side opposition.
3285.36,3289.2," Moreover, what's more important, it's achieving closure to these individuals."
3291.68,3300.0, A child who's waiting for his father to go back from the war is way more inhumane for him to wait
3300.0,3306.28, without knowing that his father died 20 years ago. A wife who's still waiting for her husband to go back
3306.28,3313.26, and to bring her something is way worse on their side of the house
3313.26,3315.58," because on our side of the house, by the worst thing,"
3315.82,3319.4," we achieve closure, we achieve the real reality that happened there."
3319.86,3326.0, So I'm going to do the three main questions in this debate.
3326.0,3329.0," First of all, who helps the victims more?"
3329.0,3333.0," First point of clarification, they told us that the NGOs are symmetrical."
3333.0,3337.0, Throughout the debate we've proved that NGOs are not symmetrical.
3337.0,3342.0," On our side of the house, the NGOs are more incentivized to cooperate and to work"
3342.0,3345.28," because NGOs, when they know that there are atrocities that were"
3345.28,3351.76, discovered in the ICTY that are getting discovered in our TRC they're more likely going to create
3351.76,3357.04, part of this but second of all on our side of the house when we get the testimonies of the victims
3357.04,3360.48, which is exclusive to our side of the house because on their side of the house these victims
3360.48,3368.0," do not have the needed platform to testify on On their side of the house, we have a small amount of victims."
3368.0,3372.0," On our side of the house, we have a bigger platform for these victims."
3372.0,3377.0," So even if the perpetrators are not going to participate, the victims are way more important."
3377.0,3380.0," But second of all, talking about participation."
3380.0,3385.66," On our side of the house, these victims are going to participate because they want to get the platform to talk about their problems."
3386.06,3388.78, They're going to participate in order for them to get compensation.
3389.3,3395.64," But third of all, these soldiers and mid-rank generals that are going to participate in the fear of getting prosecuted,"
3395.64,3401.72," even if there is not as much prosecution as we want to have,"
3401.98,3407.38, but the fear of the possibility of getting prosecuted is way more important
3407.38,3412.56, and it's going to incentivize many leaders and many generals and many normal soldiers
3412.56,3413.56, to testify.
3413.56,3417.12, Moving into closure and acknowledgement and why is it important?
3417.12,3422.44," It's not simply about an apology, it's about not denying the atrocity, not denying the"
3422.44,3423.44, crime.
3423.44,3426.46," On the other side of the house, these leaders are denying the crime."
3426.74,3431.56, What's worse than a perpetrator going free after telling the truth
3431.56,3435.64, is a perpetrator going free because of a not guilty verdict
3435.64,3438.94," after denying the truth, after denying the atrocity."
3439.26,3440.24, This is side opposition.
3440.74,3443.46, Moving into who achieves a more collective historical record.
3443.46,3448.58, They told us a multinational regional TRC is not going to work. We've told you that they're
3448.58,3453.08, going to cooperate under their own administration but second of all why this TRC is
3453.08,3456.5, way more important than anything from side opposition because on our side of
3456.5,3460.46, the house each TRC is going to provide their own report and they're going to
3460.46,3466.82," report back to the regional TRC. This regional TRC is going to be responsible for, as we told you before,"
3467.36,3474.52, this TRC is going to be responsible for providing a historical record that is being written by different POVs.
3474.7,3477.18, And this is way more important than anything else from the opposition.
3477.54,3479.02, Moving into peace.
3479.22,3481.44, They told us that they achieved peace.
3481.58,3482.7, We did not see this.
3482.7,3484.96, We're saying Kosovo is part of Serbia.
3485.36,3490.16, We're saying the only genocide that happened is against the Serbs. These are narratives that only happen
3490.8,3494.56," on their side of the house, on our side of the house, where the victims are going to testify,"
3494.56,3499.52, where the soldiers are going to testify. It's way more important than arbitrary prosecution
3499.52,3505.04," of grandpas and imprisoning them, and some of them are not even imprisoned. So proud to propose."
