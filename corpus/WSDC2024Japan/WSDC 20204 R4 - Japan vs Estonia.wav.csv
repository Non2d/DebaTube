0.0,10.0, Medicine has evolved from beating sick people with rocks to a vaccine that eradicated entire diseases
10.0,16.0, and managing us to come back from the deadliest epidemic in the last 100 years in a matter of months.
16.0,22.0, We tell you that the new rise of distrust caused by new age wellness and other practices undermining science
22.0,29.4, have brought smallpox back to the United States after it being eradicated for a hundred years. We tell you that we hear in this debate that human
29.4,33.72, lives and the preservation of our mental health. In this speech I'm going to bring you a frame
33.72,37.88, and then two arguments. Let's begin with the frame. We tell you that the definition of
37.88,41.54, the new age wellness here is things that are not without sign of the people backing them.
41.54,47.68," We tell you that those things could look like, I don't know, all of the things mentioned in the info slide, but also like mental oils, et cetera,"
47.68,51.78," psychology books, and without the psychologist's backings, and selling"
51.78,56.5," books. No, thank you, not that. We tell you that those alternative methods often do not work,"
56.5,59.92," because they firstly are not tested by actual medicines, actual scientists,"
59.92,63.52," actual companies, et cetera. Secondly, they are usually based on belief. They are"
63.52,66.16," based on you believing that it can help you,"
66.16,68.4," and then when in the luckiest case, it does help you,"
68.4,70.0, you believe it further.
70.0,72.72, We tell you that the burden of proof of opposition in this debate
72.72,75.12, is that the damages have been worse than the benefits.
75.12,76.64," In our speeches, we have the arguments."
76.64,79.52," I will bring you the first two about physical and mental health,"
79.52,81.84," and in our second speech, we also will tell you about scams."
81.84,83.2, Thor and I will go on.
83.2,88.16, Things like medication and mindfulness have hundreds of studies backing its science.
88.16,91.46, This means that view-based wellness is not about things that don't have scientific
91.46,95.92," backing, but rather this new prevalence focused on things like self-care and self-improvement."
95.92,96.92, It does have scientific backing.
96.92,97.92, How do you engage?
97.92,101.72," We tell you that even if some parts of them do, it is how you interpret those things."
101.72,105.52, We tell you that you cannot have physical determined impacts from meditation.
105.52,112.08," It can help you in some ways, but we tell you that people are less likely to connect them with actual medicine"
112.08,116.0," and other practices that connect them to crystals, etc. And this is what's important in my speech."
116.0,122.32," Okay, moving on to the first argument, trust in actual medicine, how it can cause physical harms on the side of position."
122.32,125.44," First, we tell you that trust in scientific medicine"
125.44,126.8, decreases on their side.
126.8,129.92, We tell you that alternative medicine seems very untrustworthy.
129.92,131.68," Firstly, it is also sold by big pharma,"
131.68,133.68, which legitimizes the rise of those uses.
133.68,135.4," Secondly, it is also not banned,"
135.4,137.4, which you usually do when things are negative to you
137.4,138.88, or which can cause horrible harm.
138.88,141.64," Therefore, we tell people that it is not that bad as it might seem."
141.64,144.2," And thirdly, we tell you that the advertising by those big companies"
144.2,147.6," is very strong, very effective, and done in a very large amount."
147.6,157.6," Since this type of sale is made mostly mainly based on quantity over quality. We tell you that those people, or since those medicines and those methods don't cost a lot,"
157.6,167.0," those companies are relying on people buying a lot of different ones and buying a lot of ones over and over again. Therefore, they are relying on people more. Secondly, we tell you that those who are presented also are very persuasive."
167.0,171.0, We tell you that the influence can come from parents or friends or through social media.
171.0,173.0, All the things that are very persuasive for the average user.
173.0,179.0, We tell you that especially the suspect group here is children who are very much influenced by social media
179.0,181.0," or what their parents are going to rule them up with, etc."
181.0,188.64," And lastly, we tell you that there are also social bubbles forming in Facebook or Telegram where those people constantly have reaffirmation that those things actually do"
188.64,192.88," work and if they don't, they will get proof of things working and even if they don't work,"
192.88,197.12," they won't get that actual scientific proof that they might cause harm to you, etc. We say that"
197.12,202.08," this causes snowball effect because even if it works one single time, you're more likely to be"
202.08,205.8," leaving the system. We tell you that they can work in some cases. First, you might just get lucky."
205.8,211.2," There might be environmental cases or things that make the disease go away naturally,"
211.2,212.4, or the issues go away naturally.
212.4,213.6," And secondly, there are other things."
213.6,216.8," For example, you can get vitamins or things from your food that can fix the diseases."
216.8,220.2," You still connect them to the alternative medicine, or going for the new age products."
220.2,224.6, We tell them that now you're more susceptible to the other reasonings behind them.
224.6,227.0, You're more susceptible to those advertisements.
227.0,231.0, You're more likely to be persuaded by your parents or your friends or social media.
231.0,234.0," Therefore, now you're a lot easier of a target."
234.0,237.5," Therefore, we tell you that even if in some cases they don't work on you,"
237.5,241.5, you're still more likely to believe on them and you can still believe that they might work in the future.
241.5,249.32," And lastly, we tell you that companies also really like pop up, like spread pop up on the topic, they really want you to have this trust in"
249.32,253.68," scientific medicine because they want you to use the alternative ones instead, they"
253.68,258.14," get profit from you using them. And this means that most people are not going to be, or most"
258.14,262.26, users are not going to trust actual medicine less or like scientific medicine less because
262.26,268.08," first they don't have that much resources, they're probably going to buy only a single medicine either it being scientific or alternative"
268.08,269.28, for a disease you have.
269.28,271.44," Secondly, you either don't believe in it or not."
271.44,275.2, We say that this has two major causes or negative impacts for your health.
275.2,278.72," Firstly, you suffer for a longer time period, a longer period of time."
278.72,284.08, We say that you actually have this experimental time or period as you only get sick you try
284.08,286.8," those crystals, you try out new ways of doing it,"
286.8,293.0," even if you return to scientific science in the end, you still have this period of time where you suffer and you don't get help."
293.0,296.7, We tell you that this is very critical as some diseases are very treatable at the start.
296.7,302.3," For example, cancer is completely treatable in the first stage, but as it evolves further, it is no longer treatable."
302.3,305.8," And if you, during that first stage stage don't seek help from science,"
305.8,308.6," but you try to use crystals or alternative medicine or medication,"
308.6,310.8, then you might not be able to be cured at all.
310.8,314.0," And secondly, if you don't seek help at all because you don't trust actual medicine,"
314.0,317.2," then you cannot actually have those like external explanation problems,"
317.2,321.0, or any symptoms and issues that you may have made up in the never-before-known-case.
321.0,322.8," And secondly, side effects."
322.8,328.0, We tell you that a lot of those issues or a lot of those alternative medicines can actually cause your health to go worse.
328.0,333.0, We tell you that drinking MMS or having different solutions that are promoted through those systems are a very bad thing.
333.0,337.0," We tell you that all of those cases can cause that, but we tell you that some will."
337.0,340.0, And you're more likely to use them due to the snowball effect.
340.0,346.5," Even if those safer versions of meditation or crystals might work, you're more likely to use more radical ones in the future as well."
346.5,356.3," And secondly, we tell you that you can also mistreat your body by not eating different things or distracting your immune system and destroying it,"
356.3,360.5, which means that you're also more susceptible to different diseases that are not connected to the current one.
360.5,368.68," Therefore, we tell you that a lot of action issues return to you and you will have a worse physical health in the long run and in the short term when you use those."
368.68,371.68," Now moving on to the second argument, we tell you about mental issues."
371.68,377.68, First we tell you that the approach of those new age wellness medicines is very individualistic.
377.68,382.68, We tell you that these look like either self-help books or beliefs that doctors are only there
382.68,385.76," to harm you, only you yourself can fix"
385.76,390.9," those issues. Or like the third one, your actions or things causing your illness, for"
390.9,394.42, example you not meditating is why you have a cough or why you have depression. We tell
394.42,399.56," you that this kind of result in massive harms in two different ways. Firstly, when you actually"
399.56,403.7, cannot do anything about those issues and you think that you are the problem. We tell
403.7,409.6, you this looks like people having depression or people having anxiety etc but they still think that they can change it on
409.6,413.84, their own but at the same time they're not even able to. We tell them that this is a very bad
413.84,418.72, situation for those people because they would be stuck in that internal loop of making themselves
418.72,422.88, feel miserable because they cannot fix it and it's their fault. We tell you it can cause further
422.88,427.76, damage for example and it can also cause further damage like anxiety or depression which can come from the
427.76,431.82," medicines you actually are using to cure it. Secondly, we tell you that isolation is also a key point here."
431.82,440.2, We tell you that those are people who won't seek help with anything now. Those are people who believe that they are the sole reason that they're sick and they are the sole answer to those problems.
440.2,446.0," We tell you that by having this individualistic approach, you are less likely to talk about your mental issues."
446.0,449.0, And also you're overall analyzing every single other issue in your life.
449.0,454.0," We're talking about you getting fired, but you're less likely to talk about that to your significant other or to your friends"
454.0,458.0," because you think it's on you, it's your fault, etc. and you are the one who's supposed to get over it."
458.0,462.0, This means that we create harms on every single level.
462.0,465.0, First we can tell you that those issues are less likely to be solved
465.0,472.0," as if you catch your partner cheating, you're less likely to confront them because you think it's your issue that you should overcome."
472.0,477.0, We tell you that this means that you additionally will blame yourself eternally for those issues
477.0,481.0, because you are the sole reason for it and as those issues don't get solved you have the end of the match.
481.0,488.32, And lastly we tell you that those effects also happen by affecting other people around them. If my significant other who uses those methods
488.32,491.48," does not tell me about their problems, I'm less likely to tell all of my problems on"
491.48,495.42," the spot. Therefore, we mean that those mental issues are going to deepen in the world and"
495.42,499.12, we have less help and less people seeking for support for all those reasons and propositions.
499.4,512.0," The current reality is one where humans face issues on a daily basis. Issues like anxiety, depression, and insecurity."
512.0,517.0," Issues that may seem small, but made your life all the much more bleak."
517.0,522.0," We think that new age wellness culture provides people with a breath of fresh air,"
522.0,526.38," accessible personalized solutions to your problems, but not only solutions"
526.38,529.78," to your problems, but also active improvements to your life."
531.04,533.42," With that, we are so proud to oppose."
533.96,539.46," Before I go into my arguments about new age wellness being good, and even if the culture"
539.46,546.4," itself isn't good, the fact that the ideas that it promotes is good, I would like to go"
546.4,553.98," into two pieces on framing. Firstly, what does the implementation of new age wellness culture"
553.98,559.72, look like? Note that this frame is completely going to cut down that entire two arguments.
560.48,566.0," Firstly, we think that this new age wellness culture and the rise of it means that there's massive competition."
566.0,571.0, So only the best forms of this culture will arise and become accessible.
571.0,577.0," For example, if they're really scammy crystals, they're not really going to gain traction and get support from the public."
577.0,585.04, The ones that are going to rise will look much more like the meditation that actually actually helps people.
590.3,590.7," But secondly, we think that this culture exists in a sea of counter-narratives."
594.18,594.46, We think that there are two counter-narratives that this culture has to contend with.
600.0,600.7," Firstly, the fact that hospitals feel that this culture is a threat to their scientific legitimacy."
603.46,607.0, So we think that these hospitals and scientific institutions will also have an incentive to promote their own medicines.
607.0,612.0, What that means is not that many people are going to be washed away into this new age wellness culture.
612.0,616.0, People will still continue to opt into hospitals to some extent.
616.0,617.0, No thank you.
617.0,622.0," But secondly, we think that the degree to which people opt in will not be extreme."
622.0,625.76," This is for two reasons. Firstly, we think that it is simply"
625.76,630.68, counterintuitive to human nature to buy all of these claims that these new wellness culture
630.68,637.88, promotes. Because people probably won't believe that one healing crystal will solve 14 days
637.88,642.94, spent in depression. People won't think that one crystal is enough to solve your whooping
642.94,650.38," cough, or if you're vomiting, people are not likely to buy into stupid things. Secondly, we think that other generations find these new"
650.38,655.5," ideas kind of skeptical, so parents will still make their children go to hospitals if they're"
655.5,661.24, suffering from COVID-19. So the implication of this is simple. Individuals will still opt into
661.24,665.14," hospitals if they really, really need to, if they have a physical illness."
665.56,671.92, Notice that this cuts a large chunk out of their entire case. Note also that this doesn't
671.92,676.88," undercut our argument, and our argument will stand independent of this. But the second"
676.88,681.2," piece of frame, what does the absence or what does the world that opposition has to depend"
681.2,688.14," look like? At the point in which we do not get any characterization from our proposition side, we think that it is reasonable to"
688.14,692.18, assume that no such narratives of self-help will exist on that side of the
692.18,697.82," house. With that said, onto my first argument. The New Age wellness culture in and of"
697.82,702.86," itself is good. There are five reasons for this. Firstly, no thank you. We think that the"
702.86,709.86," benefits of New Age wellness culture will allow, that people will be allowed to choose and be able to pick and choose between"
709.86,714.32," the benefits of wellness culture. Because of the rise of this culture, there are simply"
714.32,718.8, more videos and more tips available on the internet. What that means is that people can
718.8,723.66," pick and choose what best fits them. Obviously, if you do not find healing crystals effective,"
723.92,728.94," that means that you can simply opt into other means, such as yoga, that will actually help you maintain your"
728.94,734.36, mental stability. The second reason is that you can uniquely solve micro-issues that you
734.36,739.56, don't have to tell anyone or that you won't tell anyone on proposition well. This looks
739.56,744.26, like being self-conscious before your WSDC speech. This looks like being anxious about
744.26,745.08, your exams. This looks like being anxious about your exams.
750.02,750.44, This looks like being anxious about whether your boyfriend is caring about you anymore.
754.68,759.4," Note that these are not huge issues, so that you won't want to bother your parents with or you bother your friends with, and can only be solved by yourself when you don't have"
759.4,763.66," an incentive to tell others or ask others for help, or that you'll be embarrassed to"
763.66,765.2," ask others for help. Rather, on be embarrassed to ask others for help."
769.92,775.28, Rather on our side at the point in which you can read that book in your own room you can like about self-help and get these tips you'll be able to solve these issues on your own. But sadly we say
775.28,780.88, that you can solve these subjective problems that only you can solve. This looks like for example
780.88,785.52, just being insecure. We think that stuff like insecurity can only be solved
785.52,790.8, through self-examination. You have to ask yourself problems like why do I feel insecure? What are the
790.8,796.16, best ways to combat the deep-seated conceptions that I have that led to this insecurity? Obviously
796.16,801.68, this kind of issue is something that only you can solve. We think that we can uniquely solve this on
801.68,806.0," our side at the point to which you're able to read self-help books and watch these videos,"
806.0,812.0," and internalize these tips on how to get better, and process how you fix yourself."
812.0,813.0, No thank you.
813.0,820.0, The fourth reason is that we simply have increased accessibility to solving your problems and getting self-help.
820.0,825.58, We think that there are many problems that you have on a daily basis that pop up very unexpectedly.
831.28,831.52," This looks like having an unexpected fight with your friends, or suddenly getting nervous 20 minutes before a football match."
839.28,839.58," On that side, you simply cannot go and access these self-help because you can't call yourself to a hospital 20 minutes before your match, right?"
840.1,840.32, No thank you.
848.0,848.22," We think that on our side, comparatively, you can take out your phone in that world locker room room and watch a 5 minute video on how to not be nervous and how to help yourself."
849.66,850.3, This is unique to our side.
854.92,855.24," But fifthly, we say that you are able to improve yourself and not just fix your problems."
857.34,857.72, This is important because of mainly two things.
866.12,867.76," Firstly, we say that public hospitals and therapists only solve your problems and only solve your problems after the harm occurs, right? After you fail that job interview"
867.76,869.54, and get severely depressed.
869.54,871.9," Rather, on our side, we're able to preemptively"
871.9,874.3, make people immune to these kinds of problems.
874.3,877.46, At the point at which you watch self-help videos
877.46,880.12, on a daily basis about how to deal with failure
880.12,882.24," and internalize that failure isn't bad,"
882.24,883.72," when you fail that job interview,"
883.72,888.28, you'll be able to deal with it much better. But the second impact of this is that no one teaches
888.28,892.96," you or no institution really teaches you about how to make yourself better, right?"
892.96,896.62, About how to tidy your room. It's not something that is taught by other people
896.62,900.82, and other institutions on a daily basis. Only self-help books are able to deal
900.82,907.14, with this. Onto my second argument then. Even if the self-help culture in and of itself is
907.14,913.98," harmful and unhelpful, we think the ideas that it promotes are good. We think that there are three reasons for this."
913.98,921.9," Firstly, because self-help culture actually promotes you to care about yourself and to care about your own mental health."
921.9,926.4, That means that you define the capitalistic narratives that exist in this stage of school
926.4,929.8," that tell you to work hard, to work 24-7 constantly."
929.8,934.1," What that means is that you'll be able to take a day off work to be able to look after yourself,"
934.1,938.4, even if you do not opt fully into the culture in and of itself.
938.4,943.4," But secondly, we think that people are more likely to opt into institutions and therapists and hospitals"
943.4,944.8, on our side of the house.
944.8,949.44, Because people now uniquely know what depression looks like they know through their self-help books
949.44,954.24, that staying in your room for 15 days isn't normal that means that on our side you can uniquely
954.8,958.72, actually like make yourself go realize that you have something for the problem and cut yourself
958.72,964.56, therapy thirdly we think that a lot of things that have been stigmatized such as depressed people
964.56,967.36," will be able to decrease the stigmatization against them historically we think that a lot of things that have been stigmatized, such as depressed people, will be able to decrease the stigmatization against them."
967.9,971.56," Historically, we think that stuff like mental health has been very stigmatized"
971.56,977.1, simply because people and the general public don't know about it and don't understand how important it is.
977.5,982.94," However, on our side, when you get influencers talking about how depression is a real problem that you have to solve,"
983.12,988.7, you get normalization because these narratives exist. We think that the stigma is most vulnerable that it decreases
988.7,993.34," on our side, which allows them to access help and access help from their friends. We think"
993.34,997.56, that because we are able to provide help for the most general public and for the most vulnerable
997.56,999.64," people, we're so proud of us."
1000.2,1006.56," Dear panel, oneself is of utmost importance, And when faced with our mortality, when faced with our well-being,"
1006.56,1009.12, we do not act as rational actors.
1009.12,1012.4," We are more open to things that are promised to us, even when there is a proof,"
1012.4,1014.48," because the idea of not being sick anymore,"
1014.48,1018.08," the idea of not taking pain anymore, is definitely worth it."
1018.08,1021.36, We tell you we have to safeguard against the worst possible case.
1021.36,1023.36," Let's go over the frame very quickly again,"
1023.36,1028.28," and then look at the two arguments we just heard, analyze our material, the positive one, and then a third"
1028.28,1032.78, argument about scams and how they gain so much more power or have gained so much more
1032.78,1036.24," power. The frame, what do we hear from that? The first thing is that there is competition"
1036.24,1040.88," on the market now, which means we don't really have all the bad products, and secondly, that"
1040.88,1044.2, there are counter-energistic ones. Let's first look at the competition. I think this is a
1044.2,1047.94," false characterization because of what we actually bring to you in proposition, which"
1047.94,1053.12, is how people get this information. This isn't like an open market competition because of
1053.12,1056.96," all of this. Firstly, it's based on fake research, just people can buy a body of evidence and"
1056.96,1061.22," still get people to buy it. And secondly, since this info is received from different"
1061.22,1070.0," sources, i.e. internet media, i.e. things that aren't fact-checked, there are often problems with it. We tell you that the basic market competitions apply here,"
1070.0,1074.88, especially when people trust on belief of it working and the perception of it working a lot
1074.88,1079.52," more than the fact that it actually has to work for you. Secondly, they tell us about counter-narratives,"
1079.52,1083.6," but we tell you that once you have already bought into this, you are already to a certain extent"
1083.6,1087.76," desperate and wanted, and secondly, they never actually respond to our analysis on how a"
1087.76,1091.4," lot of this information is generational, and your belief on this can be generational."
1091.4,1094.9," If your parents teach you that moonstones work, then you are going to grow up thinking"
1094.9,1097.9," moonstones work, and you are going to want to believe that they work, because you are"
1097.9,1101.8," more likely to consider them to work, and you are less likely to opt into other things"
1101.8,1102.8, that work.
1102.8,1106.98," They never want anything that we tell you, dear pal, because we tell them that yes, there are multiple situations where you might have"
1106.98,1110.92," good benefits. We think that in general, meditation might be good for you, but we think the most"
1110.92,1114.38," important thing here is when a person does have cancer and doesn't go to the hospital,"
1114.5,1118.28, but someone legitimately dies or has the worst impacts realized. That is at the core of this
1118.28,1121.82," debate, because those are the most severe consequences. They have to answer that. No,"
1121.94,1147.0," let's talk about their arguments first. First, let's talk about the access you have to it. A few important answers. Firstly, yes, oh god. Firstly, okay, there's a barrier of entry, right? I think once you have gone over it, essentially, or probably, like, in their world, you're going to be more stuck in it. Because when you are doing this, when you can try different mood styles and different yogas and find out if it legitimately works for you, every single time you try something that doesn't work for you, you are going to continue being in pain"
1147.0,1152.0, or your condition is going to worsen. I think this timing is incredibly critical and if there are other
1152.0,1156.0," chance we have, is you legitimately going to a psychologist, you are actually getting chemotherapy,"
1156.0,1161.0, we are always going to prefer that because you aren't going to go over that critical point where we can still help you.
1161.0,1165.8," Secondly, to tell us that there are problems that only you can solve, you don't legitimately agree with this."
1165.8,1167.8, I think as an psychologist can help you very much.
1167.8,1169.6, I think they can help you discuss things.
1169.6,1173.4," I think if you're insecure, they can start helping you find the reasons for that insecurity."
1173.4,1177.2, I don't know why a five-minute YouTube video is ever going to be more legitimate
1177.2,1179.8, in helping and understanding a person's mental state
1179.8,1182.0, than a professional who has trained for 20 years
1182.0,1187.84," in specifically understanding mental states, what decisions lead to something. Especially when you have personal contact with them,"
1187.84,1192.0," when they can actually help you, a 500 YouTube video is always going to be impersonal and doesn't"
1192.0,1195.92," correctly engage you, right? So, I think that tells us what the problems are in this."
1195.92,1199.68, Only the fact that you have specific situations where you don't get access to that in these
1199.68,1203.52," YouTube videos are the best. Firstly, I think you can call a therapist when you really need one."
1203.52,1207.76," A lot of services provide this already. But secondly, I think asking help from others"
1207.76,1211.28, isn't a bad thing. That's exactly what our second argument tells you about. We should
1211.28,1214.88, be asking help from others because there's nothing inherently wrong with relying on others
1214.88,1221.28," for support when you need it, for more benefits. I think uniquely on the other hand, when you're"
1221.28,1224.8, constantly blaming yourself for every single problem that you have and consistently think
1224.8,1226.96," that you are the only one who can actually deal with it,"
1226.96,1230.4, that is when you stop asking help from others. That's when you believe that asking help from
1230.4,1234.56," others is not okay, and that's when you stop actually receiving the most important benefits,"
1234.56,1238.72, i.e. the mental support that you need when you are depressed. They never rebut any of this from
1238.72,1242.48, our place. I think that's so incredibly important for the purposes of this debate. I'll take that
1242.48,1248.0," to your wife. Can you explain two things? One, why cancer has anything to do with this debate about"
1248.0,1253.0," self-care and self-improvement, and two, why the conception of not being able to ask others"
1253.0,1254.0, for help in the case of cancer.
1254.0,1257.0," Okay, two points in the POI, right? So basically, why is cancer about this? Because in the"
1257.0,1260.0," English slide it says alternative medicine, we tell you, mood swings are alternative medicine,"
1260.0,1264.0," people believe that cancer can be solved with mood swings, very directly, it's very important"
1264.0,1266.72," in fact, they cannot only tell you about yoga, right?"
1266.72,1270.32," Okay, then they tell you that psychologists don't work, because only most of psychologists"
1270.32,1274.4, want some hormones to work. That's the exact same thing with alternative medicine and other
1274.4,1278.08," things, i.e. you don't start doing yoga when everything is fine, when something is wrong,"
1278.08,1281.12," i.e. you are depressed, you start looking for things to solve it, then it's completely"
1281.12,1285.96," symmetrical. That's the thing that psychology doesn't teach you how to be better, we completely do not agree with this."
1285.96,1289.94," I think that as psychologists, I also like how to, in every single day of life, be less"
1289.94,1292.94," anxious about things, because we're always going to be better in situations."
1292.94,1296.86," The second argument was about ideas and that even if there are potential harms, then opting"
1296.86,1297.86, into this is really good.
1297.86,1301.86," Then they tell you about, hey, we don't work 24-7, and then there's a sadistic one."
1301.86,1305.28," Firstly, about working 24-7, I think we already scientifically also say that we shouldn't be working 24-7 and that there's a sad stigma. First of all, working 24-7, I think we already scientifically"
1305.28,1309.84," also say that you shouldn't be working 24-7. We have a lot of analysis of why it stresses you out,"
1309.84,1314.48, why it's too much work. Psychologists all say that a four-day work week is far superior to a five-day
1314.48,1319.84, work week. I don't think this is in any way completely unique to new age wellness. Second
1319.84,1324.08," thing they tell us about stigma, but basically they make stigma worse around mental health and"
1324.08,1328.0," mental well-being because there's no stigma that you cannot ask for help. They never about stigma, but we simply say they make stigma worse around mental health and mental well-being because there's now a stigma that you cannot ask for help, they"
1328.0,1332.0," never about this as I say again, which when you can't ask for help, when you go and rely"
1332.0,1336.0," on 5-minute YouTube videos and hope that's enough, then in those situations where it"
1336.0,1340.0," isn't enough, which we tell you it often won't be, especially when you have a really significant"
1340.0,1344.0," retiree situation, in those situations they always lose. Okay, third argument, let's talk"
1344.0,1348.0," about OVG, what are our direct harms that we claim for"
1348.0,1351.0," that? First thing, less people getting legitimate help, i.e. every time you use a wound stone"
1351.0,1355.0," you are going to the doctor. Secondly, there is more false info moving around. These companies"
1355.0,1359.0, are motivated to spread false info as every person who doubts in the medical system is
1359.0,1363.0," going to use their products, thus they get more customers. Secondly, family and friends"
1363.0,1367.12," are also spreading this false info because they also believe that it's true, thus they want you to use it because"
1367.12,1371.04," they think that it's going to help you. Thirdly, you miss the critical point where you can get"
1371.04,1375.36," help, i.e. if cancer reaches the forest days it won't be curable anymore, thus timing it,"
1375.36,1379.6," it will pass to the hospital, is legitimately very important. Fourthly, you have mental arms,"
1379.6,1383.76, you are going to blame yourself even if you can't do anything about the situation that you are in.
1383.76,1387.24," And fifthly, you are going to always be less open to outside help because you think"
1387.24,1390.48," you're the one who should be dealing with this. There's also an auxiliary arm here,"
1390.62,1394.16, which is the fact that your family also feels really bad when they can't help you and when
1394.16,1398.6," you shut them out and don't share your problem. Okay, let's talk about scammers too. Because"
1398.6,1402.52, I think alternative medicine and other new ways of wellness has created a unique market
1402.52,1408.4," for scammers. Three reasons. Firstly, people are willing to pay a lot for it because it's directly to do with their health."
1408.4,1412.72," In the same way, secondly, they're really open to anything that you promise them. They are willing"
1412.72,1417.52," to accept a lot of doubts that they would regularly have. And thirdly, a lot of this stuff"
1417.52,1421.52," isn't scientifically proven. Yes, yoga does have some things that show that it can be good for your"
1421.52,1427.5," brain's gray matter, but there are a lot of things that aren't scientifically proven. What does this mean? Firstly, that there is a race to"
1427.5,1431.5," the top, where more and more ludicrous claims are being made, i.e. it can start with all"
1431.5,1435.5," your brain memory better, but then it can reach the point where, again, moonstones can"
1435.5,1439.5," cure cancer. Secondly, more and more money is taken away from the average person because"
1439.5,1443.5," they are paying large amounts for this, i.e. moonstones can go up to 500 per stone and"
1443.5,1445.28, you need to recharge them every week.
1445.28,1449.92," And thirdly, more propaganda is actively being spread, i.e. these scammers are really motivated to start"
1449.92,1454.08," spreading this information, because again it brings more money to them, does less trust in the medical"
1454.08,1458.88," system, does less people actually going and getting the real help they need. Why is this super problematic?"
1458.88,1462.72," Because these scammers are always going to sell something that's fake, that never works, right?"
1462.72,1466.34," Why is this true? First because they don't actually have the knowledge on how any of this works,"
1466.4,1470.86, and they don't actually understand how to make something that could kill cancer.
1471.1,1473.16," And secondly, they aren't motivated to actually kill you,"
1473.3,1476.08," because when they keep you sick, that's the point where they gain benefits."
1476.18,1477.44, They want people to keep coming back.
1477.6,1479.78," Because if you're depressed and get a stone and it doesn't work,"
1480.0,1481.96," then they have a built-in propaganda system where they say,"
1481.96,1484.98," you need another stone, or it's your fault that it didn't work this time."
1485.2,1487.32," Thus, people are going to keep coming back to that system,"
1487.58,1489.48, because they keep hoping that something is going to happen.
1489.56,1491.3, Because when you're in as horrible of a situation
1491.3,1493.98," as you often are going to be at the worst points of your life,"
1494.18,1496.52, then anything that promises to fix it is worth a try.
1496.52,1499.58," We tell you that people should go to the hospital, not get a moonstone."
1499.7,1500.4," Thank you, proposition."
1501.08,1501.58, My proposition.
1502.3,1505.62, Proposition brushes off legitimate remedies for serious issues
1505.62,1509.76, and this is the meaning. Just because you cannot physically see change does not
1509.76,1515.32, mean it does not exist. For the fact that my friend was suicidal for two years and
1515.32,1519.56," books like 12 Worlds for Life by Jordan Peterson, meditation and self-improvement"
1519.56,1523.16," content has changed his life. But it's not just that, right? It's the breathing"
1523.16,1525.46, exercises that Natsuki does before rounds.
1525.46,1528.0, It's the videos Hiroko watches when she's stressed.
1528.0,1531.46, The accessibility of these things only exists in our world.
1531.46,1534.1," I want to deal with top-level clarification in this debate,"
1534.1,1536.86, which will largely cut out the majority of absurd claims
1536.86,1538.32, that you get from proposition.
1538.32,1541.16, Then I'll delve a little bit into the specific clashes.
1541.16,1543.36," Firstly, on top-level clarification,"
1543.36,1545.12, there are three things of note I want to make.
1545.48,1547.86," Number one, these are real remedies"
1547.86,1549.66, that new age wellness to some extent
1549.66,1551.12, has to exist on a spectrum.
1551.48,1553.9, They cannot brush off the entirety of new age wellness
1553.9,1555.34," as something that is unrealistic,"
1555.54,1557.68, not scientifically backed and just completely wrong.
1558.02,1560.34," Rather, a lot of the things that do exist"
1560.34,1561.9, are actually factually proven.
1562.22,1563.32, Medication and mindfulness
1563.32,1565.22, have hundreds of thousands
1565.22,1570.38, of papers backing up its usefulness. Cell phone literature has saved multiple people
1570.38,1575.32," from the worst forms of suicide. Therefore, new age wellness exists on a spectrum."
1575.32,1579.68," Second clarification, what does our world look like? What we tell you is a fairly nuanced"
1579.68,1583.76, theory of what our world looks like because we do agree to some extent things like moonstones
1583.76,1586.62," and healing crystals, we do have to defend that in our world."
1586.62,1588.62, But the things that do gain the most prevalence
1588.62,1591.94," in this debate, and the things that are the most used"
1591.94,1593.88," in our world, are still going to be things"
1593.88,1595.7, that have somewhat effective remedies.
1595.7,1598.36," The mechanization we gave you for this was competition,"
1598.36,1600.46," and proposition, brushing this off by talking"
1600.46,1602.34," about fake information and different sources,"
1602.34,1604.14," doesn't change the fact that, for example,"
1604.14,1606.58," things like reviews create checks and balance systems,"
1606.58,1609.34," which means still, the best forms of most effective remedies"
1609.34,1611.14, still make it to the top.
1611.14,1613.42, I also want to note our second piece of training
1613.42,1615.76, that proved to you that there exists a lot of counter narratives
1615.76,1617.94," within which this culture does exist,"
1617.94,1619.42, means that we can cut out the majority
1619.42,1622.1," of the extreme characterization you get from proposition,"
1622.1,1624.5, because this debate is about the manifestation
1624.5,1629.92," of this culture in society, and the manifestation is crowded by other counter narratives which means"
1629.92,1634.32, the most extreme forms of this still are mitigated we proved you for example the incentives of
1634.32,1639.44, hospitals that feel delegitimized by the new age wellness to have to and their active incentives
1639.44,1643.44, to propagate ideas that limit things like alternative medicine and healing crystals
1643.44,1647.24, that are ineffectual and rather to push things like meditation and mindfulness.
1647.24,1651.2," Therefore, these counter-metaphs still do exist and therefore the most extreme forms"
1651.2,1653.64, of this debate are still out of the scope of this debate.
1653.64,1654.64, Go ahead.
1654.64,1656.4," In some cases they work, in some cases they don't."
1656.4,1657.84, This debate comes down to the metric.
1657.84,1661.48, We tell you that their wins are very very small when you get a little bit better concentration
1661.48,1662.48, etc.
1662.48,1666.5," But we tell you that every single child who dies of cancer is a massive loss,"
1666.5,1669.5, therefore the damage is always a lot bigger on our side.
1669.5,1670.5," Right, two things."
1670.5,1674.0," First, I will engage to your entire claim later on in my speech,"
1674.0,1678.0," but also secondly, I did want you to note at the top of my speech that I think claims like cancer"
1678.0,1681.5, and a lot of these physical diseases that Proposition wants to debate about
1681.5,1683.0, is just not part of this motion.
1683.0,1685.36, This motion is about self-care and self-improvement.
1685.36,1688.88," Co-ocally, terms used for mental health issues,"
1688.88,1690.28," not physical health issues,"
1690.28,1692.12, which means we do not support the promotion
1692.12,1695.14," of Moonstones alongside for solving cancer,"
1695.14,1697.92, but I really don't think that's in the motion.
1697.92,1700.38," Okay, what was our communication in this debate?"
1700.38,1702.52, We proved through six independent reasons
1702.52,1705.36, why the colloquial forms of medicine that
1705.36,1708.56, exist in propositions world only is ineffectual.
1708.56,1713.4," This was not to say that things like therapists are bad, this was not to say that we are in"
1713.4,1718.18," any way better at doing our jobs than professionals, but rather that these supplemental sources"
1718.18,1721.24, could fill in the gaps of professional support.
1721.24,1723.12, What was our mechanization?
1723.12,1726.04, We firstly proved to you that we are able to pick and choose what works.
1726.04,1729.08," That for some people, sitting down in a room and talking to a therapist"
1729.08,1732.0, is something that they cannot do or they're unwilling to do.
1732.0,1734.28, Maybe you're too embarrassed to talk about your issues.
1734.28,1737.68, What we allow for then is so you can choose alternative forms.
1737.68,1740.44," Maybe talking to a therapist is too hard, you can watch a video."
1740.44,1743.32," Secondly, we proved to you, we talked about smaller issues"
1743.32,1748.18," because going to a therapist to some extent does cause money, which means you are unlikely to want to do that for things"
1748.18,1751.04," like stage fright, which you feel is unimportant."
1751.04,1753.04, We uniquely feel that's the act.
1753.04,1757.18," Thirdly, we proved to you ideas of things that can only be solved in our world."
1757.18,1759.68, We told you by yourselves.
1759.68,1763.12," For example, the fact that you are nervous to come on this stage is something that things"
1763.12,1765.38, like breathing exercises can effectively deal with.
1765.74,1771.94," Fourthly, we talked about accessibility because I cannot just call my therapist in Japan and expect him to pick up at 2 a.m."
1771.94,1772.84, in the morning right now.
1772.84,1777.28, What I can do is turn on a video about breathing exercises and access that immediately in a second.
1777.28,1781.24, Our fifth thing was on retrospective versus preventative remedies.
1781.24,1785.78, That at best what they're doing is deal with issues after they have happened.
1785.78,1787.48," That yes, after I get depression,"
1787.48,1789.34," professionals, great job at doing that."
1789.34,1790.5," But to prevent depression,"
1790.5,1792.9, I can do mindfulness exercises every single day.
1792.9,1794.18, That is a preventative measure
1794.18,1795.62, that does not exist in their world
1795.62,1798.32, because people go to therapists before they're depressed.
1798.32,1800.28," And sixthly, that there are unique learnings"
1800.28,1801.74, that only exist in our world.
1801.74,1803.64, That therapists don't do things
1803.64,1807.08, like tell you to clean your room or to tell you how important you are
1807.08,1809.86," that uniquely exist in things like self-help literature,"
1809.86,1811.16," which means uniquely in our world,"
1811.16,1812.5, there are actually different learnings
1812.5,1814.44, that professionals do not cater to.
1814.44,1816.62, Propositions responses are a lot of things.
1816.62,1818.3, They firstly tell you professionals are better.
1818.3,1820.02," Again, we do agree, professionals are better"
1820.02,1822.24," in some regards, we're just better in other regards,"
1822.24,1824.4, and they do not cater to this demand.
1824.4,1828.16," Then they tell you that, oh, you can just call a therapist, I think I not cater to this demand. Then they tell you that oh you can just call a therapist I think I agree with that and then they finally"
1828.16,1832.56, tell you that therapy is effectively able to tell you how to deal with pain. There are two problems
1832.56,1836.96, with this one people don't actively approach therapy in a lot of situations like I did not
1836.96,1841.12, go to my therapist because I am scared to speak in front of you that is not something I am willing to
1841.12,1848.0, do because I don't want to pay a hundred dollars just to learn about stress right but I But I can join that video and learn a little bit about it. Just three more seconds.
1848.0,1853.1," But also secondly, that I don't think that therapy is also actively going to do that to you, do that for you,"
1853.1,1855.4, because they focus on big picture solutions.
1855.4,1860.4," Like yes, talking about it will help, but so will small scale mindfulness exercises."
1860.4,1860.9," Yeah, go ahead."
1860.9,1863.4, They never apply to or compare it to my mental issues.
1863.4,1867.96, They either need to prove to you how you can solve everything like anxiety and depression on your own
1867.96,1875.64, Or otherwise mental issues grow massively when you don't seek for help with anything and you try to focus all in all ways on fixing everything yourself
1875.94,1883.36," Professional institutions exist in our world, people still go to them in our world, therapists still exist in our world, people still go to therapy in our world"
1883.48,1887.0, Our second argument was also massively important and very lowly engaged.
1887.0,1890.0," We tell you that even if these ideas are harmful in and of themselves,"
1890.0,1894.0," the ideal that it propagates is massively important because it leads you to people,"
1894.0,1898.0, it leads to a self-help movement that means people care about themselves.
1898.0,1901.6," The proposition response is while science tells us that, sorry I can't take anymore POS,"
1901.6,1905.5," proposition response is, oh, science tells us that you should care about yourself."
1905.5,1909.0," The problem is, this science only happened for two reasons."
1909.0,1912.84," One, because there is increased demand for this science, that people now view self-improvement"
1912.84,1915.24, as important and therefore are more willing to research it.
1915.24,1919.0," But also secondly, even when that science exists, the only way the general population"
1919.0,1923.72," will access to academic papers is if this movement exists, which means our argumentation"
1923.72,1925.66, is pre-represented on science happening.
1925.66,1930.32, But I also want to note that they don't explain anything about our second and third
1930.32,1931.32, mechanisms in this argument.
1931.32,1934.32," I think that, for example, individuals who face stigma is important."
1934.32,1938.44, I want to finally engage their argumentation on things like misinformation and scammers
1938.44,1939.44, that exist.
1939.44,1940.44, Two things.
1940.44,1944.96," One, there is very little incentive to do this because individuals need return usage,"
1944.96,1949.4," which means even if you were to be able to sell moonstones the first time, people are not going to come back."
1949.4,1952.1, It is incredibly unlikely that you do so.
1952.1,1955.9," But also secondly, I don't think that the capacity to do so is there as well."
1955.9,1958.7, Because there exist things like checks and balances.
1958.7,1966.42," For example, the Federal Medical Agency actively does crack down on alternative medicine that is ineffectual and is actually harmful for the human body."
1966.42,1970.44," There exist review systems for YouTubers online, which means YouTubers cannot propagate harmful"
1970.44,1972.96, beliefs without people having checks and balances.
1972.96,1976.1," Now what problems this thing will tell you is that these YouTubers, these ideas, are"
1976.1,1977.1, coercion.
1977.1,1980.32, The problem with that is that coercion cannot be fact.
1980.32,1984.5, That the fact that individuals know that these do not work is going to be the thing that
1984.5,1989.52," they incentivize. In our world, we believe that the new age wellness culture has led to individuals"
1989.52,1992.96, and their mental health massively benefiting for all the reasons proposed.
1995.2,2001.36, The point her mother suggests to her child that they're reading is his wife because of a working
2001.36,2005.32," wifi router in their home, before even considering the"
2005.32,2010.8," possible psychological effects. At that point, the child has been faked. Even if"
2010.8,2015.0," they go to a doctor later on, all of the anxiety that has been internalized"
2015.0,2023.0, within themselves becomes so much more difficult to cure. We're so proud to propose.
2023.0,2026.8," Firstly, on hard vacation. Secondly, on personal"
2026.8,2032.72," society, perception of mental health. Secondly, on physical health and alternative medicine,"
2032.72,2037.92," because the impossible does include it as a part of this debate. Firstly, the first"
2037.92,2046.78," proposition, second speaker, concedes that an individual is not better than a professional. However, what we have been"
2046.78,2052.84," telling you throughout our own case is that in a situation where we individualise all of the issues,"
2052.84,2058.66," you're less likely to go to that professional in a situation where you do need help, in which you"
2058.66,2069.0," yourself cannot help you. Firstly, because you're stuck in an interval, we do believe that in a situation where you enter the new age wellness community,"
2069.0,2076.0," in majority, you get the information from social media because this is not something that doctors often prescribe you."
2076.0,2080.0," In that situation, the algorithm is constantly feeding you that information."
2080.0,2086.32," We tell you that you won't get out of it, thus you're more likely to try more approaches in that community."
2086.32,2090.16," If they don't work, we tell you that before you're even going to go to a doctor,"
2090.16,2092.8, you're going to try all of those more medical versions.
2092.8,2096.4," So firstly, it's like menthol oil to deal with your sinuses."
2096.4,2101.28," In the end, we tell you that if you have been infused with insect infusion for long enough,"
2101.28,2108.0," we tell you that you are likely to also try the new with the time you do. Secondly, because of peer pressure. We think that in a situation"
2108.0,2112.0," where the society thinks that you yourself have to deal with issues, you're much more"
2112.0,2117.0," likely to give in to the peer pressure of being able to deal on your own, to be self-dependent,"
2117.0,2126.0, and ensure that going to a professional is your last resort. To then says that therapy is already
2126.0,2128.0, expected. We agree
2128.0,2130.0," totally, but the minute"
2130.0,2132.0, society has taken a stance that
2132.0,2134.0, individual has to deal with issues
2134.0,2136.0," on their own, they're not going to use the"
2136.0,2138.0, other completely free thing
2138.0,2140.0, your friends. You're not going to
2140.0,2142.0, call your friends because you think
2142.0,2144.0, that you have to deal with them alone. The
2144.0,2148.04," question in this debate is not always whether you can solve issues on your own,"
2148.04,2152.6, the question is whether you should. Sometimes it's easier to share an issue
2152.6,2156.62, without really going to the first class clash on societal
2156.62,2161.18," perception of mental health. Two stakeholders in this clash, firstly an average person,"
2161.18,2174.0," secondly the one who has mental health issues. Firstly, let's talk about a nourished person. This is what Opposition 1 characterised as having insecurity, some type of relationship issues or stagefrights."
2174.0,2180.0, We tell you that those issues absolutely can be solved on their own with time. We're willing to concede that.
2180.0,2184.0," However, we do think that it's easier to solve them with additional help."
2184.0,2189.0," Firstly, because it's difficult to fix things alone when you are suffering already."
2189.0,2196.0, We tell the people in a society with others that you can rely on those people because they can bring you additional benefits.
2196.0,2202.0," For example, a friend can notice you being anxious so much earlier than you can,"
2202.0,2206.12," because you're likely to push those bad feelings away, because your brain simply"
2206.12,2208.18," doesn't want to feel them. However, your"
2208.18,2210.16, friend can see that your hand
2210.16,2212.32," is trembling, or your voice is shaking,"
2212.62,2214.2," and notice it, and tell you that"
2214.2,2216.12, before. They can ask you whether
2216.12,2218.12," you're okay, they can offer you help."
2218.46,2220.04," Notice, in our side of the house,"
2220.24,2221.1, in a situation
2221.1,2223.76," where, one,"
2224.06,2228.12, it's more likelier that you're not likely that the people or the society doesn't
2228.12,2232.76," believe that you should deal with those issues on your own, it's much more likely that a"
2232.76,2234.12, friend will offer you that help.
2234.12,2238.76," However, it's always so much more likely that the one who is suffering will accept that"
2238.76,2239.76, help.
2239.76,2243.44," Meaning that in a situation where you're dealing with daily life issues, we tell you that you"
2243.44,2249.52, can get benefits from others helping you. You don't have to take care of those issues on your own. The
2249.52,2253.84, explicit writing here is that firstly you're able to detect the stress much earlier when you have an
2253.84,2257.68, extra viewpoint and secondly because you feel better about yourself at the point where you
2257.68,2266.0, have some type of extra validation. Meaning that other people also tell you that WSCC is in fact scary and you're entitled to feel insecure
2266.0,2271.92, and this is not a you specific issue that only you have to solve because there's something wrong
2271.92,2278.4," with you. What does this way prove? Even if it proves that you can solve these issues alone,"
2278.4,2282.56, we tell you it's much more easier and effective to do it on our side of the house. The second
2282.56,2285.84, thing you call that stakeholder that opposition has
2290.08,2299.04," not engaged with a lot are the people who have more deeper issues than mental health, such as depression, ADHD or anxiety. Notice these are the most vulnerable people in this debate."
2299.04,2306.84," They're the most susceptible to any kind of criticism from the society. For example, when they do gather"
2306.84,2312.36," the courage to ask for help from their friends, and they're given a self-help book by Jordan"
2312.36,2318.34," Peterson, 12 Rules for Life, they won't read it as a help, but they read it as a sign,"
2318.48,2323.5," we don't want to help you, you are the issue, you have to deal with those issues alone."
2323.88,2326.44," But notice, you can't deal with those issues alone,"
2326.52,2329.14, because your brain chemistry is simply different.
2329.52,2333.12, Isolation is the worst thing that you can do to yourself.
2333.12,2336.8," In that situation, you're going to internalize all of those fears."
2337.14,2339.8," Notice, all of those issues become so much worse."
2340.2,2342.6," Even if you, in the end, decide to go to a professional,"
2342.9,2345.6," where you have spent a month alone with those issues,"
2345.6,2352.32," it becomes so much more difficult to cure, it becomes so much more difficult to actually get better."
2352.32,2362.32," The way here is that the best case from opposition, we tell you that the radical challenges are worse than the benefits on the daily stress,"
2362.32,2365.94, or believing that you should care about yourself simply because of the
2365.94,2372.06," intensity. Because we tell them for some, depression is a life or death situation. And"
2372.06,2376.78, not reaching out because you have been told to deal with it on your own can be the worst
2376.78,2379.54," option. Before going on to physical health, yes."
2379.94,2384.0, We've proven countless times why the most extreme forms of this culture are limited
2384.0,2386.0, due to counter narratives existing.
2386.0,2395.0," Meaning even if your parents promote Moonstone's too, you going to school and learning about the ineffectual nature of alternative remedies means you don't opt into it in the most extreme ways."
2395.0,2396.0, How do you view this?
2396.0,2398.0," Firstly, the informal side of what we've talked about."
2398.0,2405.0," Secondly, because I do believe that some children need their parents more because this is something in the context that they get the most."
2405.0,2409.0," Thirdly, they know that there are different factors and we already concede that,"
2409.0,2413.0, they're already mitigating that as well. They also have to concede that there are different
2413.0,2417.0," spectrums, they also deal with other material. Let's talk about physical illness."
2417.0,2421.0, Opposition barely answers to the alternative medicine that doesn't work.
2421.0,2426.0," No, just that we need to concede that you can relieve some type of symptoms. For example,"
2426.0,2431.52," inhaling the methadone can unclog your nose for a short amount of time. However, it never calms down"
2431.52,2436.8," the inflammation in your sinuses. However, you do believe that it works because one, it made you feel"
2436.8,2442.4," a bit better in a short amount of time. Secondly, because it changes the system. We check the important"
2442.4,2446.16, nuance here is that every success story pushes radical people
2446.16,2447.82, further into their infertile.
2447.82,2450.48, These are the people who won't vaccinate.
2450.48,2452.84," These are the people, thanks to whom today"
2452.84,2454.92," we have cholera back,"
2454.92,2457.06, because the immune systems have been compromised.
2457.06,2460.1," Secondly, it's much more likely that people try it again,"
2460.1,2464.54," alternative medicine again, when they have a worse illness."
2464.54,2466.4," We tell you that in that situation,"
2466.4,2471.4," even if you go to scientific medicine later, it also takes longer to cure whatever issue you've got,"
2471.4,2477.2," because the issue has gotten worse. For example, you have to take antibiotics for a much longer time"
2477.2,2490.4," if you do have lungitis, because you tried menthol oil earlier, and it actually doesn can tell with the issues that you have. Panel, those radical harms don't, they are not that far away as opposition or"
2490.4,2496.0, state has. These are regular people suffering on a daily basis. We've never been more proud to be those.
2497.44,2503.36," I watch Rui Ohama who teaches me about how to cope with stress and about mindfulness all the time,"
2503.36,2505.52," but that does not mean that I'm blind and dumb,"
2505.52,2509.68," that I believe everything that she said. I go to the hospital, I still believe in science, and I"
2509.68,2515.2, know when meditation may not work. For a proposition to say that many people are so naive that they
2515.2,2520.72," will be indoctrinated by this culture and is so demeaning and simply ungrounded in reality, I want"
2520.72,2529.2," to talk about three things. First, on characterization of age-bought culture. Secondly, on hospitals and science that they want to talk about. Finally, on personal subjective"
2529.2,2533.2," matter. Before that though, I want to make three clarifications at the top of my speech. First,"
2533.2,2538.48, let's look at the politicians' case thus far and ask you if you find your case truly persuasive.
2538.48,2544.08," Because their case essentially says, well, when you watch a video of mindfulness of a YouTuber,"
2544.08,2546.4, you don't trust science and mindfulness
2546.4,2551.84, and people with cancer will simply not go to the hospital on our side of the house.
2551.84,2557.92, This is simply insane because they never explain all of the incentives why the companies are so persuasive
2557.92,2564.16," and, unheartedly, do not apply to companies that are selling the medicines that exist symmetrically on either side of the house."
2564.16,2569.0, Because the mechanism of their first argument on why self-help cultures are so coercive and persuasive
2569.0,2574.0," about how big pharmaceutical companies are strong, about how corporations advertising are strong"
2574.0,2577.0, also applies to companies that are selling the medicines to begin with
2577.0,2583.0, which has meant that I think them saying that this culture is persuasive is symmetric in saying
2583.0,2585.0, that our youth medicine will also say that
2585.0,2588.96, big pharmaceutical companies who are also selling the medicines are also persuasive
2588.96,2590.16, in the same manner.
2590.16,2594.98," So all of their beautiful incentive analysis are not going to be the reason why, uniquely,"
2594.98,2597.6, why this culture is going to be persuasive for them.
2597.6,2602.06," But even if we don't buy that judge, I think our still unresponsive characterization was"
2602.06,2608.78," about how other generations simply do not believe it, about how this is counterintuitive for me, which is why I think even if individuals"
2608.78,2612.54," do opt into it, they are not simply blind that they are going to be indoctrinated by"
2612.54,2615.24, everything what those influencers or companies tell them to do.
2615.46,2617.22," And they say, oh, there's information bubble."
2617.46,2618.3, Two responses here.
2618.54,2622.44," Firstly, schools, governments, there are a lot of other institutions and authorities"
2622.44,2625.76, that tell them about how important those science and hospitals are.
2625.76,2633.12," And importantly, they want to talk about children, but those children are actors that still has not been upheld into those kind of things that they say is coercive."
2633.12,2638.88," Which has meant that they are still, they have some sort of like still open mindset about which is actually good or not."
2638.88,2644.24," But secondly, I think precisely for the reasons why they themselves gave as to how these things are harmful,"
2644.24,2649.68," as is the reason why there are a lot of the information about how these things can be harmful,"
2649.68,2654.8, which is why individuals are capable of making an informed choice on our side of the house.
2654.8,2660.24," Secondly, they say asking help from others is actually a good thing, but that's a straw man,"
2660.24,2666.28," and that wasn't our point. Because our point is that yes, asking help for others is actually a good thing."
2666.28,2668.96, Because there are certain issues and things
2668.96,2670.96, that people don't like to tell others
2670.96,2673.6, because of the stigma and how embarrassing it is
2673.6,2675.16, to exist in this kind of school.
2675.16,2677.94," This looks like you being nervous before speeches like me,"
2677.94,2679.56, but you don't wanna say that because it's gonna be
2679.56,2682.06," embarrassing, or you being quote unquote depressed,"
2682.06,2684.56, and those things are apparently a small issue
2684.56,2687.18, and therefore you are unlikely to actually tell others.
2687.18,2689.42, Our claim and our set of accounts is simple.
2689.42,2691.92," When you have this self-help books for instance,"
2691.92,2693.38," when you have those mindfulness,"
2693.38,2696.52," one, you are actually able to actually solve the things"
2696.52,2699.64," on your own, but within so far as,"
2699.64,2701.26," I think these kind of books for example,"
2701.26,2703.48, or actually getting experiences from past people
2703.48,2708.76," who have similar problems with you, can be like individually collected, i.e. you can buy the books, right?"
2708.76,2713.32," But secondly, I think it normalizes you asking help for others when asked for help because"
2713.32,2718.0," people internalize this idea that depression is normal, caring for yourself is important,"
2718.0,2722.2, which acts as a counter-narrative against things like capitalistic mindset or you needing
2722.2,2723.2, to work all the time.
2723.2,2728.24," Which has meant that when they talk about how asking for others is important, it's an R-centered house where"
2728.24,2733.34, we actually get the normalization of having the environment by which we enable people
2733.34,2734.94, to ask for others in the first place.
2735.18,2738.64," Finally, they think that this is not going to work because this is scientifically bad."
2738.92,2742.38," One, Seiji tells you that this is untrue, that mindfulness actually works."
2742.38,2745.76," But secondly, even if this is not scientifically true,"
2745.76,2748.6, I think people perceiving it to be scientifically true
2748.6,2750.58, or people perceiving it to be actually good
2750.58,2752.56, is actually in themselves a good thing.
2752.56,2755.0," Because I think in fact, mindfulness"
2755.0,2757.0, and the solace that you can get as a result of it
2757.0,2759.72, actually do benefit you in its unique ways.
2759.72,2761.76," For example, you not being nervous anymore"
2761.76,2763.32, or you actually being able to try harder
2763.32,2765.04, because you understand that you need to actually
2765.04,2769.0," like self-improve yourself. Before I move on to the first clash, I'll take a POI."
2769.0,2776.74," These mental health issues can mean feeling anxious before eating. If you have actively dealt with all of your issues on your own,"
2776.96,2781.76, what is the incentive to finally admit something to your friends or others?
2781.76,2786.72," I really didn't get that POI, but if you wanna talk about these serious diseases,"
2786.72,2788.74," I'm gonna talk about in my class, don't worry."
2788.74,2790.66," Firstly, let's talk about the characterization"
2790.66,2791.5, of this culture.
2791.5,2793.12, Because what they are saying is that companies
2793.12,2795.2, will tell you that you are the problem
2795.2,2797.12, and you will blame yourself.
2797.12,2798.38, I have two responses.
2798.38,2801.12," Firstly, I don't know what kind of self-help books"
2801.12,2802.42," that they need in this debate,"
2802.42,2805.46," because the thing is, obviously influencers or companies"
2805.46,2807.74," want people to buy these individual services, right?"
2807.74,2809.46, Which means that they have the maximum incentive
2809.46,2811.64, to make sure that these individuals who are reading
2811.64,2814.98, are not going to feel so bad or feel so sad
2814.98,2817.04," in the first place, which has meant that on the incentive,"
2817.04,2818.2, this is simply not true.
2818.2,2820.14, The implication here is that this is not a tension
2820.14,2822.8, because we think that they will spread the mentality
2822.8,2825.04, of needing to improve yourself without
2825.04,2830.24," actually spreading this sensation that you are bad, right? You should be blaming for yourself,"
2830.24,2834.0, right? You are going to tell them that you can improve yourself and here's how.
2834.0,2839.44," Secondly, even if some books and some influencers are bad, the still unresponsive characterization"
2839.44,2844.24," we tell you about from first, is that these cultures, insofar as this creates over-flawed"
2844.24,2845.0," information, even if there's some things that are cultures, insofar as this creates over-flawed information,"
2845.0,2849.0," even if there are some things that are bad, the good things and the good products are"
2849.0,2852.0," able to gain prevalence on our side of the house, which has meant that people will be"
2852.0,2856.0," able to pick and choose the good ones, which is why their case at this point in time is"
2856.0,2857.0, not standing already.
2857.0,2861.0, Let's then talk about their path to victory on science and hospitals.
2861.0,2869.28, Their claim here is that the barrier to entry to hospitals is too high. Exactly! This is our claim. That is why people don't go to hospitals on their
2869.28,2875.96," side of the house for a few reasons. For example, people perceiving depression is too hard and"
2875.96,2879.14, therefore this is not going to be actually connected to the reason why you will go to
2879.14,2883.76," the hospital. Incredibly, on our side of the house, we flip this and tell you that we actively"
2883.76,2888.0, tell them that you must rest and you must actually get the mental health help.
2888.22,2891.5, And this is the reason why you are going to go to hospitals on our side of the house.
2891.72,2898.5," But secondly, if the barrier to entry is high, that characterization is the symmetric characterization, ladies and gentlemen."
2898.76,2907.24, Which has meant that I think it is simply disingenuous for their side of the house to discredit all of these these kind of self-help culture because there are some sort of things that are actually useful
2907.24,2910.86," to you. For example, about how you cope with stress for instance, which has meant that"
2910.86,2914.76," if you cannot go to hospitals on either side of the house, at least the type of help that"
2914.76,2917.92," you can get on our side is the things that you can actually get from those books, which"
2917.92,2922.4, is why I'm weighing the most higher number of individuals we are also winning on science.
2922.68,2926.16," Finally, on personal issues, our claim was really simple, that there are certain things"
2926.16,2929.72," that are personal that you actually do not tell to other people, and you actually see"
2929.72,2933.34, yourself and rationalize yourself that this is not worth going to hospitals.
2933.34,2935.06, This looks like your relationship issues.
2935.06,2936.48, This looks like you getting bullied.
2936.48,2938.4, This looks like me getting nervous before school.
2938.4,2942.76," This is why I think for those things, insofar as actually getting the books or the YouTube"
2942.76,2947.28, videos where you can actually easily see and easily use that to help yourself
2947.28,2951.64, Which is why I think on those personal matter you are able to actually get the individualistic approach
2951.64,2957.98," Which is easier to actually get an R-set of public health. Here's the way in them, two pieces of the way. Firstly on quantity, right?"
2957.98,2961.08, There's simply numerous amount of things like personal issues
2961.08,2965.12," Unsymmetrically on either side of the house, uniquely through this culture,"
2965.12,2969.68," we cater to them. But secondly, on vulnerability, because we told you that there's a lot of people"
2969.68,2974.0," who are depressed in the status quo, who are told that they are stigmatized, that they simply cannot"
2974.0,2978.24," go to see for help. But on the other side of the house, insofar as this is a personalized approach,"
2978.24,2983.04," we're actually able to actually approach and appeal to them, which is why I think"
2983.04,2985.0, our argument is settled at this point already.
2985.0,2987.0," For all those reasons, I'll bet it's true."
2989.0,2994.0, I want to do two top-level clarifications before getting into the mess that was this debate.
2994.0,2998.0," Firstly, what is this culture and what does its implementation look like?"
2998.0,3002.0," I think that we gave you two pieces of framing, and although there is some lackluster engagement,"
3002.0,3006.76," I think that at the end of this debate, these two pieces I'm framing in some way does stand."
3006.76,3012.12," One, that to some extent this self-improvement sphere is in nature competitive."
3012.12,3016.3," That there are hundreds of thousands of YouTubers creating content, which means the few YouTubers"
3016.3,3018.3, that are successful are the best YouTubers.
3018.3,3022.38, Or the fact that there are thousands of books being published every year means that the
3022.38,3028.38, books that do gain popularity are ones that actually impacted people's lives and that the editors approved of.
3028.38,3032.72, The implication being that this competitive landscape means that the most effective forms
3032.72,3036.86, of remedies are the ones that do drag people into this.
3036.86,3041.58," But also secondly, the second thing about what this looks like is that there exist counter-narratives"
3041.58,3051.24, and I'm sure you've heard this from all of our speakers but the reason why these counter narratives are important is because it does cut out a lot of the problems that Proposition does want to outline
3051.24,3056.68," that even though there is an information bubble, you're not going to access it because there are counter narratives"
3056.68,3062.74," that because the youtuber tells you, that because there are people, advocates for actual science"
3062.74,3070.18, you're not going to believe that health crystals are real that's why everybody in this room knows health crystals probably does not work.
3070.18,3074.7," Let's talk about mental health then. Sorry, I have a second piece on clarification. The"
3074.7,3078.68," second piece on clarification is generally just to say that the proposition is very,"
3078.68,3084.2," very low-down value. All of their most extreme forms of harm, egregious harms, individuals"
3084.2,3087.2," looking at the fact that they have cancer and going,"
3087.2,3089.76," oh well, I probably need to buy health crystals."
3089.76,3092.4, Those types of individuals are symmetric in this debate.
3092.4,3096.32, Those type of individuals are still going to go and actively find these remedies.
3096.32,3098.56, Those types of individuals don't need this culture
3100.56,3102.88, for them to actively involve themselves in this.
3102.88,3104.8, What this debate is about is us.
3104.8,3105.0, It's about is us.
3105.0,3106.14, It's about normal people.
3106.14,3108.68, It's about people who are stressed in their daily life.
3108.68,3111.0, And it's about these people who don't actively seek out
3111.0,3113.16, things like therapy that this debate has to be about.
3113.16,3115.32, The extreme forms of these harms are symmetric.
3115.32,3117.22, Dumb people are always dumb.
3117.22,3118.72, Let's talk about mental health.
3118.72,3120.94," About mental health, I want to firstly note"
3120.94,3122.54, that I don't think the characterization
3122.54,3124.28, of the mental health issues that may occur
3124.28,3126.88, in our world are as extreme as proposition makes it out to be.
3126.88,3129.28," One, because the info level is untrue."
3129.28,3134.52," We've given you a lot of analysis on things like counterneur, government, schools, textbooks, medical papers"
3134.52,3138.24, that you can actively access to make sure that what you're consuming is good.
3138.24,3141.44," But secondly, they say, well you're going to do it in desperation."
3141.44,3143.36," But we don't see people do this, right?"
3143.36,3146.1," We don't see people like fall into a fit of,"
3146.1,3147.82," oh my god, I need to buy health crystals"
3147.82,3150.88, and I need to spend thousands of dollars on whatever
3150.88,3152.52, because I am about to die.
3152.52,3155.8," This is not that big, this is not grounded in reality"
3155.8,3157.16," for the majority of individuals,"
3157.16,3159.04, maybe extremely low in sales.
3159.04,3161.4," Secondly, about asking help from others."
3161.4,3163.02," That is, this is the main thing telling us"
3163.02,3165.02, that you are unable to ask help from others in the problem.
3165.4,3165.94, Two things.
3166.22,3168.5," One, this is just not a unique claim to begin with."
3168.6,3171.52, Friends noticing your anxiety is largely symmetric in this debate.
3171.78,3173.06," But second, we flip this."
3173.14,3174.1, It's better in our book.
3174.18,3180.64, You're better able to talk to people when books tell you that that is an effective remedy for solving your situation.
3181.1,3183.14," Finally, their claim on self-blame."
3183.44,3184.1," No, right?"
3184.22,3185.0," No book pushes you this. How would this go? Oh, it's all your fault? You. No, right, no book pushes you to this."
3185.0,3186.0, How would this go?
3186.0,3188.0," Oh, it's all your fault, you should just give up?"
3188.0,3189.0, That's not how it works.
3189.0,3193.0, Self-blame is not the methodology by which self-improvement is done.
3193.0,3196.0, It's rather telling you that there are smaller improvements that you can do in your life
3196.0,3198.0, to make your life a lot better.
3198.0,3199.0, Start by cleaning your room.
3199.0,3201.0, That's the kind of advice we promote.
3201.0,3208.76," Let's talk about our argumentation in more detail as well, because our argumentation is actually pretty in-depth, that is not entirely based on my proposition."
3208.76,3213.36," For example, the fact that we have preventative remedies rather than retrospective remedies,"
3213.36,3216.86," or the accessibility of these things, because calling my therapist is not something I can"
3216.86,3217.86, do right now.
3217.86,3221.0, These are real things that can only happen in our world.
3221.0,3224.24," Finally and very quickly, on physical health, two things."
3224.24,3225.06," One, this is"
3225.06,3229.54, out of the scope of this debate. I don't think physical health is massively impacted by self-improvement
3229.54,3233.84," content in any single way, but also secondly, that these harms are likely not that extreme"
3233.84,3237.9," in this debate. That individuals who have cancer probably resign themselves from cancer,"
3238.1,3241.22," and if there are two dying, well, there is no doubt that that is pretty harsh, but there"
3241.22,3242.82, is no doubt. Sorry. Thanks.
3244.44,3246.0, Psychologists exist in both worlds.
3246.0,3249.0, No court encapsulates this debate better than what
3249.0,3251.0," the second opposition told you,"
3251.0,3253.0, because they admit that you need psychological help.
3253.0,3256.0," In my speech, I'm personally going to tell you why you never opt into this help"
3256.0,3258.0," on their side of the debate,"
3258.0,3260.0, and then why the most important people in this debate
3260.0,3262.0, never get the help that they need.
3262.0,3264.0," Firstly, I want to update you on why you never do it."
3264.0,3268.0," Firstly, because of the massive amounts of false info that tell you that hospitals don't work,"
3268.0,3270.0," therapists don't work, psychologists don't work."
3270.0,3271.0, Why is this info spread?
3271.0,3273.0, Because these companies want you to use their services.
3273.0,3276.0, YouTubers want you to watch their videos.
3276.0,3279.0," We tell you that very simply, they are always going to beat the pharma"
3279.0,3281.0, because they have a race to the top.
3281.0,3282.0, We explain this in our second argument.
3282.0,3286.42," The bigger the claim that you have, the more likely people are going to watch it. If you claim in your five-minute video"
3286.42,3290.58," that you can solve depression, then people are going to go to that video. No big pharma"
3290.58,3293.76, company can claim that they are going to solve depression overnight or in five minutes.
3294.08,3297.9," Secondly, it would seem that once you believe, once one person believes this info, it is"
3297.9,3301.16, very likely that this info is spread because you are motivated to tell your friends and
3301.16,3304.56, family about it in case you want to help them and you believe that this is the thing that
3304.56,3305.32," is going to help them. Thus, there is a you want to help them and you believe that this is the thing that is going to happen."
3305.32,3308.76," Thus there is a massive amount of distrust in the system that legitimately works, you"
3308.76,3309.76, are always going to opt out.
3309.76,3313.36," Second reason you opt out is because of the stigma that is now going to surround it, because"
3313.36,3317.36," they tell us that we're storming them, no they're storming us, because we characterise"
3317.36,3322.56," in our first speech that this rise promotes self-responsibility, i.e. you are the person"
3322.56,3324.48, at fault for everything that happens.
3324.48,3325.04, What this means is that you blame yourself and youe. you are the person at fault for everything that happens. What this means
3325.04,3329.04, is that you blame yourself and you believe that you are the one who can solve this. Thus you don't
3329.04,3332.56, talk to others because you firstly don't believe that they can help you and secondly that they
3332.56,3336.64," should help you because this is your responsibility, the thing you should be working on. Thus they don't"
3336.64,3340.16, get any of those benefits from your friends of dissimilar problems because you don't want them
3340.16,3343.68, to notice because you want to hide it and you want to help yourself. Thus they don't get those
3343.68,3346.78, benefits. And the third reason you opt out is the inherent situation where you
3346.78,3350.14, can't do both. We explained that sometimes you pay a lot of money for a moonstone and
3350.14,3354.04, you can't also get the medication. And when you opt to get that moonstone and you don't
3354.04,3358.78," get that medication, you have inherently opted out of the system. Thus, the bottom line here"
3358.78,3363.32," is simple. Therapy is always going to work no matter how simple your situation is. However,"
3363.32,3368.8, there is a ceiling for which yoga cannot help you anymore and when you hit that ceiling in the road the most negative impacts
3368.8,3372.96, you realize we have told you this from the first. Let's talk about the most important people in this
3372.96,3376.96," debate, the ones suffering the most. And we say it's really offensive when they say that these people"
3376.96,3381.04, are dumb for believing these medicines and alternative options because it's not that they are
3381.04,3388.0," dumb but we characterize them that they are not rational actors. When faced with incredible pain, when faced with depression and faced with suffering,"
3388.0,3393.0," anything that can help, anything that promises to help, you are willing to give a shot to."
3393.0,3396.0, We tell you that this is the most crucial part of this debate.
3396.0,3399.0," Firstly, because of the snowball effect that they never respond to."
3399.0,3404.0," Why? That starting from yoga, you actually move on to other parts of this eventually completely distrusting system,"
3404.0,3409.04," which goes likewise to trying anything that helps, anything that promises to be better."
3409.36,3413.3," And secondly, that you feel incredibly guilty because of the stigma when you blame yourself"
3413.3,3416.96, for your situation and the situation doesn't get better because often these videos don't
3416.96,3420.34, tell you when you're in the deepest depths of depression and they tell you that you should
3420.34,3421.04, be able to help yourself.
3421.22,3424.78, You feel incredibly guilty and your situation worsens even more because you think you are
3424.78,3427.5, useless. None of this has ever been reported on their
3427.5,3431.64," side, right? When the biggest impact that they claim is that you are more confident"
3431.64,3435.58," in your VSTC speech, but we tell you you can legitimately handle your depression because"
3435.58,3439.72," you are more likely to opt into the best system to legitimately help you, we clearly win this"
3439.72,3443.26," debate because debating is cool, but it's not as important as your mental health, right?"
3443.52,3446.8," Lastly, we tell you that the physical part is also extremely important because this is"
3446.8,3450.88," a spectrum, as we see, and at one end of the spectrum people are dying. There are a lot of"
3450.88,3454.0," reasons. First, because sometimes you have legitimately bad medication, i.e. scammers are"
3454.0,3457.44," really motivated to not sell good things or aren't even capable of selling good things,"
3457.44,3462.24," they never respond to this analysis, right? But also because there's just no access to it anymore."
3462.24,3466.6," I tell you very simply that it doesn't, that even in situations where it does possibly,"
3466.6,3467.6," to a certain extent, work,"
3467.6,3469.6, they have never proved why it was going to work better
3469.6,3471.6, than the medication or things that we offer.
3471.6,3473.6," Thus, the worst case that we have is that"
3473.6,3475.4," these two things are completely equal,"
3475.4,3476.8," but in most cases in our world,"
3476.8,3478.4," it's going to be far better, right?"
3478.4,3481.4," When people are suffering on a physical health standard,"
3481.4,3483.6, we can legitimately help them so much more
3483.6,3485.0, than they ever legitimately
3485.0,3489.0," can. For all of these reasons, we win this debate because the most vulnerable people"
3489.0,3493.0," are our health, and every one of us also gets help if they need it, if they ask for it,"
3493.0,3496.84, and they are always more likely to ask for it in our world. I'm so proud of you. Thank you.
