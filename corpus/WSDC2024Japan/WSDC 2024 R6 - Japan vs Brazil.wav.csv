0.0,7.0," Art is a source of expression, a source of happiness for artists and people."
7.0,14.0," But at the same time, in the status quo, art is an inherently extremely fragile profession."
14.0,20.0," Because under the status quo, when there are only grants and fellowships, art is a lucky opportunity"
20.0,26.54," that is only granted to the richest, most lucky individuals who manage to get through these applications."
26.96,30.34," We believe on side proposition that art should be accessible,"
30.34,36.1," it should be enjoyed by all individuals, including those at the bottom of the social ladder."
36.5,37.7, So proud to propose.
38.88,43.28," My arguments for today is firstly on increased accessibility of art,"
43.7,45.56," and secondly, why fellowships hurt"
45.56,49.76, minorities disproportionately and why we're able to benefit those minorities
49.76,55.18," on our side. But before that two pieces on framing. Firstly, what does the"
55.18,60.12, implementation of this basic income policy look like? We think that this
60.12,64.38, basically looks like providing less than the basic income and only the basic
64.38,67.14, living expenses for these people.
67.6,73.48, The implication of this is that there will be no irrational opt-in from actors who don't really want to pursue art.
73.48,75.42, Because this is not a huge grant.
75.52,79.4, We are providing them with the basic necessities that they need to keep on living.
79.54,90.56," The people who will benefit from this policy are the people in the status quo who want to pursue art. But secondly, what is the definition of artist and who are the artists who will be funding?"
90.56,95.84," We think that there are two criteria. Firstly, that these people will basically have to have"
95.84,101.68," some, be making some sort of income from art. But secondly, that they have to be making art"
101.68,109.44, at some level of consistency. The implication of this is that this person who just made one song like 20 years ago
109.44,115.4, and has not made any songs since is simply not going to be able to continuously get money from this policy.
115.92,120.5," With that then, on to our first argument of increased accessibility on art."
120.5,122.48, There are two layers to this argument.
123.0,125.62," First layer, why under fellowship and grant"
125.62,132.32," programs in the status quo, not many people can access art in the first place. This is"
132.32,137.22," simply due to the fact that currently the art industry is very, very competitive, and"
137.22,141.98, you have to take down lots of competition in order to even get these grants in the first
141.98,146.6," place, which are incredibly limited. You do not know who gets these grants,"
146.6,151.6," because, especially so, since in order to get a grant,"
151.66,154.18, you need to pass these application processes.
154.18,155.92," What that means is that inherently,"
155.92,158.68," people who had access to money to go to art schools,"
158.68,161.76," who had money to access good paint brushes, good paint,"
161.76,164.18, who had money to be able to have the capacity
164.18,169.3, to have time to even create these art pieces or create great art pieces to send to the
169.3,173.56, application process. Only those rich and very privileged individuals can get
173.56,178.68, access to these grants and fellowships on our side of the house. We think this
178.68,183.38, is also extremely difficult for people to just balance the application
183.38,186.16, process with other things like applying for
186.16,190.24," your side jobs for example. So the implication of this is that poor people, especially those"
190.24,195.04," who need to do multiple jobs at the same time, are very very disadvantaged when it comes"
195.04,199.4, to applying for these applications because they cannot produce good enough quality art
199.4,204.6," to be the people at the top. Note that there's also no guarantee, again, even if you as a"
204.6,208.24," poor person are able to get a grant the first time, there's no guarantee that you'll be"
208.24,212.36, able to get a grant the second time and the third time because it is so competitive.
212.36,216.68," On that side, no thank you, we think that because of this, on that side, many"
216.68,219.92, people have to quit art in the first place because their paintings do not go
219.92,223.18, through the application process and they're not even able to get out into
223.18,228.92," the public sphere. We think that there are also people who pursue art because they're so passionate about art,"
229.1,233.5," but because they continue to pursue this, they are only depleting money from their pockets"
233.5,238.44," and going into the cycle of eternal poverty, not being able to get any money whatsoever."
238.86,243.04, This looks like the people who create mangas in Japan. We think that there are many people
243.04,249.36, who like to pursue mangas but simply cannot get enough income to sustain their basic necessities and they
249.36,254.94," keep but and yet they still keep on going. On the comparative, on our side, under our policy,"
254.94,259.88, everyone is able to get money. Every single artist is able to get money. So
259.88,264.26," on to later to them. What is the impact of this? The impact of this is twofold. Firstly,"
264.26,268.16, everyone who wants to pursue art can pursue art. And note that this is
268.16,272.54," incredibly important, Josh, because the characterization of these"
272.54,276.68, artists are that these people inherently want to pursue art because you wouldn't
276.68,281.18," be an artist if you didn't like doing art, right? So on that side, when we're"
281.18,284.8," actively taking away the opportunities to succeed, it's incredibly"
284.8,290.56, mentally harming and an inherent contradiction to that entire identity as an artist when
290.56,295.16, we think that we are able to give them the opportunities that they deserve to be given
295.16,296.72, on our side of the house.
296.96,301.32," But secondly, we think that we also are able to give money to those who continue to pursue"
301.32,301.62, art.
301.82,308.04," We think that on either side, due to passion, people will continue to pursue art. We think that we are uniquely able to give them the money"
308.04,311.94, and give them the basic necessities to be able to sustain themselves on our
311.94,318.42," side of the house. Before I go into my second argument, what do you mean by"
318.42,323.4, accessing art? We think that accessing art is basically the ability for artists
323.4,325.1," to be able to make profit from art,"
328.74,329.32," to be able to succeed from art, to be able to get self-sustainability from art."
332.62,333.32," Second argument then, why fellowships hurt minorities disproportionately."
335.04,335.36, There are three mechanisms of this.
339.96,343.6," Firstly, we think that in this stage, the government and the people who grant these fellowships is an amalgamation from people from majority communities, right?"
343.6,347.72, These people have intrinsic biases that lean towards that majority community.
348.04,351.42," For example, in Japan, that would be the very rich elitist at the top."
351.8,356.38," But you think that secondly, the fact that there's no objective metric"
356.38,359.46, to decide whether one piece of art is good or bad
359.46,363.68, means that people can very easily weaponize this lack of objectivity
363.68,365.38, and discriminate against minority
365.38,370.1," artists. This looks like, for example, in a very white-centric community, we think that"
370.1,375.6," if you can have a portrait of an Asian with a portrait of a white person, even if the"
375.6,379.84," skills and the art style that were used were the same, we think that the white person or"
379.84,389.04," the portrait of the white person is more likely to be granted access and to be granted fellowship. But thirdly, we think that even if the minorities are able to get"
389.04,393.32," through this application process, we think that they'll still cater to the majority"
393.32,398.84, perspective. We think that this is because they're dependent on the majority people
398.84,409.32," for that funding. What that means is that when people want to make movies about rape victims, they will not really depict the full brutality of it,"
409.32,414.0," and will not really blame men for it, and we think that they will downplay this to a significant extent."
414.22,426.16," This also looks like whitewashed paintings of racism that exist in the state's core, and can only get publicity under that brutal policy. The implication of this is that minorities cannot get runs,"
426.16,431.44," and even if they do, it's only for artists who downplay their social message."
431.44,433.44, So what is the importance of this?
433.44,435.44, The importance of this is twofold.
435.44,438.16," Firstly, on principle, we think that this is principally wrong."
438.16,441.36," We think that this is an inherently arbitrary way you are born,"
441.36,443.04," and what status you are born,"
443.04,449.28, so it is wrong for the state to actively endorse discrimination against certain groups of people. Just in the same way it is not
449.28,453.4, good for the state to actively fund white schools over black schools or white schools
453.4,457.84, over Latino schools. We think that it is simply wrong to take this policy or to further the
457.84,462.64," continuation of this policy. This policy should be for all. But secondly, we think that minority"
462.64,469.68," art in and of itself is extremely important, especially for those minorities, because it is simply very liberating for them"
469.68,473.86," to be able to express their anger, to express their oppression. We think that at the point"
473.86,477.58," in which the state is not allowing them to do this, we think that we should take this"
477.58,481.76, policy that allows minorities to at least be able to self-express themselves and make
481.76,491.12," an income from it. But lastly, we think that there are many societal implications of this. The fact that literary arts like the colour purple or"
491.12,497.04," music from artistic choice of art spread huge societal messages to the rest of society, we think"
497.04,501.04," that on that side, that is at the point in which you're not able to get the societal narratives out"
501.04,506.0," in the open. For all those reasons, proud to propose. Thank you."
512.2,516.3," Panel, their side falls because their own characterization and their own model rebut their own whole case. That's why I'm so proud to oppose. Before going to the setup and before going to the rebuttal,"
516.3,520.8," there's too many arguments to debate. Firstly, about how the government should be able to finance art"
520.8,525.68," with an extra social feedback, but secondly, about how we in our cyber are"
525.68,528.14, able to better help the artist.
528.14,531.94," Before going to a piece of setup, I'd like to introduce a piece of setup."
531.94,536.88," What they bring in their model is that for the person to be able to enter their program,"
536.88,542.08," this person needs to already be able to sustain itself in art, needs to already be able to"
542.08,545.76, make some profit out of the art. And then they claim to me
545.76,551.04, that they would be helping poor people and they would be helping those minorities because those
551.04,554.8," are the minorities and those are the poor people who are not able to produce art, because they are"
554.8,558.72," not able to sustain themselves, because they are poorer than they would be to actually have access"
558.72,563.44," to those things. I believe that this own model, this own characterization go against, because"
563.44,565.0," go against their own case, because"
565.0,569.0, now those people are already sustaining themselves and are already able to gain profit out of
569.0,572.0, the art they are producing. They don't necessarily need the help that the other side of the house
572.0,575.0," is giving, because they are already sustaining themselves, they are already gaining something"
575.0,581.0," out of their art. But secondly, their whole argument tries to prove to me about two things."
581.0,585.48," Firstly, about how art is a source of happiness, but secondly, about the other side of the house,"
585.48,589.54," and it's very, the market of art is actually very limited."
590.56,592.48, But they never explained to me why exactly
592.48,595.04, the government should give money to those people
595.04,596.8, because of those two reasons.
596.8,598.32," Because look, there's a lot of things"
598.32,599.76, who can bring happiness to people.
599.76,601.42," When debate brings happiness to me,"
601.42,603.48, that's not why and that's not a reason
603.48,608.8," that's why the government would give me money for me to be able to continue debating for the rest of my life. But secondly,"
608.8,613.4," they never proved to me why a market, a specific market being very limited and has a very high"
613.4,618.6," barrier of entry, the government should give money to those people to produce that. I think"
618.6,622.8," there's a lot of sectors in the economy, there's a lot of sectors in the workplace that are"
622.8,627.04, very limited and that have very high barriers of entry to the sources of art.
627.04,630.04, And I don't think that the government should be able to give money to all of those people
630.04,633.82, so they can actually enter those type of things in the market.
634.04,637.7, So let's actually understand how the comparative debate looks like.
637.88,640.64," The difference between the words, their role is about the artists."
640.92,644.66," They are now giving money to all of those artists, independent if their art are good"
644.66,646.0, or if their art are bad.
646.0,653.0," But secondly, our rule is about the artist's self. It is about the value that the art can aggregate to the role."
653.0,665.0," Because it is our sign that with more selective process, people are actually able to analyze the art and actually understand if the art is able to produce some social impact to society."
665.0,672.0," So let's understand why would that be affecting our side of the house, and who would be analyzing this art in our side of the house."
672.0,675.0," We believe that our government and organization, why does this mean?"
675.0,678.0," When we talk about government, it's not the president who would be analyzing that."
678.0,683.0," We're talking about colleges, universities, professionals inside the ministries of education, inside ministries of art,"
683.0,685.7, but we're also talking about independent organizations
685.7,692.7," who also have an interest in producing art, in supporting those artists. We're talking about independent organizations funded by other people."
692.7,699.7," All of that is who is funding the art on our side of the house, and all those people will be analyzing the quality of their art on their side of the house."
699.7,707.1," It's very difficult for them to be able to claim that they will be able to analyze the quality of the art and the social impact that art has, because as the new infoslide says, they"
707.1,709.44, will be financing all artists in their side of the house.
711.24,714.6, And how is the process in our side of the house and why is it so effective?
714.74,718.96," They will be analyzing which project this is, how does this project look like, is it"
718.96,722.48," a theater, what is the social impact of that theater, how much money will it cost?"
722.58,726.5, All of those things will be analyzed in order to be able to analyze the quality of their life.
726.5,731.5," So now let's understand about in our side of the house, we are actually able to generate more social impact."
731.5,737.5, Why? We believe that art in our side of the house and the art that the government is putting should necessarily have a social impact.
737.5,743.5," Because the money that the government is giving to the art is the money that comes from the people, comes from the thanks of the people,"
743.5,748.0," and the money that people are giving and the public, the general public, is giving to the government."
748.0,754.0," Therefore, the money that the government allocates must generate some social impact to the general public as well."
754.0,760.0," If their point is based on the fact that art is a passion of someone, and therefore someone is producing art at their house"
760.0,764.0," and is producing a paint in their house and is not generating any social impact,"
764.0,766.4," I don't see why the government in Australia should give money to that,"
766.4,769.2, since the government would not be taking money from the general population
769.2,771.8," and giving it to a very specific thing, yes, except for POI."
771.8,776.1, Behind the guise of social utility is governments weaponizing this word
776.1,780.2, to limit the capacity for specific individuals and their anti-government views
780.2,781.9, to remain proliferated into society.
781.9,786.0," As I just explained, I explained to you why would that be effective."
786.0,788.0, I don't think there's a president that is only doing that.
788.0,791.0," We have a minister of education, we have a minister of art."
791.0,796.0," But not only that, even if you try to portray that those are also used by the government"
796.0,798.0," or instrumentalized government propaganda,"
798.0,801.0," in our side of the house, as the info slide says, we're still talking about organizations."
801.0,803.0, We're still talking about independent organizations.
803.0,806.96," If a very rich independent organization decides to do a part in our set up the house,"
806.96,810.8," they will still be able to do so, and they will still be able to do so with a quality of art,"
810.8,814.0, because in our site is that where we have a selective process.
815.52,822.72, So how is the social impact defined? The social impact is about the social impact that is able to generate on people.
822.72,828.32," What are we talking about? We're talking about the emotional response that it has on people. We're talking about, for example,"
828.32,832.8, how people would think and how people would reflect upon that art. So therefore we're not
832.8,837.2, finding any type of art. We're finding the type of art that is able to generate emotional response.
837.2,841.6, We're finding the type of art that is able to generate real thinking and a broader thinking
841.6,846.0, in people's lives. How are we actually having better quality of art in our set of thoughts?
846.0,850.0," Because first, know that art, and for you to be able to produce art, is expensive."
850.0,854.0," Even when we talk about small art, the resources for you to paint is very expensive."
854.0,858.0," The things that you need to paint, for example, something, are also very expensive."
858.0,862.0," The testing, the studying, all of those things that you need are very expensive."
862.0,865.96," But not only that, there are types of art that are intrinsically expensive."
865.96,867.36, We're talking about theater.
867.36,869.0, For you to be able to produce a play
869.0,870.7," that's also very expensive,"
870.7,872.2," very expensive to do that plays,"
872.2,875.06, you need actors that will go a lot of money.
875.06,875.94," When you talk about movie,"
875.94,878.24, that's also intrinsically expensive.
878.24,879.56, So how in their side of the house
879.56,881.56, are you actually taking away this quality?
881.56,882.9," Because in their side of the house,"
882.9,894.0," since they're giving that money to more people, since they need to be able to allocate all artists and not specific projects, now they need to be able to give small amounts of money for each individual."
894.0,906.0," Since they have more individuals and since they have more projects to be able to fund, the amount of money that those projects are receiving are smaller when compared to our side of the house, where we have a smaller amount of projects being funded"
906.0,911.0, and therefore also being able to give a bigger amount of money to each project.
911.0,913.0, So what does this mean? What is the implication of that?
913.0,919.0," Even though we have less projects, our process has more quality, because now people are able to actually study about art,"
919.0,924.0," are actually able to buy the best resources in the market, are actually able to test about the art,"
924.0,927.8," but secondly, they are able to produce a type of art that wouldn't be produced in their"
927.8,930.9," side of the house. And here we meet with their main stakeholder. Their main stakeholder,"
930.9,934.4," those four people that we talked about, those minorities, now they are also able to produce"
934.4,937.8," theater, movies. They're in their side of the house, they would never be able to produce"
937.8,941.3," because the amount of money that those people are giving, the amount of money that the government"
941.3,946.0," is giving, is way less because they needs to fund a whole amount of people."
946.0,950.0," Therefore, what are the actual implications of our settlement house?"
950.0,957.0," We are able to not only fulfill the actual necessities of the government that they are having in their settlement house,"
957.0,961.0," because they never gave me reasons and now they have the money to pursue me,"
961.0,970.64," while the government specifically has a reason to give those people that money, but also we are proving to you how we are able to better produce quality"
970.64,975.5," of art and how also we are able to produce, how we are able to have those arts better"
975.5,979.68, publicized. Why? Because we also have a matter of exclusivity in our separate house. When
979.68,982.8," there's less projects being funded by the government, this means that when people look"
982.8,1008.4," at the art and look at the symbol of the government and understand that the art is being financed by the government and was selected in a selective process, those people when they see the art are able to see, wow, this art must be of quality, now I will consume that more. Therefore, we have to publicize the art more and that's why I'm so proud to oppose. The usage of art as utility maximizing machines is something that we all should not forget"
1008.4,1010.9, because art is so much more than that.
1010.9,1012.6, Art is livelihood.
1012.6,1016.7, Art is life and that is what we stand for in our work because what we allow individuals
1016.7,1021.6," to do is to express themselves regardless of if that piece of art creates social utility,"
1021.6,1027.0," regardless of if that goes against what the government wants to proliferate, and regardless of your social background."
1027.0,1032.0," In my speech, I'm going to do two levels of top-of-the-book clarification, then a couple"
1032.0,1033.0, of clusters.
1033.0,1037.0," On top-of-the-book clarification, I want to note two crucial things in this debate."
1037.0,1042.0," Firstly, opposition misunderstands or mischaracterizes our frame, because what they tell us is that"
1042.0,1047.42, they think that we support a world in which only artists who earn enough to sustain themselves get this funding.
1047.74,1048.58, This is not true.
1048.84,1053.1," What we say we support is artists who have some amount of income from art,"
1053.18,1056.32, whether that be $10 a month or whether that be $100 a month.
1056.58,1059.5, We don't believe that these artists are making all of their income off of this art.
1059.62,1061.42," Obviously, they wouldn't need it in that case."
1061.48,1068.96," We did not say this to clarify. But secondly, I also don't think that opposition has enough fiat to say that the standard by which"
1068.96,1073.2, all of these artworks will be judged is simply unsocial utility for two reasons.
1073.2,1077.88," Number one, because oftentimes these art programs, as the Incluside specifies,"
1077.88,1080.94," are external to the government through things like organizations, which"
1080.94,1084.6," governments have very little purview over. And also secondly, that there are a lot of"
1084.6,1087.44," uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and governments have very little purview over, and also secondly, that there are a lot of uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and"
1087.44,1091.08," governments. Like yes, the Minister of Art does exist, but you also don't know what"
1091.08,1094.52," the Minister of Art thinks, and you cannot believe that the Minister of Art is"
1094.52,1098.42," always going to maximize social utility. Therefore, I don't think the criteria by"
1098.42,1102.72, which opposition can judge artwork is always going to be this idea of social
1102.72,1105.6," utility. With that said then, I want to firstly discuss"
1105.6,1107.96," which side is better on the level of social utility,"
1107.96,1110.4," largely dealing with most of Oppa's shoot game,"
1110.4,1111.9," that are minorities' accessibility,"
1111.9,1113.96," and finally, quality of art."
1113.96,1116.12," Firstly, on social utility, I want to know"
1116.12,1118.84, three main things about this argumentation.
1118.84,1120.98," I want to know firstly, that this maximization"
1120.98,1123.36," of social utility is not true,"
1123.36,1126.18, that I don't think opposition fulfills the adequate burden
1126.18,1129.42, of proving to you how these artworks are going to create
1129.42,1131.0, this scale of social utility.
1131.0,1132.32," We don't know what they're talking about,"
1132.32,1134.5, we don't know what the mechanization is.
1134.5,1136.72," On the flip, what we believe is oftentimes"
1136.72,1139.08, these artworks are chosen deliberately
1139.08,1141.5, through the incentives of specific actors.
1141.5,1144.04," If, for example, you are an actor that lead government,"
1144.04,1147.76, you're probably not going to want to proliferate messaging that goes against what your
1147.76,1151.44, government stands for. Maybe that means that you don't want to promote things like
1151.44,1155.42, female rights or LGBTQ rights because you're a conservative government. Maybe
1155.42,1159.6, all that means is that you don't want to depict specific politicians in negative
1159.6,1162.86, ways. But we do think that in any scenario there are going to be third
1162.86,1168.0," party, other ulterior incentives other than social utility that mess with the catalyst."
1168.0,1178.0," The problem and the unique reason why this is extremely harmful in opposition is because opposition allows for governments to do this, organizations to do this, under the guise of social utility."
1178.0,1185.6, Because what these people can do is claim they're trying to maximize social utility while minimizing individuals who have opposing views.
1185.6,1188.52," They can do this, and this is going to be incredibly harmful."
1188.52,1192.92, But the second layer of response is to say that not only is this harmful in a general scale
1192.92,1195.96," because the maximization of social utility isn't going to happen,"
1195.96,1200.52, but also that this is going to massively harm minorities specifically for two main reasons.
1200.52,1205.0," Number one, because minorities are unable to create artworks that are probably going to be perceived as good,"
1205.0,1208.0," or as the info slide says, have mirrors in a lot of scenarios."
1208.0,1214.0," Because as they, to somewhat correctly characterize, artwork to some extent does require a lot of training,"
1214.0,1219.0," and creating good artwork, or artwork that will be accepted by society and therefore create social utility,"
1219.0,1228.6, are going to have to be artworks that have a lot of resources put into it. The implication being that minorities are unable to access the scale of social utility
1228.6,1232.32," that opposition wants to push, and therefore these vulnerable actors, who one of their"
1232.32,1236.36," only methods by which they can self-express is artwork, are limited."
1236.36,1239.96," The reason why this is crucial is, just like I said, this is one of the only methods for"
1239.96,1244.8," their self-expression, because they cannot do things like vote in the government and"
1244.8,1247.44, have enough votes to create change for themselves.
1247.44,1249.9," But ours can be sensationalized, ours can be picked up,"
1249.9,1251.94," ours can be displayed, and this can proliferate"
1251.94,1255.8," their messaging across a broader spectrum of individuals,"
1255.8,1258.28, doing things like a garden and sympathy for votes.
1258.28,1260.42, The implication is minorities are better at voting.
1260.42,1262.42, But the second reason why minorities are hot
1262.42,1264.64," is as I said, there are going to be intrinsic biases"
1264.64,1268.78," that mess with the process, which means that the maximization of social utility is"
1268.78,1270.78, going to be the minimization of minorities.
1270.78,1272.78," Before my third response, go ahead."
1272.78,1274.78, The biases isn't exclusive.
1274.78,1276.78," In both sides of the house, government needs to decide what is hard."
1276.78,1280.78, And graffiti is willing to receive money in both sides of the house because the government
1280.78,1282.78," will say, this is not hard."
1282.78,1284.78," Yeah, okay, two things."
1284.78,1286.06," One, I don't think that this is very true."
1286.16,1288.22," There is a dictionary definition of art, and graffiti"
1288.22,1290.04, does fit into that dictionary definition
1290.04,1292.08, of art. We have thoughts for English dictionary
1292.08,1293.98," right there, we'll lift it up. But also, secondly,"
1294.28,1296.32, I want you to know that this is a highly uncomparative
1296.32,1298.1," theme at best, because their world has"
1298.1,1300.46, a lot more limitation than anything in our world.
1300.56,1302.16, Maybe graffiti won't get any funding
1302.16,1304.18," in our world, but a hell of a lot more things"
1304.18,1307.0, are going to get funding in our world in comparison to their world.
1307.0,1315.0, Third and final response then. Social utility is a fluffy impact. It is an impact that is unfair. We do not know what type of social utility is created.
1315.0,1320.0, We don't know what types of art they're making. We don't know what types of social utility they're creating in their world.
1320.0,1325.7, We think that a far more important impact in this debate that isn't the second passion. Woodside is better in terms of accessibility.
1325.7,1327.9, Our argumentation was fairly introverted.
1327.9,1331.9," We tell you that art is a very competitive landscape, that individuals have to fight"
1331.9,1337.9," tooth and nail to make it in any sort of way, and that this is an unsustainable way to run"
1337.9,1338.9, this industry.
1338.9,1343.4," On the flip end, what we can do is we can guarantee that these individuals have some"
1343.4,1346.18, amount of income so that they can continue to pursue their passions.
1346.64,1348.4, There are two important impacts of this.
1348.7,1351.3," Firstly, that these individuals can do what they want."
1351.52,1355.6," Rather than, for example, having to do things like take on three part-time jobs, you can"
1355.6,1358.72, take on two and you spend the rest of the time doing your hard work.
1359.02,1362.04," But also secondly, that leads to mass-scale poverty alleviation."
1362.04,1366.9, But a lot of times these artists are in poor situations and they're unable to live by themselves.
1366.9,1369.68," And for these individuals, we can alleviate their poverty."
1369.68,1371.96, Now the outlandish opposition response you get
1371.96,1375.28," in response about this is basically to say,"
1375.28,1377.74," well, governments shouldn't have to do this"
1377.74,1379.92, because this is the same in any other industry.
1379.92,1381.88, There's two problems with this analysis.
1381.88,1384.76," Number one, it is not the same in every other industry."
1384.76,1388.04, R is actually uniquely competitive and uniquely cut-throat
1388.04,1391.32, and only the top 1% of earners earn enough income
1391.32,1392.46, to sustain themselves.
1392.46,1394.48, R is more competitive than anything else.
1394.48,1397.34," But secondly, we do think that this utility maximization"
1397.34,1398.76," of things like poverty alleviation,"
1398.76,1400.84," hard impacts that we can get in our world,"
1400.84,1402.58, is something that governments are prioritizing
1402.58,1408.5," over unclear impacting like social utility. Before I move on, we'll ask P.O.I. here."
1408.5,1412.7, You talk about the duty and you talk about the poverty. Do you believe that governments
1412.7,1416.12, can still have welfare policies just as we do with the aid workers? We don't believe
1416.12,1419.0, that they need to give money to art just so we can get that.
1419.0,1424.14," Yeah, two things. One, we have a lot of money here, we should probably be using it for the"
1424.14,1425.0," poor, that was our case."
1425.0,1430.0," And also secondly, I don't think that governments have enough welfare policy to, for example, target artists."
1430.0,1434.0," Often times it's unemployment benefits, for example, that governments use that money for."
1434.0,1438.0," Artists have some amount of employment, I don't think artists are getting enough money right now."
1438.0,1447.92," Finally then, I want to, in my last 40 seconds, just deal with this, I just want to finally talk a little bit more about minorities because there was an important principle of the past that was unengaged in"
1447.92,1453.26," this argumentation. That is to say, the governments are discriminating minorities or disenfranchised"
1453.26,1456.52, individuals uniquely in all positions of the world under the disguise of social utility
1456.52,1462.22, or in the disguise of merit. This is an unjustifiable way to run things. That even if all of these
1462.22,1465.0," individuals have the most maximal altruistic incentives,"
1465.0,1470.0," and all they want to do is maximize social utility, all they want to do is create a better art history,"
1470.0,1474.0, that the fact that they have some amount of intrinsic biases that clash against that incentive
1474.0,1477.0, is going to mean that they're going to have biased results.
1477.0,1481.0," That even if everybody tries their absolute best, it is still going to be biased."
1481.0,1488.0," The government cannot condone such injustices. This is a principle, and is an impact alone that is debate winning. I would stand for my vote."
1488.0,1492.0," Panel, I love drawing. I think drawing is very important."
1492.0,1496.0, I think drawing makes me happy. But that doesn't mean that the government necessarily needs to give me money
1496.0,1500.0," for that. We believe that art is impactful so that people can see it, so that people"
1500.0,1504.0, can feel it. We believe access to art is so significant because
1504.0,1505.84, art moves people.
1505.84,1510.0," On their side of the house, you're funding art that will never meet the public eye. Art"
1510.0,1514.34," that will never get to fulfill its role, which they admit is making people happy and feel"
1514.34,1519.0, fit. We're incredibly proud to defend quality art on side opposition.
1519.0,1523.0," What am I addressing in this speech? Firstly, I'm going to be discussing our process and"
1523.0,1528.0," the concept of access to art. Then I will be engaging our minorities, but also I will be bringing a second constructive"
1528.0,1532.0, on how we better the actual careers of the artists they so care about.
1532.0,1536.0," But firstly, on access to art, notice that they say that art is important within the first speech"
1536.0,1539.0," because it makes you happy, because it's a form of expression."
1539.0,1543.0, Notice how this isn't contingent on you having a living to produce art.
1543.0,1545.32, You can still make art because it makes you happy
1545.32,1550.28," on both sides of the house. We believe that people who enjoy drawing, people who enjoy singing or"
1550.28,1554.96," playing a guitar, people who enjoy writing can still do that on their side of the house, just"
1554.96,1559.08, as they can on our side of the house. That isn't the biggest delta on this debate. We're not stopping
1559.08,1565.82," people from doing things that make them happy. But most importantly, we believe that access to the industry of"
1565.82,1569.56, art is important for the sake of making sure that things that are being published are of
1569.56,1573.94, quality and that we have actual people who are capable of publishing things that aren't
1573.94,1579.04, just the rich white majority who already have access and resources to enter these institutions
1579.04,1582.62," in the first place. On side opposition, we're actually providing people a ticket to enter"
1582.62,1585.88, this industry because they're continuously locked of on their side of the house.
1586.32,1587.78," Now, how does this process work?"
1588.2,1594.7," We believe that on our side of the house, you will have to submit a portfolio, meaning you show the process of your work, the kind of work you produce, how you study work."
1594.96,1598.14," You're going to provide, at least, an analysis on the work you produce."
1598.32,1601.1, You're going to provide proposals for what you want to produce your work about.
1601.36,1603.18, And you might go through an interview with them.
1603.34,1609.0, This means that the judgment is much more than just a simple loss and a bias. There's a literal amount
1609.0,1612.42, of evaluation in regards to quality. Remember that these institutions aren't
1612.42,1616.2," just political institutions, these are literal institutions filled with people"
1616.2,1619.44, who spend their entire lives studying and dedicating themselves to art because
1619.44,1623.04," they think it's important and because they like analyzing it, they think it has depth. We don't"
1623.04,1625.96," think these people are going to immediately put their bias in the first place,"
1625.96,1628.1, and that they have the incentive and the capacity
1628.1,1630.56, to care about the quality of it.
1630.56,1632.72," Now, they see that these institutions have good biases,"
1632.72,1634.48, but notice that institutions aren't singular.
1634.48,1636.24, You can compose an institution and not hold
1636.24,1637.88, every single value it proposes.
1637.88,1639.38," These processes, being so complex,"
1639.38,1641.28," have multiple individuals in each phase,"
1641.28,1643.46," which each have their own personal biases,"
1643.46,1647.2, which will be conducting thousands and thousands of interviews and processes. We don't
1647.2,1658.36," believe that there is a single bias that is going to outrule them all. And even if I buy that, we still think that there are competing institutions with competing biases. We're going to have different arts being promoted from different places, like different galleries, museums,"
1658.36,1667.88," charities, etc. So we don't think that that's a big point of provision on our side of the house. Now, we much rather have art that is judged on depth and intention, on the level of skill"
1667.88,1671.24," of those artists, and the meaning, so that we can actually produce quality art."
1671.24,1675.8," But most importantly, we think it is significantly more important to provide people with resources"
1675.8,1679.12, so that that art can actually see the light of day.
1679.12,1684.6," Why are some of the most impactful, for example, writers that we have so important?"
1684.6,1685.36," Think of Franz Kafka, think of Ferd that we have so important. Think of Franz"
1685.36,1689.02," Kafka, think of Ferdinand Pessoa. Their art is important because it reached the world."
1689.28,1693.62," Their art almost was completely insignificant and forgotten, and didn't provoke any impact"
1693.62,1697.1," whatsoever because it wasn't published. On their side of the house, you're now providing"
1697.1,1701.66, people with enough resources to actually enter and break into the industry of art with what
1701.66,1706.58, they're producing. You need significant amounts of money so that you can actually have trials and experiments
1706.58,1708.56," and studies of a piece, so that you can experiment"
1708.56,1710.32," with different materials, different kinds of paint,"
1710.32,1713.98," different kinds of mediums, so that you can actually,"
1713.98,1715.66," for example, gain access to events"
1715.66,1717.22," where you can promote your own art,"
1717.22,1719.1, or so that you can have larger projects
1719.1,1722.3," that involve significant more amounts of money, like film."
1722.3,1725.3, We never need a scenario where art is actually expensive
1725.3,1727.0, if you want to produce it in the long run.
1727.0,1728.78, And if you're providing people with just the basic amount
1728.78,1730.42," of money they need to survive, the poor people"
1730.42,1732.58, on their side aren't producing that art either.
1732.58,1734.36," But most importantly, on our side of the rules,"
1734.36,1736.28," these people gain access to institutions,"
1736.28,1738.4," like galleries, like museums, but they can actually"
1738.4,1739.88, gain a career out of this because they're gaining
1739.88,1742.12," connections, because their work, now that it's actually"
1742.12,1744.68," properly produced, can be sold to someone"
1744.68,1745.0," who is a private collector,"
1745.0,1749.0," or can be shown at the local theatre, because they can pay to do so."
1749.0,1752.0," We believe art only fulfills its impact, which they agree, on our side of the house,"
1752.0,1757.0," when people are actually capable, in terms of finances, to produce that."
1757.0,1763.0," Now, in regards to minorities, they say that the richest and the most illegal are against them, because of their biases."
1763.0,1768.96," I already explained why the point on biases isn't true, but notice how minorities contribute uniquely to art"
1768.96,1772.16," through the different forms of culture and experiences that they can contribute,"
1772.16,1775.44," through the different kinds of expression that they can represent, especially in countries"
1775.44,1778.8, with lots of minorities like Brazil. I think indigenous art is going to receive a lot of
1778.8,1782.4, attention from the Brazilian government because the indigenous people and black people consist
1782.4,1788.5, of a relatively large portion of the population and they have interest in promoting this. So I don't think that minorities are significantly harmed.
1788.5,1792.0, But why do I believe art in their state is significantly less accessible?
1792.0,1798.5, Notice that income from art is already generally hard to get without any form of a program
1798.5,1802.0, because you still rely on large amounts of money and financial support to do so.
1802.0,1806.82," On our side of the loss, you're actually providing people with amount enough money so that they can quit their job,"
1806.82,1808.24," so that they can focus on making their art,"
1808.24,1810.62, and dedicate all of their resources to creating projects
1810.62,1812.96, that can provide them with a career in the long run.
1812.96,1814.68," On your side of the house, you're providing people"
1814.68,1816.26," with such minimal amounts of money,"
1816.26,1818.34, tell me how the poor artist who is struggling
1818.34,1820.28, to make a living is actually going to be able
1820.28,1823.16, to produce art that helps him join a career
1823.16,1825.0, in the industry in the first place.
1825.0,1833.0," Second of all, notice that their criteria are also inaccessible. They say that it's not about making full income and dependence on art."
1833.0,1837.0," But notice that in order to prove that you make some sort of money in art, it needs to be a substantial amount."
1837.0,1842.0," So if you're selling your art on the streets, it's significantly harder for you to prove that you're getting income from selling your art on the streets"
1842.0,1847.0, because those people from lower backgrounds don't have access to the institutions that can provide them with proof of their income.
1847.0,1849.0," Or for example, making art consistently."
1849.0,1854.0," I think people who have jobs and other concerns, like they say, work in two to three different professions,"
1854.0,1858.0," are not going to produce art consistently, and are therefore also not going to pass."
1858.0,1861.0, So we believe that the most vulnerable people don't exist on both sides of the house.
1861.0,1869.0," The important thing is that we're actually providing them with careers and the capacity to produce art that is not only reaching the public, but is actually viable for their careers."
1869.0,1879.0," Do you agree that a lot of people opt into art not because of financial gain, but rather because they love art or because they see it as a way to glorify smart people?"
1879.0,1887.56," I do agree that there are people who opt into art for things that are other than financial gain. But notice how that's better on our side of the house, because then they can actually"
1887.56,1890.84," be able to pursue that art in the long term. On their side of the house, they're gaining"
1890.84,1894.72," very little amounts of money that they can't actually produce anything worth. Now, this"
1894.72,1898.22, is our second construct of our careers. We believe that we can actually maintain people
1898.22,1902.48, who are low income and enter the art industry in that industry on our side of the house.
1902.72,1905.04," On their side of the house, they're going to be gaining minimum wage"
1905.04,1907.28, to make little to no money from their art
1907.28,1909.5," or little to no access to this institution from their art,"
1909.5,1911.76, and they're not going to be able to produce it properly.
1911.76,1912.78," On our side of the house,"
1912.78,1914.7," firstly, we have prestige and recognition"
1914.7,1916.34," from being able to pass this in the first place,"
1916.34,1917.44," after all, it's selected,"
1917.44,1918.94, and you're associated to institutions.
1918.94,1919.78," Second of all,"
1919.78,1921.72, you have connections from these institutions.
1921.72,1923.88," So for example, a gallery picks up my work,"
1923.88,1928.1, that gallery is necessarily more incentivized to keep buying my work or to keep selling my
1928.1,1932.16," work in the long term, which guarantees me an income. Thirdly, we believe that you're"
1932.16,1936.24," also generally going to receive more money overall to produce better arts, which allows"
1936.24,1940.24, you to have a career because now you can produce art that is of higher quality and therefore
1940.24,1946.72, get picked up even if you don't have all of those connections. Notice how this is significantly more important than what they bring me.
1946.72,1948.56," Because when you have that small amount of people,"
1948.56,1951.84," but they can actually pursue their passion and dedicate all of their time to it,"
1951.84,1955.6," to not only produce a social good that is for everyone who goes to the theatre,"
1955.6,1958.0," who goes to museums, who frequents galleries,"
1958.0,1960.56," but more importantly that these people are going to, in the long term,"
1960.56,1963.36," be able to continue pursuing what is so important to them, which is art,"
1963.36,1966.0, which the government doesn't have to only support them for the rest of their lives.
1966.0,1970.0," You support them for that one project, which propels them, and they can continue supporting"
1970.0,1971.0, more people.
1971.0,1974.0," On our side of the house, you get better art for more people on the long term."
1974.0,1977.0," On their side of the house, you're creating the false impression of accessibility."
1977.0,1979.0, I'm highly proud to oppose.
1980.0,1983.0, And there is one thing that the opposition does not do in this debate.
1983.0,1984.0, Wait.
1984.0,1987.62," They're playing this debate, because they is talking about the social utility in the social media chat,"
1987.68,1989.88," which is really, really, really uncertain."
1990.3,1994.38," If you want to think about it, no one knows if just one piece of art is actually going"
1994.38,1995.68, to gain traction in society.
1995.96,2001.2, No one knows if one piece of art is actually going to actually gain social utility in society.
2001.2,2005.98, What we do know is about our argument on minority discrimination on principle
2005.98,2008.48, and about how dispersing the money
2008.48,2011.1," is actually going to give money to the poorest people,"
2011.1,2012.9," which is why, on the day, our argument"
2012.9,2015.4, was significantly more important than today's debate.
2015.4,2017.28, I want to do a few things in clarification
2017.28,2019.18, before I move on to the questions in my speech.
2019.18,2021.32," Firstly, I want to deal with their second argument"
2021.32,2023.04, on careers for low-income people.
2023.04,2028.2, They give us wholesome analysis and wholesome benefits that you can have once you get elected and you
2028.2,2032.1, can get money from the organizations. They do not prove why you can actually get
2032.1,2037.02, these selection process and you can get into the very first place. Our argument that we give you from
2037.02,2041.72, Giroco explains why these individuals who oftentimes do not have connections to begin with
2041.72,2045.24, are incapable of actually selecting the selection process to begin with.
2045.24,2049.76," The reason being that in this art industry, there is a significant high competition in"
2049.76,2054.6," the status quo, which has meant that people who went to prestigious art schools are far"
2054.6,2058.88, far able to out-compete individuals from poor backgrounds.
2058.88,2063.8," It has meant that you can actually, people with higher capacity and money to be able"
2063.8,2065.3, to create artwork in the first place
2065.3,2068.9," has meant that you can out-compete others, and that a lot of the connections do matter"
2068.9,2072.2," in this debate, which has meant that they never proved the three requisites of this"
2072.2,2074.4, argument through first-leaf style to begin with.
2074.4,2076.3," But secondly, let's say they've got their best."
2076.3,2080.3," Let's say that you can actually get in, they never prove why you can continuously get in."
2080.3,2084.7," Because note, this is a highly competitive industry, which means other individuals can"
2084.7,2089.0," get in in the very next second, which means that yes, you can get money for this one project,"
2089.0,2093.0," it doesn't mean that you can get money for the next project, which is why they lose already."
2093.0,2094.5, I want to chat about two things.
2094.5,2099.0," First, on the material well-being of the core artists, and secondly, on my core needs."
2099.0,2101.0," Firstly, on the material well-being."
2101.0,2105.04," Our claim that we gave to the first was really simple, that if most"
2105.04,2110.96," artists are internally poor or are really struggling in the status quo, I think Seiji's POI"
2110.96,2114.88, proves this and they can see it when they say that most artists do become artists because they are
2114.88,2119.36," passionate about it, not because they want to actually make money. Which is why the substantial"
2119.36,2124.72," number of people, most artists and animators in Japan in the status quo, are heavily struggling"
2124.72,2126.0, to make ends meet.
2126.0,2132.0," Which is why I think their attempt to out frame argument and saying, oh poor artists do not exist is simply ungrounded in reality."
2132.0,2139.0, When in reality a lot of the individuals are in fact making art but are still struggling to make ends meet.
2139.0,2145.0," Given that, let's take their focus off this and eliminate all of this."
2145.76,2148.0, The first thing they say is that welfare still exists.
2148.0,2150.9," Notice here at all, the welfare exists in the status quo,"
2150.9,2153.2, and welfare does exist on both sides of the house.
2153.2,2154.62," But still, in the status quo,"
2154.62,2156.14, there are a substantial number of artists
2156.14,2157.78," that are moving paycheck to paycheck,"
2157.78,2160.02," which is why I think it would be better than life,"
2160.02,2161.76, but welfare is not enough.
2161.76,2163.46," But secondly, on our side of the house,"
2163.46,2165.26, we are able to actually give them money
2165.26,2168.6, that actually enables them to live a more sustainable life
2168.6,2171.68, that is above the working life in the status quo.
2171.68,2172.88," The second thing they see is that,"
2172.88,2173.96," ah, I like to debate,"
2173.96,2176.2, but that's not the reason why you want people.
2176.2,2178.96, But that is because there's a significantly smaller number
2178.96,2180.4," of people who are debaters,"
2180.4,2181.98, and most people who are debaters
2181.98,2183.88," don't sustain themselves with debating, right?"
2183.88,2185.6, Which is why this is simply not analogous.
2185.6,2190.6, There are in this tax bill 10 million artists and quite a lot of them are living under poverty line.
2190.6,2194.6," Which is why I think if there are analogous things, we are more than happy to do that."
2194.6,2201.6," But even if we don't take that just independently, we are capable of actually saving the individuals within the artist industry."
2201.6,2204.6, Which is why I think this is still our task to victory.
2204.6,2206.98, Why is giving money to these artists
2206.98,2208.6, actually important when in the round?
2208.6,2210.82, I have three important ways of looking at this.
2210.82,2213.46," One, money is oftentimes an objective benefit,"
2213.46,2215.38, and one objective benefit of this debate.
2215.38,2217.22, Oftentimes you don't have epistemic access
2217.22,2219.94," to what individual funds, but in capitalist society,"
2219.94,2222.12," you need money to do anything, to buy anything,"
2222.12,2224.12," for instance, which is why money is important."
2224.12,2227.6," But secondly, money is the prerequisite in capitalist society."
2227.6,2231.8," Anything requires you to have money to begin with, which is why money is important."
2231.8,2235.8," But third of all, even if you have some sort of money, which I think we're going to come up here and talk about,"
2235.8,2239.8," I think that does not mean that you have money, like enough money all the time."
2239.8,2243.8," No one knows when an economic shock will hit you, no one knows if you want to have children,"
2243.8,2247.0," or this might look like you're not being able to have a comfortable life, you're eating"
2247.0,2251.0," two meals instead of three meals for example, which is why having money is the biggest shield"
2251.0,2255.0," against the uncomfortable circumstances, which is why I think our claim in material well-being"
2255.0,2259.0, is significantly more important than any other claim put into the debate.
2259.0,2262.0," Before I move on to second class minorities, I'll take a few questions."
2262.0,2267.0, How do you think people who are actually struggling with poverty will be able to pass on your side in the first place?
2267.0,2273.0, So I think there is a reasonable standard of what the artist and its definition look like.
2273.0,2279.0, I think their strategy is to say poor individuals do not fit in the criteria of artists is inherently unimportant to begin with.
2279.0,2284.0," Let's say animators who is making anime in Japan are obviously artists, right?"
2284.0,2285.84, They are in the film industry
2285.84,2290.72, and they are in like film making making protests like it's unclear why they are saying that these
2290.72,2295.12, people are not artists on our side we at least give them the money which is why we significantly
2295.12,2300.48, help the most vulnerable secondly on minorities what we tell you from like um so what we tell you
2300.48,2307.1," from the local was extremely simple in the process of actually making decisions, I think there are internal biases, etc."
2307.1,2310.68," Their claim is that, oh, we should fund something that generates social impact."
2310.68,2316.4, But the premise of this is that the governments and organizations have the perfect capacity
2316.4,2321.76, to actually assess which part has more social utility and which part has less utility.
2321.76,2327.32," And our claim that we give you from P was indirectly, which was directly not responded to,"
2327.32,2330.28, was that the decision making calculus is fundamentally biased
2330.28,2334.0," to begin with, and their response implicitly from second"
2334.0,2336.68," was to say there are a lot of processes and criteria,"
2336.68,2339.2, and judges and NGOs are in fact involved
2339.2,2340.52, in the selection processes.
2340.52,2342.68, But I think this immediately falls under the bait
2342.68,2343.72, at a few key grounds.
2343.72,2348.2," First, I think people have incentive to actually do reasonable dealing with it, because I think this immediately falls under the bait of a few key grounds. First, I think people have incentive to actually do like, resident living in the Midwest, because"
2348.2,2352.0, I think unfortunately we do live in a society where residents don't like to cram pens.
2352.0,2356.0, It was simply an assertion for them to run away and say that there is no incentive for
2356.0,2358.0, this actually functioning in the Midwest.
2358.0,2360.0, I think there exists these kinds of incentives.
2360.0,2367.44," And what we, an important nuance here that Hiroko gives you was that insofar as there's no clear criteria"
2367.44,2369.4," of what is the best part and what is not,"
2369.4,2372.62," it's lacking objectivity, which allows those people"
2372.62,2374.56, who have the incentive to spread racism
2374.56,2375.9," to actually get away with it,"
2375.9,2378.5, which is an unresponsive characterization.
2378.5,2380.58, So just having 10 people instead of one
2380.58,2383.04," is not going to solve the structural problem of racism,"
2383.04,2384.94, which is why you don't let government
2384.94,2388.72," or any experts actually decide what is good for them, especially when we're"
2388.72,2389.94, using the taxpayers' money.
2390.18,2396.38," But second of all, even if racism explicitly does not exist, our claims that those things"
2396.38,2400.56," are implicitly ingrained in our mind and that people's decision-making capitalism, what"
2400.56,2406.46," is good power and what is not, is inherently flawed, which is why the art of things like gay men kissing"
2406.46,2408.4, is not going to be actually going to the public
2408.4,2411.12, in so far as people implicitly have their biases
2411.12,2411.96, with the gator.
2411.96,2413.86," But third of all, I think lack of objectivity"
2413.86,2415.4, inherently creates a problem.
2415.4,2417.14," Even if these are not explicit,"
2417.14,2420.0, I think our principle argument does stand within the debate.
2420.0,2422.92, So the implication here is that things like minority art
2422.92,2424.68, are not going to significantly decrease
2424.68,2426.18, on their side of the house.
2426.18,2429.04," Plus, I think one mechanism that Hiroko explains,"
2429.04,2431.38," which is directly not responded to,"
2431.38,2433.08, is that even if minority people
2433.08,2435.02," can get in the selection process,"
2435.02,2436.88, they are unable to make a minority art
2436.88,2438.96," insofar as they're getting funding from the government,"
2438.96,2440.24," and they need to please the government,"
2440.24,2441.68," or they need to please the majority,"
2441.68,2443.4, which means that they are going to create art
2443.4,2445.72," that is good for the majority, not for the minority."
2445.72,2447.3," So, two things then."
2447.3,2450.1," One, we win, because this is principally unjust."
2450.1,2453.66," It is principally wrong to simply only find white people,"
2453.66,2456.02," and not black people, in the process of,"
2456.02,2457.88," like, let's say, scholarship, right?"
2457.88,2459.64, We think this is principally illusory
2459.64,2460.68, for the government to do this.
2460.68,2463.44," But secondly, internally, we think when there's"
2463.44,2465.44," minority art, minority individuals"
2465.44,2470.96, can actually perceive and self-affirm that their art and their gender or their race is actually
2470.96,2475.04, good. This is incontingent of social change. We think having minority art is in and of itself a
2475.04,2479.52," good thing. For all those reasons, please, I can't take this debate. When you're there,"
2479.52,2483.12, controlling territory seems to be the next step. The first thing that they establish is the
2484.64,2488.0, model that says that people need to have some sort of income from art
2488.0,2490.0, to actually participate in that kind of job.
2490.0,2493.0, Why this is also a mid-tariff day or on case?
2493.0,2495.0, Because a lot of art doesn't profit with art.
2495.0,2499.0," We already explained how, firstly, art is extremely expensive."
2499.0,2504.0," A lot of people, even if they like art, they aren't going to sell things and actually receive money for that."
2504.0,2509.68," But mainly, why this is the most current in a contract or in their own case. Because what they say,"
2509.68,2514.48," a lot of people do this art not because they want to have income from that, not because they have"
2514.48,2518.56," financial prospects on that, but because they like art, because they are passionate about art."
2518.56,2522.4, So we think that the majority of the population that they are trying to affect actually does art
2522.4,2528.0, because they are passionate and don't sell this kind of art. So we don't believe that these kind of persons are having income with
2528.0,2532.0," art. So we believe that if there are multiple passes, these kind of people aren't actually"
2532.0,2535.0, participating in their own program that they tried to create in this debate. So we believe
2535.0,2538.0," that they are contributing to our system in the beginning. But second thing, they tried"
2538.0,2542.0," to paint in this debate that a lot of people, they are passionate about art, even if they"
2542.0,2552.5," have some kind of income, but we believe that this is true, but they have the burden to prove why, in this debate, governments should finance the passion of people."
2552.5,2569.76," We believe that a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck in a variety of different professions, and a lot of people have different professions that they love, that they are passionate about, and governments aren't giving more money to them to exercise this kind of profession."
2569.76,2574.0," We don't believe that just because someone is passionate about it, the government shouldn't say that."
2574.0,2580.24," But even if we believe that it was true, why this kind of programs that governments financially"
2580.24,2589.0, guard actually exist? Because it gives a social impact to the population. It's not in society that you are giving money to artists to produce their own creatures.
2589.0,2593.0," We are actually giving money to artists because they will actually give a return to society,"
2593.0,2597.0," and the money that these taxpayers give to the government to invest in this kind of problem,"
2597.0,2600.0, they are actually returning to them because we have a social impact on that.
2600.0,2610.0," So what they tried, they had to win this debate, is that the kind of practice that they had in their side of the house is actually giving more social impact to the population than what we have in our side of the house."
2610.0,2617.0," I'll engage with my second point in this debate about quality of art, how just we can have more social impact in our side of the house."
2617.0,2629.3," But now, the two main classes of this debate. First on minorities and second, on polygraphic art. First, on minorities. We believe that, and we try to paint firstly, that a lot of people that are in the minority,"
2629.3,2634.4, they won't have the capacity to produce art and create all the distribution with art in our self-domination.
2634.4,2641.3," Firstly, and to the selection process, we believe that first, art is not necessarily political."
2641.3,2644.8," So if I produce art, it's not because some government is like from right or left,"
2644.8,2649.52, he's not allowing my art to actually impact this government. We believe that the majority of art
2649.52,2654.0," actually isn't political. Second, we believe that the people that actually analyze this art"
2654.0,2658.88, is in fact the president of the country and actually one party of the country. We believe
2658.88,2662.48," that there are a composition of a lot of people that are not the right to do that. And third,"
2662.48,2665.0," because governments, they have checks and balances also."
2665.0,2668.0," We believe that the governments, they really do this kind of process."
2668.0,2671.0, They actually need the best outcomes from this process.
2671.0,2676.0," So, they are actually going to receive and to actually analyze the projects,"
2676.0,2678.0," that our generation's social roots and population,"
2678.0,2681.0," that our generation comes to the project that they are reading,"
2681.0,2683.0," and most of them, because if they select just bad things,"
2683.0,2687.0, we think that the part of the population that votes for them won't vote for them anymore.
2687.0,2691.0," We believe that this government, they don't have the interest to vote for the person who is at the top."
2691.0,2697.0," But more than that, why do we believe that even the minorities, even if they are from different groups,"
2697.0,2701.0, they still select the next top house? Because the process is not what we paint.
2701.0,2705.6, We believe that it's not like you send an ad project that is expensive
2705.6,2709.28, and the corporate likes it and they will sell it. We believe that's much more about the project.
2709.28,2712.4," That's what the infillality is about. So if you have a good project, for example,"
2712.4,2716.56," having a theater and producing a theater, explaining how it would impact the population"
2716.56,2720.56," and what kind of resources you need to do that theater, these kind of things are passing"
2720.56,2725.56," hours and hours. But when they start to close, what they actually need to do to prove they are an artist"
2725.56,2727.32, is sending artists to the block room.
2727.32,2729.52, So you believe that the only way that we can financially
2729.52,2731.76," minorities have good projects,"
2731.76,2735.2," do good projects, and actually improve their capacities in art,"
2735.2,2736.88," have the income to do good art,"
2736.88,2739.92," and actually produce something that has such impact on society,"
2739.92,2741.32," is only in our side of the house,"
2741.32,2744.12, when we actually give them this money to do this kind of things.
2744.12,2747.0," But more than that, they try to paint old, they suffered biases."
2747.0,2754.0," Actually, they have a big burden to provide for example, what they tried to paint, only for example white work is selected."
2754.0,2757.0, We don't believe that this is true and some reasons for that.
2757.0,2759.0," First of all, the composition of the government."
2759.0,2767.44," But second, we believe that art is one of the few sectors in the government that is much more progressive than other sectors in the government."
2767.44,2776.32," We believe that when we are talking about art, we are actually being more progressive to the nature of art that is actually transforming society and giving new perspectives to people."
2776.32,2783.28," So we believe that the people that are involved with art, even in the government or in the different organizations that are actually in our set of house, as the English language says,"
2783.28,2788.4," they are going to actually give an attitude to the people, not want to try to create their own"
2788.4,2790.4," southern house. Before I continue, go ahead."
2790.4,2794.8, Yeah. You tell us that it is our great to prove the uniqueness of art as being government
2794.8,2799.6, funding as a method of utility. Is it therefore not your great to prove by the method by which
2799.6,2803.6, you would like to create social utility has to be more than the integration of art? How do you
2803.6,2805.0, have a better quality of art in our central house?
2805.0,2810.0," First, we believe that the procession, the selection process is actually effective."
2810.0,2812.0," I already explained how we have a lot of methods to be sold,"
2812.0,2816.0," and how Corbett's have actual incentives to decide the better quality of projects,"
2816.0,2819.0," and how they work, and how this selection process actually is about."
2819.0,2821.0," But second, we believe that only in our central house,"
2821.0,2831.0," even if we have similar projects than quality in those central houses, the money to realize these kinds of good arts to give them to the population is much better than our central house,"
2831.0,2837.0," as we have fewer artists being selected. We give more money to them, the resources necessary to them to produce that art."
2837.0,2847.2," So we just believe that even if they have good artists, good selectors, we believe that they wouldn't have the money to actually produce the arts that is necessary to give the social impact. So we can only ask ourselves how we can guarantee that."
2847.2,2850.36," But how do you try to answer our principle that I talked about,"
2850.36,2853.04, how is not the data to govern the social issues?
2853.04,2854.44, They have two main answers.
2854.44,2858.72," Firstly, they say that art is much more comprehensive than any other sector in the society."
2858.72,2860.12, This is simply not true.
2860.12,2865.0," It's not to say that women artists are not equal to black people or other women in the financial sector. I just want to point out that we are not trying to say that women in art is not difficult to do, like most of the women in the financial sector."
2865.0,2868.0, I just think that you are wrong trying to engage with other women.
2868.0,2870.0," But second, in that art is actually accessible."
2870.0,2875.0," We are having a role where internet and AI say, I'm actually helping people to produce art."
2875.0,2878.0, We are in a role where people actually can really evaluate different types of art.
2878.0,2882.0," And we believe that in their scenario where people are actually passionate about art,"
2882.0,2886.0," even if they don't have a lot of money to be sold, they can actually produce art for themselves."
2886.0,2888.0, We don't believe that this is incestuous.
2888.0,2893.0," So we believe that art is expensive to produce very good things to help society,"
2893.0,2897.0, but it's not expensive to do normal things that we're passionate about.
2897.0,2901.0," But second, the way that we try to answer is that arts are also poor,"
2901.0,2904.0, and governments should help them as they do.
2904.0,2905.6, We do welfare policies.
2905.6,2910.4," First, we believe that no thesis is totally true if they are not the answer of the bill."
2910.4,2914.56," I stated that if they were poor, they are going to be helped by these welfare policies."
2914.56,2918.4," What you say is, oh, but they aren't that poor, they are actually having a good job"
2918.4,2920.4, and they do art that should complement them.
2920.4,2923.76," If they aren't that poor, I don't believe that governments should spend their money"
2923.76,2926.0, to make these people that are rejected rich and to receive more.
2926.0,2936.0," However, there are a lot of people that are actually struggling with poverty and hunger, and they don't receive this kind of money because government has a limited amount of resources."
2936.0,2949.28," So we don't believe that government should have the duty to just finish the passion of people that are just coming for the options. So you believe that the principle that happened in the Narcissus House, but it is not the duty of the government to have that in the Narcissus House,"
2949.28,2950.4, is to end the lithium-ion.
2950.4,2952.8," And you believe that there are continuing minorities,"
2952.8,2954.64," and actually, flip it to our Narcissus House,"
2954.64,2956.64," because just in our Narcissus House, these minorities,"
2956.64,2959.44, they actually have the capacity to produce a good high
2959.44,2961.2," if they are interested in the projects,"
2961.2,2963.84, because only Narcissus House has the resources to do so.
2963.84,2969.0," And secondly, about the quality of the price, believe that just as high quality of art in the US"
2969.0,2973.0, because of the selection process and because there are a lot of films that are used by artists
2973.0,2977.0," that produce that, and so we give much more social impact to the population that are actually"
2977.0,2980.0," the most important. So, we are proud to be here."
2980.0,2983.0," Adam, there is one very fundamental question in this debate."
2983.0,3009.88," Why does art matter? We think art matters for the individual because it brings in happiness, fulfillment, and expression. We believe we only actually have what art matters on our side of the house instead"
3009.88,3014.52, of giving a lot of people little amounts of money for their works to collect dust.
3014.52,3019.74," Three things I'm addressing. Firstly on artists, secondly on art, thirdly on minorities."
3019.74,3024.1, They say that we're supporting more people who wouldn't be able to pursue art as a
3024.1,3025.5, career otherwise because people do art as a career otherwise.
3025.5,3028.0," Because people do art for passion, not money."
3028.0,3033.0," That is intrinsically very contradictory, because if people pursue art for passion and not money,"
3033.0,3037.5, then having this financial incentive won't really change anything on either side of the house.
3037.5,3043.5," But more importantly, wealthy people will still be able to produce art on their side of the house."
3043.5,3047.44," The difference is, they will, potentially be getting money from the"
3047.44,3050.62," government from it, just as a poor person on their side of the house, who if we assume"
3050.62,3054.62," they get it, will be getting that same amount of money. The issue is we"
3054.62,3058.54, will not be able to provide the people who actually have different views or
3058.54,3062.34," potential for the minorities that they so address, the people of low income that they so"
3062.34,3067.38," address, with the platform and the capacity to produce and practice the art on their side of the house, because the amount"
3067.38,3068.68, of money is marginal.
3069.04,3071.96," If rich people are still producing art on their side of the house, people who are beautiful"
3071.96,3075.52," are rarely receiving any more resources, those people are still going to get more opportunities"
3075.52,3076.2, and more attention.
3076.46,3080.8," It is only on-site opposition that people, regardless of their background, regardless"
3080.8,3088.4," of their income, have the opportunity to be judged purely on the quality and the depth of their work. This means that we have people who have arts"
3088.4,3093.48, which is evaluated by a variety of experienced individuals and industries
3093.48,3098.9, and institutions for a variety of activities for a large group of people to then be not only
3098.9,3103.22," resources but also connections, but also prestige, but also attention. These"
3103.22,3105.22," opportunities, after receiving it once,"
3105.44,3110.72, can provide someone with a career for a lifetime. We would much rather have less people being
3110.72,3114.84," selected, but guaranteeing that those people who are being selected are capable of producing"
3114.84,3119.7, art that provokes an impact in people. What they say is that that art to have social utility
3119.7,3124.16, should not have bias in the selection process. But notice that having people that are rich
3124.16,3126.0, people and have its role of expressing
3126.0,3134.0," and developing emotion doesn't necessarily rely on the complex idea of social utility, but merely accessibility in regards to being in museums or theaters."
3134.0,3140.0, We believe that's only possible inside opposition when you provide people not only the resources but the connections and the opportunities
3140.0,3149.9," which are exclusive to the fact that you have less people receiving more resources. Now, they say that more art is better because art is about expression and it's completely"
3149.9,3154.3," subjective, but we explain to you that we have entire industries built on the study"
3154.3,3160.6," of complex art, and that art, even if more art is better, that more art is only better"
3160.6,3164.8, if it actually reaches people. Notice how on our side of the house we're actually having
3164.8,3166.0, more art reach people
3166.0,3167.88, when we're having programs where those artists
3167.88,3169.98, who wouldn't get the opportunity to otherwise
3169.98,3172.86, actually get to express and publish their art.
3172.86,3174.52, The delta on their side of the house
3174.52,3176.0, is that that art which is being produced
3176.0,3177.62," by low-income and minority people,"
3177.62,3180.1, if I buy all of their framing that there's bias
3180.1,3181.64," and prejudice on our side of the house,"
3181.64,3184.32, it's still not reaching anybody and fulfilling the impact.
3184.32,3187.94, It's still not actually providing people with a career so that they can give up on the true job they give.
3188.22,3192.22, But notice how I'm engaging with their best scenario where I buy their framing on how low-income people
3192.22,3194.46, and minorities are better accommodated on their side of the house.
3194.78,3198.3," Notice how they also didn't really manage to prove that, because their process in itself"
3198.3,3203.98," happens to be significantly more discriminatory than ours, because it is based on their capacity of income and consistency."
3204.32,3209.0, Both of those rely on street time and financial circumstances so that you can produce art
3209.0,3211.0, and prove that you make some kind of money from producing art.
3211.0,3216.0," On our side of the house, because you're judging based on portfolios, ideas, depth, propositions,"
3216.0,3219.0, none of that is necessarily contingent on your income.
3219.0,3223.0, We believe that art better fulfills its purpose outside opposition.
3223.0,3225.5, We believe we have better artists and more expression
3225.5,3227.24, on only our side of the house.
3227.24,3229.24, Incredibly proud to have loved this group.
3231.26,3234.28, Opposition asks why art matters.
3234.28,3237.78," But former Persian queen, why do people matter?"
3237.78,3241.12, Art is being used as a utility maximizing machine.
3241.12,3244.6, My speaker proves to you that art is just another profession
3244.6,3246.24, but one that is so intensely
3246.24,3249.82, competitive and impassable for the porter for the living selves that that is why you
3249.82,3251.82, must take the problem.
3251.82,3255.4," Firstly then, for the poor artists, I want to firstly answer the question, are artists"
3255.4,3256.4, poor on opposition?
3256.4,3261.5, The only reason you get for artists not being poor on opposition is their existing welfare
3261.5,3264.16, assistance which you get in POI.
3264.16,3269.0," This, from Natsuki's speech and an unresponded response we proved to you, is not enough."
3269.0,3274.0," The important nuance, therefore, of artists being poor in opposition is not just that they are poor,"
3274.0,3280.0," but that they are unable to do things like access alternative measures, which my first introduction mentions."
3280.0,3284.0," As DLO concedes to my POI, it is deceptively alluring."
3284.0,3287.0, People become incredibly passionate about art.
3287.0,3291.0," People develop things like sunk cost policies where they've invested too much,"
3291.0,3293.0, and art is an untransferable skill.
3293.0,3296.0," The implication then is that individuals are unable to opt out,"
3296.0,3302.0, or individuals are stuck in a lack of earning that exists in our opposition.
3302.0,3306.4," Comparatively then, are these artists better in our world?"
3306.4,3307.96," Opposition will have you believe,"
3307.96,3311.48, too many protested why artists are not better in our world.
3311.48,3313.52," Opposition, firstly, will have you believe"
3313.52,3316.48, that poor people are unable to pass in our world.
3316.48,3318.76," But Natsuki explains how many, for example,"
3318.76,3321.0, animators are under the line of poverty.
3321.0,3322.56," But it's not even just that, right?"
3322.56,3328.84, It's the artists on Etsy who can't sell more than one video. It's the teenage artists trying to sell street art. These people
3328.84,3333.18," are part of this motion. If your friend buys your art, you qualify for this money."
3333.76,3337.82, I also want to next deal with the opposition claim that if the majority of these artists
3337.82,3342.02," are so passionate about art, then it's probably fine that they're poor. But the issue lies"
3342.02,3345.34," outside of art, which I'm sure Natsuki's weighing mechanisms prove to you."
3345.34,3350.6," It's about whether you have food on the table, milk for your baby, a house for your family."
3350.6,3355.78," It's not just about whether you can have fun in art. Is this argument therefore, is this,"
3355.78,3361.36, is all of this important in this debate? We give you four reasons why this is massively important.
3361.36,3366.92," One, that money is the only objective metric by which we can have this debate."
3366.92,3369.16," Social utility is perceptive, subjective."
3369.16,3370.6, We don't know what people want
3370.6,3372.4, and everybody wants different things.
3372.4,3374.44, But money is something everybody wants.
3374.44,3376.24," Secondly, that money is a prerequisite"
3376.24,3377.96, to live in a capitalistic society
3377.96,3380.12, and anything you do requires money.
3380.12,3381.88," And thirdly, even if you have a lot of money,"
3381.88,3384.08, you have to do things like create safety nets
3384.08,3388.0," or you might want to have children in the future, therefore money is a great enabler."
3388.0,3392.0," Therefore, we think that money is the most maximally important thing in this debate,"
3392.0,3395.0," and for these impoverished individuals, it's the most important thing."
3395.0,3401.0," I want to finally, before talking about minorities, deal with the idea that taxpayers' money should go to social and youth health events."
3401.0,3405.0," One, this is again a premise that an opposition leader would prove impartiality, which they"
3405.0,3406.0, have never done in this debate.
3406.0,3409.0," And two, this is the most futile thing to do in this debate."
3409.0,3412.0, The impacts on opposition are incredibly fluffy.
3412.0,3416.0," Let's talk about minorities here, and every important response opposition gives."
3416.0,3420.0," Opposition wants you to believe a lot of things, like this insane idea that art isn't political,"
3420.0,3424.0, though an actual important responses you get from op are truthful.
3424.0,3427.68, They firstly have you believe that governments are diverse and have checks and balances
3427.68,3432.54," against minorities. Across the bench we tell you two things. One, not all countries have it."
3432.54,3435.42," They can't just debate in the most progressive democracies, they have to"
3435.42,3439.34, exist in the spectrum of the context. It is true that in many countries the top of the
3439.34,3443.16," ladder are individuals who are old, rich and white. It is true that in a lot of countries"
3443.16,3445.0," the top of the ladder are individuals who believe that women rich, and white. It is true that in a lot of countries, the top of the ladder are individuals who believe"
3445.0,3446.8, that women have no place in society.
3446.8,3449.2," But secondly, that there is implicit biases"
3449.2,3451.6," that cannot be tackled, even if the governmental system"
3451.6,3453.0, in and of itself is perfect.
3453.0,3455.6," Humans are nothing, no matter how many cumulative individuals"
3455.6,3459.2," you have, they still, for example, buy into the majority."
3459.2,3461.6, Opposition then has to believe that there's a lot of backlash
3461.6,3464.0," when minorities get in, but often it's more implicit"
3464.0,3466.36," than that, minorities having significantly smaller chances"
3466.36,3469.06," of getting in, it is incredibly hard to call out."
3469.06,3470.12," It is a matter of statistics,"
3470.12,3472.22, and a statistic that never gets published.
3472.22,3473.66, The implication of all of this is that
3473.66,3476.42, the argument of bias is that this is principally wrong
3476.42,3477.98," because it is arbitrary where you are,"
3477.98,3479.48, whether you are a minority or not.
3479.48,3481.84, This is analogously only funding white individuals
3481.84,3483.24, and disregarding black individuals.
3483.24,3485.34, I think that this argument is maximally important
3485.34,3487.42, and the principal metric we take this debate.
3487.42,3488.26, Thank you.
