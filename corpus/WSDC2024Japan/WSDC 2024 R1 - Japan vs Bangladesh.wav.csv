0.0,6.0, The status quo in Western liberal democracies is a world where religious minorities live in fear.
6.0,12.0, They live in fear of discrimination. They live in fear of majorities encroaching on their very own ideas.
12.0,17.0, Straight state secularism is the only way to solve this. We have two arguments to contend for here.
17.0,21.0," First, all of our intertwining of religion and politics is uniquely harmful."
21.0,29.12," Second, all of our minority religions are better off under straight state secularism. Before our meditation, three pieces of grant."
29.12,34.8," First, strict secularism looks like one where the state remains neutral and doesn't endorse"
34.8,38.64, or discriminate against any particular religion. This looks like three things.
38.64,42.72," One, the state cannot take a stance on a particular religion. There will not be a"
42.72,46.92, official state religion. The state will not provide funding to any religious schools or charities.
46.92,52.7, 2. Individuals are not allowed to do religious hypocrisy in public. You cannot hold posters
52.7,55.38, of religious symbols. You cannot call the site to release emblems.
55.38,60.4," 3. Individuals will be prohibited from reading any religious symbols. For instance, schools"
60.4,62.44, cannot display a cross inside a crosswalk.
62.44,65.0, 4. Individuals that do not appear to be full
65.0,70.0, face criminal punishment. This can range from fines to incarceration depending on the severity
70.0,72.0, of the violation of it.
72.0,76.0," Secondly, people can still practice religion in their private spaces on our side. For instance,"
76.0,80.0, they can still pray at their homes. The church and mosque that is in the existing status
80.0,84.0, quo will not be torn down to support the emotion of their mission. The implication of this
84.0,88.0, is that the benefits of religion in daily life still exist on our side.
88.0,95.0," Thirdly, what is the burden of opposition? The world opposition needs to defend is the status quo. They cannot support the prototype of the new world."
95.0,107.0," Moving on to the first part of my mention, as to why inter-trafficking to a religion of alt-ism is immediately harmful. The thesis of which we'll admit is that strength secularism is essential to ensure a biased political discourse and equal access to public services."
107.0,109.0, There are two layers to this argument.
109.0,113.0," First layer, then, is why strength secularism is necessary to eliminate the intertwining"
113.0,114.0, of original politics.
114.0,115.0, No major.
115.0,119.0, We think anything apart from it results in heavy intertwining of original politics.
119.0,121.0, This is due to three reasons.
121.0,125.24," One, politicians have massive political incentive to capture these votes."
125.24,127.32," And note here that not only open voters,"
127.32,128.78, religious supporters still identify with
128.78,130.5, politicians' support because they are
130.5,131.72, the most loyal voters.
131.72,134.52," For instance, today, about 25% of the US"
134.52,136.62," do identify themselves with evangelicals,"
136.62,139.44, and most of them back Donald Trump in the 2016 election
139.44,141.74, and took the scales in his favor.
141.74,144.12," Two, religious organizations have vote-based"
144.12,146.0," incentive to pass change-loving government. We want a first-ever policy, and both been extended with the capacity to lobby government."
146.0,149.0," We want a first-ever policy, and they also have lots of capital to lobby."
149.0,153.0," They acquire funding from foundations, from their followers, and use it to hire lobbyists"
153.0,154.0, to form broad-minded campaigns.
154.0,159.0," This looks like NNE, No Me Too, National Association of Evangelicals, Lobbying and Abortion, or"
159.0,163.0," the United States Congress of Catholic Bishops, lobbying in Indonesia."
163.0,164.0, 3.
164.0,168.0, The line as to what violence and separation of church and state is inherently unfair.
168.0,171.0," Just consider the U.S. president, placing an ad on the Bible during an inauguration."
171.0,174.0," Justice is endorsed Christianity, or is it a merit ceremonial?"
174.0,178.0, Or is it supposed to eat moral and liberal life that anger? Is it promoting Christianity?
178.0,182.0, The implication of this is that the blurred boundary between politics and religion makes
182.0,185.0, it extremely difficult for justice systems to step in.
185.0,191.0," For example, Japanese ministers were accused of holding ceremonies at religious tentacles, but courts have not fully guessed that."
191.0,200.0," Thus, what some think is deemed acceptable is sent to the president, and over time, slowly memorizes the more and more extreme forms of non-secularized political involvement."
200.0,205.2," Thus, strict secularism is necessary because it is only when you bend all forms of religious"
205.2,209.6," polling expression that parents lose the power to demand for vital citizens' schools, that"
209.6,212.8," religious groups are barred from lobbying, and that religion protests are met."
212.8,216.4," Over time, discourse around secularism will fade away on our side."
216.4,220.8," It will be normalized to not talk about religion and not bring up religion as a polling, which"
220.8,225.0, further encompasses the incentive of politicians to pass discriminatory religious policies.
225.0,229.0, On to the second link. What are the impacts of this dysfunctional secularism?
229.0,234.0," The impact of this is twofold. First, it restricts people's capacity to go to public space."
234.0,239.0," When religion and other faiths which is called sex for education get tangled up, it creates a enormous model."
239.0,242.0, This is because the state gives more political and financial support to these religions.
242.0,246.4, This looks like Christians lobbying for LGBTQ plus folks to be banned from school.
246.4,251.48, This looks like gay people being barred from accessing public services in LGBTQ plus regions
251.48,252.32, in Poland.
252.32,254.04, And this is harmful on two levels.
254.04,258.88," A, on a practical level, certain people are barred from the vital public services of just"
258.88,260.08, schools and hospitals.
260.08,263.52," Obviously, these are incredibly important people and you cannot live without them."
263.52,268.88," When they are not welcome in these places, they feel like their identity is not valued by the state on a daily basis."
268.88,274.08," On the principle, public spaces are funded by tax money, which is 100% given by all citizens."
274.08,278.64," Therefore, principally, everyone ought to have an equal right to use the benefit from these spaces."
278.64,283.52, I'm studying the impact of world politics. It's prompted two points.
283.52,289.0, entanglement between politics and religion erodes political discourse and compromise.
289.0,294.0," This is because when political parties are implied to register, it significantly surpasses"
294.0,298.0, and compromises the issues. This looks like Christians longing for no sex education at all
298.0,302.0, and being unwilling to accept atheist demands to reduce their restrictions.
302.0,308.96," B. Restrictions, related to the extremities, all being empowered by the office sector as well. This is because the title groups organizations"
308.96,313.44," that lobby for this are not moderately influenced people. For instance, the risk-holders, such as"
313.44,317.92," Christians, who wouldn't even go crazy to church on Sundays, wouldn't go out lobbying government."
317.92,322.0," However, hard-liners, which is even helpful, who tend to have an extreme view in the world,"
322.0,326.0," would go and push their policies, such edge, lifting restrictions on page speed, especially"
326.0,328.0, in the context of English speech.
328.0,330.0," All of this harms vulnerable people, especially"
330.0,332.0, those who find your name in the news.
332.0,334.0," These policies could pass the government, as these followers"
334.0,336.0," of the Bible, the Ephesians, and evangelicals"
336.0,338.0," perform significant and humiliating policies,"
338.0,340.0, strict step by step to prevent the more severe
340.0,342.0, forms of income. And before I move on to
342.0,344.0," a second argument, I'll leave it to you."
344.0,345.0," I think you were just expressing the right feeling about the census. Before I move on to the second argument, I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question."
345.0,347.0, I want to ask you a question.
347.0,354.0, Would you also ban LGBTQ individuals from expressing their pride and value in public spaces?
354.0,359.0," No. We are talking about the British, the Baptists, the Democrats and all the other people."
359.0,363.0," Moving on to the second argument, as to why the minority communities are better off on our side."
363.0,367.68, The thesis of this argument is that I reduce tensions which harm minority religions by
367.68,372.16, reducing quality of existence bills. I'll do the first one. As to why a better absence
372.16,376.72, of public space necessarily creates a piece of tight contention between religions.
376.72,380.8," First of all, it's important to note the context of this debate. As I pointed out from my intro,"
380.8,384.72," the status quo of the world is my own truth, my own view, and my fear. This shows that"
384.72,386.0," religions have a hard time focusing at all the times when quo of the world, my own recent writing, is in a theater. This shows that religions have a hard time"
386.0,388.0, focusing at all the times the minority
388.0,390.0, which is feel-pushed aside by the majority
390.0,392.0," in society. In this debate,"
392.0,394.0, opposition will lie to you that religion
394.0,396.0, in the current world can coexist from
396.0,398.0, a reason. We tell you that as and always
398.0,400.0, will not work. Coursework for reasons.
400.0,402.0," One, exposure to different"
402.0,404.0, visions of the public fuels people's
404.0,405.0, antagonism against minority
405.0,406.0, religions.
406.0,409.0, Religions often have a contrarian view of their ideas and put those in the question
409.0,410.0, of pain.
410.0,415.0, Seeing public Muslim festivals celebrate a new public is a constant reminder of how
415.0,418.0, much the opponents disagree with their religion.
418.0,421.0," Every time you see them, you feel like you are being invaded by these new religions."
421.0,423.0, All you can see is that there is a limit.
423.0,425.2, This won't happen because you will see an event
425.2,426.32, that will call that here to come.
426.32,430.72, 2. The concept of religious freedom in public allows people to attack other religions.
430.72,434.56, The line between faiths which are confined to religious discretion is extremely blurry
434.56,437.28, and individuals have been splintered against other religions.
437.28,441.28," Women who mislook like Christians, going around to the cross-country saying that our country"
441.28,444.72," is a Christian country, you can fist at anyone, so you can block their line of rights."
444.72,447.92," Comparatively, people cannot weaponize religion and politics."
447.92,451.76," Three, politicians with a massive incentive to weaponize a negative sentiment against"
451.76,455.12," minority religion, whether in all favor, as that often turns different books."
455.12,459.2, It's the same politician calling all Muslims quote-unquote Islamic radicals to instigate
459.2,463.4," fear, or in the worst case, to incentivize the destruction of the Reds, a similar"
463.4,464.64, example from Mao.
464.64,468.0," Comparatively, politicians cannot talk about are weaponized religion."
468.0,474.24," Fourth and lastly, minorities feel neglected as society disproportionately favors men-contrary religion."
474.24,477.24," This is because everywhere you go, you see Christian symbols."
477.24,480.68," From the lens of the Muslim, you feel your belief is not represented enough."
480.68,485.0," Consequently, minorities are not shown in the face with the majority and the dissimilar."
485.0,487.0, Our impact of this is very simple.
487.0,492.0," Minorities, the minxies, are able to walk down the street every day like any normal person."
492.0,494.0," For all these reasons, we are very proud of the police."
494.0,498.0," A world where your faith is reduced to a dirty secret,"
498.0,501.0," allowed only within the public signs of four walls,"
501.0,505.0," where you are villainized, persecuted, and deemed unfit because of their fame, is"
505.0,507.0, a morally different government world.
507.0,511.0," So our opposition will never support such a world, and we're so proud to oppose."
511.0,514.0," We're trying to go to constructives, up your responsibility to their base, and allow them"
514.0,517.0," to follow if you want some setup, and lastly, our constructive department."
517.0,519.0," With that being said, what do we get from here?"
519.0,520.0, There's two main points.
520.0,523.0," First, we understand how they don't want politics and those who believe in it to be"
523.0,530.0," intertwined, and how that leads to pushing for more extremist ideas because these people want to rally these extremist policies and how they're at it."
530.0,547.0," Okay, why is this untrue? Firstly, we think just because you ban the popular religious expression does not mean that these incentives these people have, that the fact that these people want these policies to want to have the change-based policies in place"
547.0,550.0," will still want that, but now they're not able to publicly express this."
550.0,553.0, What does that mean? Now they feel actively threatened.
553.0,557.0, They feel like big ads also tell us that they're going to be the most radical group of people.
557.0,561.0," But this means that now they feel they're being suppressed by the majority,"
561.0,567.92," they're being suffered by the state, which means they're likely to be even more anti-independent. What this means is now they're not going to be able to publicly rally, so they're probably"
567.92,572.48," going to do these things in hidden places or under the, without the state's control"
572.48,576.4, because now the state has no ability to monitor them because it's not being done professionally.
576.4,580.64, What this also means is if these people want these narratives to be in place in the first
580.64,583.84," place, they can still rally for these things under other terms."
583.84,588.08," Like if you want abortion to be banned because of religious reasons, you can still push back"
588.08,592.0, on the narratives of the whole life instead of just not saying because of religion.
592.0,593.44, So these narratives can still exist.
593.44,597.6, But then they come up with how religious minorities will feel bad because it all is shut down
597.6,599.52," by the majority and whatnot, right?"
599.52,604.24," Firstly, the reason why this is actually exist is because the majority has always underlined"
604.24,606.0, these religious minorities in the first phase.
606.0,611.0," Because A, they don't understand what their practices are, and B, because of just how majority and vast things is."
611.0,617.0," Well, this means that these minorities will still know that the majority thinks they're not of the same pedestal,"
617.0,622.0, and they'll still feel under 90 even if they're not being shot down on the face by this majority of the things.
622.0,626.3," We'll tell you in our case, why majority of the faces like me, and we still become a part of culture,"
626.3,627.8," and remain their separate,"
627.8,629.7," and secondarily, why these minor faces"
629.7,631.5," who have their only act of self-defense,"
631.5,633.3, by being able to guarantee their fair view
633.3,634.1," across the world,"
634.1,635.9," and they'll get through these harsh times,"
635.9,637.0," now do not get that,"
637.0,639.3, because the act of you take away that's our own self-defense.
639.3,640.2," With that being said,"
640.2,642.0," onto our first conversation,"
642.0,643.4, what this probably shouldn't happen
643.4,644.9, if another street face comes by itself.
644.9,646.24," They are a beautiful step give you most of it,"
646.24,648.42, and I think most of it is probably look like a ban
648.42,649.64," on wearing hijab or a blue cap,"
649.64,651.86," but like, we take one from wearing a cloth"
651.86,653.98, or not having a statewide religious culture
653.98,655.6," and generally we can maintain a culture,"
655.6,656.78," religion, and a public sphere."
656.78,657.94," In most of the cases,"
657.94,660.94," like, a public is a Jewish minority."
663.22,665.0," And you start with, how many is toddler? I think it's like four or six. Four to six. ."
665.0,668.0, .
668.0,671.0, .
671.0,674.0, .
674.0,677.0, .
677.0,682.0, .
682.0,686.0," . Okay, are we ready? Okay, starting in 3, 2, and 1."
686.0,691.0," It most likely looks like more extreme forms of practices that some European countries like France are already doing, right?"
691.0,693.0, But that is not their second point of setup.
693.0,696.0, How is the imposition of strict states and norms and rules to be done in the first place?
696.0,702.0," In a biased manner, majority of these Western liberal democracies have a long-standing Christian heritage,"
702.0,704.0, which is largely seen as their culture back home.
704.0,706.8, These structures will continue to cherish this heritage and its symbols.
706.8,710.4, They are so integrated into the daily lives of these people that these countries would
710.4,715.2, recognize them as merely religious symbols but also as a cultural symbol as they do even
715.2,716.0, in the Christmas.
716.0,719.6, So what will happen is that the balance will be in position because your shanty will be
719.6,723.6, expressed all the time in the veil of culture while other religious expressions will fall
723.6,728.0," under the gluten and gain smash. For example, Christmas is a large part of the cultures of these nations"
728.0,732.0," and while most likely continue to be celebrated grandly in public spheres, hence these symbols"
732.0,736.0, will most likely still be displayed in public. It is only religious minorities whose ability
736.0,741.0," to express their religion will need to be sacrificed. But secondarily, public servants"
741.0,747.0," like teachers, government officials, etc. will enforce these policies and their subjective discretion policies."
747.0,752.0," This is like a French teacher, Jacksonizing a girl because her story goes too long and similar to a book club."
752.0,757.0, This means there is no uniform application of this policy due to the very little permission of these policy-based people
757.0,761.0, because they are so unfamiliar and the lack of exposure to these practices in the first place.
761.0,768.0," See even normal things often appear as unlawful because they just don't know enough about it. But see, the punishment of a violation for this policy can exist"
768.0,772.0," on a wide spectrum, including the imposition of bad device. In prison and at times, it"
772.0,776.0," may be even beating up innocent individuals. Probably, it has to prove why even risking"
776.0,780.0, confrontation and injuring people to defend this policy of theirs is more than legitimate
780.0,784.0," on their side. I'll leave it there. But what is our stance, I hope? A. Broadly, we support"
784.0,785.0, minimal intervention in religions.
785.0,788.0," People can choose what religion is hardest to wear, their own religious affiliation,"
788.0,793.0, and include doctors who are practicing religion not only in close confining but also in public spaces.
793.0,798.0, B. We support offering subsidies to religious as a way of moderating them and controlling them via funding.
798.0,803.0," C. We will still have hate speech, love and grace, so religious messaging that actively"
803.0,807.0, demeans other religions or have hard-biting harms will still be restricted regardless.
807.0,813.0," In that being said, on to our first contract with our country, on the lives of our leading leaders, to dictate and myself to evaluate the freedom of religious integration."
813.0,820.0," This argument doesn't seem the best case of proposition because even if we think and actually enforce that policy uniformly for all religions,"
820.0,824.0, it all comes to be done if we can prove it as a direct violation of people's freedom of expression.
824.0,827.76," This religion, which is crucially tied tied to their identity is being attacked."
827.76,830.8, The minister is going as a part of the sum of identity now.
830.8,836.92, It can be temporarily given up because the same way you cannot fundamentally ask a trans person
836.92,839.6," to have to temporarily identify with their birth gender,"
839.6,842.92," really because others are offended by or disagree with their identity, right?"
842.92,846.0, Why is the assertion of position in the public sphere a critical part of their identity?
846.0,851.0, It inhibits their moral beliefs. It influences their actions in both public and private spheres.
851.0,854.0, It really is a crucial way to access peace and solace for these people.
854.0,859.0, People's religion is an act of selfishness and the act of sort of going to hell for those who really need it.
859.0,863.0, People fulfill their religious duty by being able to express it in the public in their first place.
863.0,865.84, How does straight-state terrorism then violate religious identity?
865.84,869.92," Because firstly, many of the industries that are able to express religion in belief that"
869.92,873.36," a way is meaningful to you, they will mostly look at things as an imperative for a firm"
873.36,877.28, to be able to work out any type of rejection of that freedom or denial of that ability
877.28,878.32, to practice their religion.
878.32,882.32," But when you can practice your faith in a way that is deemed right by people, you feel"
882.32,883.04, like a sinner.
883.04,885.0, These practices are able to...
885.0,886.0, These practices are being...
886.0,890.0," Key math is provided by religion, and we think it's essential to follow this."
890.0,893.0," But additionally, also he's told that hypocrisy of Western liberal democracy is a matter"
893.0,896.0, which prides itself on the so-called bastions of freedom and choice.
896.0,901.0, The conclusion of this argument then is one's religious identity cannot just be separated
901.0,902.0, into private and public life.
902.0,905.32, Proposition is committing an egregious moral violation.
905.32,907.64, You cannot be a bystander in a judicial school assault.
907.64,909.6, But we've had a lot of my second arm in a few months.
909.6,912.0, Even if incentive to wish for religion and bystander
912.0,914.64," is a cementary, government funding public schools"
914.64,916.88, or religious schools for using religious freedom
916.88,918.88, or proselytization has been an excuse to laugh
918.88,921.64, at the religions and exquisite forms of discrimination
921.64,923.92, on religious people who have been able to produce
923.92,925.6," unbarcended victims. So we feel that we are not able to guarantee exquisite forms of discrimination on the digital, retail, and the use of our same things."
925.6,930.6," So, we feel like we are not able to guarantee that this is not going to happen."
930.6,935.1," So it's as though you can have France just ban the hijab for no sense,"
935.1,937.8," under the name of saying to ourselves, well, not doing so with other people,"
937.8,941.4, but not sure how they're able to ensure these major devices will not see D2
941.4,944.0," because they don't have other from the police, governments, and hospital."
944.0,944.9, I think that answers it.
944.9,945.0, Authors that can talk about street-state socialism and biases will not see into because they don't have other problems holding these governments in control. I think that answers it.
945.0,950.0, Authors that can talk about street racism and how these two are polarizing and radicalizing beyond the barest countries.
950.0,954.0, How these problems should create alienation of religion from religious people from the state matter.
954.0,958.0, This encourages the inclusion between different religious communities and why is that so?
958.0,965.24," Introducing the religious minorities to interact with the majority, the expression of religion becomes much easier with the ending endings of people,"
965.24,970.16, though similar religious and beliefs. There are more thoughts developed in these areas from both the minorities and thus they can
970.16,974.8," pray or abide their religious mandates by staying within that area, so it furthers a different sum of communities."
974.8,979.2," Secondly, when minorities interact with the majority groups, they often play a student, their religion has not been"
979.2,984.16," has not been brought into the public sphere, right? Even in this interaction, you will often be negative with your side because"
984.16,989.0, people from different communities do not properly interact with people from other communities until they are teenagers.
989.0,993.0," And by acting this way, to build a solidified student that already exists, right,"
993.0,1001.0, this inclusion is likely to lead to extreme polarization in their sight of the world because you want to interact with people who share your beliefs and you only care for your own community.
1001.0,1005.0," For all these reasons, for the principle of hand-in-cloak to these people, we're so proud of you two"
1005.0,1006.0, of us.
1006.0,1014.0," In this dangerous world, Western liberal democracy is one full of faces where Christian majoritarianism"
1014.0,1018.0, hide under the veil of moderate secularism.
1018.0,1023.0," One where education that is supposed to be for everyone is stained by biblical rhetoric,"
1023.0,1026.34, where minorities fear crossing the street
1026.34,1029.1, because they will be called a terrorist.
1029.1,1032.8," We are not saying that religion in and of itself is bad,"
1032.8,1035.34, but we think that the restriction on public faith
1035.34,1039.84, is necessary to negate the very negative impacts of religion.
1039.84,1043.14, So proud to propose.
1043.14,1044.68, I would like to be doing a couple of things
1044.68,1046.0, in my discussion today.
1046.0,1052.0," Firstly, talking about what AALA looks like and the implementation of strict state secularism."
1052.0,1054.0," Secondly, on religious freedom."
1054.0,1060.0," Thirdly, on the entitlement of religion and politics."
1060.0,1062.0," And lastly, on minority."
1062.0,1067.0," Firstly, what does the implementation of strict state secularism look like? Opposition"
1067.0,1074.0, tries to come up here and say that strict state secularism will only be applied to minorities.
1074.0,1080.0," Well, we say that this is simply not true for a couple of reasons. Firstly, please read"
1080.0,1086.24," the motion and the motion's application. We are basically supporting very strict state psychosocial,"
1086.24,1089.08," something that applies to all people living in the state,"
1089.08,1091.6," which includes vans for all religious symbols,"
1091.6,1095.24, including both Christian cross and Muslim head scarves.
1095.24,1097.52, So the opposition cannot just come up here and say
1097.52,1100.64, that this will only be applied to workers and jobs.
1100.64,1107.0," If a Christian cross is used as a religious advocacy, we will obviously still ban it."
1107.0,1113.0," If parents come to the school board trying to get Christian beliefs into the public curriculum, we will still ban it."
1113.0,1117.0," And most importantly, if there is lobbying, obviously we will ban it."
1117.0,1131.0," But secondly, we think that the premise of that entire argument is wrong. They try to say that people just don't have enough knowledge about religions and religious faiths and religious public displays"
1131.0,1136.0, in order to be able to restrict these Muslims from holding these Christians equally in the class space.
1136.0,1138.0, But I think this is simply not true.
1138.0,1144.0," The fundamental tenets of religion, the clothing, the accessories, the practices, are largely known by everyone."
1144.0,1151.0, Everyone knows that the Christian cross is a symbol of Christianity in the same way that everyone knows that hijabs are part of Muslim faith.
1151.0,1156.0, We don't think that anything stupid like black fanny boots and bells and long dresses will happen.
1156.0,1169.0," But if that is an expression of religion, we think that yes, we do have a justification to ban it. But lastly, we say, so what? Even if the lines are blurry, we think that we are at least able to apply this policy"
1169.0,1173.0, to the vast majority of things that are generally viewed upon as religious.
1173.0,1177.0, We are still able to ban the most obvious forms of religious and cultist ways.
1177.0,1183.0," Sure, Christmas might not be banned, but at least on our side, we can prevent people from"
1183.0,1188.0," using religious classes to get across very, very anti-Muslim rhetoric."
1188.0,1194.0, We think that the most extreme forms of extremist violence will still be prohibited on our side if those reforms are clear.
1194.0,1196.0, No thank you.
1196.0,1201.0," So they can't just point at helping in cross-stabbing us as a whole, they won't."
1201.0,1203.0, But that doesn't engage with the class of our argument.
1203.0,1207.24," With that, the implication of all of this is that strict secularism will be applied"
1207.24,1212.48," to an equal extent. But secondly, on religious freedom, no one can guarantee it like us."
1212.48,1216.72, The opposition tries to come up here and say that public faith and public display of your
1216.72,1222.24, faith are very important to your expression of religion. We think that this is untrue
1222.24,1229.0," for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we think that the people's conception, or religious people's conception of normalcy"
1229.0,1234.0," can change over time, because once this policy is enacted, once strength in secularism is"
1234.0,1237.0," enacted, every single micro aspect of your life changes."
1237.0,1241.0," There are no more theology courses in college, no more religious protests, and leave around"
1241.0,1243.0, you cannot state your faith openly.
1243.0,1248.4," So once you continue this for a couple of years, you get used to this life, simply because society as a whole does not"
1248.4,1258.08," assign religion in public any collective significance. We think that this looks like, for example, after the genocide that happened in Rwanda, the present"
1258.08,1268.0," mass citizens are expressing their ethnicity publicly, and now people are just confined with that, they are willingly expressing their religious freedom under the veil of their private faith."
1268.0,1275.0," So the implication of this is that when states implement strict state secularism, this is not compassionate because people will adapt"
1275.0,1288.88," willingly to this religion. So it is not a compression of religious freedom if people are going to adapt and express their religious freedom willingly. But secondly, we say that the degree to which public display of faith matters is incredibly limited."
1288.88,1294.8," For most people who practice religion, the ultimate goal of practicing faith is forming a personal connection with God."
1294.8,1301.52," The humongous moments of elevation and emotional salvation for religious people come from praying to God and getting salvation from God,"
1301.52,1303.2," which happens through prayer, right?"
1303.2,1309.54," So although we do see that public displays of faith and proselytization may hold some meaning,"
1309.78,1314.04, we do not think that this is the most important consideration for these religions.
1314.64,1317.78," On the other hand, you can still do a majority of meaningful private things."
1317.78,1322.12," For example, you can still pray by Thursday and enjoy your communication with God."
1322.36,1326.0, The implication of this is that you do not feel like you are being betrayed by the state
1326.0,1331.0, because you will adapt to it and it's not an important freedom that you're giving up.
1331.0,1336.0," But lastly, we think that the choice to exercise religion in the public is less important"
1336.0,1339.0, when compared to the choice to exercise other things.
1339.0,1343.0, So this choice of freedom and religious freedom is not absolute.
1343.0,1351.0," Because religions are contradictory in nature, your right to form religion in public greatly offends and harms the other religions."
1351.0,1358.0, We think that the state is justifying to limit certain rights of expression when there is a bad party calm.
1358.0,1362.0, We see this in masks of hate speech. We see this in brands of graffiti.
1362.0,1368.0," Because although you are expressing yourself, you are telling others that that is not just."
1368.0,1373.0, At the point of which we proved the economy of Mexico by our explicit back-plotting bombs.
1373.0,1376.0," Thirdly, all the intertwining between religion and politics."
1376.0,1380.0, We think they told us the opposition should try to come out here and say to all of this.
1380.0,1386.68," Firstly, they said that even if there is separation, people still practice that we're in hidden places."
1386.68,1389.88," What we think is that that's exactly why we want to take this motion, right?"
1389.88,1396.2, We don't want Christians to come out of their community and post their religious bands on LGBTQ plus people.
1396.2,1397.44, We think that that is a good.
1397.44,1401.6," But secondly, we try to tell us that Christian people can still vote through other means,"
1401.6,1405.0, and through passing off abortion as proclive.
1405.0,1414.0," But we think that even if we can't conceive that we cannot change abortion, we can still change a multitude of things on our side."
1414.0,1418.0," So I told you from our last speaker that maybe these policies become less absolutist,"
1418.0,1423.0," because at the point of which you're not assigning your political views with your religion,"
1423.0,1425.0, there's more space for compromise because
1425.0,1427.0, it's not a clash of identity.
1427.0,1434.0," Secondly, even if you can still vote for abortion policies through other means, we think that"
1434.0,1440.0," there's still many other huge benefits, such as being able to ban lobbying, such as being"
1440.0,1447.0, able to ban people from getting out of that cross and protesting outside Muslim mosques and making people feel very uncomfortable.
1447.0,1451.0, We think that this is a benefit that does not exist on their side.
1451.0,1462.0," Finally, on minorities. They told us that the discrimination towards minorities will get worse on our side because there will be seclusion."
1462.0,1466.0, But we think that we can flip this argument and say seclusion happens more on that side.
1466.0,1470.0," At the point at which, like we told you from our past speaker, that the reason why Christian people"
1470.0,1474.0, don't want to interact with Muslim people is because they look at Muslim people and see that
1474.0,1482.0," and feel very threatened that their country is being, like, you know, like, indoctrinated by Muslim beliefs."
1482.0,1487.0, We think that he likes people on that side who want to even interact with Muslim people in the black space.
1487.0,1494.0, We need to get rid of these public displays of expression. We think that people can get together and expose them and get together as human beings
1494.0,1507.0," not because and not judging each other by their religious faith. For all these reasons, we think that we are good for the majority minority of religions to account for the same. Three pieces of verification that I've talked about in my speech."
1507.0,1511.7," One, note, most religions within communities have existed for centuries and centuries,"
1511.7,1515.5," decades and decades, which means majority of religions within these countries are likely"
1515.5,1518.5, to continue to have significant levels of influence within it.
1518.5,1522.5," Churches don't just magically disappear, religious symbols continue to exist within people."
1522.5,1528.0," Within Italy, the church as symbol of the cross is seen as a cultural icon instead of religion in and of itself."
1528.0,1533.0, These are things which continue to exist under their civil code because governments have every incentive to keep them there.
1533.0,1537.0," Because according to their own narratives, people care about religion, which means governments don't want to keep this."
1537.0,1542.0, They do not have the fear to somehow presume that every single thing that is cultured automatically disappears.
1542.0,1547.0," Which means majorities continue to perpetuate their cycles, but, and this is the most important"
1547.0,1550.0," point in clarification, we tell them that minorities are the ones that are oppressed"
1550.0,1554.0, because now these are the individuals who automatically cannot express themselves because
1554.0,1556.0, they were never a part of culture to begin with.
1556.0,1561.0," Second, for most Muslims, the only way you can express yourself is opting to public places."
1561.0,1565.0," If I was a woman with Islam, do not wear I would hide, I would always feel like I'm"
1565.0,1567.0, sitting every time I decide to go out within society.
1567.0,1570.0, They can't simply tell me that this was their genuine suggestion.
1570.0,1572.0," If you're a religious minority, then just move on."
1572.0,1576.0, Accept that the diet that you're paid can't be practiced because this weird government
1576.0,1578.0, wants to make sure you can't practice your faith.
1578.0,1581.0," If that is the reality they're trying to defend, who tells you that it's morally illegal"
1581.0,1582.0, in general effort than perusal?
1582.0,1587.0, Individuals and governments have no right to express what form of religions should ever take part in.
1587.0,1594.0," Do you believe that the only time when you oppress these individuals, you automatically de-jurisize them and reduce their ability to practice who they really are?"
1594.0,1596.0," Finally, this is the voice of the global democracy channel."
1596.0,1599.0, Do not let them throw you into ideas of populist politics.
1599.0,1601.0, Because the personal thing they've talked about is about populism.
1601.0,1604.0," It exists on every single layer, not just religion."
1604.0,1605.0, Conservatism continues to make students populist even every single layer and not just religion. Conservatism
1605.0,1609.0, continues to make students populist even if it is indirectly tied to religion. Politicians
1609.0,1613.0," are unlikely to change on both sides of the wall. At the end of the day, religion isn't"
1613.0,1616.0," the reason for why these are happening. Therefore, there is no reason to ban it. It's because"
1616.0,1620.0," of populist politics. Unless they can somehow prove that populist politics disappears, we"
1620.0,1625.0, will give null fair claims about religious lobbying exists in any sacred school whatsoever.
1625.0,1627.0, What will that be doing at the end?
1627.0,1629.0," First, a few years of important responses within two days."
1629.0,1632.0," One, on the principle which Syriac Day has yet to be responded to."
1632.0,1637.0," And second, on how secularism increases the evolution between deaf and religious groups"
1637.0,1639.0, and it's exceptionally hard for them to get along.
1639.0,1641.0," First then, a few years of responses."
1641.0,1645.44, The first thing that it does is that it normalises religion because it becomes extremist in nature.
1645.44,1650.32, This is quicker because there are extreme existing checks and balances within systems.
1650.32,1653.76," When you go out and explicitly talk about hate speech, you'll always have opposition"
1653.76,1657.6, parties and opposition leaders who will likely follow you up and drive you from doing so.
1657.6,1660.96," We believe this exists because of how Western human democracy is functioned, where freedom"
1660.96,1664.48, of speech allows between problems of groups to come up and vote politicians into direct
1664.48,1665.0, problems of the ground. But even vote politicians into direct forms of gun.
1665.0,1670.0," But even if you don't believe that, we tell you that religion in and of itself deserves to have a view regardless."
1670.0,1677.0," We are unlikely to believe why it is unfair for a US religious person to hope that your mosques and churches can be prettier and better,"
1677.0,1681.0," to hope that your fundings can automatically be agreed at, and finally, a third layer, about hate speech."
1681.0,1685.0, There are existing laws that are already in place with investment in world democracies
1685.0,1688.0, which reduce your ability to commit hate crimes or go for hate speech.
1688.0,1693.0, Which means that automatic algorithm already flashed out in their diet for this debate.
1693.0,1696.0," Unless they can prove that for some reason it is exclusive for religions to be banned,"
1696.0,1699.0, it still continues to be morally indigital.
1699.0,1703.0, The next thing that I do for us is that for some reason religions who are contradicting ideas
1703.0,1707.0," and the supreme contradictability, we have yet to understand what the deeper layers of the dancehows under this is."
1707.0,1713.0," When I choose to go out and wear a book in public, there is no reason for me to be shocked and directly called out in any sense of this scenario."
1713.0,1717.0," Most people move on with their lives, we believe it is unlikely to be as extreme as they tell it to be."
1717.0,1720.0," But even if we tell them, they will flip it."
1720.0,1724.0," When you don't have the levels of expression, that is the moment in time you don't understand these people anymore."
1724.0,1730.0, That is when the very popular psychological data on talk about can dehumanize you because you automatically do not know what Muslims look like
1730.0,1732.0, and they can feed you narratives of extremism.
1732.0,1738.0," When you allow different forms of voices to come in, you allow checks and balances to be announced to make sure religious individuals aren't dehumanized"
1738.0,1741.0, and demonized by politicians who have every incentive to do so.
1741.0,1746.0, This form of check and balances makes sure these individuals can continue to have a magnified life.
1746.0,1749.2," First then, on the principle. We've given you every single layer of analysis."
1749.2,1752.4, So why is it morally legitimate? We've given you layers of P.O.I.s.
1752.4,1757.4, Why? And you ask me this. Would you allow a gay individual to not stay still in their private life
1757.4,1761.6," involving in the yet-weirder response? No, pardon. This is an extremely semantic thought."
1761.6,1766.16, The way through which religious individuals express and empower themselves is through being a part of religion.
1766.16,1770.84, It's through expressing themselves in public and it's through feeling like their God is with them no matter where they go.
1770.84,1773.56," The moment you die, these individuals are barred from doing so."
1773.56,1777.04, They feel dehumanized and there's a level of innate human being
1777.04,1779.64, where you feel like you're less than everyone else around you.
1779.64,1784.88, Where you feel like your ability to express yourself is for some reason barred by a scheme even though you did nothing wrong.
1784.88,1788.3, You get to hear any responses to why this is problematic.
1788.3,1795.6, The reason why all of this is important and it matters within the religion is because the ability to express yourself is the way through which you inform your identity.
1795.6,1801.0," We believe this debate exists for every single person whose religion, but also for religious minorities as well."
1801.0,1801.9, No parallel.
1801.9,1804.4, He said individuals who have left everything in their country behind.
1804.4,1807.0, He said people who have come to these countries for the sake of immigration because they have
1807.0,1811.0, had no other choice. The only identity that they are often able to bring with them is
1811.0,1814.0," their own religion. If they are stripped away from this on their side of the world, we are"
1814.0,1817.0, making it feel that you can't express yourself because the state tells you that you are somehow
1817.0,1821.0," harmful. Really, this is father-publishing by individuals. When individuals are able"
1821.0,1824.0, to frame you under claims of how you are evil and that's where the government directly
1824.0,1826.0, bans you.
1826.0,1827.0, It's part of our virtue in state speech.
1827.0,1828.0, And this is important.
1828.0,1832.0," Even if in public spaces it doesn't happen, either forms of aggression don't disappear."
1832.0,1835.0," If you're born under the name of your name, everyone knows you're a Muslim."
1835.0,1839.0," Within these communities, it's not that you automatically don't face harms anymore."
1839.0,1840.0, You will continue to do so.
1840.0,1844.0, The only thing that then changes is your ability to express yourself in public.
1844.0,1845.0," Unless they show to you yourself in public, unless they"
1845.0,1849.0," are able to show you why in private spaces you won't be decriminalized, though unlike"
1849.0,1851.0," the Proms, they have tried to keep you from their cases."
1851.0,1854.0," But at the end of the day, the principle continues to stand."
1854.0,1858.0," Unless they are able to prove what its egregious forms of fun are somehow justified, we believe"
1858.0,1860.0, they automatically cannot be the same.
1860.0,1861.0, Secondary.
1861.0,1864.0," On secondary, the inclusive increases the secular culture."
1864.0,1865.0, No matter.
1865.0,1869.0," Under the mainstream, governments can continue to fund these forms of religious groups."
1869.0,1871.0, They can fund churches and they can fund Muslims.
1871.0,1878.0, Which is why we have popes who directly go up and generally they think this is fine to be homosexual because you can still end up going to heaven.
1878.0,1883.0, The reason for why this exists is because religions have been immediately centred to become a path to overtax.
1883.0,1886.8," However, when you directly mar the community with access on their side,"
1886.8,1890.16, these individuals are left to only cater to the most extremist forms of groups
1890.16,1894.32, because they want to hold on to them and make sure these people never leave these groups to begin with.
1894.32,1898.72," Or this is look back, it means you going up to your other church individuals and telling you that"
1898.72,1902.16," look, if you leave these communities, you're not fulfilling your holy duties."
1902.16,1906.0, These forms of extremist narratives would often turn other people off and they do not have an incentive to do so.
1906.0,1911.0," But here, this is the only way through which they can hold on to the small amounts of groups which can continue to support them."
1911.0,1916.0," The problem with this, then, is how it increases the very level of extremism that they talk about."
1916.0,1919.0," The next thing about this is, and this is the second here,"
1919.0,1923.0, religious ideologies and political ideologies fall under very small grounds.
1923.0,1928.0," What this means is you can frame a lot of interesting, underpinnings of political ideologies fall under very small grounds. What this means is you can frame a lot of these things under claims of political ideologies as well."
1928.0,1934.0," Emotion may be religious in nature, but at the end of the day, it can still be framed under the theme of true life."
1934.0,1939.0," At the end of it all, what this means is politicians, due to having angry levels of religious individuals"
1939.0,1943.0," who want and feel more things because of feeling that you've been marginalized by the state,"
1943.0,1948.0, now vote for these groups that they themselves want to harm against. This means the very perpetual
1948.0,1952.0, forms of harms and aggression of minority repercussions of making sure your religion
1952.0,1956.0, doesn't become unsafe for others and the very burdens they themselves feel at the very
1956.0,1961.0, beginning of their speech. The reason why then all this matters is because when seclusion
1961.0,1966.0," increases, the ability for minorities to come into power automatically falls as well."
1966.0,1968.0, People have in-groups that are built into them.
1968.0,1973.0, People feel like different religions are different and should remain within their own obligated abilites.
1973.0,1977.0," Muslims fear going out of their power because they feel like the state does not recognize them,"
1977.0,1982.0," which creates more internal groups, reduces the ability for groups to simply interact and grow together with each other,"
1982.0,1986.4, and it reduces the ability for them to then come into possession of power and believe in mistakes as well.
1986.4,1989.44," Now, it is illegitimate to say that religion is harmful."
1989.44,1993.36," It brings you peace, it brings you solace, and therefore, to say that religious individuals"
1993.36,1996.32," do not deserve to express themselves is a monogamy, which is..."
1999.36,2001.28, I want to travel quickly to this next speech.
2001.28,2003.44," Firstly, let's talk about religious freedom."
2003.44,2005.92," Secondly, on religious and internal politics. Firstly, let's talk about religious freedom. Secondly, on religious entanglement with politics."
2005.92,2007.12," Lastly, on minorities."
2007.12,2009.04," Before that, though, I want to take two clarifications"
2009.04,2010.4, to support this debate.
2010.4,2013.12," Firstly, let's talk about the enlightened implementation"
2013.12,2014.88, of this strict state-side version.
2014.88,2016.08," An author notes that,"
2016.08,2016.8," phase A-0,"
2016.8,2018.88, majorities will define religion as selectively
2018.88,2020.08," biased and faulty,"
2020.08,2021.92, under the veil of the century.
2021.92,2023.68," And I like this awkward position right now,"
2023.68,2026.0," because if you look at this motion clarification,"
2026.0,2028.0, the motion clarification does indeed tell you
2028.0,2030.0, that you are going to be banned a lot of the
2030.0,2034.0," obvious forms of things, regardless of what culture or religion it is."
2034.0,2036.0," Look at it, I will quote,"
2036.0,2038.0," a person wearing a cross necklace,"
2038.0,2040.0," or a sick turban, or hijab in the public,"
2040.0,2042.0, all of these are going to be
2042.0,2044.0, simply banned and are sent on the halls
2044.0,2045.0," in the public, which"
2045.0,2048.0, has meant that it's on their knee what they are pushing for in the city.
2048.0,2053.0," And I do agree that it has a core motion, you don't have to simply defend your right"
2053.0,2057.0," to communication, but the motion's definition does tell us that we have to defend the world,"
2057.0,2061.0, and I think the role that they accuse us of defending is not a role of supreme state
2061.0,2064.0," capitalism, which is why it simply cannot get swayed by the right wing, which is why"
2064.0,2065.0," our impoverished leaders stand for right. which is why we simply cannot get swayed by your rhetoric, which is why our in-public"
2065.0,2067.0, leaders tell you from the first stand already.
2067.0,2071.0," We tell you that if a Christian cross is used for religious advocacy in the public, we will"
2071.0,2072.0, ban it.
2072.0,2076.0," If parents oppose the schoolwork in corporate religion and education, we will ban it."
2076.0,2080.0," And quite obviously, if politicians, foreign religious organizations, coordinate schools,"
2080.0,2082.0, we will also punish them.
2082.0,2085.4," And if you cannot punish these people, this is not a secular thing,"
2085.4,2088.64, which is why I think our case stands at this point already.
2088.64,2091.44," Secondly, let's talk about your claim on how"
2091.44,2094.22, the new case put people internally in the private.
2094.22,2096.98, This immediately told them that they could take rounds.
2096.98,2099.62," First, it's what they've done less than the R-side of the House."
2099.62,2101.72," But if it's true that Rosen's one money,"
2101.72,2103.52, do you think that they would not be as excluded
2103.52,2105.6, because they would no longer be able to
2105.6,2107.7, follow the path of the public in our side of the house.
2107.7,2109.7," And notice here, remember, panel,"
2109.7,2112.1, that the religions cannot depend on the current followers
2112.1,2114.8," all the time, which means that they have to gain new followers,"
2114.8,2116.6, which means that they cannot become excluded
2116.6,2117.7, in our side of the house.
2117.7,2120.3," But secondly, it is actually only on our side of the house"
2120.3,2122.5, that it can effectively crack down on them.
2122.5,2127.0," So when we have the first-rate scouts like Riddham, we have the capacity to police religion"
2127.0,2131.0, because we are the only side that can punish these that are religion-displaced
2131.0,2133.0, for not being like these leader-coaches for instance.
2133.0,2135.0," All of this is brutal, is a nowhere."
2135.0,2140.0," The governments are so pro-religious freedom, and a lot of religious organizations are actually"
2140.0,2143.0, able to block government all in the name of religious freedom.
2143.0,2148.0," And therefore, at the point of the state, they can see that religion has some sort of origin of exploitation,"
2148.0,2151.0," that is to say, that it's simply worthless on their side without their health."
2151.0,2153.0," Here's the way, though, two pieces of the way."
2153.0,2157.0," One, even if it gets more exploitative, there's a limited use of the word health exploitative"
2157.0,2160.0," in that case, because it's uncritical and how much it would use their popular law."
2160.0,2164.0," So second of all, I think that if it gets exploitative, even if that's the case, at"
2164.0,2174.0," least it's more difficult to join religion apart than it does to all, which means that in the long run, there's less people exploiting a religion for the first place, which is why your path between law and school religion, expulsion, is gone."
2174.0,2189.0," First of all, what do you put out? Your mind. If it does get more exploitative and more people time-hardened, then most people who are born into this world are not forced to go online and start it."
2189.0,2195.0," Because the religion has no incentive to be available, because it's no longer publicly exposed and cannot gather followers in that way. How do you deal with that?"
2195.0,2207.12," Sure, but I just said that it cannot be exploitative, it can get forces on their kind of house, so their way is against their family's house. I'm not going to say that I'm not a Catholic. Firstly, let's talk about rights. Two things I want to note here. Firstly, you not being able to wear a hijab"
2207.12,2210.12, is not analogous to you not being able
2210.12,2211.46," to be a Muslim woman, right?"
2211.46,2213.56, It is simply being mean for all of the Jewish state.
2213.56,2215.82," If they cannot wear it, they don't feel empowered."
2215.82,2218.36," Especially, we told you from the Sirocco speech"
2218.36,2220.68, as to what the inherent purpose of God
2220.68,2222.8, is not to simply actually give posters
2222.8,2223.78," to people in the public,"
2223.78,2225.5," rather it is to individually let, like, present for God to talk to pastors give posters to people in public, rather it is to individually elect,"
2225.5,2227.5," like, present for God to talk to pastors,"
2227.5,2229.5," which is why in Buddhism in Japan,"
2229.5,2231.5, a lot of the people are actually going to mount
2231.5,2233.5, into individually elected God.
2233.5,2236.5, I think that religious conception can impact change.
2236.5,2239.5," But second of all, I think that the long-term train has meant"
2239.5,2242.5, the normalization of new conceptions of religion
2242.5,2244.5, are in fact going to be adopted on our side of the house.
2244.5,2247.04," Because imagine, guys, this motion gives us"
2247.04,2250.28," this magical view that in Western liberal democracies,"
2250.28,2252.74, strict state factors is going to be adopted.
2252.74,2253.58, What does this mean?
2253.58,2256.7," UK, US, France, a lot of old-time countries,"
2256.7,2258.7, big countries are going to adopt this policy.
2258.7,2261.28," They're not religious, like pastors, for instance,"
2261.28,2263.26, and preachers have the incentive to gain new followers.
2263.26,2266.8," They have the incentive to actually interpret this religion in a new subjective way,"
2266.8,2269.7, which is why the world was announced as going to help religion-neurotic teachings
2269.7,2272.1, can't keep standing at this point already.
2272.1,2273.5, The implication here is simple.
2273.5,2276.5, The reason why it responds to your claim that it is freedom to talk about your religion
2276.5,2278.7, is that it is not the state oppressing you.
2278.7,2283.2," When the state acts in a lawful way, people willingly make a choice not to bear the job"
2283.2,2287.0," committed to the forest as their own choice, which is why I think they pursue other things."
2287.0,2295.0," But even if that's not true, the unfortunate reality of the religion is that there are some coercion in religion that exists in the past."
2295.0,2298.0," So it's true that many people want to get a job on their own, right?"
2298.0,2303.0, But it is also true that most people don't mean to opt in to religion if they are born into it.
2303.0,2308.0," And two, the choice to opt out of religion is not a realistic choice when God tells you"
2308.0,2311.28," that your religion is the eternal way of salvation, and when your parents and your"
2311.28,2315.2," families actually adopt your religion, which has meant that there are also some people"
2315.2,2319.76," who are versed into actually wearing hijab or actually wearing hijab in the public, which"
2319.76,2324.72," has meant that all the way, those beautiful, like, choice can adapt, but on their side"
2324.72,2328.5," of the house, those people who are vers worst into wearing it is going to be eternal."
2328.5,2336.0," Which is why the forms are asymmetric, but those vulnerable people are going to need to be part of their side of the house."
2336.0,2350.0," But, even if we lose on the right, there's too many better things. Why? What if practical farms, to be frank, I know this is kind of counterintuitive, but we did prove to you why very few people are actually going to give you some sort of practical farm."
2350.0,2352.0," We can talk about the second part, but we're in minorities."
2352.0,2368.0," And in the same way, we don't allow people to just go to the leaders of the patient, where we actually, not even thinking about it, but we think that practical farms can outweigh the microlithics that are bluff away from the identity status of the wealthy in the US. Secondly, on those harm principles, we tell you from your book that this advice significantly harms other people,"
2368.0,2371.0, which is why Linus Wright did not sign a new plea for full-ranging.
2371.0,2373.0, Let's talk about the limits and handlements.
2373.0,2378.0," There are pieces that are emotionally symmetric, but I think there are a lot of political issues in their reference."
2378.0,2382.0," One of these is that in Poland, Congress sees religious employment as a dog-piguracy,"
2382.0,2386.7," and LGBTQ freedom in the public. This is basically barring away from those public speeches,"
2386.7,2388.24, these are the harms that will not exist
2388.24,2389.62, on our side of the house.
2389.62,2392.46," Then we see, oh, the other one may exist, sure,"
2392.46,2395.04," but that doesn't respond to their impact, right?"
2395.04,2397.16," All of our impacts that we outlined here from first,"
2397.16,2399.24," about how individuals cannot simply go to college,"
2399.24,2401.0, or how things like education are the worst thing
2401.0,2401.84," on their side of the house,"
2401.84,2403.38, is still of obvious magnitude.
2403.38,2406.0," On practical way, one, this impacts everyone"
2406.0,2408.0, within the public space.
2408.0,2410.0," Think about how Darwinism is like,"
2410.0,2413.0, the reject to science in the US Oklahoma.
2413.0,2415.0, Literally 10 commandments were actually
2415.0,2417.0, mandated to trust everyone.
2417.0,2419.0," But secondly, public spaces is a day,"
2419.0,2421.0, like something that affects your daily life.
2421.0,2423.0," But on principle, public spaces actually create"
2423.0,2428.0," on tax money, which is why I think this has to be accessible to every single person."
2428.0,2434.0," Finally, let's talk about why it's really their business that they wouldn't be burdened by harm if you go to contact with them."
2434.0,2438.0," The problem is that they assume that when you contact with them, you will get along."
2438.0,2440.0, They miss the nuance two things.
2440.0,2445.0," One, you can also contact with them on R7 and R well. It's just that they're not wearing the hijab, right?"
2445.0,2448.0," But secondly, note that religion is contradictory."
2448.0,2451.0, Who is God? What is a good believer?
2451.0,2454.0," Those things are contradictory, which means that when you're talking for them,"
2454.0,2456.0," you are more likely to identify them as a threat to your religion,"
2456.0,2459.0, which is why you can't place verses on their side of the house.
2459.0,2464.0," So on our side of the house, Muslims and Christians are going to sit in the same classroom"
2464.0,2466.0, and talk together harmoniously.
2466.0,2472.0," But on their side of the house, when they simply talk about religion, when they simply put up religious symbols,"
2472.0,2477.0, that is an ablution to argue the disproportionate and hard minorities on their side of the house.
2477.0,2480.0, This is why I think we are winning on my youth as well.
2480.0,2489.0," Finally, when they speech laws, they ask and always will not work. Because of blurriness, does note how uninputed and moving back what this analogy is,"
2489.0,2493.0," this is not ripping in a sad scope, which is why we have to take a small seat."
2494.0,2500.0," Now, imagine being denied your autonomy, being robbed of your only source of solace,"
2500.0,2504.0, just because the bare beads in your hands make someone else seem uncomfortable.
2504.0,2507.0, We refuse to stand for such a world.
2507.0,2509.0, I have three questions in this debate.
2509.0,2512.0," Firstly, which world better protects the fundamental rights of individuals?"
2512.0,2515.0," Secondly, which world better controls radicalization?"
2515.0,2519.0," Thirdly, which world protects the most vulnerable?"
2519.0,2522.0," But before that, I have two clarifications."
2522.0,2526.4," Firstly, the main debate about how we vowed to only go against"
2526.4,2531.28," Binoils, that's literally not what we tell you. We tell you that this is likely to happen"
2531.28,2536.56," against all these religions. But the moment in time it happens, in Western liberal democracies,"
2536.56,2541.36," because Christianity is so integrated into the culture, which looks like the Christians"
2541.36,2550.32," being celebrated everywhere because it's their important culture because if they're in this car, because of all of these reasons, it's highly that even if you do"
2550.32,2555.68," banners, if you stay in regard to culture, which is exactly why it's unlikely to work, there's another"
2555.68,2561.12," wrong. Secondly, we tell you that on their side of the road, all their beliefs look like religion is bad,"
2561.12,2567.0," it's just that case, fine. If religion is so bad, why don't we vanish into public spaces? Why don't we be there?"
2567.0,2575.0," Moving on to my first question, which world better protect the fundamental rights of individuals?"
2575.0,2586.1, They come here and tell you that people's principal right to go outside is barred because now religious people lobby politicians. I have three responses to this.
2586.1,2590.3," Firstly, understand that this literally cannot be taken away in the first place."
2590.3,2594.9, Why? Because these governments need these individuals to give their votes.
2594.9,2598.1, Which is why they will literally not wire them from most democracy spaces.
2598.1,2600.8," Or on second, these are Western liberal democracies"
2600.8,2605.0," which care about the international reputation which comes from media houses, right?"
2605.0,2609.0," The more time you are lacking in these religious organizations on a national large scale,"
2609.0,2611.0, you will have backlash no matter what.
2611.0,2616.0," Secondly, they claim that we do not bring the motion, but I wish they did that,"
2616.0,2622.0, because their claim of WLBs having this is literally flawed.
2622.0,2629.0," WLBs, by constitution constitution literally cannot side with religious organizations to such an extent"
2629.0,2632.4, that they are lobbied to the great extent that it cannot be.
2632.4,2636.8," Thirdly, even if we take another best-case scenario, even if this principle stands,"
2636.8,2639.6, it still takes away individuals' autonomy.
2639.6,2644.2, The one thing that matters the most to individuals is human dignity.
2646.0,2652.0," What do we tell you then? First thing, we tell you that competition's world snatches away your most fundamental"
2652.0,2654.0, right for religious orientation.
2654.0,2662.0," They attempt to do some evil rebuffles to it, but why does it fail?"
2662.0,2666.0," Because, first thing, their only rebuffle that comes here is that"
2666.0,2671.52," with science, you come to normalcy. Firstly, you never come to normalcy. Religion has been integrated"
2671.52,2677.36," into your identity and into who you are from the very beginning, literally from your birth. All you"
2677.36,2683.2," have known about yourself, all of it, is a part of that religion. No matter how much time passes by,"
2683.2,2688.0," even if you're on your deathbed, you will never come to the market scene. But secondly, even if you take the"
2688.0,2692.0," matter-of-the-space scenario, even if that happens, you still lose your autonomy, which"
2692.0,2696.0, is the most important thing in this debate. Because understand that this principle stands
2696.0,2702.0," no matter what utility they can show you. Because I, as a human being, my dignity matters"
2702.0,2706.0, the most. My autonomy matters the most. Whether or not
2706.0,2710.0," I can stay within my religion, I can show my religion to the world, whether I can fulfill"
2710.0,2715.0, my religion is something that I hear about the most. But why is this extremely important
2715.0,2720.0," in that panel? Understand that religion changes people on an individual level, right? It gives"
2720.0,2730.1, them solace and hope that they need on their darkest of nights. It ensures that it acts as a self-defense mechanism against the afterlife and against hell.
2730.1,2738.0," But most importantly, it protects you from individuals because your identity is not flawed anymore."
2738.0,2765.5," Coming to my second fact then, in regards to radicalization, we already talked about this. The moment in time we bring their case down, which literally revolves around the idea that now, they are going to have policing in their side of the world."
2765.5,2771.0," But why does this not stand? Because now, wheelchair is directly doubled down in their side of the world."
2771.0,2773.0, Why is this so? Because of two reasons.
2773.0,2778.0," Firstly, because on their side of the world, you literally don't know what's going on in regards to these wheelchairs."
2778.0,2783.0, Because all of these happen through a closed door. You don't know which extreme group has come up.
2783.0,2785.0, You don't know what these politicians are doing.
2785.0,2792.0, Because you literally cannot let them talk in public. There is no check and balance mechanism to ensure that they are true.
2792.0,2800.0," But on a secondary scale, understand that now on their side of the cross, preachers do not get to bring people back to religion."
2800.0,2807.0," What is it that they do then? They ensure that the limited amount of people that they have, they double down on these people."
2807.0,2808.0, How do they do so?
2808.0,2815.0," They tell them that you are in danger, that you need to protect your identity, which is why they are likely to become even more radical."
2815.0,2816.0, Why is this bad?
2816.0,2824.0," Because it leads to even more political tensions within these WLPs, which ensures that these people are acting hard on their side of the world."
2824.0,2826.32," Before we move on, I will be making a theory."
2826.32,2832.24," Christian youth use the Bible to justify slavery, but now, the Pope welcomes gay people in church,"
2832.24,2838.4, and the soundly opinions now allow us to make a trial. Why can't people's conceptual religion change?
2838.4,2844.32," Sure, their conceptual religion can change, but that shouldn't be at the cost of their identity."
2844.32,2848.0," You don't change their conception, you change their identity."
2848.0,2855.0," Even on their best days in a year, right? Even if there has come a moment of backlash for radicalization, it comes as a legitimacy of people."
2855.0,2862.0," Because on their side of the world, the strict secularism is, you literally bash up these people the moment in time they talk about religion."
2862.0,2867.0," Moving on to my third question, why do we project the most vulnerable of individuals?"
2867.0,2872.0," Here, I can come to you and tell you that minorities on their side of the world are"
2872.0,2873.0, sage.
2873.0,2874.0, I have five responses to this.
2874.0,2877.0," Firstly, understand that no, minorities are not sage."
2877.0,2879.0, They are oppressed even further.
2879.0,2880.0, Why is this so?
2880.0,2887.0," Because the only form of identity, solace, for these minorities is their religion."
2887.0,2894.0," Understand this panel, no matter how much discrimination you face as a minority within these WLBs,"
2894.0,2898.0, you still choose to stay within this religion because you actively care about this religion.
2898.0,2903.0," The moment in time they bar these individuals from literally expressing their faith,"
2903.0,2905.6, that's exactly when they feel even more oppressed.
2905.6,2911.2," On the secondary level of balance, even in their best-in-scenario, they do say to these minorities,"
2911.2,2915.6," to a certain extent, that comes at the cost of the autonomy of these minorities."
2915.6,2919.92," Even then, these minorities, even according to them, are the most vulnerable individuals,"
2919.92,2924.24," understand more than they can to take away another layer of vulnerability from them,"
2924.24,2925.28," which is their own economy,"
2925.28,2927.28, you make that even worse.
2927.28,2934.32," The more time they talk about polarities that exist, understand that polarity is even harder on their side of the world."
2934.32,2938.8, This is because majority now have communal sentiment to only cater to themselves.
2938.8,2944.8," We talked about the us and them, us versus them mentality which is why they double down on minorities."
2944.8,2945.0," What do we tell them then? us versus them mentality, which is why they doubled down on minorities."
2945.0,2946.0, What do we tell them then?
2946.0,2950.0," We tell them that on their side of the world, these religious organizations, which cater"
2950.0,2954.0," to the most vulnerable of individuals, are likely to downsize."
2954.0,2955.0, Why is this bad?
2955.0,2959.0," Because these are the religious institutions which cater to people within rural areas,"
2959.0,2961.0, who will never be catered to by governments.
2961.0,2965.0, We tell them that these individuals are the most vulnerable. These individuals
2965.0,2970.0," are the white who are likely to be orphans, who are likely to have free education or free"
2970.0,2974.0, food. These religious institutions are the ones who literally build the infrastructure
2974.0,2978.0, against the plurality of gay men from the funding that they get. Because we tell you
2978.0,2982.0," why we protect the most vulnerable individuals, why we protect their rights, why we protect"
2982.0,2990.4," them from radicalization within the city. Now, before I get into the major part of this request, which I just want to note, they start"
2990.4,2994.4, this debate off by saying they want to prove minorities because they don't want the majority
2994.4,2997.76, shoving up their own religious symbols on their face. But then their second scheme comes
2997.76,3002.24," is, okay, but we might have Christmas in our city, we still have some benefits. So they're"
3002.24,3006.0, okay with having majority celebrating Christmas in the brightest of ways
3006.0,3011.0, and mostly that other people don't get to celebrate festivities like this on their side of the world.
3011.0,3014.0, That is inherently problematic. We don't see any other thing standing.
3014.0,3015.0, There is a conflict of shame itself.
3015.0,3020.0, But then they come to a point of how not wearing a board car does not make a Muslim woman half a non-Muslim.
3020.0,3023.0, The problem here is they think they have the right to decide that.
3023.0,3030.0, What makes a Muslim woman Muslim or what she de thinks is necessary for her to be a proper religious person is completely
3030.0,3031.04, up to her choice.
3031.04,3034.16, This is the reason why our principal standard is that no one pays in this debate.
3034.16,3035.2, What do they tell us?
3035.2,3038.24, They tell us that there are going to be extremist policies pushed forward.
3038.24,3039.84, They give you the layers of the response on this.
3039.84,3043.68," First thing, how these sentiments don't just naturally disappear but now they can get worse"
3043.68,3046.5, because now they have to without the state being able to monitor them.
3046.5,3050.5," They happen in secrecy, but also we're telling that these policies can still be pushed forward,"
3050.5,3056.5," investment work can still be done via other things like pro-life, it doesn't have to be directly related to religion."
3056.5,3059.5, So we don't think that point can be investigated anymore.
3059.5,3065.5, But then they talk about they're okay with banning it as long as it it harms someone else and because it could be a threat to someone else.
3065.5,3067.5," We tell you these things, they resisted us and are the worst."
3067.5,3069.0, We love it when hate speech exists.
3069.0,3074.0," But we told you, if people feel that their religion is being harmed because they saw an LGBT person,"
3074.0,3076.5, would they ban that person and they are going to express themselves?
3076.5,3078.5, They never gave us an answer.
3078.5,3082.0," Now, let me talk about how they are doing this just to save these minorities from the hate."
3082.0,3084.5, We tell you that the sentience of hate will exist.
3084.5,3087.8," I may not face direct racism if I go out right now,"
3087.8,3088.64," but the sentence,"
3088.64,3091.18, I know that people who'll be racist towards me
3091.18,3093.42, is something that I will always remember in my head.
3093.42,3095.62," So compared to those videos where I told you in my speech,"
3095.62,3096.92," when they have their prayer beads,"
3096.92,3098.62," when they have that cross around their neck,"
3098.62,3100.38, they haven't acted from self-defense.
3100.38,3102.16, They didn't hope that their God would save them
3102.16,3104.5, and that that's the only self-defense they have.
3104.5,3108.0, They actually gave it away. That mind does not stand. They never counter-responded to that.
3108.0,3113.0," But at the very end of the Roots Feast, we tried to counter their principle with this one thing of coercion."
3113.0,3119.0," Firstly, it's way too late for that big red ribbon. Even if it were, a lot of things in life are way more worse than religion is."
3119.0,3122.0, And we gave few reasons why religion has a lot of benefits after it.
3122.0,3127.6," And you still have an ability to opt out of other religions into something else, so we're not sure where this gets."
3127.6,3130.8," So if their importance is the only medical value in the bank, then we're all going to"
3130.8,3134.4," get every single thing we're forced to do, like getting an education by getting a job, right?"
3134.4,3135.2, Has it made sense?
3135.2,3136.4, What did we give you?
3136.4,3141.2, A principle on people's identity being actively taken away and how it's specifically
3141.2,3144.8," invocative of these Western people that want this to do so, because they think that they're"
3144.8,3148.4, the fat bearers of so-called human rights and freedom of expression.
3148.4,3150.8," But doing this is an inherited problematic involvement space,"
3150.8,3153.6, because that is where you cannot control how much time you spend.
3153.6,3155.52, That is where you need protection the most.
3155.52,3156.88, They never assume all of that.
3156.88,3163.92," The fact that the state literally has control over everything and now the state is taking away my right to what faith I want to believe in,"
3163.92,3165.24, what clothes I want to wear.
3165.24,3167.0, That doesn't help you from that now.
3167.0,3170.12, But what we did in the second round was an increase of radicalism.
3170.12,3171.28, We tell you how.
3171.28,3176.8, They keep saying these examples from Chetan's talk of how salt is a driven drive and the food is being delivered.
3176.8,3180.88," They never state it for its outlaw, which means yes it happens in our world because exposure exists."
3180.88,3184.52," This does not happen in their world because the moment you cannot expose religion,"
3184.52,3207.0," you can no longer get these forms of exposure, which is why they look at the incentive to belch them, because people who see the way they put the status quo, which means our points of them being radical and holding the front line to the people who are already in the religion, and them being those vulnerable ones, still stand in this debate. The fact that they never respond to our argument on principle, the fact that they are okay"
3207.0,3211.0," with the active right of these people, the most vulnerable people, these immigrants,"
3211.0,3214.0, these people who want to simply live in their faith and want to wear something of the form
3214.0,3219.0," of supplements, stand with this debate, while simply the principle that they were unable"
3219.0,3222.0," to take it on and how they are okay with this inherent form of harm, we win this debate"
3222.0,3228.0," on a very fair margin, to all of the people that are still in the polls."
3228.0,3231.0, The wild stuff the opposition side have to defend in this debate
3231.0,3235.0, was the wildfire discrimination that happens on a daily basis
3235.0,3238.0," to Muslim people walking down the street because they're worried about them,"
3238.0,3240.0, because they're pulled up as terrorists.
3240.0,3242.0, They have to defend a world in which
3242.0,3244.0, lobbyists lobby the government all the time
3244.0,3250.0, and make these like indoctrinated curriculums with religious rhetoric.
3250.0,3260.0," We think that discriminatory wars was not enough for them to reduce the harms on everyone and all minorities on their side, which is what we're so proud to propose in today's debate."
3260.0,3265.0, I'd like to go through three questions in today's debate.
3265.0,3269.0," Firstly, on religious freedom. Secondly, on religious and taboo politics."
3269.0,3273.0," And finally, on minorities. So firstly, on religious freedom."
3273.0,3278.0, Note that we have already told you down our bench that religion is very adaptable.
3278.0,3281.0," In Indonesia, it is now optional to wear a bath canal."
3281.0,3286.0," In Iran, Muslim women actively voted for a president that would"
3286.0,3291.0, make a hijab optional. So from this you can see that the identity or religious identity
3291.0,3298.0, is inherently subjective and that the changing of these identities is not forced in any way
3298.0,3304.0, whatsoever. And at best it only incurs very short time humps from their side which we
3304.0,3305.76, are willing to concede.
3305.76,3310.32," Because they still have the option of operating five times a day at home, they can still talk to us,"
3310.32,3316.72," they can still get the emotional salvation inside, through private religions,"
3316.72,3321.52, which we think will mitigate all the harms that they provided to us today.
3321.52,3324.72," But secondly, religious entanglement with politics."
3324.72,3326.0, I just want to weigh this point
3326.0,3331.0, over the religious freedom argument. We think that the religious entanglement with politics
3331.0,3336.0," is the most important issue in this debate. Just as we get to pass these, religious entanglement"
3336.0,3341.0," with politics harms everyone. Just notice how in the meeting of the state, Matt aided everyone"
3341.0,3347.0, to teach creationism and to teach the Ten Commandments regardless of what religion they were.
3347.0,3354.0," So basically, these kinds of policies hurt every single person on the ground regardless of whether you're religious or not."
3354.0,3366.8," But secondly, we say that religions entangled with politics is most important because it's the most certain impact in today's debate. When strict secularism is implemented, it will substantially lower the"
3366.8,3372.54," ability of politicians to entangle with religion. Because we've told you stuff like public funding,"
3372.54,3377.14, they can't get money from lobbyists anymore. Parents
3377.14,3389.0," literally cannot go to school boards and request the curriculum to be changed. We think that this is the most impactful impact in this debate. But lastly, we think that the right to religion is not absolute."
3389.0,3393.0, We restrict the right to freedom of expression all over the time.
3393.0,3401.0," We think that this looks like, you know, just limiting like, vandalism, limiting like, hate speech, limiting all these forms of expression."
3401.0,3405.52," Insofar as the right to freedom and the right to religion is not absolute,"
3405.52,3414.56, we have to weigh this below the state responsibility to provide accessibility and accessible public
3414.56,3421.76," spaces for everyone that is based on everyone's tax money. But lastly, on minorities. We think"
3421.76,3425.68, that we are required to host a host of reasons from our
3425.68,3430.88, backspeaker that the reason why minorities are being discriminated is because the majority
3430.88,3434.56," of people feel threatened by more minorities when they see these black, when they see these"
3434.56,3439.6, kids' jobs. That people feel threatened because politicians fan the claims of anti-Islamic
3439.6,3443.68," sentiment. We think that, uniquely on our side, this is not possible, which is why on"
3443.68,3450.0," our side everyone can sit together, everyone can coexist in a school, at their workplace,"
3450.0,3457.0," because they do not feel threatened by the other religion, and they will be willing to cooperate and to communicate with the other religion."
3457.0,3469.2," So, the conclusion of all of this is that the political and instrumental politics is the most important impact in this debate and should you should weigh in over any fluffy harms of religious freedom or any fluffy harms of"
3469.2,3473.92, minorities when they can't even protect minorities on their side through like discrimination
3473.92,3476.64, or like anti-disclimation laws that do not even work.
3476.64,3480.64, So all these reasons we are so proud to propose today. Thank you.
