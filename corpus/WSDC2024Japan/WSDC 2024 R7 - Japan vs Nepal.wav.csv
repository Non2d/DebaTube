0.0,5.0, It is merely a myth that colonialism is a relic of the past.
5.0,12.0," France continues to exploit and steal from the pockets of West African citizens, forcing them to work below minimum wage."
12.0,18.0, Pre-colonial French tendencies continue to suck up uranium in Niger and plunder crude oil in Gabon.
18.0,24.0," It pulls the strings of West African politics through overthrowing democratically elected leaders,"
24.0,25.24," orchestrating coups, and"
25.24,30.64, paying bribes in favour of pro-French leaders like Ali Gawang in exchange for control and
30.64,35.32," natural resources. On Team Japan, we say it is time to tell them that we are no longer"
35.32,38.9, going to tolerate this exploitation. We are extremely proud of those.
39.66,44.32," A few points on set-up before we finish up three arguments. First, on principle. Secondly,"
44.44,47.68," on how we get economic development, thirdly on how we get"
47.68,49.8, regional stability in the region.
49.8,51.04, A few points on set up.
51.04,54.48, What does the French exit look like and what is the French exit?
54.48,59.68," France's exit from West Africa is a combination of military exit, political exit and economic"
59.68,63.52, exit that has occurred since Macron's admissions office in 2017.
63.52,66.42," This is independence, this is kicking out French corporations."
66.42,68.32, This is removing the French military.
68.32,69.92, What is the comparative then?
69.92,72.24," In Proposition's world, after the French exit,"
72.24,74.44," we think that power over politics, the economy,"
74.44,77.16, and the military falls into the hands of local governments
77.16,79.5, who actually affect citizens' interests.
79.5,80.7," This is factually true,"
80.7,83.16, but what are the structural reasons for this?
83.16,88.14," Firstly, West African citizens value democracy above anything else, driven by generational"
88.14,93.12, trauma from colonial rule and a strong desire for autonomy and dignity following their recent
93.12,94.12, independence.
94.12,98.62, Look how 67% of West Africans say they prefer democracy over any type of rule.
98.62,102.44," Secondly, but even in countries with weaker democracies, they are likely to transition"
102.44,106.56," to civilian rule because a general general international pressure, b."
106.56,111.2," ECOWAS military interventions, all military juntas in West Africa have set up plans to"
111.2,114.32," transition to civilian rules in the next five years, c."
114.32,118.96," when one country democratizes, it opens up its democratic media and imposes a trickling"
118.96,122.88, which can force other countries to transition into civilian rule as well.
122.88,124.64, What do we support on our side then?
124.64,128.56," Firstly, we still support trade with other countries including France, but secondly,"
128.56,132.64, what we do not support on our side is the military presence of France and countries
132.64,136.56," having governments avoided by France. Two arguments from the proposition then,"
136.56,140.48," but for that I'll take your view on it. If it is so true that people know what they want,"
140.48,145.24, why is there an increase in the number of of military juntas who always claim that they're half-Japans?
145.24,151.62," Yeah, so the thing is that not only the military juntas reflect the people's opinions, people"
151.62,155.38," sometimes form military juntas instead, but the fact of the matter is that people want"
155.38,158.26, democracy over anything else in the first instance.
158.26,161.88," First argument then, on why the continued presence of France in West Africa is principally"
161.88,162.88, unjust.
162.88,167.24, The first thing is that status quo is an extension of colonialism.
167.24,171.84, France continues to exploit West Africa by sucking up resources and staying inside the country.
171.84,175.84," Most importantly, citizens of West Africa deeply resent France's colonial legacy."
175.84,181.5," For decades, they have demanded France's exit, elected anti-French leaders, and protested outside French embassies."
181.5,185.24, France's continuous dominance against their will is by definition full of illicit.
185.24,188.24, But why does this principally necessitate France to exit West Africa?
188.24,193.24," There are two independent reasons why France's presence is principally wrong, if either of"
193.24,195.24," them stands, France ought to be."
195.24,198.24," Firstly, France possesses something that is not rightfully deserved."
198.24,201.24, We think when France benefits heavily from things which they have unfairly gained from
201.24,203.24," West Africa, that is theft."
203.24,207.76," We think theft is inherently unjust, regardless of whatever benefits side opposition may want"
207.76,209.76, to talk about their two implications.
209.76,213.88," A. Analogously, we don't take so much talent away from them because we can take care of"
213.88,214.88, the talent better.
214.88,219.24," In the case of France, it is an inmate breach of property rights that is euphemized by economic"
219.24,220.24, growth.
220.24,224.24, But B. Speculative future impact is irrelevant consideration from repugnation.
224.24,225.62, Any future consideration
225.62,230.32," like the potential of corrupt whacking group, which may you want to talk about, is hypothetical"
230.32,235.96," and is not critically legitimate grounds to undo any past damage. For example, all companies"
235.96,240.24, would not be excused from compensating disliked villagers just because there is a potential
240.24,244.12, that someone else that is evil might do the same. Given that France's mere presence in
244.12,246.34," West Africa and other countries was unjustly acquired,"
246.56,248.2, it is only fair that they exit altogether.
248.52,250.58, Note that this principal reason is not contingent
250.58,251.8, on any practical outcomes.
252.1,254.74," This, in and of itself, requires France to forfeit"
254.74,256.22, its rule because it is not deferred.
256.4,258.12, The second reason is that France exiting
258.12,261.22, is the best method to maximize the agency of individuals.
261.8,264.22, West African countries are currently mere puppets
264.22,269.56," whose strengths are controlled by France, and the best way for them to be free is to be cut those strings."
269.56,274.56, France has systematically maintained a power imbalance within the citizens of West Africa
274.56,280.76," for two reasons. A, massive military capabilities, political lobby to endorse specific politicians,"
280.76,285.94," selfless incentives to select which projects to do, uniquely makes the voting power, taxing benefits,"
285.94,288.2, and voices of the citizens not be heard.
288.2,290.48," Therefore, the best form of reciprocal power"
290.48,294.04, that citizens can obtain by France exiting West Africa
294.04,296.34, and then being able to channel their voting rights
296.34,298.42, and political preference into actual action
298.42,301.66, by deciding which local political party to stand behind.
301.66,304.5," For those reasons, France must be West Africa."
304.5,309.0," Moving on to the second argument then, on why we get economic development in West Africa."
309.0,314.0," This comes in two layers. First layer, why the presence of France has stunted West African"
314.0,318.0," economic development. During the colonial era, France set up economic systems that enabled"
318.0,323.0, it to dominate West African countries' economies and make West African countries overly reliant
323.0,327.8, on France. France has created a system that never allows for these countries to grow in any way whatsoever.
327.8,331.2," After the French exit, we get economic development for two main reasons."
331.2,334.7," One, though, the abolition of the CFA-Franc."
334.7,338.3, There are three main problems with the CFA-Franc that still linger to this day.
338.3,346.34," A. France requires a massive portion, nearly 70% of Africa's nation's reserves, to be stored in a French treasury, inaccessible to African nations."
346.34,348.04," B, it instills instability,"
348.04,350.5, because nations cannot control their own currency.
350.5,352.0, They cannot control interest rates
352.0,354.04, and control inflation and stuff like that.
354.04,356.12," C, the currency is tied to the Euro,"
356.12,357.92," which leads to extreme appreciation,"
357.92,360.84, and therefore decreased exports and more expensive imports.
360.84,363.18, This is like when Senegal couldn't export their rice
363.18,367.24, anymore because the price of them increased so much that Thai rice outcompeted them.
367.62,374.12, The abolishment of the CFA franc and the shift to a more local currency can change this as they get more control over their own currency
374.12,380.24, and have a currency that is more proximate to their area. Also due to mounting anti-trust sentiment in West African countries and
380.56,385.78," multiple regress from West African regimes, France abolished the French Foreign Reserve Policy."
385.78,390.0, This led to countries like Senegal being able to enact huge macroeconomic policies worth
390.0,393.08, more than $2 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.
393.08,396.76," The implication is that countries have more access and control of their own money, which"
396.76,399.18, wouldn't have happened without the exit of France.
399.18,403.32, The second reason is the exit of exploitative French companies.
403.32,406.18, Numerous French MNCs take advantage of the systems
406.18,408.34, that they established during the colonial era
408.34,409.78, to extract disportionate benefits
409.78,411.18, from West African countries.
411.18,413.78," For instance, the French-owned state-owned company"
413.78,416.48, ran away more than Niger's entire annual budget
416.48,418.18, by selling off Niger's uranium.
418.18,419.62, This means that French companies
419.62,422.18, use a pre-established industrial dominance
422.18,424.66, to block competitions like foreign direct investment.
424.66,428.76, This also means that French companies create cheaper and better products which stamp out
428.76,429.76, local industries.
429.76,434.12, This is terrible for West African countries as it is uncertain when France will stop funding
434.12,435.12, the region.
435.12,439.16," In the comparative, there is decreased exploitation as there is increased competition."
439.16,443.76," Under French rule, the French do not allow for any competition and block other countries"
443.76,445.8, from coming in using the first movement of the package.
446.08,450.56," In the comparative, we think that West African countries can pick and choose from which country"
450.56,451.46, to cooperate with.
451.62,454.3, This is because there is likely to be competition between nations.
454.64,458.72," Most Western nations and countries like China have incentive to come in due to, one, the"
458.72,462.38," abundance of resources, and secondly, the incentive to block each other's influence."
462.38,466.76," In the past, France created a dictatorship where countries could only obey."
466.76,470.88," Uniquely on our side, we give West African countries more choices to choose from."
470.88,475.38, It is obviously whichever option that these West African countries take is the one that
475.38,476.38, we'd best offer.
476.38,480.24, Look how ivory coast has a GDP of one-third of that in 1978.
480.24,484.62, Cameroon and Congo have never reached this high GDP since the 80s due to their problem
484.62,485.5, on their side.
485.5,490.3," To conclude, in the past, colonisation used to come through tanks, but now it comes through banks."
490.3,494.5, We are extremely proud to stand for the side that cares about people. So proud.
495.5,498.5, The Bank's opposition's name here is simple.
498.5,505.0," France has a reparative obligation, and they think that the only way to fulfill that obligation is for them to"
505.0,510.0, leave West Africa entrenched in its current problems and just let go.
510.0,512.0, We think that this is simply unfair.
512.0,517.0, You being able to escape the ramifications of the problems that you have caused is not
517.0,518.0, justice.
518.0,519.0, It only benefits you.
519.0,524.0, We think that instead the only way to fulfill this reparative obligation is to stay there
524.0,525.0, and fix the mess
525.0,530.0, that you've made because it is your mess to fix and it exclusively belongs to you.
530.0,534.0," First, I'll be starting with some responses. In the context of responses, I want to forward"
534.0,538.0, two broad ideas. The first being that the comparative that side proposition is going
538.0,542.0, to end up with is worse. The second being that the only way to fulfill Francis' obligation
542.0,547.0, is for them to stay if their messaging doesn't look good anyway. Starting. Statenburg is proving that they can bear it in this verse.
547.36,551.72, Their first claim to victory here is that this is merely speculation and none of this
551.72,552.54, is likely to happen.
552.9,554.8, We tell you this is not merely speculation.
555.14,557.06, It has already begun to happen in Mali.
557.34,559.04, It has already begun to happen in Niger.
559.4,562.72, As the military government has sought ties with the Russian government to support their
562.72,567.0," regime, we've already seen some of these effects measures which means that this year lots of"
567.0,568.0, whom are hypotheticals or speculations.
568.0,573.0, This is dangerous and we are seeing these countries become dependent on Russia for military
573.0,574.0, support.
574.0,575.0, What happens in this scenario?
575.0,578.0, We think that military governments become more repressive with the help of Russia and
578.0,583.0," further human rights abuses, trample on democratic and governmental institutions and we have"
583.0,590.64, seen this happen with Wagner's review of Sudan's transitional political policy post-2019. Let's say that Russia is
590.64,594.74," not the only option. Even when we look towards China, we think that China's presence is"
594.74,599.4," even worse because their concerns are one, that the Sakhirin citizens are being subjected"
599.4,603.88," to low wages and two, that they do not truly own their properties. We think that this becomes"
603.88,608.26, significantly worse with what President China has said to the International Statist School.
608.48,612.74, We think that the Chinese government is likely to entrench these countries further in debt
612.74,616.72," traps and they are likely to be agnostic to security issues as well, which I'll get into"
616.72,621.94," in a second. But we think that this is permanently worse in the context of France, however. We"
621.94,627.0, think that France defends a formidable opposition and is still able to maintain a certainty of its country's sovereignty.
627.0,632.0," The reason this is necessarily true is because if you look at countries such as France and China,"
632.0,636.0, we don't necessarily think that it is within their incentive structure to ensure that they come off as fair.
636.0,644.0," However, all eyes are on France. There is a high degree of international scrutiny that comes associated with France's support for West Africa,"
644.0,648.4, given the fact that they already have a colonial legacy associated with it. Which means that
648.4,651.78," uniquely, France is going to be scrutinized to the degree that these other nations are"
651.78,653.62, not going to be scrutinized. Yes?
654.22,658.38," Then, if you say that scrutiny exists, why have they continued to exploit West Africa"
658.38,661.08, for decades and still continue to stay in West Africa?
661.08,665.0," Okay, so their entire claim only stands if they continue to exploit them."
665.0,668.0," I tell you no, because trends have been increasing."
668.0,671.0, I'll point out how trends have been increasing over the past few years.
671.0,674.0," But other than that, I also want you to know that if international scrutiny does not exist,"
674.0,677.0," there are other points like, oh, there's going to be international scrutiny and because"
677.0,679.0," of this, countries are going to be forced to democratize."
679.0,681.0, Doesn't necessarily work.
681.0,682.0, They can't happen both ways.
682.0,686.0, Either international scrutiny exists and countries are going to democratize or they're not.
686.0,690.0, Then moving on to why there's a trend in terms of France's relationship with West
690.0,694.0, Africa and the Philippines. I want you to crucially note that we think that this comes
694.0,698.0, in two major forms. The first is operational support and oversight of these providers.
698.0,703.0, If you look at how they basically ensure that the security issues that exist within the
703.0,705.0," countries of West Africa have been suppressed to a certain degree, we saw that the security issues that exist within the context of West Africa"
705.0,707.0, have been suppressed to a certain degree.
707.0,710.0, We see that they have been really effective in ensuring that the terrorist regimes that
710.0,712.0, exist within West Africa have been suppressed.
712.0,716.0," If you listen to the International Crisis Group, they tell you that in Manchuria, France"
716.0,720.0, was able to bring the militant control of that area in control of the 70% within the
720.0,721.0," first year, right?"
721.0,725.38, Which is also to say that we are also able to maintain a large degree of regional coordination.
725.38,726.32, It will become more important
726.32,728.8," why this regional coordination is important data,"
728.8,730.76, but we need to understand that France's diplomatic
730.76,733.14, and financial combinations are the only mechanism
733.14,735.14, through which we can form joint regional coordinates
735.14,736.52, and policy harmonization.
736.52,738.36, Then moving on to why this is the worst time
738.36,740.56, for France to enter the West Africa.
740.56,741.56, There's four key reasons.
741.56,743.86, The first of which is that if you look to West Africa
743.86,749.28," just to move into 2022-23, over 11,000 civilians were killed, half a million refugees and over 640"
749.28,752.96, million people were internally displaced by the U.S. troops in the Saharan region. This
752.96,756.8, is an impending refugee crisis that is waiting to happen which is only going to get worse
756.8,760.56, if France is entered. We also see that this is a massive security crisis and like I already
760.56,763.92," tell you, China and Russia are going to be amassed into these security threats because"
763.92,765.0, they literally won't care.
765.0,768.0, France is much more invested in these countries and it is lacking to care about these security threats.
768.0,772.0," And in Toronto, with examples, look at the cheap IELTS choice vote."
772.0,776.0," It helped all these like Burkina Faso, which helped Chad, which helped Mali, which helped Mauritius, which helped Niger."
776.0,781.0," Second reason, extremist unrest has caused significant damage to the vital infrastructure in two of these countries."
781.0,787.92," Look at Chad. When France's stand shifted to avoid diplomatic and distance position, 700,000 people went hungry because"
787.92,791.28, food supply chains were broken. This is something that has literally happened in the stages
791.28,795.6, where any speaker in this state are denied. So just to say that people's life gets litigated
795.6,799.68," worse. Thirdly, we think that Malini, Ayush and Gini and Rukhna Pasu have also undergone"
799.68,803.52, bloody political coups and political unrest and we think that military jatats are the
803.52,807.0," most likely option to exist within the state of coup for a few key reasons, right?"
807.0,810.0, The first is that their entire theme on how they want democracy so they are going to get
810.0,814.0, democracy doesn't necessarily work just based on examples that we've seen.
814.0,817.0," But also more importantly, we think that we've already seen this in the past as well."
817.0,822.0," If you look at what the international precedent has been, you'll recognize that when countries,"
822.0,827.0," when the West has left their military interventionist strategies,"
827.0,830.0," for example in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken over."
830.0,833.0," When it has done something similar in Iraq, once again militant groups like ISIS have"
833.0,834.0, taken over.
834.0,838.0," So when they do it without people in the institutions being there, it is very likely that the terrorist"
838.0,843.0," institutions come over and take over the job, no matter what the political will of the individual"
843.0,849.0," citizens in the front lines are. Third, the institutional structures of COVID-19 was also a source of massive"
849.0,854.0, infrastructure damage to these institutions because of which we see things like massive unemployment rates.
854.0,856.6, They have conceived with you that they are going to take away all of their MSCs.
856.6,861.0, I don't necessarily see all the economic infrastructure supporting these regions at that point of time.
861.0,863.4," Then moving on to more of their economic rebuttals, right?"
863.4,868.0, They tell you that one of the major problems with CFA franc is that they don't have autonomy over their currency.
868.0,873.0, While we can see to a certain degree that sovereignty in terms of where people are able to conceive their monetary
873.0,877.0," exchange rates is important, we think that what is more important for them is to ensure that number one,"
877.0,882.0, they don't have a liquid crisis and we've seen that a liquid crisis has a liquid crisis on his or on the CFE franc
882.0,887.76, and number two that there isn't hyperinflation. Because we think that the hyperinflation happening is the most likely piece
887.76,892.32," when CFA-France countries opt out of the CFA-France system, right?"
892.32,898.92," Now, let's talk about what are the harms in the position, in the context of when a France would exist."
898.92,901.36," Which, for example, to visualize what the French exit would look like."
901.36,905.46, We think that France's exit from West Africa has been drastic and it will continue to be drastic.
905.46,907.26, This is the exit that we have to support.
907.26,910.76, Look at what happened after the coup over United States president in July 2020.
910.76,914.3, France literally left within two months without informing that any of the institutions were
914.3,916.3, in move to deliver the aftermath of their own mess.
916.3,921.3," Which is to say that when this drastic and staggered exit happens, it's going to create"
921.3,927.0," a security vacuum and these countries are going to be forced to turn to the worst defenders like Russia, like China."
927.0,931.0, And we think that this is the worst possible thing that we have to put everything into context of this.
931.0,934.0," Now, why do we think that we can die in the arms of this?"
934.0,939.0," We think that the arms of this are most probably going to be like a refugee crisis, like regional instability and black people dying."
939.0,945.0," The reason this is so important is that if you look at the capital, you will realise that their borders are very important."
945.0,948.0, Which is to say that all issues are transnational issues.
948.0,952.0," If an issue exists in Burkina Faso, it is also going to go to Mali, it is also going to go to Nigeria."
952.0,960.0, Which is to say that all of these transnational nations have the ability to object to large degree of individuals very quickly and take the entire region to a degree that has never been seen before.
960.0,968.0," We also think that when investors like China want to get access to these regions, we think"
968.0,970.0, that they are unlikely to care about the security threats.
970.0,972.0, Why is this so crucially important?
972.0,975.0," Because like I tell you, there is a large degree of individuals who are becoming number"
975.0,978.0," one in space, number two they are losing their lives, number three they are becoming injured"
978.0,981.0, because of the fact that security threats from militant groups exist.
981.0,987.0, We think that France exclusively has a responsibility to ensure that these military groups are established
987.0,990.0, but other individuals like China do not have this incentive.
990.0,993.0," Because if you look at what China has done in Pakistan, you will come to realise that"
993.0,997.0, China only really cares about these security threats when it is a threat directly to their
997.0,999.0," investments, not when it is a threat to the citizens."
999.0,1003.0, Which is to say that France has a better incentive and we have proven that to you both propositionally.
1004.0,1011.2, France stole from West Africa. France continues to benefit from what it steals from West Africa
1011.2,1016.56, and the colonial structures that they instilled within West African countries during that colonial
1016.56,1023.12, era. We think that it is not enough for them to just simply pay reparations. West African people
1023.12,1025.16, do not want them to pay reparations.
1025.16,1032.8, They want them to exit West Africa altogether. So proud to propose.
1032.8,1036.68," In my speech I would like to know a couple of things. Firstly, I would like to clear up what the likely"
1036.68,1042.6," comparative of this debate is. Secondly, clear up our principle of argument. Thirdly, talk about"
1042.6,1046.1," security. And lastly, the economy. But firstly, on the"
1046.1,1051.28, likely comparative. What did the opposition side try to tell you in this debate? Opposition
1051.28,1057.32," side tried to claim that there are basically three comparatives in this debate. Firstly,"
1057.32,1063.62," very largely under democratic military regimes, secondly, the Wagner group, and lastly, China."
1064.24,1066.16," Let us take down each and every single one of them. Firstly, on the Wagner Group, and lastly China. Let us take down each and every single"
1066.16,1071.76," one of them. Firstly, on the corrupt military regimes that they wanted to talk about. They"
1071.76,1077.0," provided, the only mechanism that they provided for these regimes being corrupt is the fact"
1077.0,1081.58," that, oh, there are examples. But sure, we can get there are other counter-examples in"
1081.58,1085.0," Senegal or Cote d'Ivoire, but lots of citizens support this."
1085.0,1091.0," So let's just not play an example table tennis, right? Let's just actually mechanize the reasons"
1091.0,1098.0, why these military regimes are likely to be beneficial for the citizens. We provided to you a host of
1098.0,1104.0," unresponded to mechanisms from our first speaker, why these military regimes are likely to be democratic."
1104.0,1109.68," It is because the citizens want democratic rule. It is because these military regimes in and of themselves,"
1109.68,1116.24," their sole goal was to take down the largely undemocratic, really powerful French regimes."
1116.24,1122.48," And secondly, we already told you that these military regimes have to remain in power because"
1122.48,1125.0, there are lots of coups and terrorists in the region.
1125.0,1131.0," What that means is that they don't want their civilians to turn against them and go to these military coups and go to these terrorists,"
1131.0,1138.0, which means that there is a huge democratic incentive for them to actually cater to the interests of their own people.
1138.0,1144.0," So the implication of this is that these undemocrats, so-called undemocratic regimes that they talked about,"
1144.0,1147.24, still do cater to the incentives of the people.
1147.62,1148.56, France doesn't.
1148.82,1152.86," But secondly, on the Wagner group, again, let's not play example tanks."
1153.5,1159.26, Let's just recognize why Wagner is not likely to take over these countries to a huge extent.
1159.26,1162.16, We think that they do not have the incentive or the capacity.
1162.58,1165.04," Firstly, they do not have the incentive or the capacity. Firstly, they do not have the incentive"
1165.04,1167.36, to militarily take over the regions.
1167.36,1170.48, We think that a lot of countries in West Africa
1170.48,1172.66, already have somewhat amicable relations
1172.66,1174.16, with Russia and the West Coast.
1174.16,1176.38, What that means is that Russia and Wagner
1176.38,1180.1, doesn't really need to militarily take over these countries.
1180.1,1183.22, They don't need to march in there and kill all civilians
1183.22,1185.6, in order for them to maintain friendly relations.
1185.6,1193.1," But secondly, we think that Wagner simply does not have the capacity to swarm in and enforce largely strict democratic rule."
1193.1,1197.1, Because look at what Wagner is doing right now in other parts of the world.
1197.1,1202.1," Wagner is literally fighting in Ukraine, he's fighting on fronts in Syria and the Middle East."
1202.1,1210.0, We think that it's incredibly unlikely that Wagner will just march in with all these high-technology weapons and be able to suppress the people.
1210.0,1215.5, We think that that's simply unlikely characterization. No thank you. But even if they say they do
1215.5,1220.0," have the capacity, we think that, well, if they do have the capacity to fight multiple"
1220.0,1228.46," fights at the same time, we think that these, like the Wagner group, would have taken down these French regimes in the first place, regardless, irregardless of whether"
1228.46,1233.26," France existed or not. We think that this is largely symmetric. But that being said,"
1233.42,1239.28," on the economy, no, sorry, on China, we think that they largely mischaracterized China,"
1239.38,1243.98, right? They said that China really doesn't care about the security of these West African
1243.98,1246.5," nations. But now, how does this knife their own case? Because they said that China really doesn't care about the security of these West African nations. But not how this knives their own case,"
1246.68,1249.68, because they said that China will come into these West African countries
1249.68,1251.4," because they have economic incentives,"
1251.66,1253.82, because they want to develop infrastructure in China.
1254.04,1257.58," If that is so true, then we think that China has a huge incentive"
1257.58,1260.76, to make sure that these economic companies and the Chinese companies
1260.76,1264.06, that they put in West Africa are protected to a great extent.
1264.3,1269.04, We think that China will care about security and China will ensure security.
1269.04,1274.7," But we say that even if that doesn't stand, we think, no, we say that does stand,"
1274.7,1279.8, but we say that also China doesn't have an incentive to exploit people on that side of the world.
1279.8,1290.0, I don't. Because we say that China doesn't have an incentive because the reason why they appeal to these West African countries is because they want to be different from France.
1290.0,1293.0, They want to appeal to these West African countries and be a beacon of hope for them.
1293.0,1297.0, That they're different from the exploits of French companies that exploited them.
1297.0,1305.0," So by showing that they are not colonizers but rather trading partners, we think that they can largely win their trust."
1305.0,1309.0," So secondly, we think that China has an incentive to gather lots of regional partnerships."
1309.0,1313.0," At the point to which China wants to gain influence in other regions, like North and South Africa,"
1313.0,1327.44," we think that China wants to use West Africa as a bargaining chip and set a precedent for other countries to want to invite China inside their own countries. But lastly, they tried to say that France doesn't really have an incentive to, you know,"
1327.44,1332.96, exploit these West African countries. But we think that this is largely not true. We think that they
1332.96,1337.68," do have the incentive to exploit West African countries because they've pre-established, like,"
1337.68,1342.48, dominance over all of their other industries. What that means is that they really implicitly exploit
1342.48,1348.8," a lot of that workers through really exploitative contracts work history, really exploit specific contracts that we're not able to see on a global stage."
1348.8,1356.4," Even if we are able to see them, French citizens really do not care about what happens in West Africa and they're not held accountable."
1356.4,1362.88," But secondly then, on principle, they told us that the principle of theft, you can just pay reparations, right?"
1362.88,1367.2, We think that this is simply ridiculous. We think that we can still pay reparations on our side.
1367.66,1370.2," Our claim is that just because you reparate,"
1370.28,1373.62, that does not mean you can still stay inside those West African countries.
1373.84,1375.9," On our side, you can still exit West Africa"
1375.9,1378.56, and still continue to trade with West African countries.
1378.56,1382.58, You can still aid these West African countries to a significant extent
1382.58,1385.36," with just the same amount as any other country. We think that that is enough, and at the point in which West African countries to a significant extent, but just the same amount as any other country."
1385.36,1390.4," We think that that is enough, and at the point at which West African citizens do not want France to pay reparations"
1390.4,1395.28," and want France to simply exit, we think that we should respect what West African citizens want."
1395.28,1405.0," Secondly, on security then. We are willing to bring forward a constructive argument that will basically deal with all of our security arguments."
1405.0,1412.0," We think that yes, although it is true that France has been able to temporarily, in a very short time, in 2010, decrease the number of terrorists,"
1412.0,1417.0," we think that over time they have increased terrorism by a thousand percent, which has been proven."
1417.0,1430.0," What they have failed to understand is that France, that the presence of France is actually the catalyst to increasing terrorism and increasing coups. Here are the reasons why. First here, we think why does the presence of France worsen"
1430.0,1434.0, regional stability? We think that this is because both terrorist groups and military
1434.0,1439.0, groups weaponize anti-French sentiment in the outing of the war to orchestrate terrorist attacks and coups.
1439.0,1446.0, The reason why anti-French sentiment is a unique mobiliser of this support is because it is a universal concern
1446.0,1450.8, for all West African citizens to experience on a daily basis. When their wages are mega and when
1450.8,1455.6," they see French soldiers on the street, they have this anti-French sentiment. But secondly, why does"
1455.6,1460.16," the absence of France improve this regional stability then? We think that in the absence of France,"
1460.16,1464.88," terrorist groups and military groups will not and cannot hold this trade, large-scale demonstrations"
1464.88,1466.0, and large-scale violence.
1466.0,1474.0, Not that terrorism is whose intensely hot to do. It requires mass mobilization of people and it requires insane amounts of commitment.
1474.0,1481.0," We think that it's not something that a light and casual citizen is likely to do unless you have this fire-and-aggression site,"
1481.0,1490.0, which we only get where France is in these countries. Unique tipping point that France's existence creates is that the massive incentive to cause terror diminishes.
1490.0,1495.0," When France exits, no one wants to participate in these coup d'etats anymore because they are happy,"
1495.0,1497.0, because they are satisfied with their military regime.
1497.0,1501.0," Because we have proven on all levels why we are superior, so proud to be part of the state."
1501.0,1508.56," The reason side proposition loses today's debate is because they have been extremely uncooperative and though they call us out for using facts, I think they largely use"
1508.56,1512.06," a lot of assertions to generally characterize actors like China and Russia as well, and"
1512.06,1514.32, in my speech I will be filling all of those points.
1514.32,1518.02," They claim that they have solved all of the problems in West Africa, but in reality they"
1518.02,1520.18, turned it into a wasteland that caused the solution.
1520.18,1521.68, We have seen people run away.
1521.68,1523.18, But let me go into the first part of my speech.
1523.18,1527.0," Firstly, just on the strategy, what are the first off and second off, then I'm going to go into like four main classes."
1527.0,1532.0," First terrorism, second economics, thirdly good governance, and then compared to all of this I'm going to be clear with the rest of them."
1532.0,1535.0," Firstly, let's look at our first process. This year two things."
1535.0,1540.0," The first thing they say is after France exits, these West African nations will get what they want."
1540.0,1551.0, Their analysis here is lackluster because that is where they leave their analysis. They tell us they don't get good governance because military chantas are what these democratically motivated people want.
1551.0,1557.0," I think that's just an analysis on its own because military chantas will get in historically, not just as an example ping pong,"
1557.0,1560.0, because that's what it is. They want to consolidate power.
1560.0,1564.0, I'll give you further reasons on why Russia and China have incentives to keep these militaries in power.
1564.0,1566.0, Because I think their response was not enough.
1566.0,1568.0, But what is the last thing that they see in their speech?
1568.0,1571.0, They say that France continues to exploit West Africa.
1571.0,1575.0," We think that if we engage with their principle directly, they need to prove to us two main"
1575.0,1576.0, things for us to understand.
1576.0,1580.0," Firstly, if death is their principle, they need to show to us why death stops happening"
1580.0,1584.0," on their side of the house because even if death as a principle exists independently,"
1584.0,1588.0," we think if their side also has death, they have little mutual care and benefit or principle benefit"
1588.0,1592.0," to begin with. But secondly, on poetry and autonomy, we think that's also something that"
1592.0,1596.0," is comparative, it doesn't completely go away. When we think of France, we think author-actors"
1596.0,1600.0, have greater purpose in this to come to these features more and we'll move to that in my
1600.0,1604.0," future study. But second, all those variables gives you a lot of structural reasons. I didn't"
1604.0,1606.0, tell you what is the likely comparative and they give us three reasons but they largely
1606.0,1609.0, only deal with the fact of why undemocratic regimes are not likely to be there.
1609.0,1610.0, They say a few things.
1610.0,1612.0, They say this is a ping pong line.
1612.0,1615.0," Example, ping pong support therefore is also something that we can go for."
1615.0,1619.0, I think that's a very poor response but secondly their structural reasons are also fun enough here.
1619.0,1621.0, They say military regimes are democratic.
1621.0,1622.0, No.
1622.0,1625.34," Wagner Group and China has a consenting to control them for profit. They say we already have soft power but what is interesting is. No, Wagner Group and China has a consent to control them for profit."
1625.34,1627.1," Basically, we already have soft power."
1627.1,1629.4, But what is interesting is that if the Wagner Group
1629.4,1631.76, is something that has assisted many military groups
1631.76,1633.42," in Niger and Mabin Bukina Faso,"
1633.42,1635.62," historically these, like, militant groups"
1635.62,1637.38, have been hired by these military conductors
1637.38,1639.98, to order for them to go and take over these forms
1639.98,1642.44," of governments, and they already have a lot of power"
1642.44,1644.06," over these countries, things like Wabi-Land"
1644.06,1647.0, or even hyperdependence on these security groups of production because if they
1647.0,1650.0," step out, they're not going to have possession anymore."
1650.0,1653.0," We think then, due to these unique structures, they're uniquely able to create situations"
1653.0,1655.0, where they want to exploit these resources.
1655.0,1660.0," They want these military leaders to be empowered because if democracy as a comparative exists,"
1660.0,1664.0, they're going to have to bypass the public sentiment which in most instances or every
1664.0,1666.0, instance let's be realistic is going to be against bypass the public sentiment which in most instances or every instance let's be realistic
1666.0,1669.0, is going to be against the profit incentive that Russia and China have.
1669.0,1673.0, So their comparative one with Russia already as a common power is something that is unlikely.
1673.0,1678.0," If they just wanted like allies and international allies, they would probably not even say the war groups in the first place"
1678.0,1681.0, or they would probably call for even other more likely for rich people.
1681.0,1683.0, We don't really see their comparative views.
1683.0,1685.0," But lastly they say, well even even if they want to fight,"
1685.0,1689.0," and if they have the structure reasons to fight, they won't because they're already fighting wars in Ukraine."
1689.0,1694.0, The unique reason they would still do that is because this exploitation of France helps them fight those fights.
1694.0,1699.0, Uranium in these regions are used by these groups to manufacture things like atomic bombs.
1699.0,1703.0, Other minerals can be used to manufacture weapons. Wagner is not just a military group.
1703.0,1709.0," They have permeated all the different spheres of the economy, society and other such things, creating unique benefits for themselves."
1709.0,1714.0," Their reasoning is not enough. But lastly, they tell us, we knife ourselves because China doesn't care about these countries, it's false."
1714.0,1728.32," Historically, the way China permeates these countries is they obtain specific resources in very important military locations, very important geological standards. But this means that they are only likely to defend those very standards, as compared to"
1728.32,1733.12," France, who probably has a greater incentive to control the economics and the violence"
1733.12,1736.4," in the strater region, because again, they have a lot of economic incentives in the greater"
1736.4,1737.52, LECs.
1737.52,1739.92, We think they are compared to the severe ill-advanced.
1739.92,1744.16," And we have historical precedence for that, because China historically, in places like"
1744.16,1746.72," Pakistan, I showed you, but even if there is a story"
1746.72,1748.52," like violence everywhere, they still only care"
1748.52,1750.12, about their specific infrastructure.
1750.12,1752.12, They need to give us analysis on why that example
1752.12,1754.24," doesn't work, they're just saying this example"
1754.24,1757.8, doesn't really give you enough to trade off
1757.8,1758.64, on the practice.
1758.64,1760.58," Therefore, we can get their contentious up to this point"
1760.58,1763.08, as it's been something that is largely untrue.
1763.08,1764.28," Let's go on to the classic thing,"
1764.28,1765.0, and let's compare the increase.
1765.0,1766.0, Terrorism.
1766.0,1769.0, They think that's increased a thousand percent since France's coming.
1769.0,1773.0," We don't necessarily see what the structural reasons are for that, we think that's simply an assertion."
1773.0,1779.0, But what is key to note is that France has been one of the only actors who are invested in ballistic defense against terrorism in the region.
1779.0,1784.0," We don't think that the UN would probably have an incentive on either side, but here's why French involvement really matters."
1784.0,1791.0," Firstly, regional cooperation. France has historically worked in ways that promotes cooperation between these countries through mechanisms like the G5-7."
1791.0,1798.0," With French influence, we have an added incentive for entities like the EU and Germany that have also historically been involved in these regions through mechanisms of French alliances."
1798.0,1801.0," Thirdly, Russia and China are unlikely to care as much. Why?"
1801.0,1807.0," Number one, China only defends their limited infrastructure that exists in strategic locations and we have already moved on to your strategic thing, but I will also give you examples for it."
1807.0,1810.0," Secondly, Wahab and Hood has a history of leaving countries in trouble."
1810.0,1814.0," In Mozambique, for example, they simply gave up an accident when they couldn't deal with the military"
1814.0,1817.0," shotless anymore, who with triple guerrilla tactics were able to overpower them."
1817.0,1819.0, So we clearly don't see what their comparative here is.
1819.0,1822.0," But lastly, we need to look at the human impact of terrorism."
1822.0,1825.6, Millions of people in these African regions have their homes plundered.
1825.6,1827.76, They have their crops destroyed by jihadi terrorists
1827.76,1830.0, who think that they do not follow the Muslim ideals.
1830.0,1831.88, They destroy their idols that are culturally significant
1831.88,1833.48," to them, they destroy societies."
1833.48,1834.8," They have no point in their cases,"
1834.8,1836.26," through whose speeches, deal with this,"
1836.26,1837.88," we think the lives of these people matter,"
1837.88,1839.3, therefore they lose simply on this.
1839.3,1840.28, Let's weigh this then.
1840.28,1841.36," In our worst case scenario,"
1841.36,1843.48, we agree that France probably has some control.
1843.48,1847.12," On a comparative, on this simple class meeting we think many more people are losing their lives,"
1847.12,1851.28," families, and the things that matter to them the most, crops and all such things because of terrorism."
1851.28,1854.88," We think even if you weigh these things, we already are on sort of like a winning streak,"
1854.88,1857.68, but I would say two other classes before that I think would be wise to go.
1857.68,1863.36," If large-scale violence happens in these West African countries, Chinese factories are harmed,"
1863.36,1865.0," Chinese companies are harmed, Chinese companies are hung, Chinese"
1865.0,1871.0, employees are hung. Why do you think that China has no incentive to protect these countries?
1871.0,1875.0, You need to understand that the comparison in saving and protecting a particular region
1875.0,1879.0, versus saving and protecting a single dam or a single company is something that is very
1879.0,1883.0," very stark, needing to show to us why China would care for all of these different regions"
1883.0,1887.0, instead of caring for their specific infrastructure. We'll show you why they would like to do that in
1887.0,1888.0, most instances.
1888.0,1889.0," Secondly then, economics."
1889.0,1891.0," They simply ignore France's impact, right?"
1891.0,1894.0," First thing we tell you, there are a lot of MNCs that employ hundreds of thousands of"
1894.0,1895.0, people in these regions.
1895.0,1899.0," With the French exit, it is likely that these MNCs are too going to exit."
1899.0,1902.0," Even if they don't directly exit, which they already concede by the way, we think"
1902.0,1904.0," they are gradually, eventually going to exit."
1904.0,1905.98," Additionally, NGOs that function in West Africa"
1905.98,1907.28, that are primarily funded by France
1907.28,1908.56, are also likely to exit.
1908.56,1910.14," Thirdly, on the CFE France,"
1910.14,1911.8," they say this means that they are not able to trade,"
1911.8,1913.18, but they don't give us a comparative.
1913.18,1915.4," Things like the ECOWAS are very, very unlikely to work."
1915.4,1916.22, Why?
1916.22,1917.88, Because this leads to large foreign exchange implications
1917.88,1918.72," because they are that,"
1918.72,1920.24, they really do not have precedent
1920.24,1921.16," for their currency being strong,"
1921.16,1922.64, so foreign exchange is going to be a problem.
1922.64,1923.92," But secondly, look at the military"
1923.92,1925.68, that has ignited earlier in Burkina Faso.
1925.68,1927.0, They literally go away from ICOs.
1927.0,1930.16, They create iso-externally economic tactics within these military regimes
1930.16,1933.48," in order for more populist progressives, which means that they already say bye-bye."
1933.48,1934.68, But Russian and Chinese do that.
1934.68,1937.08," As I was going to explain, my staff at the four largest economies,"
1937.08,1940.56," Niger, Qatar, Ivory Coast, and Senegal, already owe big debts to China."
1940.56,1943.24," Ivory Coast, for example, owes 10% of its external debts to China"
1943.24,1948.08," compared to the other financial loans, which is only 7%. This just goes to show you historically, right, why actors like"
1948.08,1951.84," China is something that is very very harmful. On good governance then, they just claim that"
1951.84,1954.88, military jhanatas are something that is likely going to go away and they are likely to be
1954.88,1959.6," democratic. First, even military jhanatas by virtue are people that want to maintain power."
1959.6,1963.76," Secondly, when actors like the WAPT would actively have incentive in order for them to remain in"
1963.76,1967.0," power, we think they are unlikely to be democratic over the long run because again being democratic"
1967.0,1969.0, would mean direct loss for these people.
1969.0,1972.0," Lastly then, let's weigh all of this against their principle."
1972.0,1976.0," The first part of their principle is step, which is to say that if France exits, there"
1976.0,1978.0, are peace for nations exit.
1978.0,1981.0, We prove to you by these other countries that competing these nations are further going
1981.0,1982.0, to steal from you.
1982.0,1985.44," We agree that this is probably a principle that stands to some degree, but if you weigh"
1985.44,1988.88," it off against the harms that people face on the ground, we think this has no impact."
1988.88,1990.0," Second, autonomy."
1990.0,1993.76," We proved that Russia and China, through mechanisms like their traps and the Bunker Group, have"
1993.76,1997.12," more perverse incentives to create more control over these decisions, which means that they"
1997.12,1999.6, probably do not have actual autonomy on either side.
1999.6,2001.28," By this point, I think it's pretty clear."
2001.28,2004.96," They can't even solve all those problems, but all they're doing is leaving these places"
2004.96,2007.0," with no help. Therefore, vote toss."
2007.0,2015.0," Panel, let it not be lost on you how dire the situation is for Western African citizens."
2015.0,2019.0," Within that prison, they have to pull their country under a neo-colonial rule."
2019.0,2030.18," Their response to the principle argument we heard from their DLO was feeble and unrespectable, the fact that they say, oh, France should be able to stay and fix these problems flies in the"
2030.18,2034.62, face of the fact that thousands and millions of Western African citizens have denounced
2034.62,2039.88, France's exit and have counted the elect anti-French leaders and protested in front
2039.88,2040.78, of French embassies.
2040.98,2045.0," For decades, they've traded their bodies in Congress for greater autonomy and"
2045.0,2050.0," dignity, and French presence in and of itself is an unjustifiable thing to do."
2050.0,2051.0, I want to talk about four things.
2051.0,2054.0," First, on the comparative and what happens to the absence of France."
2054.0,2055.0," Secondly, on the political."
2055.0,2056.0," Thirdly, on the economy."
2056.0,2057.0," And lastly, on the narrative."
2057.0,2060.0," Firstly, let's talk about the comparative on this day."
2060.0,2063.0, I want to clarify that we are perfectly fine with forming bilateral trade agreements.
2063.0,2068.32, What we are against is the coercive power and military presence on our side of the house.
2068.32,2071.68, The first thing they say is that military uncertainties are going to arise.
2071.68,2075.12," If you actually look at their mechanism, the first thing they say is that, oh, this is"
2075.12,2075.76, already true.
2075.76,2078.8," The second thing is like, oh, it happened in Iraq, so it must happen now."
2078.8,2081.6," So their only mechanism is the third one, on unemployment."
2081.6,2088.4, But this is notably contingent on economies of the entire Senate. We tell you about how economy is actually one of the worst on the other side
2088.4,2092.18, of the house. I'll talk about that later. The second thing they say is a better mechanism.
2092.52,2097.2," In Dukhiya, I want to say, oh, this is historically true, but Russia and China can fund coups."
2097.32,2101.7," I have three responses here. One, they never approved the incentive of Russia and China,"
2101.7,2105.6," but one, they always fund this military side to begin with. But China, but one thing, they're always fun, this is like military side to begin with,"
2105.6,2107.14," but second of all, and more importantly,"
2107.14,2108.56, they never provide a capacity
2108.56,2110.42, of other China and Russia exists.
2110.42,2112.08," If we call it from the role of speech,"
2112.08,2113.96, that's why Russia already is invested
2113.96,2115.82," in places like Ukraine or Syria,"
2115.82,2117.7, which means that they have diminishing incentives
2117.7,2120.42, and a capacity to actually invest in those to begin with.
2120.42,2122.44," In China, if you wanna talk about that,"
2122.44,2124.92," their argument might have worked 10 years ago,"
2124.92,2129.5," but if you actually look at the real world, the Chinese DRI is substantially decreasing"
2129.5,2135.5, as time passes because of the internal debt crisis within China and the failed DRI investment
2135.5,2139.5," in Eastern Europe, for example, which has meant that they simply cannot just throw away"
2139.5,2140.5, examples of war strikes in China.
2140.5,2144.5," But third of all, I think that independently does not constitute a reason why military"
2144.5,2146.4, crews are going to gain power
2146.4,2153.4," insofar as countries like the United States of America or a lot of other Western countries have an incentive to gain democratic government,"
2153.4,2160.0, which means that it's up here to me why this military regime is going to actually increase on our side of the house.
2160.0,2165.44," But even if, to what extent, it is undemocratic or democratically weak, what we tell you from"
2165.44,2169.88, his vocal speech to no response was that in the context where there is military coups
2169.88,2174.32," were occurring everywhere, those democratically weak governments have an incentive to actually"
2174.32,2178.12, cater to the interests of its people because of the selfish incentive actually aligned
2178.12,2181.64," with the protection of their own government and their own position, right?"
2181.8,2186.76," Which is an unresponding characterization, which is why I think, to an extent,"
2186.76,2188.94, the imperative is not as good as they claim.
2188.94,2190.0," The second thing you see is that,"
2190.0,2191.94," oh, why is your group all going to come?"
2191.94,2194.1," To clarify, our claim wasn't necessarily to say"
2194.1,2195.34," we don't trade with Russia,"
2195.34,2196.3," but why wouldn't your group,"
2196.3,2198.44, wouldn't the military intervene or force?
2198.44,2200.44, We gave you three mechanisms which Roku sees
2200.44,2202.1, as to how they know how to access it
2202.1,2203.84, because they already have their relationship.
2203.84,2208.56, And going in militarily and the benefits simply already exist but secondly
2208.56,2212.8, on capacity and thirdly on symmetry I think that already exists.
2212.8,2214.88, Before I move on to the principal object of UI.
2214.88,2219.36," Okay, we agree that China, that the Lakhman Group, that France, how are these desperate"
2219.36,2223.04," countries with problems of immigration, with problems of economics, problems of other industries"
2223.04,2224.32, going to do the same?
2224.32,2227.12," Alright, I'm going to talk about that within a practical class,"
2227.12,2230.24," but let's now talk about the most important class, non-Christian people."
2230.24,2232.64," So, what we tell you from the first is really simple,"
2232.64,2237.48," that this best and French rule in the status quo is acquired unjustly,"
2237.48,2239.48, therefore we must give it back to these people.
2239.48,2242.48," Their response is, oh, and they're the god, like that,"
2242.48,2245.76," but then afterwards, don't these French people can say, right?"
2245.76,2248.8, Do you see how ahistorical and simply morally bad
2248.8,2250.1, this case actually is?
2250.1,2252.44," It's like I come into your room and I take your shoe,"
2252.44,2254.78," and because it doesn't fit you, it's fine that I didn't"
2254.78,2257.06," pick it, or that I have to actually buy back"
2257.06,2260.38," this better shoes for you, insofar as we're telling you"
2260.38,2262.62, that the individuals living in Western Africa
2262.62,2265.82, has been demanding that France must leave from its nation.
2265.82,2268.1, I think this is principally only legitimate
2268.1,2270.74, if France just gives back its land to its people.
2270.74,2273.22, We think this is independent of the practical outcome
2273.22,2275.62," afterward, which is why I think principle of theft"
2275.62,2278.22, and independency is going to win us the debate.
2278.22,2280.6," Secondly, let's talk about the economy."
2280.6,2282.42, I want to first flag in the beginning
2282.42,2287.12, that economy is more important than regional stability in Paris and the report's three main factors.
2287.12,2292.0," One, there is no moral distinction between people killed by terrorists and people who"
2292.0,2294.72," die due to hunger, therefore, at least neutral."
2294.72,2297.84," But second of all, I think hunger simply affects more people."
2297.84,2301.04," If you want to talk about the economy, it's like 10 million individuals who are living"
2301.04,2301.84, under poverty.
2301.84,2306.0," So third of all, I think there's less defense mechanism against people who,"
2306.0,2309.0, like if you compare between people who have a bomb
2309.0,2311.0," and just against poverty, right?"
2311.0,2314.0, I think it is much more difficult for you to defend against
2314.0,2316.0," people who are living under poverty, which is why I think"
2316.0,2319.0, our claim on the economy is significantly more important.
2319.0,2322.0," Given that, their claim here is that this new currency"
2322.0,2323.0, is going to be unstable.
2323.0,2324.0, I have two responses here.
2324.0,2327.0," One, stability in and of itself is never a benefit."
2327.0,2333.0," Because our thing was that, inherently, the CFA's rank is having a higher value,"
2333.0,2337.0," the radius is high to begin with, which does not match the local's desire."
2337.0,2342.0," Because, for example, the local desires, local individuals want to decrease their currency"
2342.0,2347.14," in order to increase the attractivity of their export, but you cannot do that. We simply cannot control their"
2347.14,2351.1," inheritance in an interest rate, which is why stability in the Netherlands is not a benefit."
2351.1,2355.44," But secondly, it's obvious to me that it is stable in the Netherlands, but it's just because France owned it"
2355.44,2359.74," does not mean that it is stable, because France themselves even isn't using this"
2359.74,2364.24," currency, right? It's only Western African citizens that are using the currency, which is why the"
2364.24,2367.0, margin of stability is not that enough in this city.
2367.0,2371.0," The second thing they say is that, oh, MNCs exist, but they never proved why these MNCs"
2371.0,2374.0, likely trickle down to local individuals.
2374.0,2377.0, What we told you from first to knowers' thoughts was that this exploitation exists.
2377.0,2380.0, Then I want to answer to their entirely and their key why.
2380.0,2385.16," I want to note, the reason why it is substantially better on R7 than Hull is that local individuals"
2385.16,2389.62," presumably would still have basic resources in the absence of private wealth, which means"
2389.62,2393.62, that they are likely able to use their local currency and export their resources for instance
2393.62,2397.76," because there is still a demand for those resources, let's say uranium and nitrogen"
2397.76,2398.76, for example.
2398.76,2403.88," Which is why on R7 and Hull, even if there is no MNCs or less MNCs, there is simply more"
2403.88,2405.5, number of trickle-down effects
2405.5,2406.5, on the market than there are.
2406.5,2408.5," Now, I want to weigh this idea of layers."
2408.5,2410.5, I want to do the weighing within the economy.
2410.5,2413.5, I think they cannot simply say that terrorism hurts the economy.
2413.5,2418.5, A currency presents the economy more than terrorism for a few different reasons.
2418.5,2421.5," Firstly, currency being too expensive is all the time."
2421.5,2424.5," In comparison, terrorism and conservancy is only in some times."
2424.5,2425.46," But secondly, terrorism strikes someancy is only in some times."
2425.46,2429.46," But secondly, terrorism strikes some industries that are strong, but currency affects every"
2429.46,2430.96, single aspect of your economy.
2430.96,2435.02," But third of all, costs of fighting against terrorism, like for instance rebuilding infrastructure"
2435.02,2439.66," or hiring workers in the process of it, does bring you back to benefits to the economy,"
2439.66,2444.0, all of which means that you simply cannot run a Hail Mary case from quit as to why terrorism
2444.0,2446.0, also connects to the worst economy.
2446.0,2450.0," Therefore, we think economy, independently, wins the debate, even under their practical"
2450.0,2451.0, touch.
2451.0,2452.0," Finally, let's talk about terrorism."
2452.0,2456.0, The first thing they say is that a retail cooperation with France can't happen.
2456.0,2460.0," But notice here, Canada, we tell you about how locals do not have the incentive to actually"
2460.0,2463.0," cooperate with France, which means that all of their benefits do not stand."
2463.0,2467.8," Secondly, our PLO have already suggested China and other Indian countries, or other Indian actors"
2467.8,2471.6," that come in, also wants to actually fight back against terrorism, insofar as they're"
2471.6,2476.0, sufficient and they actually protect their own economic benefits over the climate fighting
2476.0,2477.0, back against terrorism.
2477.0,2481.4," But finally, I want to point out that their other third argument is entirely on this quantity"
2481.4,2485.6, about how individuals uniquely have an incentive to fight or join the terrorism
2485.6,2488.0, when they have an active anger against friends.
2488.0,2491.2, And they are not simply someone who wants to do anything.
2491.2,2496.1," There are individuals who have their daily lives, they have an individual who are actually working,"
2496.1,2500.2, they only go in when there's a high anger against people.
2500.2,2505.4, Which is why the incentive to actually go into terrorism uniquely exists more on the other side of the house.
2505.4,2507.9," For all those reasons, he just has to anticipate."
2507.9,2510.9, They needed a wasteland and called it peace.
2510.9,2515.4, They tell you that France's presence was exploitative and colonial in nature
2515.4,2519.6," and because of it, many arms were perpetrated throughout West Africa."
2519.6,2521.1, We do conceive with this.
2521.1,2523.9, But the moment in time they say that they are going to leave
2523.9,2527.0, and leave behind an institutional shock that has permanently
2527.0,2534.0," damaged everyone's lives in those countries, we tell you that we vehemently oppose that and that cannot be justified."
2534.0,2538.0, On that ground we introduce this debate. Let's talk about three things that happened in this debate.
2538.0,2549.0," Firstly, the wishy-washy principle that they bring up and let's completely weigh that with our principle of resolution. Secondly, the geopolitical consequences that would ensue as a result of this and thirdly,"
2549.0,2553.0, the exit process and let's look at an economic perspective within that.
2553.0,2558.0," So, firstly then, on principle, let's look at what both sides can see firstly."
2558.0,2562.0," We tell you that, both sides tell you that there has been economic consequences because"
2562.0,2565.12," people are devastated because of institutional shocks,"
2565.12,2570.24," for example. Political consequences, military consequences because of how authoritarian regimes"
2570.24,2574.24, have been controlled in France and so on and so forth. Social consequences because our
2574.24,2581.04, French has tangled its French culture and neo-colonialist incentives within the French
2581.04,2586.68, population. We agree on all of this. We also agree that West Africa ought to get something out of France
2586.68,2591.32, because they owe something to West Africa. But the world does not run on ideologies.
2591.64,2596.18, They tell you that France steals from Africa constantly. They tell you that France cannot steal anymore.
2596.18,2602.42," And therefore, the best option is just to leave everything after they have stolen multiple thousands of dollars,"
2602.66,2605.76, dozens and trillions of dollars from African nations.
2605.76,2607.96," It is worse when others come in and steal,"
2607.96,2610.22," especially if they do not have, firstly,"
2610.22,2612.6," cultural and currency-related ties,"
2612.6,2615.02, that is things like CFA-Franc to ensure that
2615.02,2617.8, France has an active incentive not to destabilize
2617.8,2622.1," the economy so much that it affects its trading validity,"
2622.1,2623.8," accepted by the international forum,"
2623.8,2626.24," but also secondly, economic and cultural ties"
2626.24,2628.52, that have been built throughout the course of history
2628.52,2629.84, and that is so hard to take back
2629.84,2633.38, because a lot of incentives of both parties involved
2633.38,2636.88, in this exist in multiple different forms.
2636.88,2640.16, Our version of reparation versus their version of reparation
2640.16,2643.36, tells you a funny thing about what they believe in.
2643.36,2646.64," They tell you that simply because they were sitting, they are today."
2646.64,2650.32," We tell you that it is the worst time to leave right now because there is one,"
2650.32,2654.8," an impending refugee crisis with 11,000 killed just recently."
2654.8,2658.24," Second, a massive security crisis that looms over these people."
2658.24,2662.16," Thirdly, there's a supply crisis in the supply chains that surround these countries."
2662.16,2667.1," And fourthly, COVID-19 has left an irreparable institutional shock in the short term,"
2667.1,2670.5, which France ought to help West Africa recover from.
2670.5,2673.32, The only word in which trying to exist
2673.32,2675.4," as West Africa is justifiable,"
2675.4,2678.0," is justified to support,"
2678.0,2679.82, is the word in which two things happen.
2679.82,2682.86," One, if Africa has recovered from the liquidity crisis"
2682.86,2688.0, and the institutional shock and the unemployment rates that has ensued as a result of a lot of...
2688.0,2689.0, No.
2689.0,2697.0, 2. If the military is truly stabilized after then say the G5-5 efforts come together and form true stability within the region.
2697.0,2700.0," They tell you that simply because they steal, they have to leave."
2700.0,2706.0, I don't see a reason why we should care about this in this debate and therefore we just think that they are lost on principle.
2706.0,2710.0," If they push that, that is the most important question in this debate. I don't see how it is."
2710.0,2728.0," What happens even in our worst case is better. First, we get it that you get economic stability because France always wants to ensure that its pegged value to its currency, to the CFA franc, is always seen as legitimate by the international forum so that they get more funding, they get more appraisal from the community and so on and so forth."
2728.0,2735.0," But secondly, there is an actively anti-junta sentiment within the French government."
2735.0,2745.94," That is to say that firstly, it did not recognize the EGF, for example, when the junta was able to capture the whole nation. But secondly, it has an actively democratic agenda that China"
2745.94,2748.06," and Russia, the worst of actors"
2748.06,2750.14," in this debate, don't have. For example,"
2750.44,2751.98, that means they always want to maintain
2751.98,2754.14, a level of democracy and show to the world
2754.14,2755.8, that they are democratic to an extent
2755.8,2758.16, which they do not have with agenda forces.
2758.54,2760.28," Secondly then, on geopolitical"
2760.28,2763.16, consequences. They tell you that
2763.16,2763.96, there are no
2763.96,2767.0, mechanisms for why China and Russia seem interested.
2767.0,2774.0," We already told you in our first speech three reasons each for why that is the case. When France exists, China and Russia"
2774.0,2780.0," intervene and we... Let's look at China, three reasons. One, it is already evident in the military base they own in Djibouti."
2780.0,2785.44," To monitor the port, they would have to get more influence within the region and that is more strategic for them."
2785.44,2786.44, They ignore this.
2786.44,2790.94," Second, we tell you that the Belt and Road Initiative wants to expand actively because"
2790.94,2795.28," that is the economic strategy of China for the next, I don't know, 50 years."
2795.28,2799.88," But thirdly, they want access to uranium and bromine or deposits that they tell you France"
2799.88,2800.88, has been stealing from.
2800.88,2802.88, China also wants to do the same thing.
2802.88,2809.76," But now they do not have an incentive to stabilize the region. Russia, three things also which has already happened."
2809.76,2822.2," One, militant control by selling arms to the Wagner Group. I don't know why in this debate there comes up a point where they try to push that the Wagner Group is not interested in selling arms to these people when they have already decided to do so."
2822.2,2826.0, Imagine what happens when France builds a vacuum within these regions.
2826.0,2831.0," They come in and actively give them arms because the moment it ends, the France stops supplying all of these."
2831.0,2839.0," The only source they get is the poor in Russia. But secondly, they want to get the South Paralympic because it's a very strategic location."
2839.0,2847.0," To the north you have Europe, to the east you have the Middle East. There's a lot of other reasons as well like natural resources and the Gulf of Guinea"
2847.0,2850.0, becoming a very strategic location for global trade.
2850.0,2855.0, We tell you then that when we compare the France influence on our side versus the
2855.0,2862.0," Russo-China influence, we get far more benefits and they give a lot of hands that they need to show"
2862.0,2865.6, why it does not happen. They cannot simply assert that it does not happen.
2865.6,2871.04," We tell you four things under this. One, France has something to lose. The currency pegging, for example,"
2871.04,2877.6, China and Russia do not. China only wants to expand economically. Russia only wants to expand militarily.
2877.6,2882.72," These do not coincide. They do not balance each other. Second, France is more accepted by the"
2882.72,2886.0, international community than undemocratic Russia and China.
2886.0,2892.0," So there is likely going to be scrutiny over this. That means when at a time when Russia is so politically active,"
2892.0,2900.0," this Western scrutiny that is imposed upon China and Russia within these regions put into a lot of skirmishing in the region,"
2900.0,2910.0," which is devastating for the institutions and the people over there. But thirdly, the alternatives that they pose, that they have in the most likely case, are more coercive."
2910.0,2916.0, Because China just wants to propagate an economic debt that spirals in the countries.
2916.0,2923.0," And secondly, Russia just wants to create a military debt law because that is the most profitable model"
2923.0,2925.16, in the instance where there are people engaged
2925.16,2927.16, for the geography of the scale.
2927.16,2928.34," Yes, your Peter."
2928.34,2930.86," You say France wants to give back, right?"
2930.86,2932.86," But opposition defends its stance, both."
2932.86,2935.02, We thought that France was actively exploiting.
2935.02,2937.12, It was simply an assertion for them to see
2937.12,2939.3, that France will help in the future.
2939.3,2940.84, We have told you why it's helping.
2940.84,2942.8, The G5 side is a literal example.
2942.8,2944.5, I don't think I can make a nice fact
2944.5,2948.0," that are already apparent in the world. I if you want mechanisms, I've already given"
2948.0,2953.0," you the CFI fact for example, where France is actively stabilising the region, actively"
2953.0,2958.0, going through the democratic process of removing the Jain juntas and not accepting them within
2958.0,2963.0," the region. They tell you only one thing, that you will be posed with more choices,"
2963.0,2966.7," that more choices is good, this maximizes the autonomy."
2966.7,2968.7, We tell you that this is wrong on two levels.
2968.7,2972.7," One, they tell you, they concede to the fact that people have anti-friend sentiments."
2972.7,2977.1, So people are likely to think anything is better. This does not necessarily give them a bargaining chip.
2977.1,2981.7," But secondly, it's wrong because actors like USA don't have vested interest in the region."
2981.7,2989.52," Because maybe they're too busy caring about the side of South China Sea. The UN's view is overshadowed by other words in the region,"
2989.52,2990.84, like Gaza and Israel.
2990.84,2992.9," There's only a false sense of bargaining chip,"
2992.9,2995.04, and we think that in the case that proposition
2995.04,2997.54, has not shown to us what are the active benefits
2997.54,3000.56," of exiting the region, how West Africa is going to recover,"
3000.56,3003.06," and in the void of the principle that is the wishy-washy,"
3003.06,3008.3," why are they going to improve the region's civility, we tell you that we want this debate clearly, the vote is still"
3008.3,3009.3, for opposition. Thank you.
3009.3,3015.3," If we evaluate the status quo with an objective sense, you will come to realize that there"
3015.3,3021.3," is one true beneficiary when France exits, and it is not West Africa, it is France, which"
3021.3,3025.0, is why we vehemently oppose the fact that it is exiting from the very problems
3025.0,3030.0, that it has created without positing a solution when it is its principal responsibility to
3030.0,3034.0, ensure that NAPS is mutually backed up. We think that NAPS has been taking active steps
3034.0,3038.0, in order to ensure that this solution becomes actualised under the status quo and we have
3038.0,3042.0, proven that through our three speeches. I am going to start with this reply by telling
3042.0,3047.0, you concretely what our path has been within the context of this debate was.
3047.0,3055.0," We told you that what was most important for West Africa was that the lives of people on the ground who are currently suffering,"
3055.0,3062.0," who are currently dying at the hands of jihadi extremists, these are the individuals, these are the vulnerable stakeholders whose lives need to be better."
3062.0,3068.0," At the very least they deserve a chance to live, that is the bare minimum and Francis at least giving them that because these other"
3068.0,3072.0," stakeholders could not bother to care about this, right?"
3072.0,3076.0, We told you that this was more important than a sense of principle justice for a few different
3076.0,3080.0, reasons and that is the first clash. First the other principle then in terms of is it
3080.0,3089.0," really important to consider the principle choice of these individuals. We think that although to a certain degree it is important to concede that their principal choice matters,"
3089.0,3093.0," we think that at this current point in time, it should be deprioritized."
3093.0,3098.0," There is a few reasons for this. In my speech, I gave you four reasons for why it is the worst time to exit."
3098.0,3101.0," Because of these very four reasons, we need to see this happen."
3101.0,3109.84," First, we think that these individuals don't really know what they're asking for, right? Which is to say that their apparent consent is not present."
3109.98,3112.68, They don't really know the consequences of the choice that they're trying to make.
3112.92,3117.48," Second of all, we also think that their choice is actually brainwashed by the Russian and"
3117.48,3121.38, Chinese propaganda that has infiltrated the ecosystem of these West African nations.
3121.6,3127.02," Which is to say that even if they are making that choice, they really don't know what the consequences of those choices are"
3127.02,3128.14, or where that choice stems from.
3128.22,3129.28, That is not a true choice.
3129.38,3131.64, That is just being brave and not knowing the consequences
3131.64,3134.28," of all the ramifications, all the things that you opt into."
3134.58,3136.5, Which is why we think that their principle doesn't stand
3136.5,3137.64, within the context of this debate.
3137.88,3139.36, Why is our principle much better?
3139.62,3142.9, Because we think that our principle deals with what is to be prioritised
3142.9,3144.24, at this current point in time.
3144.46,3149.0," What are those things? First, economic, second, security. These are the next two questions I will talk to you about."
3149.0,3152.0," Firstly, on economy then, where does the economy flourish?"
3152.0,3155.0, Their path to victory in terms of economy is quite simple.
3155.0,3161.0," We tell you that the CME franc has made their currency rates artificially high and when you decrease that,"
3161.0,3164.0," when you give them monetary autonomy, the world is going to be rainbows."
3164.0,3167.8," I tell you no, for a very simple reason. Just look at how the world"
3167.8,3173.18, works. The Nepali rupee is valued at like 0.00 something against the UST. Are we
3173.18,3178.18," competitive in terms of exports? It's just like, every step of the way, obviously, just having a lower"
3178.18,3181.36, exchange rate makes you more competitive in terms of exports. I don't see any
3181.36,3187.0, mechanization for how that is done. But let me tell you that what is more important for these nations is stability.
3187.0,3190.5, Because we have seen what happens when nations exit the CMA system.
3190.5,3193.7," We see that it is a monetary crisis, we see that it is a liquidity crisis."
3193.7,3197.2, We don't want people to leave these lines because we see what has happened in Zimbabwe.
3197.2,3199.4, We don't want people to get this across this region.
3199.4,3202.4, We told you that this problem is much much worse because there are no borders.
3202.4,3206.48," These borders are very very poor, which means that all the countries are transnational."
3206.48,3210.72," He also tells you that the terrorist threats crash against these economic concerns, right?"
3210.72,3213.76, And their response to that is that the terrorism exits because of France.
3213.76,3215.68, This is literally just factually untrue.
3215.68,3219.6, The largest terrorist group that operates in these regions is Boko Haram and Boko Haram
3219.6,3221.52, is literally based on Muslim ideology.
3221.52,3223.6, I don't know how this is bolstered by France.
3223.6,3229.0," Even if it is bolstered by France, this is a large-ranged minority. The larger point here is that the"
3229.0,3233.0, bigger picture is that these terrorist groups are literally motivated by the fact that they
3233.0,3237.0, have deep ethnic and religious ideologies that they subscribe to. The only people capable
3237.0,3242.0, of controlling this is France. Why is it that France is so deeply invested and France has
3242.0,3247.2, the incentive to help their binary? The first and the most apparent and damning incentive that people are going to do with
3247.2,3249.8, was that the colonies literally pegged.
3249.8,3251.0, What does this mean?
3251.0,3255.0," If the CFE grant is going to be devalued, this has busted ramifications for France"
3255.0,3258.8, because that is literally going to devalue the Euro and the international community.
3258.8,3263.4, That means that all the assets that are denominated with the CFE grant for France
3263.4,3266.0, and literally all of the European Union were also going to be devaluated.
3266.0,3270.0, We think that they have a larger incentive because they also have to care about the election
3270.0,3274.0," politics and the democratic things that they have that we presented to them, which is to"
3274.0,3278.0, say that the only side that makes people's lives better truly is opposition.
3278.0,3282.0," What opposition gives you is a sense of principle justice, but why does the principle matter"
3282.0,3284.0, if you're hungry?
3284.0,3288.66," First day on principles, second day on economy, and lastly on terrorism."
3289.02,3294.18," Firstly on principal, what we told you from our first speaker was that France stole from"
3294.18,3298.3," these West African countries and still continues to steal from West African countries, and"
3298.3,3301.06, that means that they should return West Africa.
3302.42,3310.0," They provided a host of reasons as to why this is not true, like they can just pay reparations, but we think that this is a ridiculous claim."
3310.0,3318.0," If I steal your phone, I have to return it. Just because, oh, like, just, like, listen to how, like, ridiculous this sounds."
3318.0,3345.0," Oh, someone else would have stolen your phone anyway, so I stole it and I continue to play games on it every day. We think that that is not a justification that other bad actors will come in. It is not a justification for you to continue to steal it from these West African countries. Especially at the point in which the person and the West African people are demanding for know that they have a refugee crisis, they do know that they have COVID-19,"
3345.0,3351.0," but yet they're still demanding for France to leave, and they do know the consequences of France leaving,"
3351.0,3357.0, but they're willing to buy a bullet because France has exploited from them for 50 years.
3357.0,3362.0," We think that this standard, and regardless of the comparative of the harms that they might provide it to,"
3362.0,3369.52, we think that France can still pay reparations for these countries even after that exit. Their innocence does not stand. We think that
3369.52,3374.56," we went on this principle. But secondly, and more importantly, on economy. On the opposition"
3374.56,3379.5," side, what did they tell you? They told you that, oh, the stupid quote is fine. France"
3379.5,3384.16, can protect the economy. Notice how laughable it is when you look at the stupid quote. We
3384.16,3388.48," think that the spread of tendencies, the established dominance over these West African countries'"
3388.48,3392.56," economies, and it does not trickle down to the people on the ground. They make $40 billion"
3392.56,3397.92, from Cote d'Ivoire and the mines in Cote d'Ivoire and ship them all to France. This does not
3397.92,3401.82, trickle down to the people. We do not see any wealth in which that's how you could make
3401.82,3408.32," it trickle down to the people. Rather, we think that in the absence of of these we told you for our first speaker that the point of which has so many actions"
3408.32,3413.68, that want to come in not just china not just russia but also switzerland the uae turkey this
3413.68,3418.64, is not competitive incentive to appeal to these west african people to appeal to them that yes
3418.64,3425.42, we will provide you with good wage yes we will not exploit you. We think that because these countries uniquely do not
3425.42,3430.22," have war minutes as compared to France, we think that that's the point at which resources"
3430.22,3434.04," and profits will actually trickle down to the people on the ground. But secondly, we"
3434.04,3438.78," told you about the CFA frame, how the CFA frame is not stable in any way whatsoever."
3439.02,3444.22," The euro is not stable. But secondly, we think that even if it is stable, it is stable at"
3444.22,3445.0, an incredibly low
3445.0,3451.0," rate or incredibly high rate, which will make these economies basically crumble."
3451.0,3454.0, We think that stability is not important in and of itself.
3454.0,3458.0," But lastly, we told you about how they cannot adjust the interest rates and how this is"
3458.0,3460.0, detrimental to their economies.
3460.0,3467.0, We think that this leads to countries suffering through multiple times of the recent experience
3467.0,3473.0," during the 2008 economic crisis, that entire economies will crumble with the CFA framework,"
3473.0,3478.0," while we support local currencies in which people can adjust according to their economy,"
3478.0,3485.0," and can adjust their interest rates, and can get access to foreign reserves that they should be able to access."
3485.0,3489.0," But secondly, on terrorism, we think that it is incredibly ridiculous what the other"
3489.0,3494.0," side is saying. We think that although, yes, terrorists are the core terrorists, the core"
3494.0,3499.0," members are Islamic, we think that our point was not about that. Our point was that you"
3499.0,3506.16," can generalize the general population who is not, through this anti-Rush sentiment."
3506.16,3511.76," You cannot do that on our side, but one can because there's no incentive for these citizens to join any war."
3511.76,3517.2," But lastly, we think that terrorism is just not important when compared to the economy to begin with."
3517.2,3520.64," Because what? Well, now people are affected by stumbling hunger."
3520.64,3526.28," Like 50 million people are suffering from hunger in West Africa as compared to the 1,800 people"
3526.28,3527.44, who have been killed by terrorists.
3527.44,3529.9, We think that there's no bit more distinction between them.
3529.9,3532.88," But secondly, we think that's less defense against poverty"
3532.88,3534.62, than against someone with a bomb.
3534.62,3536.58, We think that we are able to actually achieve
3536.58,3538.72," these concrete benefits on our side,"
3538.72,3540.04, so proud to propose.
3540.04,3540.92, Thank you.
