0.0,6.0," Since the 1980s, the influx of tourists travelling to Barcelona has only increased."
6.0,10.0, It has been unchecked and not really regulated because of the illusion of economic benefit.
10.0,19.0, Over-tourism is something that is inherently harmful because it means that locals are pushed out of their own communities because of rapid gentrification.
19.0,25.8, Suppose that dollar signs that the opposition might tell you about clearly don't matter at the point at which individuals are marching in the streets of
25.8,30.4," Santorini and Barcelona telling tourists to go home, proud to propose."
30.4,32.4, A few arguments come into the problem.
32.4,36.2," The first is on why we benefit the economy, the second is on culture, and the third argument"
36.2,38.8, in the second speech is an argument around the environment.
38.8,40.4," Before that, what's our stance?"
40.4,42.8," One, we aren't banning tourism, that's absurd."
42.8,44.8, We're rather limiting the numbers in the industry.
44.8,54.0," We believe that any industry can have economic benefit, but it is the duty of the state to regulate against unchecked growth in order to ensure that the possible harms don't outweigh the possible benefits."
54.0,59.0," For clarity, we want tourism to not overshadow the carrying capacity that currently exists."
59.0,61.0, What then does our model look like? Five things.
61.0,67.8," A. It looks like establishing quarters, particularly during peak season. So for example, limiting the number of individuals that can access something"
67.8,72.68," like a tourist visa. It looks like how Greece's admins has put a cap to 20,000 individuals"
72.68,76.76," per day, down from historically with their number of 40,000. This significant reduction"
76.76,81.28, is going to be determined by states alongside relevant experts in the field. B. We're looking
81.28,84.82, to impose restrictions on tourist-centered accommodation. So this looks like how Berlin
84.82,91.0, has put a regulation on short-term rentals requiring a permit to be signed when you are apportioning the apartment in residential areas at a time.
91.0,96.0, C. We're looking to also support the implementation of additional premiums for specific areas.
96.0,101.0, So this looks like how Venice has an increased five-year fine for visiting Venice on day trips if individuals want to live in there.
101.0,105.28, D. We're also willing to support all other reasonable initiatives
105.28,107.76, to limit the number of tourists within these major destinations
107.76,110.4, and also prevent the inflation impact that currently exists.
110.4,114.0," Lastly, this cap would be determined from country to country basis,"
114.0,118.92, but it would be a cap determined on the basis of reducing the country's dependency on tourism.
118.92,121.6, That's what the most important thing in this debate is.
121.6,122.92, Second part of the strategy.
122.92,126.0, We're willing to trade off the constant influx of money for tourism
126.0,130.0," because of three reasons. One, government's responsibility to support local populations"
130.0,134.0, first and foremost because of social contracts. Hyper-tourism uniquely has a blanket form
134.0,137.0," to its individuals, and most instances the money from tourism doesn't actually go to"
137.0,140.0," locals and we're the ones who put the silver back into it. But two, tourists are still"
140.0,145.0," able to visit on our side, we're not completely undergoing the economic benefit that exists,"
145.0,147.0, we're just maintaining a lack of sustainability.
147.0,151.5," Third, access to tourism creates a dependency that forces governments to have pervasive interests."
151.5,155.5, So the idea that the government of Brazil is now likely to not have an incentive to face your vendors
155.5,159.5, because they have a reliance on slum tourism is something that they can never trade off on their side.
159.5,161.5, Arguing then as to how we benefit the economy.
161.5,163.5," Before I preach, I want to take a P.O.I."
165.44,169.04," Arguing then as to why we benefit the economy. Before I preach the argument, let's take a P.O.I. Arguing that as to why we benefit the economy. The framing here is very simple."
169.04,174.0, Unchanged tourism has led to harms to the domestic economy because oftentimes there is a prioritization
174.0,178.64, around the needs and comforts of wealthy tourists over the poor population. Why then do we have more
178.64,183.44," economy? Firstly, the allure of tourism is certainly that politicians often don't take the necessary"
183.44,189.0," means to regulating it until there's a critical tipping point, so private interest overshadows the domestic population's well-being."
189.0,208.0," Air gain across the world has led to increased demand for short-term rentals, increasing the general cost of living in city centres, which leads to a real human cost, at the point at which pensioners and local individuals can't out-compete with tourists in terms of like on a many reasons. That means then, it should likely do harm to these individuals and increase the prices of food in that area."
208.0,212.16," The minimum wage in Spain is a little over a thousand euros a week, but on average tourists"
212.16,217.6, in Madrid spend about a thousand euros. This leads to an enemy out-of-place and very veganization
217.6,222.08," impact out of volume. Secondly, there's a seasonality around the world. So tourism centers"
222.08,226.0, are in peak seasons where markets pop up and there's accommodation that's putting tourists out.
226.0,231.0," The seasonality is harmful because when tourism is allowed to grow unchecked, you create a dependency on the tourism."
231.0,234.0, That means then that out of season there's no real economic benefit.
234.0,238.0," This is especially important because even in the best case when they do provide jobs, those jobs are still on steam."
238.0,242.0, Particularly pernicious in the instances when the government needs incentivised mass training.
242.0,246.74, Because those are the types of things like hospitality training that are short-term in nature and they're very volatile.
247.14,250.76," Third, the massive gains from tourism on their side just leak out of the country."
251.0,255.56, Because MNCs are the largest corporations that have the ability to create large results on tourist destinations.
255.92,259.58, 70% of all of the money tourists spend in Thailand ends up leaving their country.
259.58,265.72," Because international allies don't benefit the local economy, local vendors often get bought out by MNCs looking to gentrify."
265.72,270.72, The reason as to why MNCs and leakage are inherent to scale and are a hand to mass tourism
270.72,275.18," is because they enable MNCs to gain more economies of scale, to keep prices low, and fundamentally"
275.18,277.8, is a greater likelihood of that happening on their side.
277.8,281.52," But even if leakage exists on either side, it is far worse on their side, because more"
281.52,287.84," and more people come into these local communities, making those economic issues far worse. Especially important in all points is going to make any"
287.84,291.12, argument about developing world economies that are worse for the opinion that they're likely to
291.12,295.68," be talking about. On our side, however, destinations in particular don't get overwhelmed. There's less"
295.68,299.84," inflation pressure on the poor and the middle class comparatively. One, locals are always going"
299.84,304.56, to outnumber tourists but they need to be able to live in cities that can have economic economy
304.56,308.8," to help the broader economy grow. Two, on our side, states can invest into more long-term,"
308.8,312.72," durable economic opportunities because when tourism decreases, it's likely other industries"
312.72,316.96, can grow because there's more utility that's provided. Even if gentrification occurs on our
316.96,321.28," side, it is still likely to be better because that gentrification is going to happen organically and"
321.28,328.0, not to be needed to have a lot of tourists. So you don't have MLCs pushing for rapid development and things like high-rise buildings. It's going to happen head-to-head to global.
328.0,334.0," On their side eventually, the appeal of the novelties is going to be let off. The country is going to be let off. No other means is sublimating that value."
334.0,347.0," Tourists are going to move on and the trade is going to be over, like we've seen in the Spanish islands. So that means then that you don't have the capacity for the country to build again. The impact of this argument is twofold. Firstly, we see this home existence in wealthy countries,"
347.0,349.0, and I think now regulation is an especially important
349.0,351.0, empowerment for developing nations that are
351.0,353.0, looking to become tourist hotspots.
353.0,355.0," Cape Town, a city in South Africa, has the most"
355.0,357.0, ABM visa in the world because of pro-business
357.0,359.0, government who want MNCs to buy up and construct new
359.0,361.0," tourist accommodations, leading to a vast"
361.0,363.0, disfaces. Tourists just don't care because they
363.0,366.3," don't have an attachment to their country, And even when they are aware of this,"
366.3,367.76, they prioritize their own comforts
367.76,368.94, over the comforts of others.
368.94,371.18," But second, there is a real human host"
371.18,372.88, to all of the things we are talking about.
372.88,375.02, It is the mother who was laid off from her resort
375.02,376.64, because that resort isn't making money.
376.64,378.24, It is the young couple that cannot afford
378.24,379.82, to start a family and build a home
379.82,382.46, because homes are too expensive because of gentrification.
382.46,385.4, That is the type of world that exists on the other side.
385.4,388.4," Second argument then around culture, before I give this short."
388.4,393.4," For nations like seashells, they have to do tours because no alternate economy has worked."
393.4,396.8, What alternate economies would they comparatively shift to in your world?
396.8,400.4, We gave you two structural reasons as to why these economies are likely to diversify
400.4,402.0, and they're likely to have under industries grow.
402.0,403.4, You need to actually engage with those.
403.4,405.44," Argument number three. We improve cultural participation and social communication, and you like it and let industries grow, you need to actually engage with those. Arguing with the government will be important."
405.44,409.6," We improve cultural participation and social communication, especially in the developing world,"
409.6,411.6, because there's an increasing demand for tourism there.
411.6,416.8, It's taking the characteristics of the exploitative nature as opposed to being appreciative of that culture.
416.8,419.76, There's a disrespect for culturally and spiritually significant areas.
419.76,425.6," So for example in Peru, they had to limit the tourist numbers that existed in order to better ensure that those harms don't exist too much."
425.6,429.62," In Greece, they had to literally arrest individuals because they were defacing things like the"
429.62,431.72, Coliseum and historically significant architecture.
432.12,436.22," These are not isolated instances, but they're structurally true because tourists just don't"
436.22,438.42, have the same appreciation and they just don't have the same attachment.
438.72,441.48, They're individuals who want to look cool and get an Instagram post of them.
441.74,446.0," Currently, all across Europe, major tourist clubs are seeing an increased protest from individuals"
446.0,447.52, because individuals don't like these things.
447.52,449.6, Spanish individuals are spitting in tourist drinks
449.6,451.6, and telling them to leave their country.
451.6,453.8, This is because institutions are set up
453.8,455.24," to cater for tourist individuals,"
455.24,456.84, not necessarily the locals of their country.
456.84,459.52," So complaints about drunk, water-drunk, or loud tourists"
459.52,461.32, just don't matter to the institutions.
461.32,463.4," We solve these issues because comparatively,"
463.4,465.0," on our side, we have smaller numbers of tourists,"
465.0,468.0, that means then it's easier to regulate those individuals as opposed to in your side.
468.0,472.0," This argument is especially important because if we better maintain the culture of the nation,"
472.0,475.0, it's likely individuals who do actually care about those things are going to visit that country.
475.0,478.0, So we maintain tourism over a longer period of time.
478.0,482.0," If they're going to argue about tourism in one of the five years, then our case is simply prior to theirs."
482.0,485.0, What proposition? Because we make tourism work for locals again.
485.0,492.0," Not international payment, not international businesses, not amenities, but for people who live to deal with high prices in large areas and their homes and homes."
493.0,497.0, Significant restriction on tourism is a significant restriction on the economy.
497.0,500.0, We will forward two arguments from Japan in this debate.
500.0,506.0," First argument on why we better the economy, and our second argument will be brought by our second speaker."
506.0,512.0," Before argumentation, three pieces of set up. And note that this will take down the majority of their argumentation."
512.0,516.0," Firstly, what is our stance in this debate? We are willing to take a hard stance."
516.0,521.0, We support substantial increases in tourism and we encourage more and more tourists to come in.
521.0,525.32," Secondly, what is the characterization of these tourist cities?"
525.32,530.72," Major tourist destinations often feature distinct tourist zones, bustling with hotels, attractions"
530.72,535.32," and shops catering to visitors, while local population areas are more residential and"
535.32,538.78, cater to the daily needs and lifestyles of the locals.
538.78,543.8," This separation ensures that tourism infrastructure is concentrated, preserving local culture"
543.8,549.52," and community life in separate, less commercialised neighbourhoods. Third, what alternative policies are we willing"
549.52,554.24," to support? Because we agree that to some extent, regulation is necessary. We think that cities"
554.24,558.32," should basically do whatever is necessary for their nation, but there are a few examples,"
558.32,563.2, such as 1. Spreading tourist traffic. Promoting business during off-peak seasons can help
563.2,567.48," distribute the influx of tourists more evenly, reducing the strain on popular destinations."
568.18,573.36," 2. Improving infrastructure and facilities. For example, Barcelona's expansion of its"
573.36,577.76," metro system has been instrumental in managing tourist traffic more efficiently, spreading"
577.76,581.78, visitors across the city. 3. Severe punishments for destructive behaviour
581.78,587.62," by tourists. Therefore, the problems that they talked about can be fixed without significant limitations on the number of"
587.62,592.12," tourists. On this piece of frame though, I want to make two additional important"
592.12,596.8," notes. First, this regulation is exclusive to our world because the tax revenue we"
596.8,601.02," get from tourism, which is necessary to implement these regulations, can only be"
601.02,605.0," gathered in our world. This means Proposition cannot co-opt these alternative regulations. Second, Proposition cannot say these alternatives do not gathered in our world. This means Proposition cannot block these alternative"
605.0,610.38," regulations. Second, Proposition cannot say these alternatives do not exist in our world"
610.38,614.88," because we just have to support the status quo. And in the status quo, Vienna already"
614.88,620.34," has rent control, Barcelona already bans Airbnb. Therefore, the Proposition's burden in this"
620.34,628.86," debate is to change the status quo. These milder policies are our side of this debate. And before I move on to our first argument, I'll take a POI. Speaker, if it"
628.86,632.78," is that you're investing so much into having to maintain tourism, why don't you have any"
632.78,638.6, spillover effects to other parts of the economy? We think that it is very unlikely. Our speakers
638.6,643.64," will extend upon that, but we think that the crucial reason why the economy won't diversify"
643.64,648.1," is because those places are not attractive, right? That's the crucial reason why, apparently, these"
648.1,653.42," places are not popular. We'll prove to you this further in our case. Okay, the"
653.42,656.18, first argument on the economic development. And note that this
656.18,659.86, argumentation will directly clash with their argument. The thesis of this
659.86,663.86, argument is that tourism boosts the economy and creates jobs. There are two
663.86,670.56," layers to this argument. Firstly, how does tourism stimulate the economy? There are four notes on how much money tourists"
670.56,676.5," spend which proves the stimulation that tourists bring. One, tourists uniquely want to spend money."
676.5,681.62," This is because tourists inherently have a strong inclination to spend money during their travels,"
681.62,687.44, times of excitement and relaxation where they are prepared to indulge in various activities and experiences.
687.44,696.0," 2. Tourists often come from countries with stronger currencies, meaning that their money has a greater purchasing power in destinations with weaker currencies."
696.0,703.6," This difference enables them to afford more luxuries and experiences than they could at home, which leads to increased spending during their travels."
703.6,708.8," 3. Travelling itself is inherently expensive. When tourists visit another country,"
708.8,714.8," their expenditures extend far beyond just airfare and accommodation and extend to public transportation,"
714.8,719.6," dining, souvenirs, entertainment and various services such as guided tours or taxis."
719.6,724.24, Each of these expenditures contributes a substantial influx of money into the local economy.
730.2,734.82," 4. And lastly, it creates spending on unique services. For instance, locals have homes and sublets so they don't use hotels as much. Locals cook home food so they don't"
734.82,738.84, regularly go to restaurants. Locals barely use taxis as they have cars and
738.84,743.22," public transport. Locals don't consume souvenirs. Therefore, the implication is"
743.22,747.04, that the types of spending that tourists do is extremely unique and valuable.
747.44,749.18," Before we move on to the second layer, I'll take a quick one."
749.32,754.12," Speaker, you literally just said that individuals can use public transport, and then you say that they can use cars."
754.28,755.78, Which one is it? Because they're both contradictory.
756.26,761.64," We don't think it's contradictory, and it's very unclear what the implication of that, even if there is a contradiction."
762.5,767.0," Second layer of this argument, how the proposition's comparative harms the economy."
767.0,769.0, There are six main impacts.
769.0,770.0," One, job loss."
770.0,774.5," Intuitively speaking, this economic failure will lead to massive job loss for people in"
774.5,777.5," the service sector and tourism sectors, unlike they claim."
777.5,781.0, These are jobs that are very accessible to low skilled workers.
781.0,785.34," These are workers with very few transferable skills, no education, and no experience, which"
785.34,790.24, means it's incredibly hard to find a new industry to house all of these unemployed workers.
790.24,794.68," Furthermore, when an entire city is suddenly unemployed, it also means more crime happens."
794.68,798.12, It means there are no longer support networks for the unemployed.
798.12,799.92, Job loss is a massive impact here.
799.92,800.92, 2.
800.92,801.92, Promotion of service work.
801.92,829.0," The types of jobs created by the tourism industry are often more favorable compared to alternatives in many developing countries, while manufacturing jobs, which many developing countries rely on, oftentimes involve roles are far less physically taxing. These service sector jobs are much more desirable because these positions offer a better work"
829.0,831.24, environment and greater job satisfaction.
831.24,832.24, 3.
832.24,833.82, Loss in government resources.
833.82,838.5," The immediate effect is a substantial loss in tax revenue, which typically comes from"
838.5,842.56, both tourism-related jobs and the expenditures of tourists themselves.
842.56,845.06, Governments also oftentimes have to take a lot of debt
845.06,847.44, to cover welfare expenses for the unemployed
847.44,850.44, and incur additional debt to sustain social services
850.44,852.24, and economic stability.
852.24,854.36," For many nations, tourism constitutes"
854.36,856.5," a considerable segment of their economy,"
856.5,860.0, thus replacing this lost economic activity
860.0,861.98, as a task that leads to prolonged periods
861.98,864.72, of financial instability and economic decline.
864.72,870.52," But fourthly, there will be less foreign direct investment, or FDI, meaning less corporations come in."
870.86,875.86," Firstly, the immediate short-term losses from a curtailed tourism sector make it less profitable"
875.86,879.62, and riskier for investors to allocate capital to the affected country
879.62,885.88, due to the anticipated return on investment diminishing as the tourism industry revenue stream dries up.
885.88,890.54," Secondly, the signaling effect of such a drastic policy shift creates broader concerns about"
890.54,892.28, the country's investment climate.
892.28,897.14, By effectively declaring war on its largest industry after years and years of promotion
897.14,909.78," and support, the government signals unpredictability and potential hostility towards other sectors. This erodes investor confidence as we fear that similar abrupt and detrimental policy changes"
909.78,915.0," might impact their ventures in other industries, ultimately leading to a reduction in FDI."
915.82,917.6," Fifth, losing foreign currency."
918.1,922.36, Tourists bring in foreign currency that supports the local economy and exchange rate.
922.72,926.54," Therefore, without this, the country faces a deficit, weakening its currency."
926.96,932.04," A weaker currency makes imports more expensive, causing inflation and reducing purchasing power."
932.04,939.18," This can lead to a cycle of declining investor confidence and further economic problems, causing this vicious cycle."
939.54,942.28," Sixth, and finally, this also leads to bankruptcy."
942.88,947.76," Tourism businesses often invest heavily in real estate, infrastructure, and services,"
947.76,949.24, expecting steady revenue.
949.24,954.14," Therefore, when tourism stops, they can go bankrupt, leading to job losses and long-term"
954.14,955.14, debt struggles.
955.14,960.68," These bankruptcies affect banks, causing significant losses and tighter credit, which slows economic"
960.68,961.68, growth.
961.68,965.22," Therefore, the implication of all of these six mechanisms is simple."
970.68,974.8," This economy is massively impoverished when tourism is significantly limited. Significant restriction on tourism is significant restriction on the economy. For all these reasons, I'm"
974.8,975.66, very proud to oppose.
976.66,983.3, The COVID-19 pandemic plunged the economies of a lot of tourist destinations around the
983.3,985.52, world into essential disrepair.
985.52,990.9," That looks like economies like Thailand, who lost 30% of local GDP when it came to the"
990.9,993.44, decrease in flooding in some tourist areas.
993.44,999.02, This is because an over-extension of tourist economies creates a dependency on something
999.02,1002.32, that's inherently short-termist and inherently unequal.
1002.32,1008.46," It's something that can never be depended on, but you create the direct incentive for states to do so at the expense of their local"
1008.46,1012.36," populations. On South Africa, we believe that areas ought to benefit the"
1012.36,1016.26, individuals that live in them that we've been proud to propose. Three things in
1016.26,1020.1," this speech. Firstly, on context and strategy, I'm asking the question where"
1020.1,1024.54," are these areas? Secondly, on the policy limitations when it comes to limiting"
1024.54,1028.94," the amount of tourists, and lastly then, on the economic benefits that we bring through through"
1028.94,1033.52," our policy. Contextually speaking then, let's talk about the development of over-tourism"
1033.52,1038.1, and how it's something that came about. What we told you was that when the 1970s allowed
1038.1,1042.76," for mass long-haul flights to become something that is commercially viable, it also created"
1042.76,1049.74, an incentive for states not to consider the capacity of their regulation. That means they jumped straight into the inviting
1049.74,1053.96, of tourists into their nations. There was way more demand than there actually was supply.
1053.96,1057.72," But because they didn't consider these things initially, we now have the problems on our"
1057.72,1062.42," side that haven't been addressed. But secondly, we told you that this is concentrated in developed"
1062.42,1065.96," nations for three main reasons. Firstly, because of cultural compatibility."
1066.46,1071.06," That means that British tourists would rather go to Ibiza, for instance, on holiday"
1071.06,1073.24, than a country in Africa or Asia
1073.24,1076.76, because they believe they're going to be more integrated into that culture when they go.
1076.96,1078.24," But secondly, on availability."
1078.62,1081.38," That's to say that the lines, the planes, the flights available"
1081.38,1084.28, go into those regions where things are more easily accessible
1084.28,1089.58," and tourists then channel to those areas. But lastly, on safety and stability. Afghanistan is"
1089.58,1093.96," a great country when it comes to views, a great country when it comes to history and culture,"
1094.08,1097.4, but it's something that people are unlikely to visit because they don't think they're going to
1097.4,1102.78, be welcomed in a safety and political stability sense. What does this analysis then do? It frames
1102.78,1105.88, out the majority of their instances when they talk about
1105.88,1107.98, nations in the developing world that are going
1107.98,1109.9, to be harmed by this policy. Because the five
1109.9,1111.94, biggest nations when it comes to tourists are
1111.94,1113.88," New York, a lot of cities when it comes to tourists"
1113.88,1116.06," are New York, London, LA, Paris"
1116.06,1117.76," and like, um, and like"
1117.76,1119.94," yeah, and New York City. And these are"
1119.94,1121.58," things, we think, that are directly"
1121.58,1123.94, able to benefit from other mechanisms
1123.94,1125.12," other than tourism. Which means the direct harms that are directly able to benefit from other mechanisms other than tourism,"
1125.12,1128.98, which means that the direct harms that are created on the individuals in those states
1128.98,1133.22, are things that need to be prioritised. But the second thing strategically is the idea
1133.22,1137.82," of inherency, the fact that they provide generalised benefits of tourism without showing why all"
1137.82,1142.36, the tourism that we see under status quo is something that necessarily has to be maintained.
1142.36,1146.04, Firstly then on the policy and the ability to limit tourists on their side.
1146.22,1148.26, We give you three responses to their analysis.
1148.54,1152.58, The first thing is that all regions of the city have the biggest tourist destinations.
1152.76,1154.88, What you're doing is competing for centrality.
1155.06,1156.8," That's nightlife, that's access to amenities,"
1157.16,1161.72, that's the things that individuals and tourists are directly in opposition for
1161.72,1165.64," because they want to experience those amenities and the centrality of the city,"
1165.74,1169.8," which means there's a direct competition that they can't engage with on their side. But secondly,"
1169.96,1174.64," note the inherent difficulty on policing large crowds and the disincentive there is to do so,"
1174.72,1178.64," because tourists are going to like your area less when they feel like it's a police state,"
1178.7,1181.92," when they feel like they're being actively cracked down on, which means unless you have"
1181.92,1187.7," small crowds that you can regulate using smaller security services, you aren't able to regulate the larger crowds on their"
1187.7,1193.6," side because it detracts from that ambience. But lastly, on the behaviour of individuals."
1193.6,1198.24, We note firstly that tourism creates an environment where people feel like social norms are suspended.
1198.24,1202.38," We're in a place to have fun, we're going to do that at all costs. But secondly, on"
1202.38,1209.28," the capacity to spend, they talked about currency disparities. That's directly worsen on their side because people are able to absorb larger"
1209.28,1213.28, fines and are psychologically inclined to do so because they come in with the intention
1213.28,1218.44, of spending money. That then frames a direct incentive to pivot away from over-tourism
1218.44,1223.1," that exists under status quo, but also shows you why our mechanism is uniquely beneficial"
1223.1,1229.12, in that regard. The second conversation is the idea of economic benefits and the capacity to diversify.
1229.12,1233.08," Here we just think they don't engage with what exists under status quo, where tourism"
1233.08,1237.0, creates a direct incentive to lock yourself into particular markets.
1237.0,1240.26, And here is where we talk about the fact that tourism is effectively seen by governments
1240.26,1241.88, as a free source of money.
1241.88,1245.06, It's like something that's based on the natural features and requires
1245.06,1248.28, minimal investment when it comes to the development of regions.
1248.28,1252.58, Note then that policies that rely on developing areas within your nations are disbeneficial
1252.58,1257.42," to states in two regards. Firstly, they require more active investment because of that development,"
1257.42,1261.52," but secondly, there's a sacrifice that needs to be done. So if you have to run, for instance,"
1261.52,1264.86," protectionist measures to protect a nascent industry, that's something that's going to"
1264.86,1268.06," cost you trade deals, that's something that requires political inertia"
1268.06,1269.34, in order to happen.
1269.64,1274.26, That then creates an incentive or a structure where states are able to lean on tourism over
1274.26,1278.14, more because it doesn't require political sacrifices in order to get off the ground.
1278.28,1282.14, This looks like nations like Thailand that have nascent manufacturing industries that
1282.14,1285.88, they disregard because of the incentives that tourism creates.
1285.88,1288.18," Also note, tourism creates two harmful incentives."
1288.18,1292.52," One, it creates the incentive to just look away from social problems, that's Airbnb cutting"
1292.52,1294.02, deals with the city of Cape Town.
1294.02,1298.06," But secondly, it creates incentive to actually entrench these social issues."
1298.06,1302.56," So Thailand is notorious for sex tourism, that's something that Western people go to"
1302.56,1307.24," to experience, and it's something that the government won't regulate because of that economic benefit."
1307.24,1311.46," But note then, they also didn't engage with the litany of harms that we brought to when"
1311.46,1313.46, it came to disparities in purchasing power.
1313.46,1314.96, And they agreed to these harms.
1314.96,1316.76, They told you tourists come into spend.
1316.76,1320.92, And what that means is the generalized increase in standard of living and property taxes for
1320.92,1327.98," the demand of short-term tourist accommodation, all of these things then are impacted on their side. How do we weigh out then? We weigh out because they"
1327.98,1333.74, create a diffuse harm and we create a concentrated benefit. A diffuse harm with a concentrated
1333.74,1337.98," benefit. So they're able to benefit the few people that are employed in these areas, in"
1337.98,1342.04," these cities, while generalising and decreasing the standard of living. That's through the"
1342.04,1347.32," clashes between tourists and individuals, the large cities, that's through the increase in standard of living, which means individuals"
1347.32,1351.46," aren't able to benefit. Comparatively, we get a large-scale benefit for everyone who"
1351.46,1356.44," exists in the city on a marginal cost. Before I move on to my argument then, sure, I'll take a part."
1356.44,1361.38," When you limit the context of this debate to developed nations, it is factually true that countries like"
1361.38,1365.6, America or Britain are not entirely dependentated on tourism for their economy.
1365.6,1368.7, How can you say that diversification is necessary for development?
1368.7,1372.7," Okay, so I just gave you two different contexts that we need to engage with."
1372.7,1378.5," On one side, you have developed economies, which creates an increase in the standard, in the cost of living within these nations,"
1378.5,1382.3," and pushes people to the outskirts of countries, of cities, like LA."
1382.3,1387.68," That's something that's directly disbeneficial, and's something that can be fixed easily because we have the GDP reserve"
1387.68,1391.34, to just not rely on tourism. In developing nations you create the direct
1391.34,1395.12, incentive to lean on tourism as a mechanism and you allow for regulation
1395.12,1398.38, not to take place. Those are two different harms that you create and you need to
1398.38,1401.46, engage with them respectively. On the idea then that you create harms to the
1401.46,1404.56, environment. The framing here is that we have an increase in environmental
1404.56,1407.98, tourism under status quo. These are regions that carry appeal because
1407.98,1411.84, of their aesthetics. These are regions that are also uniquely fragile because ecosystems
1411.84,1416.14, are dependent on balance. Note how this is harmed in three ways on their side. The first
1416.14,1421.0, way is the increase demand for accommodation and luxury. This means the construction of
1421.0,1427.08, tourist regions. What that means is tourism expands in popularity and companies work on increasingly more extravagant and
1427.08,1430.68, resource-intensive projects in an attempt to corner the markets. This looks
1430.68,1434.86, like the Guaypoh Islands in Dubai that required a massive amount of sand to be
1434.86,1438.24, pulled in order to build them and destroy reef infrastructure in the
1438.24,1442.26, process. That means that those ecosystems are irreparably damaged and can't be
1442.26,1448.96," maintained. But secondly, note that tourist presence creates pollution and environmental harm. That's firstly in terms of resource use."
1449.14,1453.6, So there's massive resource-intensive hotels that are going to divert resources away from
1453.6,1457.62, locals. Dubai literally couldn't fight its wildfires because it didn't have the water
1457.62,1462.28," that water was being diverted to the hotels in the region. But secondly, on waste products."
1462.38,1467.62, Note that tourism are uniquely dependent on single-use plastics because they want to vent in the region for a
1467.62,1471.1," long time. You're eating out more, you're going to create more waste products in"
1471.1,1475.0," that regard. Based on all of that then, they fail to benefit the individuals who live"
1475.0,1479.02," within particular nations and we get that benefit, never been prior to a proposed."
1479.02,1488.32," I want to firstly deal with their economy. They give you three main mechanisms in their first argument, I'm going to deal with each"
1488.32,1489.32, one.
1489.32,1492.04," But before dealing with each one, I think it's imperative to note that they don't"
1492.04,1493.88, prove through a comparative in this debate.
1493.88,1498.18, They have two burdens to fulfill in the comparative that go unfulfilled at this point in this
1498.18,1499.18, debate.
1499.18,1503.5," Firstly, they still have to prove to you that alternatives to some extent do exist."
1503.5,1509.12," That the asserting POI response that, oh, alternatives probably do exist, cannot prove to you that that is true."
1509.12,1514.0," In the Maldives, the reason why the nation is relying upon tourism is because no other"
1514.0,1518.84," industry adequately can replace the economic impact that that has. In Seychelles, the reason"
1518.84,1524.68, why the economy is 40% dependent on tourism is because nothing can replace that GDP impact.
1524.68,1526.26," Therefore, they still have to prove to you"
1526.54,1533.44," alternatives do exist. But secondly, they then have to prove to you that these alternatives are in any way better because their homes are not in"
1533.44,1538.08," any way unique to tourism. Look at, for example, their claim about diversification or"
1538.5,1543.96, higher cost of living. That claim is basically going to be symmetric in every other alternative you can bring.
1543.96,1546.0, Let's say you shift to manufacturing.
1546.0,1549.6, Let's say you have car companies come in and build infrastructure in your country
1549.6,1551.36, and hire people in your country.
1551.36,1554.32, These car companies are going to bring in hundreds of foreign workers with them
1554.32,1557.52, who are similarly going to push the economy into overdrive
1557.52,1559.84, and are similarly going to increase the cost of living.
1559.84,1562.16, The problem is not unique to tourism.
1562.16,1564.48, But I also want to look at each of the mechanizations.
1564.48,1566.8, The first mechanization is on cost of living.
1567.12,1569.58, I have two levels of response against this at the top.
1569.88,1572.28," One, that we frame from our second piece on frame"
1572.28,1574.64, that is unengaged by their speaker
1574.64,1577.54," to say that, well, oftentimes the tourist areas"
1577.54,1580.8," are very far apart, or at the very least in different areas"
1580.8,1582.4, from where the locals live.
1582.56,1584.7," And governments do have incentive to structure economies,"
1584.92,1586.16," to structure societies this way,"
1586.34,1588.5, which is why in Amsterdam there's a tourist district
1588.5,1589.98, and then there's a locality district
1589.98,1591.86, where the cost of living is a lot lower.
1592.18,1595.4," But secondly, I don't believe that the cost of living going up"
1595.4,1597.64, is just unique to the cost of living going up.
1597.8,1599.38," But rather, things like eats,"
1599.6,1601.8," things like salaries and infrastructure go up with it,"
1601.8,1605.46, which means we can match the pace of inflation with the salaries.
1605.46,1611.32," But finally, I want to weigh our argumentation on things like vulnerable jobs and the general"
1611.32,1615.18, economy as a whole above this cost of living claim in four crucial ways.
1615.18,1619.76," Number one, that having a job and being employed is the prerequisite for you even caring about"
1619.76,1620.76, cost of living.
1620.76,1624.38," If you have no income, the damage of cost of living is highest for you."
1624.38,1627.62," Secondly, that high cost of living has some amount of solvency. You are"
1627.62,1631.62," helpless in getting an income out of strats as an unemployed individual, but"
1631.62,1635.06, there are many ways to do things like cut expenses or just move to another area.
1635.06,1639.64," Thirdly, high cost of living largely only applies to more rich individuals. The"
1639.64,1643.38, price increases in this debate impacts luxury goods and not everyday goods.
1643.38,1648.82," It's restaurants, not grocery stores, that are impacted. It's hotels in the city structure, not rent in"
1648.82,1653.68, the outskirts. It's the cost of living that disproportionately only impacts tourists or
1653.68,1658.36, those who are rich. The unemployment disproportionately impacts the poor. That is the impact we all
1658.36,1663.04," care about. But fourthly, that the state has some amount of more moral obligation to these"
1663.04,1665.0, individuals than they do to them.
1665.0,1670.7, Because the state is actively at fault for the reliance of these workers that they have on the tourist industry.
1670.7,1674.0," Not only did they allow for it, but they did not create good alternatives,"
1674.0,1677.2, and for years actively encouraged tourism and tourist jobs.
1677.2,1679.2, And now they're stabbing them in the back.
1679.2,1681.9, The state has a moral obligation to these vulnerable individuals.
1681.9,1684.7, That is why cost of living is unimportant in this debate.
1684.7,1687.12," Secondly, let's talk about their seasonality claim."
1687.12,1691.88," Two responses. Number one, this is structurally untreatable. Off-season"
1691.88,1695.54," vacationing is incredibly common. It's cheaper, it's less crowded, a lot of people"
1695.54,1700.34," do that. But on the flip, furthermore, we're willing to strongly encourage such"
1700.34,1703.78," policy where we encourage off-season touristing. From our frame, we tell you"
1703.78,1708.18, this is a viable alternative. The second response I want to make is that the seasonal analogy
1708.18,1712.86, claim is highly uncomparative because at worst we have a season of prosperity and a season
1712.86,1715.76, of stagnation and therefore they have constant stagnation.
1715.76,1720.6, Their third claim is that these massive gains leak out through multinational corporations.
1720.6,1728.68," We've provided to you various mechanizations from our argument. We have six of them, none of which are heavily reliant upon MNCs being"
1728.68,1732.42," willing to trickle down the economy. For example, our second mechanism, our"
1732.42,1735.84, second impact was on the shift to service industries. This means that even
1735.84,1739.6," if these corporations suck up all of the money, the fact that the"
1739.6,1743.3, economy shifts in that direction in and of itself is a benefit and in that way
1743.3,1745.32, trickle-down still does happen.
1746.9,1747.16, Let's talk about our argumentation.
1752.58,1754.82," Our argumentation gave you six reasons, six impacts why this economic benefit to tourism brings is uniquely and massively important."
1755.28,1759.14, The proposition fails to heavily engage to any of these mechanizations.
1759.14,1762.9," I think that this alone is debatable, but especially on vulnerable jobs."
1763.0,1764.18, I think that one does this debate.
1766.8,1767.16, Let's talk about culture then.
1769.88,1770.14, The claim of culture is basically tourist disrespect culture.
1771.78,1771.84, I have two layers of engagement to this.
1775.84,1776.64," Number one, that cultural importance for locals or indigenous people can still be protected in our world."
1776.88,1779.36, We can literally do things like subsidize these areas.
1779.36,1783.58," For example, the U.S. natural reserves do give communal ownership to indigenous peoples"
1783.58,1785.1, to allow them access to that.
1785.1,1790.3," But secondly, that touristy cultural sites and important cultural sites are oftentimes massively different."
1790.3,1794.0," For example, in India, people are obsessed with beautiful mosques,"
1794.0,1799.4," but the actual mosques that are regularly visited are ones that are further away, far less used, and far less touristy."
1799.4,1804.5," The second level of response is to say, well, all of this due and disrespect for cultural sites"
1804.5,1807.12, can heavily be mitigated by forms of regulation.
1807.12,1809.08, This is not just policing coming in.
1809.08,1813.6," This is also, for example, people who are visiting the site alongside you, telling you"
1813.6,1817.24, you should actually take off your shoes when you walk into a Japanese temple.
1817.24,1820.24," Now, proposition gives you various reasons why this is probably true."
1820.24,1824.42, They say things like competition or how you cannot police this or individual behavior.
1824.42,1825.76, There's two levels of engagement here.
1825.76,1829.56," Firstly, on the level of incentive, I think states have massive incentive to do this."
1829.56,1833.16," Yeah, sure, being seen as a police state is probably not that much of a good thing, but"
1833.16,1836.12, being seen as a dysfunctional state is far worse of a harm.
1836.12,1841.24," Also, you have some amount of incentive to cater to your voters who hold you accountable,"
1841.24,1843.94, which means you do have to care about your citizen population.
1843.94,1848.48," The second level of response, on the level of capacity, it's actually fairly easy to regulate this."
1848.48,1853.84," Just find people more, or just get more people, just get more police, or in the case of slum tourism,"
1853.84,1859.12," just ban things like gambling. I don't think it's that hard, I think we've proven capacity."
1859.12,1863.2," Finally, on the environment, they say two things, we have three responses."
1863.2,1869.5," Number one, that the delta is massively small, that at best they just limit tourism, some"
1869.5,1870.5, harms still go true.
1870.5,1874.9," Secondly, we can regulate this, please use paper rather than plastic, those are policies"
1874.9,1878.76," that are being implemented in the status stone, states have massive incentive to do so."
1878.76,1882.96," And thirdly, I don't think this impact is as important or as positive as the varying"
1882.96,1884.9, other economic impacts we've given you.
1884.9,1887.8, These are unique impacts that are only manifesting under tourism.
1887.8,1889.8, I think that this takes this debate.
1889.8,1893.3," I want to run an extending argument in my last minute then, on liberalization."
1893.3,1897.3, There are three reasons why liberalization happens when tourism is massive.
1897.3,1903.8," Number one, a large influx of tourists puts a big and immediate pressure to relax urgent policies that are oppressive and conservative."
1903.8,1907.7," Because when governments continue to get massive revenue from the tourist industry, they have to maintain"
1907.7,1910.32, this positive image and avoid international backlash.
1910.42,1910.88, Look at Qatar.
1911.48,1916.72," Secondly, active tourism necessitates easing of restrictive laws and implementation of"
1916.72,1922.14, consistent policies as authorities face challenges in selectively enforcing regulations on tourists.
1922.42,1926.26," Initially, authorities may try to say, well, tourists, you don't have to follow these laws,"
1926.26,1928.56," but at some point, the influx of tourists"
1928.56,1929.4," is going to be too much,"
1929.4,1932.1, governments will have to make liberal black-ed policies.
1932.1,1933.92," Thirdly, on normalization,"
1933.92,1935.94, when tourists openly engage in behaviors
1935.94,1937.5," that are restricted or stigmatized,"
1937.5,1940.0," such as same-sex relationships or liberal dress codes,"
1940.0,1941.92," it gradually normalizes these behaviors,"
1941.92,1944.5, and all of this leads to softened local prejudices
1944.5,1945.52, and inclusive policies.
1945.62,1950.96," This looks like, for example, Saudi Arabia's introduction of tourist visas being accompanied by social reforms"
1950.96,1953.72, like women being allowed to travel without male gardens.
1953.72,1957.46," This looks like Bangkok, which is a renowned destination for LGBTQ tourists,"
1957.46,1960.84, where it could have never have evolved in this way if it weren't for tourism.
1960.84,1967.56," This is important not only because it benefits the larger society in forms of freedoms but also for the most vulnerable minorities, LGBTQ"
1967.56,1970.98," individuals, women who suffer in conservative societies. Liberalization is"
1970.98,1974.44," massively important for the tourists, for the economy, for the vulnerable"
1974.44,1983.22, individuals of public. The burden of the opposition was quite high. They couldn't depend upon the already existing benefits of tourism as they are right now.
1983.22,1986.42, What they needed to justify was why over tourism
1986.42,1988.8," was likely A, going to continue those benefits"
1988.8,1990.34," in a way that is sustainable,"
1990.34,1992.56," but B, wouldn't have any adverse effects"
1992.56,1994.58, in the instances in which they do fail.
1994.58,1996.78, Given the fact that we've had two speeches
1996.78,1998.68, from the opposition side that haven't provided
1998.68,2000.52," justification for any of these things,"
2000.52,2003.2, it's quite clear that your ballot goes to Team South Africa.
2003.2,2004.8, Two questions that I'm going to be asking
2004.8,2012.72," with interactions. The first is on economic benefit, the second is on cultural harm. But before that, I just want to deal with a couple of things in terms of context in this draft."
2012.72,2025.6," Firstly, on the context between developing nations versus developed nations. Let's assume that this case takes place in the world of the opposition, where we specifically look at developing nations. Why exactly do we think that this is bad? We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the opposition, where we specifically look at development in Singapore. Why exactly do we think that this is bad?"
2025.6,2029.9, We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the shocks
2029.9,2032.2, that they are likely going to be facing on their side.
2032.2,2033.8, Two reasons why that's the case.
2033.8,2038.6, The first is because the majority of the benefit that they get on their side is likely going to be seasonal.
2038.6,2044.1, That is to say that you only get a minimal income in the season in which tourism is most likely going to be affected.
2044.1,2047.72, In the cases in which they want to derive the off-season benefit.
2047.94,2051.84," We don't think that the majority of people visit the majority of these countries in off-seasons,"
2051.98,2055.82, mainly because of the fact that the conditions that allow them to go there aren't necessarily
2055.82,2056.36, there.
2056.42,2059.14, So they cannot enjoy natural beauty because of extreme weather.
2059.24,2063.38, They cannot enjoy the things that they currently claim are going to be true in that regard.
2063.74,2067.74," But second, in the case of natural disasters, things like COVID and all of those things,"
2068.0,2071.7, they have to accept the fact that the majority of the economy under their world is likely
2071.7,2072.48, going to be stopping.
2072.8,2076.66, This means that a majority of the income that you will be having in that regard is going
2076.66,2077.54, to be taken away.
2077.76,2081.04," But furthermore, that means more economic adversity for these countries."
2081.36,2085.0," You say shells and the mountains suffered during COVID, mainly because the fact that"
2085.0,2087.0, their main source of income wasn't protected.
2087.0,2092.0," That means on their side, they're most likely going to have far worse incentives and far"
2092.0,2094.0, worse impacts for these countries in the first place.
2094.0,2097.0," On the comparative, why exactly are we there?"
2097.0,2101.0," On our side, we can have multiple avenues of growth that we can utilize for economic"
2101.0,2106.46," stability, things like retail stores and things like having to train individuals in order to ensure economic growth."
2106.64,2113.4," Second question on the strategy of this draft. Firstly, they've said to us that there is going to be some level of regulation."
2113.4,2118.08," But here's the thing, they need to prove a whole lot more in order to ensure that this is going to be true."
2118.08,2120.92, Because let's just dissect the logic. If they say that
2121.1,2125.28," tourists have so much money that they're willing to be spending on these very same countries,"
2125.28,2127.68," they're most likely going to be spending it on that regulation,"
2127.98,2133.38, and they're still going to be getting away with the majority of the problems that exist within those countries.
2133.62,2137.32," So if it is that they're littering, they're going to be paying those fines what they're."
2137.44,2141.4, They don't actually provide a mechanism towards which they can actually regulate
2141.4,2144.84, the majority of these problems that exist within their world in the first place.
2144.98,2149.34," First class then, on the economy. Here, I want to deal with the three key points that"
2149.34,2153.34, they give us. They firstly tell us that tourists spend a lot of money and that benefits the
2153.34,2157.36," majority of these countries. Secondly, they tell us on their side that on our side we're going to"
2157.36,2162.74," have a lot of like job losses. But lastly, they tell us that you can have like government resources"
2162.74,2166.5, and like diminishing inishing on our core.
2166.5,2170.5," First point, on the idea that tourists spend much more money on theirs."
2170.5,2172.5, Two reasons why this is bad.
2172.5,2178.5," First, because foreign currency tends to harm the locals and their ability to actually participate in the economy."
2178.5,2183.0, That is to say that the nature of foreign currency is often inflammatory in nature.
2183.0,2185.12, That is to say that they inflate prices and
2185.12,2190.08, like increase and decrease competition. That's to say there's a higher bonding power that is given
2190.08,2194.64, specifically to tourists that is taken away from locals. So that's to say that an Airbnb for a
2194.64,2198.88, tourist might have been a home for a local and that means that they don't actually get that benefit
2198.88,2203.2, under their will. But certainly a majority of tourists don't invest specifically into public
2203.2,2205.2, transport and public services as they claim.
2205.42,2209.48," This is because of the fact that in tourism, you've had multiple alternatives that have"
2209.48,2211.28, been given in order to ensure profit.
2211.54,2215.36, That's why Airbnbs have been available as opposed to hotels specifically.
2215.78,2219.1," This means that on their side, they don't actually get that benefit going specifically"
2219.1,2223.32," to the government, but rather to companies that exist in order to exacerbate tourism"
2223.32,2224.1, under their vault.
2224.34,2229.44, That kind of incentive quite literally takes away the economic benefit they might have been getting in the first place.
2229.44,2234.44, The second thing that they tell us is that we're most likely going to have a lot of job loss on our own.
2234.44,2238.28, Why exactly do we still have the capacity to have jobs on our own?
2238.28,2244.08," There are two distinct reasons, and this also deals with the capacity to have alternative avenues of income."
2244.08,2250.0, Why? Because there is a large scale of natural resources that can exist and can be utilized for specific benefits.
2250.0,2255.0," So for example, the Seychelles invested in fisheries when they realized that tourism wasn't working out for them."
2255.0,2263.0, That meant that you can unlock a labor capacity that doesn't actually provide or doesn't actually depend on tourism in the first place.
2263.0,2265.3," Second, on Earth, you have a massive labour pool"
2265.3,2267.46, that can be unlocked through vocational training.
2267.66,2270.5, This is important because almost every developing nation
2270.5,2273.52, has prioritised this because of the fact that they realise
2273.52,2275.92, that this massive labour pool is something that is likely
2275.92,2278.22, going to be much more effective under our law.
2278.32,2278.88," No, thank you."
2279.06,2281.64," Second, I'm going to ask you a question on why exactly"
2281.64,2283.6, they themselves don't have jobs.
2283.88,2290.38," One, because of the fact that diminishing returns decrease the capacity for you to have a job in the first place. That is to say"
2290.38,2296.48," that companies, specifically tourist agencies, tend to outsource jobs to alternative needs and"
2296.48,2300.3, to alternative individuals apart from locals. This is because of the fact that they have the
2300.3,2304.72," opportunity to cut costs, but furthermore, they have the opportunity to exploit individuals"
2304.72,2309.06," under their own. But secondly, there's a whole lot more competition under their own. That"
2309.06,2313.36," is to say that the tourism sector, if it is that they claim, is such low skill, that means"
2313.36,2316.68, that you're most probably going to have a lot of individuals competing for those very
2316.68,2322.12," same industries. 60 million people live in South Africa, yet only 5,000 of them are employed"
2322.12,2327.84, by Airbnb. That very same gap leads to more people being unemployed under their world.
2327.84,2330.24, They have to deal with this problem specifically.
2330.24,2333.76, Last question on the idea of loss of government resources.
2333.76,2336.24," They tell us here that you're going to be losing FDI,"
2336.24,2338.32, but you're also going to be losing tourism.
2338.32,2338.72, What?
2338.72,2342.4, The majority of the benefits from tourism go specifically to major MNCs.
2342.4,2347.32," That is to say that you have over-cent centralization of these industries, specifically in capital cities."
2347.32,2349.6," So cities like Hanoi, quite literally had about"
2349.6,2352.78, 50 McDonald's and 50 Starbucks in every single corner
2352.78,2353.62, that you turn.
2353.62,2356.24," So majority of the benefits don't go to local industries,"
2356.24,2358.24, but rather go to huge MNCs that exist
2358.24,2359.14, like they want.
2359.14,2362.32," But second, FDI comes specifically through things"
2362.32,2363.86, like trade of resources.
2363.86,2368.6," You get that when you look at various other industries, as opposed to tourism, who already"
2368.6,2373.02, gave you the fact that you have a large number of resources that exist under our wall that
2373.02,2373.86, can be unlocked.
2374.08,2377.1, So that very same benefit isn't exclusive to their wall.
2377.26,2379.86," Before I move into the second class then, sure, I'll take it."
2380.34,2384.66, Things like vocational training can only be done with substantial amounts of money.
2384.76,2389.56, That money is uniquely available when we have a tourist industry to fund vocational training.
2389.56,2390.24, Here's the thing.
2390.24,2394.96," One, we already have some levels of infrastructure like universities that exist within developing nations"
2394.96,2398.16, and developed nations that can provide that training in the first place.
2398.16,2402.4," But secondly, once you prioritize other industries, they're likely going to be growing to the extent"
2402.4,2409.2," where you can have that vocational training and to exponentially grow in either case, the same way tourism drew in the past few years."
2409.2,2413.68, Second class then on cultural preservation. Two points that they give us. The first is that you
2413.68,2419.52, can relax certain laws under their order to like create a sense of normality. What? The majority
2419.52,2426.24, of these countries literally used tourism as a front for their own abuses. Qatar literally used slavery
2426.24,2432.3, as a means to hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022. They cannot claim that this is a benefit that is
2432.3,2436.08," normal, mainly because of the fact that this is something that allows for these governments to"
2436.08,2440.86," continue exploiting individuals. Post the FIFA World Cup, Qatar remained the same, similar with"
2440.86,2445.0," Russia in 2018. But second, if these governments are so oppressive,"
2445.0,2448.0, they can survive without those tourists in the first place.
2448.0,2451.0, They don't provide a unique mechanism as to why exactly tourism
2451.0,2454.0, means that these countries automatically change the majority of the incentives.
2454.0,2457.0," If they're oppressive, they don't care about alternative actors."
2457.0,2460.0, That's why sanctions in majority cases didn't work in those countries.
2460.0,2462.0," By the end of this debate, two things are true."
2462.0,2466.68, The first is that over-tourism and the benefits of over-tourism are things that they haven't
2466.68,2468.68, proven and that they won't specifically.
2468.68,2472.78," But secondly, there are alternatives to over-tourism that have worked previously and can work now"
2472.78,2473.78, properly.
2473.78,2479.44, The best timing we know when a team loses a debate is when they decided to drop an entire
2479.44,2483.28, argument when we gave you from second and when we explained to you that this is the
2483.28,2484.28, most important.
2484.28,2488.0," The first thing I want to do is I want to bring back our third argument, or second argument,"
2488.0,2492.72," that we gave you from safety about liberalization, which gave themselves drop at this point in time."
2492.72,2496.64," We tell you that the LGBTQ couples being able to get accepted in the public,"
2496.64,2502.24, or the increase in solo female travelers prompted in India as a result of this kind of like tourism
2502.24,2509.6, and over tourism and the pressure towards the government uniquely exists in all sides of the house because liberalization is only going to happen when the
2509.6,2514.72, government is pressured by the international like people that have liberal values. Why is this
2514.72,2518.72, likely to be a hidden point? Obviously this is because they do need to bite the bullet on their
2518.72,2522.4, side of the house and say that the defense and significant limitation and see that the
2522.4,2528.5, substantial decrease in the number of visitors will exist. Which means that this substantial number of people pressuring the government to act is
2528.5,2532.36, incredibly important because there is also a higher countervailing incentive to want
2532.36,2534.6, to keep these traditional ideas.
2534.6,2537.34, Older generations would always want to justify that homosexuality.
2537.34,2538.34, It's the same.
2538.34,2541.66, People would always want to say that marriage should only be decided by men.
2541.66,2548.46, This is why when 40 million people actually swerve into the government only when the government is dependent on the tourism
2548.46,2552.66," industry, only when the government needs those tourists and industry to actually"
2552.66,2555.3," gain those kind of things to begin with, that is at the point in which"
2555.3,2558.48, liberalization will actually want to happen which is why at this point in
2558.48,2561.76, time they're losing already. The weighing of this argument is really simple because
2561.76,2568.12," the severity of the harm of this argument is extreme. Because note, things like environmental degradation and things like, let's say, like, I don't"
2568.12,2572.76," know, economy, I think, for example, environment presumably exists to an extent on either side"
2572.76,2574.24, of the house when we talk about degradation.
2574.24,2578.44," But when it comes to things like LGBTQ individuals not being able to accept it in public, that"
2578.44,2580.44, is something that actually comes at a cost of their existence.
2580.44,2585.44, This is why I think this is one of the most important arguments for the debate.
2585.44,2587.44," Now, let's talk about the clarification of this."
2587.44,2591.08," Firstly, I want to look at the strategy of the proposition team in this debate, because"
2591.08,2596.38," what they're saying is that tourism sucks in the abstract, but for the most tourism-reliant"
2596.38,2601.76," countries, like say, Shell or Maldives, Maldives for example, I think this industry did play"
2601.76,2608.24," an important role to begin with, and I think their side of the house saying how these amenities are exploitative to begin with"
2608.24,2613.28," does not distract from the fact that Maldives, like 80% of the countries, are in fact dependent"
2613.28,2618.0, on the economy of the tourism industry and that they need those industries for them to operate
2618.0,2622.0," to begin with. Secondly, let's talk about the context of this debate. They think that the"
2622.0,2627.52," tourism in this debate most likely takes place in developed countries. They give you three structural reasons for this. Firstly,"
2627.74,2632.88," this is not true, especially in Turkey, Ireland and Seychelles, Macau, Jamaica, all intuitively"
2632.88,2637.02," does have a tourism industry. Second of all, the structural reason why our claim is more"
2637.02,2642.02, true is that those kind of tourism industry oftentimes don't require industrialization
2642.02,2646.32," to begin with. Those things like historical monuments, or things like the nature that you have that"
2646.32,2651.44," actually appeal against tourism, like tourists to begin with, those things are things that"
2651.44,2656.04," are uniquely have without the industrialization to begin with, which is why I think developing"
2656.04,2658.76, countries are going to be the context of this debate as well.
2658.76,2662.12, Their attempt to out-frame their developing country and say that developed countries is
2662.12,2667.8, the context of this debate is also terribly unstrategic for them insofar as diversification and things like that already
2667.8,2669.98, exist in the United States of America.
2669.98,2674.18," But even if the context of developed countries is more likely, our claim stands true and"
2674.18,2678.8, we are willing to weigh this argument over theirs insofar as this is the most likely
2678.8,2683.4, delta in the debate insofar as Maldives and those countries are inherently reliant on
2683.4,2684.4, those tourism industries.
2684.4,2689.2," Therefore, the biggest burden that they needed to prove in this debate is why these vulnerable"
2689.2,2693.38, nations have the capacity to transition into a diversified economy.
2693.38,2697.92, But here's when it gets very damaging for them because they prove in the absence of
2697.92,2702.76," the tourism industry that other industries will arise, but they do not prove why the"
2702.76,2705.16, diversification is likely to happen.
2710.34,2712.36," This is important, because a lot of the developing countries have other industries, but those industries are one of cultural economy."
2712.68,2717.92," This looks like, let's say, you having resources, you having another manufacturing labor, which"
2717.92,2722.62," has meant that their claim cannot be won on diversification, because they never proved"
2722.62,2725.12," why, in the absence of tourism"
2725.12,2730.62, diversification will magically happen overnight which is why their claim is gone.
2730.62,2734.7, The third clarification I want to make is that they never prove why our model is going
2734.7,2738.24, to be effective and their model is the only way to solve all the problems.
2738.24,2742.76," In Italy for instance, finding incarceration is able to prevent individuals from accessing"
2742.76,2749.16," through things like vandalization and they they say this is not perfect, but I think their model is also not perfect when they"
2749.16,2751.16, say things like disrespect that culture.
2751.16,2755.54, It's up to me why 40 million people becoming 10 million people is going to actually solve
2755.54,2756.54, these problems to begin with.
2756.54,2761.16," Before I move on to the passage of the POI, places like the Seychelles and Maldives are"
2761.16,2762.94, under threat due to climate change.
2762.94,2766.92, What solution would you provide when the tourism industry is under threat to climate change?
2766.92,2769.3, So we cannot magically solve the problem.
2769.3,2771.18," The point is, in the comparative,"
2771.18,2773.92," in the absence of tourism, countries like Maldives,"
2773.92,2776.66, countries like South Shelf are going to suffer the most.
2776.66,2778.36, First class on job losses.
2778.36,2780.76, This stands both in the context of developing countries
2780.76,2781.78, and developed countries.
2781.78,2783.8, The first thing they see is that we need to actually do
2783.8,2785.24, things like vocational training.
2785.24,2789.76," Obviously, yes, but this can only be done on our side of the house, when we can actually"
2789.76,2793.6, have a substantial income and actually have a substantial influx of money.
2793.6,2797.0, When we can tell you three mechanisms as to why those countries and those tourists are
2797.0,2800.56, likely to spend money when foreign currencies are actually to come.
2800.56,2803.76, That is at the point in which we can actually do vocational training more on our side of
2803.76,2804.76, the house.
2804.76,2808.46, The government has an incentive to do this because they want voters and they want appealed voters
2808.46,2809.46, to begin with.
2809.46,2813.72, The second thing they see is that it doesn't trickle down to the bottom of the people and
2813.72,2816.06, the local individuals to respond to fear.
2816.06,2817.68," Firstly, no, it does trickle down."
2817.68,2818.68, It happens.
2818.68,2820.68, I think our first argument already proves this.
2820.68,2824.54," But secondly, I think this is uncomparative to begin with because all of the foreign direct"
2824.54,2829.0, investment problems that they have identified symmetrically exist in either side of the house.
2829.0,2832.0, It's unclear to me whether they were listening to Seiji's speech.
2832.0,2845.76," And I think Seiji gives you four main mechanisms as to why this job loss is the most important argument in the debate, especially when compared to their argument on the Boston thing like cost of living, which is why I think this still is our path to victory."
2845.76,2848.5," Finally, let's talk about the economic development."
2848.5,2853.38," Our claim in this debate was really simple, that this economic failure will lead to massive"
2853.38,2856.6, job loss for people in the service sector and tourism sector.
2856.6,2860.92," Numerically, the number of people decreasing from 40 million to 10 million, this means"
2860.92,2865.38," that given that the number of customers drastically falls, big companies have to lower"
2865.38,2869.12, the salaries of their workers and they have to lay off individuals who are working at
2869.12,2870.12, the bottom of their corporate ladder.
2870.12,2871.12, That is the people that they need to defend and anticipate.
2871.12,2877.12, The first thing they see is that other countries will develop and other industries will develop
2877.12,2878.12, and diversify.
2878.12,2882.68," Firstly, let's say again, USAID is out of the debate, but secondly, they don't have"
2882.68,2888.46," methods to compete with other developed countries for things like industrialization hasn't still happened, but secondly, I think"
2888.46,2892.28, tourism is much more unique because I think historical monuments and things like that
2892.28,2894.24, does not require you to have machines.
2894.44,2898.76," The second thing they say is that, oh, this is short-term and it's really uncreditable"
2898.76,2899.56, to begin with.
2899.72,2901.16, I have like two responses to begin with.
2901.44,2904.8," Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons,"
2904.8,2905.68," for example, for two reasons. I have two responses to begin with. Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons for"
2905.68,2906.68, two reasons.
2906.68,2910.72," One, because I think there are different allures and attractions in different seasons to begin"
2910.72,2911.72, with.
2911.72,2916.12," But secondly, when it's like let's say Hawaii for example, I think people would want to"
2916.12,2920.32," go to let's say winter because if relatively less people go to winter, you can actually"
2920.32,2924.88," go to different places at the same time, which is why I think their claim is not standing."
2924.88,2927.42," But even if it is short-term, it is unpredictable."
2927.74,2931.08," I think one thing that they have yet to prove in this debate is the comparative, because"
2931.08,2935.96," yes, it might be unpredictable, but they never proved why their comparative industry is better,"
2936.22,2939.98, which is why I think just because saying that these individuals were harmed in the COVID-19
2939.98,2942.08, crisis is not going to be enough for them.
2942.38,2943.4, The way in here is simple.
2943.4,2945.04, The reason why I think this beach out their claim against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is not going to be enough for them. The reign here is simple. The reason why I think this
2945.04,2949.4, beat out there clean up against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is
2949.4,2953.3," not a harm, right? If we say that things like salaries are going to rise as a result of it,"
2953.42,2957.6," I think they are able to actually cope against the cost of living, which is why I think the most"
2957.6,2961.52," vulnerable context of this debate, countries like Moldova, countries like Seychelles are going to"
2961.52,2965.0," win us the debate. For all those reasons, teams of countries exist to debate."
2966.0,2968.0," I am going to talk about three clashes,"
2968.0,2972.0, but I want to note two things that is going to entirely win us this debate from the very beginning.
2972.0,2976.0," Firstly, all of the harms proposed by Shinburi is to some extent true."
2976.0,2978.0, They do exist.
2978.0,2980.0, Overtourism is in some way harmful.
2980.0,2982.0," But all of those harms can be heavily mitigated,"
2982.0,2985.0," if not entirely eliminated, through regulation."
2985.0,2988.78, And we proved to you both the incentive and capacity to do so from second speaker to no
2988.78,2991.1, engagement after two speeches from their bench.
2991.1,2993.12, I think it is far too late from reply.
2993.12,2996.44," The second reason why we take this debate at the very top, even before the clashes,"
2996.44,2999.24, is because liberalization was entirely unengaged too.
2999.24,3002.58," I said this in my speech, no engagement from their bench."
3002.58,3005.0, I think not to weighs this beautiful liberalization
3005.0,3009.0," even if it is an extreme impact, even if this impacts only one, two countries."
3009.0,3013.0," I think that this is an impact worth caring about, these people ought to be cared for."
3013.0,3014.0, Three questions then.
3014.0,3018.0," Firstly, I want to talk about the economy, but I want to note two things about their"
3018.0,3020.0, outlandish claims at the beginning.
3020.0,3023.0," The two claims I want to note is firstly, that the money leaks out through MNCs."
3023.0,3025.5," To some extent, this is true. We have to accept that."
3025.5,3026.5, The problem with this is twofold.
3026.5,3030.9," One, that we've given you mechanization to prove to you that trickle-down in some"
3030.9,3032.9, way does exist.
3032.9,3036.86," And secondly, that this is an uncomparative claim, that any other MNC that comes into"
3036.86,3041.1," the country in their world, in any other industry, is still going to lead to the leaking out"
3041.1,3042.1, of the economy.
3042.1,3044.1, Let's also talk about their claim on the over-reliance.
3044.1,3049.0," Yes, we are to some extent over-reliant, but this is again an intensely uncomparative claim"
3049.0,3055.0, when their comparative is to shift the economy into another industry and to just be as over-reliant
3055.0,3056.0, on that.
3056.0,3060.0," And yes, tourism industry was massively harmed by COVID, but so was every other industry."
3060.0,3063.0," With that said then, I want to talk about two far more important sub-clashes."
3063.0,3066.36," First, on jobs. Are there jobs in our world?"
3066.36,3068.6, They say two reasons why this is untrue.
3068.6,3070.76," From our first speaker, we flip all of this."
3070.76,3075.12," We tell you that things like service industries, training, vocational training, state support"
3075.12,3079.12, can only exist in our world where the tourist industry is in some way successful.
3079.12,3081.2," Therefore, there are jobs in our world."
3081.2,3084.4," On the comparative then, are jobs going to exist in proposition?"
3084.4,3089.82," We say no, and the response to just do vocational training isn't a valid alternative when"
3089.82,3094.62, the poorest individuals who are only employed in our world are absolutely messed up because
3094.62,3099.24," they can't access vocational training in their world. And secondly, it's unclear what"
3099.24,3103.62, money they're doing this vocational training with when Seychelles is incredibly poor. This
3103.62,3107.12," means that this argumentation, which I weighed for four mechanisms from my speech"
3107.12,3108.84," alone, can run as this debate."
3108.84,3110.84, This is more important than any other claim.
3110.84,3113.18, Let's also talk about this claim on displacement.
3113.18,3115.66, We outframed and outweighed this argumentation for a second.
3115.66,3118.24, I don't think it stands and the web didn't bother extending.
3118.24,3122.56," Finally, and thirdly, on seasonality, we proved to you that this is not only untrue but also"
3122.56,3127.24," comparatively better in our world, but it's also wrong here why this is so especially bad."
3127.24,3130.96, Like ski resorts earn all of their money in the winter and have enough money there to
3130.96,3132.82, carry them through the next year.
3132.82,3136.88," This means that seasonality is not an inherent harm, they have to prove to you it's harmful."
3136.88,3139.58, Let's talk about culture in the second question.
3139.58,3142.24, We gave you three unresponded mechanisms from second speaker.
3142.24,3149.0," One, we can just subsidize culture, we can do things that allow communal ownership of it. Secondly, that tourist sites and cultural sites"
3149.0,3154.4," are vastly different. And thirdly, that people do enforce these on them by themselves, even if state"
3154.4,3159.86," regulation were to somehow fail. I think that culture is obviously our site. Finally, let's talk"
3159.86,3164.0, about the environment. The important framing of this environment argument is that this is an
3164.0,3166.88, intensely unimportant argument in the context of this debate because
3166.88,3170.9, tourism and its CO2 emission pales in comparison to a lot of other industries
3170.9,3174.24," like multinational corporations and their industrialization, cruise ships,"
3174.24,3178.18," cars, wars, all of those emit more and insofar as they're not even vouching for"
3178.18,3182.26," the entire abolishment of tourism but just simply the limitation of tourism, I"
3182.26,3191.6," don't think that this is a high-delta clash. I don't think, therefore, that proposition was adequate in proving to me that they can now magically solve the entire problem with sea levels that Maldives has."
3191.6,3193.6, This environment clash is low-Delta.
3193.6,3196.2, What is a Delta is three important things.
3196.2,3202.6," One, for conservative nations where vulnerable individuals are hung, we liberalize them in one way or another."
3202.6,3208.0," Two, for jobs, we don't put people out of business, we allow for employment to continue."
3208.0,3211.68," And thirdly, for the nation's economy, tourism is a necessity."
3211.68,3213.88," We may not want it to be so, but it is."
3213.88,3216.32," For all these reasons, proudly stand on the opposition bench."
3216.32,3217.32, Thank you.
3217.32,3221.5, The exact time you can trace that an opposition loses a debate is the point at which they
3221.5,3229.14, make an argument that is so profoundly unstrategic that they then down-bench disregard the engagement we give to you on it. Because we told you
3229.14,3233.56, why liberalisation is something that isn't going to function. We told you why countries
3233.56,3238.72," use tourism as a front to pretend as if they're liberalising and then do things like use slavery,"
3238.98,3243.28," the Kafkala system, to build up the systems that enabled that tourism in the first place."
3243.36,3246.82, And we also told you why these countries are uniquely not dependent
3246.82,3251.04, or leaning on the public perceptions of individuals in the West to survive.
3251.26,3253.92," So if Saudi Arabia is perceived to be a police state,"
3254.1,3259.18," generally we don't think the opinions of Western tourists are things that largely shifted in that regard,"
3259.28,3261.92, but we think secondly that those opinions were easily manipulated.
3261.92,3266.28," That's engagement we gave you, that's engagement that's unresponded to. And so their alternate"
3266.28,3268.24, path to victory is out of this debate
3268.24,3269.98, quickly off the top of the speech.
3270.18,3272.16," Three things then. Firstly, on context."
3272.34,3274.32," Secondly, on the economy. And lastly,"
3274.54,3276.02, on the preservation of culture.
3276.3,3278.32," Contextually speaking, we already told you"
3278.32,3280.02, why developed nations are important
3280.02,3282.02, in this debate. They aren't dependent on
3282.02,3284.14," tourism, and so the limitation when it comes"
3284.14,3289.3, to the populace generally is something that is marginal. And note then that the focus of people in
3289.3,3294.08, the nation is something that is uniquely overshadowed by headline economic figures in the state.
3294.26,3298.24," So the mayor of Paris, for instance, accepts broadly that things at the Olympics are going"
3298.24,3302.0," to happen, while not listening to the outcries of the populations that have to deal with"
3302.0,3308.0," those Western tourists on a day-to-day basis. But also, their point on this being empirically untrue just disregards the way the world functions."
3308.0,3313.0, We told you why the tourists who have the money are more likely to flood into countries
3313.0,3317.0," they're more capable or comfortable in, but we also told you why this is something that's"
3317.0,3322.0, uniquely impacted within these states. And so all of our analysis on the majority context
3322.0,3328.34," in this round is something that still stands. But secondly, don't their assumption that tourism just ceases to exist, demand still"
3328.34,3334.12," exists, that the demand side is still pretty high on our side and we're just regulating"
3334.12,3338.36," the influx of tourists within a nation, we have yet to prove why this is so disastrous"
3338.36,3340.48, when it comes to the individuals themselves.
3340.48,3344.36," So at this point then, understand that the majority context is one on our side and the"
3344.36,3347.0, individual clashes will take out the externalities.
3347.0,3352.0," On the first conversation, on the economy and the harming of people in those nations, we told you two things."
3352.0,3355.0, The first thing is that you compete with tourists for resources.
3355.0,3359.0, And note that this is something that's supported by every bit of analysis they give you on tourist spending power.
3359.0,3368.16," These people are inherently short-termists, they're able to spend your monthly wage in a week and that's what they come there to do. What is their response? The extent of their response is just tourists have"
3368.16,3372.62," different places that they're competing with individuals with. So it's not a direct competition,"
3372.62,3378.08," but largely the harms occur in different places. We gave you two responses. Firstly, on centrality,"
3378.34,3382.74," that is, you as a tourist want to be in the centre of a city where the economic activity is,"
3382.92,3388.24," where it's bustling, where the nightlife is accessible. The same center that individuals who have jobs want to be accessing"
3388.24,3392.32," as well. That creates direct competition that can't be regulated out. But secondly,"
3392.62,3397.6, note the impact of the increasing cost of land on our side. Because that doesn't just isolate
3397.6,3402.68," one area, it isolates the majority of instances where that land is going to increase in cost."
3402.78,3407.2," When Airbnb buys out a massive amount of properties, there's less properties for you to have your"
3407.2,3411.46," supermarket on, increasing your cost and ability to provide for locals. But"
3411.46,3414.88," secondly, they told you the creation of jobs is something that occurs. But we"
3414.88,3418.66, told you that you uniquely lock out alternative economies from developing.
3418.66,3422.38, You lack development of other economies because of the lack of incentives they
3422.38,3426.72, have. They don't have the necessity to generate alternative economies and they're going to ignore
3426.72,3430.62," those economies as a result. Thailand ignores its manufacturing, nascent"
3430.62,3434.46, manufacturing center because of the tourist income it generates. And as a
3434.46,3438.24," result then, we also told you that tourism is uniquely unstable because"
3438.24,3442.28," it's the first thing to go when a shock like COVID-19 happens. So sure, things are"
3442.28,3445.32," able to decrease when it comes to bad economic circumstances,"
3445.48,3447.92, but tourism is uniquely unstable in that regard.
3448.18,3449.12, Two deadlock breakers.
3449.32,3452.36," One, interest develops or decreases in the long term."
3452.52,3454.16," So like Spanish islands, for instance,"
3454.3,3455.6," had less attention on them,"
3455.78,3458.14, and that's something that means the money is less long-term.
3458.3,3461.36," But secondly, the investment in rebuilding the farms you create,"
3461.52,3463.82," like rebuilding shores from those like construction,"
3464.08,3464.84, is something that's bad.
3464.9,3466.32, So that money doesn't even get funneled down.
3466.56,3467.88," Secondly, on cultural preservation,"
3468.18,3470.32," we told you there are regulations that are panacea,"
3470.46,3473.24, and you can't regulate tourist behaviour as effectively.
3473.58,3474.98, Note then that we win on this debate
3474.98,3476.46, for the people who live in these countries
3476.46,3477.56, that we've been proud to propose.
