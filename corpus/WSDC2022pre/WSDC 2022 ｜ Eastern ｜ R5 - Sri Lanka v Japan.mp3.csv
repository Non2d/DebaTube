0.0,40.18," With that said, I'd like to call upon the first speaker for a proposition. Take my POIs and chat please."
40.18,46.08," In the US, conservative media organizations focused on the economic harms of lockdown."
46.08,51.12, Voters in conservative states then postpone lockdowns leading to thousands of preventable
51.12,56.48," COVID deaths. Technically reporting on the economic harm is not false news,"
56.48,62.24, but representing it as the only factor to consider is still dangerous because it distorts reality
62.24,70.56, through the omission of fair opposition. Our problem is that media bias results in people acting on incomplete information and
70.56,75.76, the impact of polarized media on how people engage with one another and vote.
75.76,80.92," Under a fairness doctrine, organizations would also include the view that lockdowns are necessary"
80.92,88.22, and people would then have the ability to decide what they want to prioritize instead of being fed conclusions from the very start.
88.22,89.92, Our model comes in three parts.
89.92,91.86," Firstly, fairness doctrines would mandate"
91.86,95.04," that corporately owned broadcast news media on television,"
95.04,98.06," radio, newspapers, magazines, news podcasts,"
98.06,100.24, and their social media content
100.24,102.04, would follow two main conditions.
102.04,104.76," When covering controversial issues of public importance,"
104.76,109.68," such as welfare policy and social issues, the two conditions are firstly granting equal airtime"
109.68,114.24, and coverage to differing viewpoints and secondly giving an accurate representation of those
114.24,119.04, differing viewpoints by finding the people with adequate qualification to represent them.
119.04,124.08, We recognize that it is not always possible to do this perfectly and in those instances media
124.08,125.04," organizations would provide proof of an attempt to do this perfectly. And in those instances, media organizations"
125.04,126.94, would provide proof of an attempt to do this
126.94,128.68, to the best of their abilities.
128.68,130.68," Secondly, we would mandate that equal access"
130.68,132.42, to campaign advertising and airtime
132.42,134.74, be given to candidates during elections.
134.74,136.72," Thirdly, existing media regulators"
136.72,139.36, that currently regulate hate speech and fake news
139.36,140.88, would take on this mandate.
140.88,143.42," Functionally, this would look like the FCC in the US,"
143.42,149.36," where no one party can have more than three of its five members, and the CRTC in Canada and the Press Council of India. The"
149.36,153.6, regulatory body would then flag violations and courts would finally determine that those
153.6,158.72," violations have occurred. Even when organizations technically comply with all of these elements,"
158.72,163.52," if they still show a pattern of subverting the street of fairness doctrines, we can still find"
163.52,165.52, organizations as fit by measuring
165.52,170.96, malicious intent what this is not is a state dictation of what issues organizations can cover
170.96,175.52, so they retain discretion over that before i move on into argumentation i can take a few
177.12,181.76, so the vast majority of the people within the fcc are people that either have political incentives
181.76,187.92, for the future or people who are already involved in politics. How can you ensure that your set is not going to be an unjust government intervention?
188.96,192.96," We think that most of these organizations are formed under parliamentary bills,"
192.96,197.44, so all parties have direct influence over who gets appointed into those committees
197.44,202.4, and the balancing of incentives of all those people mean that there is never an instance in
202.4,209.04, which one party has an unfair advantage leading to government abuse. I'll be proving this later with an argumentation as well.
209.04,213.64," Our first argument then is on the legitimacy of implementation. On a first level, the state"
213.64,218.52, has a direct obligation to provide balanced information because it derives its legitimacy
218.52,224.44, from individuals voluntarily giving the state the power to exert its power by making an
224.44,225.44, informed vote
225.44,229.92, the state should then attempt to facilitate this informed choice as much as possible where it is
229.92,234.64, possible on a second level then why is this individual right to an informed choice not
234.64,239.68, fully protected in status quo it is because people have limited control over what media they are able
239.68,244.56, to consume this is because they have limited time people cannot watch multiple channels at once and
244.56,248.92, research all viewpoints they have limited knowledge so People cannot watch multiple channels at once and research all viewpoints. They have limited knowledge. So dissecting data about social
248.92,253.96, issues on your own is a very laborious procedure and therefore people are not able to do it.
254.26,259.32," People also expect fair representation. So when the media reports a biased view, consumers do not"
259.32,263.74, always know that they're being denied legitimate information. So there's no accountability for it.
264.06,269.36, The right to choice is best facilitated when people form informed choices even if people willingly
269.36,274.16, choose to live in echo chambers we as a state still have a duty to uphold the overall right
274.16,279.28, to informed choice in as many instances as possible which is not possible under bias media
279.28,284.64, consumption even if you opted into it this is true even if opposition says that all opinions are
284.64,289.68, valid regardless of how people arrived at it because this ignores the fact that bias causes direct
289.68,295.2," harm to third parties. For example, if you're only exposed to racist ritual without any opposition,"
295.2,299.76, that negatively impacts the way that you see minorities and directly hurts those communities.
299.76,303.84, That is why the state should intervene. The third area of this argument is that commercial
303.84,305.56, rights are not absolute.
305.56,309.4, Speech concerning public affairs is not a direct form of expression.
309.4,313.52, It is more so a form of awareness so that people are able to govern themselves.
313.52,317.98, News media has actively abused this mandate because it is captured by private interest.
317.98,322.1, It looks like Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post and using it to whitewash the actions
322.1,323.1, of Amazon.
323.1,325.56, It looks like right-wing media being funded by the private
325.56,327.64, prison lobby like the CCA.
327.64,329.66, This bias is unjust because the media
329.66,332.48, is what bridges the gap between voting issues and voters.
332.48,334.4, Much in the same way that opposition parties
334.4,337.18," grant voting choices, it is opposing information"
337.18,339.2, that gives you the ability to think critically
339.2,340.88, and choose your political leaning.
340.88,342.88, This argument is important because we give you
342.88,344.18, three standards for the government
344.18,345.7, legitimacy in intervening.
345.7,349.5," Firstly, that the state obligation to provide balanced information exists."
349.5,353.96," Secondly, that the individual right to informed choice is better facilitated on our side of"
353.96,354.96, the house.
354.96,358.48," And thirdly, why both of those things matter more than corporate profit because media is"
358.48,359.48, a public good.
359.48,364.62, Our second argument then is on why we have a better representation of issues by reducing
364.62,365.62, polarization.
365.62,370.86," Currently in status quo, news media has little incentive to include the opposing view."
370.86,374.62, This is because they are catering to viewer bases that demand a specific political meaning.
374.62,379.56," There are also multiple sources that are reporting on limited issues, so organizations attempt"
379.56,383.12, to differentiate themselves by accusing other news media of inaccuracy.
383.12,386.0," Therefore, there is a collective action in eliminating this bias."
386.0,393.0," Studies show, for example, that around 66% of people say that news organizations in general are often inaccurate,"
393.0,396.0, but only 30% say the same about the news that they view the most.
396.0,400.0," Even when the opposing view is presented, it is often misrepresented,"
400.0,404.0, like using extreme examples of violent protests during the BLM protests
404.0,405.56, and using fundamentalists
405.56,410.3, from the far right to represent the entirety of the right wing. People then retain an unfair
410.3,414.34, characterization of the other side and there's no incentive to watch multiple channels because
414.34,419.52, they believe that that is engagement enough. This is where other forms of checking also fall short.
419.84,423.94," When it comes to fact checking, this is done retrospectively, so the damage of exposure to"
423.94,429.6, false information is already done. Even if reporting is factually correct it may still be biased and therefore
429.6,433.52, misleading like using crime rates in black neighborhoods to portray the narrative that
433.52,438.16, those places need to be over policed even declaring bias is not enough because people
438.16,442.96, will eventually discount these disclaimers because the news will still be presented as objectively
442.96,447.56, correct and they become increasingly incognizant of these declarations over time.
447.56,451.26," On a comparative, the incentives of news media organizations change."
451.26,455.64," Firstly, the media has an incentive to present the opposing view to avoid the repercussions"
455.64,460.44, of having to pay fines and damages to their reputation through the process of litigation.
460.44,464.58," Therefore, they will react to this by making structural changes, like hiring politically"
464.58,467.06, diverse journalists to produce more balanced news stories.
467.58,471.98," Secondly, we eliminate the collective action problem as all organizations have to comply."
472.38,475.34, There is an incentive for governments to be fair in how they implement this
475.34,480.22, because companies themselves can counter through the state if they think that they are being unfairly treated.
480.66,487.08," News organizations, because of their significant reach, capture public attention and therefore their scrutiny as well."
487.08,491.14," Opposition parties have an incentive for incumbent governments responsible, so the margin for"
491.14,492.14, abuse is very unlikely.
492.14,495.32, There are two impacts that follow from this.
495.32,498.38," Firstly, it becomes hard to mischaracterize opposition."
498.38,502.8," For example, you cannot conflate increasing regulation of guns with taking away gun rights"
502.8,507.2," entirely when a proponent of gun regulation has to be present on that panel,"
507.2,510.0, we can immediately correct for that misconception.
510.0,514.5, We also correct for echo chambers because echo chambers in broadcast media is eliminated
514.5,518.8, with the introduction of opposition and social media echo chambers are less damaging
518.8,521.4, because there's a counterweight to it in traditional media.
521.4,524.9," On our side, people with current biases may not entirely change,"
524.9,528.96, but the view base that we change are people that grow up consuming news on our side of the house.
528.96,533.52, They enter a media landscape that is a lot more balanced and cyclically this is beneficial as
533.52,538.0, people are more willing to engage with opposition leading to more holistic policies for everyone.
538.0,547.9," For all of these reasons, I propose. All right, I'd like to thank the speaker and I'd like to now call upon the first speaker"
547.9,549.16, for the opposition.
549.16,568.9, I'd like to confirm that I am visible and audible.
568.9,571.9, You are?
571.9,573.9, Okay.
573.9,587.32," I'd like to take verbal POIs. Starting my speech in 3, 2, 1."
587.72,595.68, Hidden beneath the lights of TV broadcasting is the shadow of political polarization and corrupt governmental incentives.
596.16,603.18, It is only through protecting the freedom of reporting that breaks apart the illusion of fairness we are proud to oppose.
603.18,606.12," Two arguments from first speaker. First,"
606.56,612.3," fairness doctrine forces people to shift to alternative media, which furthers polarization."
613.24,619.48," Second, fairness doctrine significantly hinders media's ability to report on crucial issues. But"
619.48,624.16," before that, a brief note on our stance and rebuttals to their case. What is our stance?"
624.48,625.14," Quite simply,"
625.46,630.24," we envision our world to look much like the status quo, in which the broadcasters have the freedom"
630.24,635.5," to carry out their own discretions. Therefore, we're fine with things like Fox News leaning"
635.5,641.34," slightly more towards conservative views, or CNN and BBC being by and large progressive."
642.24,646.26," Given this, three points of rebuttals from side opposition. First thing,"
646.3,651.4, I'd like to clarify that alternative media such as social media and such would not be a part of
651.4,656.96, their fairness doctrine mandate. This is because the motion reads media with significant audience
656.96,662.74, reach and also news media. We think that many media channels are consistent of little viewers
662.74,669.46," following individual channels and we think that on our side, social media and such would be claimed as alternative media."
669.88,672.38," Second thing, about the feasibility of their case."
672.82,678.18," Fairness doctrine is not necessarily a just and neutral metric, as side proposition frames it to be."
678.18,689.68, This is because the people who constitute the FCC board will be biased because they're selected by the government and they do not want to risk losing their jobs. This means that they're likely going to go with the government's
689.68,696.24," incentive. Know that government have an inherent interest in controlling information. For example,"
696.24,701.36, government have the incentive to not determine certain topics as controversial to prevent
701.36,706.18," political uprisings. For instance, abortion is never officially"
706.18,711.08," determined as controversial in the Philippines, despite the fact that many women are upset by"
711.08,716.34," this law. However, because the government is Catholic, having the media report on these issues"
716.34,721.98," will cut down on their profit. Controversy, therefore, becomes an unreliable metric because"
721.98,729.7," obviously abortion needs to be challenged, but on their side this will be determined as not controversial and not important. Final thing, responding on their"
729.7,734.68, polarization and principal claim about full information given to the people. My first argument
734.68,739.72, proves that their side has more polarization and my second argument proves that their side flushes
739.72,744.94, out less information. This directly engages with their case on perception and choice. This is
744.94,745.3, because you're going to harm people in which they're going engages with their case on perception and choice. This is because
745.3,749.76, you're going to harm people in which they're going to base their perception on the world full of
749.76,754.98," information that's extremely polarizing, but also things like incorrect statistics that are made"
754.98,760.9, without any accountability mechanism on their truth. We take down their principle because your
760.9,765.64," side fails to be shaped by even worse information, which will all be proven within my speech."
765.96,772.4," First argument, then fairness doctrine forces people to shift to alternative media, which furthers polarization."
772.96,780.06," Thesis of this argument is that people will have more incentive to opt into alternative media, which means the worst type of impacts will arise."
780.32,787.02," I'd like to clarify that there are two groups of people who will consume mainstream media. First, the majority who are moderate swing viewers."
787.28,790.26, These are the people who do not have strong political affiliation.
790.78,795.34," Second, people who politically identify with certain ideologies but are not extremists."
795.62,799.24," For example, these are the people who watch mainstream media such as Fox News."
799.52,803.92, These are the people who will be pushed away from the mainstream media and opt into alternative media.
804.18,808.82, First analysis then on why people shift to alternative media on their side of the house.
809.16,813.34," Firstly, it is uncomfortable for people to confront challenging views on a daily basis,"
813.52,815.46, which directly question their political beliefs.
815.74,819.1," But secondly, people want to have their ideas confirmed"
819.1,821.68, because it makes them feel safer and more comfortable.
822.02,824.68," If the media includes both sides, without reassurance,"
824.82,829.9," people would not know which side to necessarily believe in and feel anxious. Thirdly, people lose"
829.9,834.4, their trust in media outlets and therefore opt into alternative media sources. This empowers
834.4,838.22, political opposition claims that the state is attempting to take over the minds of people.
838.54,842.74, People on alternative media will advertise themselves as the only people who are telling
842.74,849.88, the truth will sound more convincing for people to opt into their platforms. Second analysis then on why this is harmful. Alternative
849.88,856.04," media has more propensity to escalate extremism. Firstly, because lack of accountability. Even if"
856.04,860.86," people lie and broadcast fake news on alternative media sources, they maintain their platform"
860.86,870.78," because people who opt into their channel actively by buying into the narrative. Secondly, because of media platform incentives to crater towards extremism. The reason"
870.78,875.52, for this is because in order to sustain viewership and reflect on niche political ideologies that
875.52,879.78," their viewers have, they will lean towards broadcasting in that specific direction and"
879.78,884.18," magnifying the view to take advantage. Third analysis, what is the counterfactual then?"
884.48,888.62," Mainstream media, even if they're politically biased, have a larger degree of accountability"
888.62,893.34," mechanism that keeps them in check and thus far more moderate. Two reasons why. Firstly,"
893.68,897.88, leaning to extremism is likely going to result in reduced viewership because being able to gain
897.88,902.44," few extremist viewers does not justify losing a greater number of more moderate ones. No,"
902.66,909.04," that most of the viewers that exist in status quo are more moderate. But secondly, it is also likely going to reduce corporate sponsorship"
909.04,913.94, because companies are unwilling to be associated with extremism insofar as public image impacts
913.94,918.2," their profit. This comes in ways like stock prices, right? Corporations generally do not"
918.2,921.56, want to associate themselves with extremist medias because they will lose more capital
921.56,928.96, from those who boycott their products for extremist ideologies. Fourth analysis on why this will be the tipping point. Alternative medias are the only
928.96,933.36, ones who explicitly promote discrimination and agitate violence against minority groups. For
933.36,937.88," example, active violence against racial minority mass shooting at the mosque. Given all these"
937.88,942.24," analysis, the implication of this argument is that it flips their case on the echo chamber,"
942.52,949.26," which means people become more extreme and carry out actions like hate crimes. Second argument then, on why fairness doctrine significantly"
949.26,953.96, hinders media's ability to report on crucial issues. The thesis of this argument is that
953.96,958.36, fairness doctrine will reduce media corporations' revenue and reduce capacity of the media to report
958.36,963.3, on especially minorities. Fairness doctrine reduces the revenue of media corporations for
963.3,970.48," two reasons. Firstly, media outlets will be far less attractive for sponsors since they will not be able to leverage the media to reflect their interests."
970.8,977.82," For example, on their side, Amazon would not be able to ask media outlets to not report on the breakup of GAFA since it harms their profit."
978.22,988.96," This makes it less likely on their side of the world for media outlets to receive monitored gains since corporations will resort to other ways of achieving this. Such as, launching advertisement posts on social media will become"
988.96,993.68," a cheaper alternative for corporations to gain back their lost profit. Secondly, all of the"
993.68,998.12, mechanisms that I have proven in my first argument proves that people lose the interest into mainstream
998.12,1002.9, media. This leads to media outlets losing their viewers because they are unable to make their news
1002.9,1010.96," contents intuitively interesting to watch. This results in reduced capacity of the media to report. Two things will happen. First,"
1011.1,1015.48," they have less capacity to hire reporters, establish spaces in various places, and fund"
1015.48,1020.14," long-term reporting, etc. But second, their programmers will shift away from news in favor"
1020.14,1025.36," of entertainment-oriented contents, which are more appealing, which reduces exposure to news reports."
1025.68,1031.3," Why is this important then? Three impacts. First, there won't be less reporting on underprivileged"
1031.3,1035.72," areas such as poor communities or developing countries, which reduces scrutiny on their"
1035.72,1040.14," governance as well as support to the people, for example, donation to victims of calamity."
1040.4,1046.22," But second, less long-form journalism that exposes covert problems as it takes longer and is less certain."
1046.56,1050.76," For example, corruption, sexual abuses in Catholic churches, and etc."
1051.06,1056.78," But finally, people in general are going to be less aware of current affairs on their side,"
1057.16,1061.34, both because there are less news programs and less people who watch their views.
1061.76,1065.76," Ultimately, my two arguments are able to provide why on their side"
1065.76,1070.56," they will create more polarization and more misinformation, which takes down their claim"
1070.56,1076.64, on principle. Fairness doctrine is anything but fair. I have never been so proud to oppose.
1080.5,1083.52," All right, I'd like to thank the speaker and I'd like to now call upon"
1083.52,1112.88," the second speaker for the proposition. Hi, can everybody hear me?"
1112.88,1113.88, I can.
1113.88,1114.88, Thanks.
1114.88,1197.24," I'll take PIs in chat, please. so Takk for at du så med. Thank you. On one hand, when it was convenient for them, viewers of traditional media were so intolerant"
1197.24,1201.66," of being exposed to the other side, and they said that this would create so much cognitive"
1201.66,1207.26, dissonance that they would have no other alternative but to switch to alternative media such as social media.
1207.26,1210.02," But simultaneously, when trying to justify"
1210.02,1212.72," why traditional media has better incentives,"
1212.72,1214.58, they say that those same moderates
1214.58,1216.68, don't want to lean towards extremism
1216.68,1219.04, because it means that you would likely not want to continue
1219.04,1221.06, to watch those same news organizations
1221.06,1223.72, and that corporate sponsorships would no longer exist.
1223.72,1229.26," There's a tension in the case of the opposition. Either it is true that the vast majority of viewers are moderates, in which"
1229.26,1233.86," case implementing the fairness doctrine would not drive them towards alternative media, given that"
1233.86,1238.2," they are not intolerant to being exposed to the other side. But even in their best case, where"
1238.2,1243.16," it's only a minority of individuals that are moderates, the switch towards extremism is likely"
1243.16,1245.66," to influence traditional media as well, which"
1245.66,1250.32, proves why our problem of political polarization will likely continue to exist in the world of the
1250.32,1254.34, opposition. They need to resolve this tension in the next speech. The second observation that I
1254.34,1258.54, want to make at the top of this speech is opposition's lack of a counterfactual. Given
1258.54,1263.24," that we have already preempted by any form of fact-checking or declaring biases is insufficient,"
1263.38,1267.12," which they did not respond to, the problems of political polarization,"
1267.12,1269.28, of omitting information in order to manipulate
1269.28,1271.12," and twist stories in your favor,"
1271.12,1272.98, over-reporting crime statistics
1272.98,1275.3, to try to demonize minority communities
1275.3,1276.7," and encourage over-policing,"
1277.6,1279.92, under-reporting things like the state abuses
1279.92,1281.3," through the war on drugs,"
1281.3,1284.24, doing things like selectively picking information
1284.24,1285.48, are likely to continue in the
1285.48,1289.8, world of the opposition. Given their complete lack of a counterfactual and the explicit concession
1289.8,1294.82," that they support status quo, they need to weigh why these problems aren't as significant as we"
1294.82,1298.92," portray them to be. Three areas of response in this speech. First, on the likelihood of state"
1298.92,1303.02," abuse. Second, on political politicization. Thirdly, on corporate revenue. First, on the"
1303.02,1306.9, likelihood of state abuse. They say that regulatory agencies will be biased
1306.9,1308.86, towards pandering to political parties.
1308.86,1310.86, I have a number of responses to this argument.
1310.86,1312.16, The first thing that I want to point out
1312.16,1314.34, is that their characterization of the power
1314.34,1316.92, that we give regulatory agencies is in tension
1316.92,1318.56, with the model that we presented
1318.56,1320.58, of what the fairness doctrine would look like.
1320.58,1323.9," To be clear, news organizations still have the ambit"
1323.9,1325.74, to determine what news stories they
1325.74,1330.48," report on, and the state cannot determine what is and isn't a controversial issue, which isn't"
1330.48,1334.3, something that the fairness doctrine would cover. So their example of the Philippines and the
1334.3,1338.42, government not considering certain issues to be controversial and using that to silence dissent
1338.42,1343.48," would not likely occur on either side of the house, given that neither side has the ability"
1343.48,1345.14, to dictate what news stories are
1345.14,1349.28, covered. But let's be charitable. Let's assume what they meant to say was that the state will
1349.28,1353.78, find a way to abuse the fairness doctrine to shut down news broadcasts by preventing news
1353.78,1358.44," organizations from broadcasting, even on issues that they have selected. The response that I want"
1358.44,1362.88, to make to this is that the fairness doctrine does not enable the unilateral censorship of
1362.88,1369.84," news stories by governments, because the fairness doctrine does not allow the unilateral censorship of news stories by governments because the fairness doctrine does not allow for the state censorship in the first place you cannot prevent"
1369.84,1374.32, a broadcast from airing that is critical of the government or exposes government corruption for
1374.32,1379.92, example at best the fairness doctrine can be used to compel news organizations to do things like
1379.92,1389.44," invite government pundits to share their views on these stories or to share government propaganda or the government's official stance on these particular issues. So to be clear, there is no"
1389.44,1393.98, justification under which the fairness doctrine could be used to totally silence any news reporting
1393.98,1398.92," that is critical of the government. At best, you would have to add to that news reporting something"
1398.92,1403.06," that is favorable towards the government, in which case we think that if there's strong evidence for"
1403.06,1408.4," things like state abuse or state corruption, people are still likely to be exposed to the necessary information even on"
1408.4,1412.4, our side of the house secondly i would point out that there are other political parties and
1412.4,1416.88, checking mechanisms that even in the weakest of democracies can be relied upon the independence
1416.88,1421.52, of courts in most democracies is something that exists and we think that if courts are given the
1421.52,1427.7, ability to determine whether something is in compliance with the fairness doctrine they are unlikely to want to appeal to political parties given that they
1427.7,1431.78, have lifetime appointments. Other political parties are likely to want to protect media
1431.78,1437.14, freedom given that it is these political parties that air opposition views. The third broad response
1437.14,1440.9," that I want to make is that even if there was some capacity for state abuse, the incentives"
1440.9,1449.04," of governments to not use the fairness doctrine are strong. Firstly, there is a strong fear among the public of media manipulation given the significance that we place on the"
1449.04,1454.32, importance of a free media importantly this exists even in the weakest of democracies given that in
1454.32,1458.56, most countries elections are somewhat democratic we've already seen this in their own example of
1458.56,1463.44, the philippines for example the duterte was voted out partly due to backlash surrounding his
1463.44,1465.12, campaign of media crackdowns
1465.12,1470.64, on organizations like ABS and CBN. So clearly there is a high degree of value that the public
1470.64,1475.44," places on media freedom and backlash against media crackdowns. Secondly, there's the fear"
1475.44,1480.22, that the process itself will become politicized when you as the government are not in power and
1480.22,1484.78, are the opposition party. So there's an incentive to guarantee that the process itself and regulatory
1484.78,1489.28," bodies are immune to politicization. Their own example of the FCC proves this point,"
1489.46,1494.08," because the FCC has written into its rules that out of the five members that sit on its board,"
1494.38,1497.98," none can be directly involved with the political party, and only three can even"
1497.98,1502.8, directly endorse one political party at a time. And so there's an incentive to make sure that
1502.8,1508.12, there's a balance of representation within regulatory bodies because governments come in and out of power.
1508.12,1511.5, Finally I want to flip this argument. We think that the fairness doctrine can actually be
1511.5,1515.48, used to do things like minimize state propaganda because it can be leveraged by opposition
1515.48,1520.72, parties to co-opt the viewer basis and airtime that state propaganda channels have given
1520.72,1524.52, that they can use the fairness doctrine to say that we want a balanced perspective on
1524.52,1528.64, issues even on state propaganda and state news channels and so we think that we have a counter
1528.64,1534.88, balance against um against state propaganda itself as well finally on reducing political polarization
1534.88,1538.0, they say that this will create a shift to alternative media the first thing that i would
1538.0,1542.24, point out is that there are limited instances in which we can also apply the fairness doctrine to
1542.24,1546.54," the kind of alternative media that they talk about. Look at the Ben Shapiro show, for example."
1546.54,1548.58," Perhaps it exists on social media,"
1548.58,1550.96, but functionally it is registered as a company
1550.96,1552.3, and it serves the same purpose
1552.3,1554.68, as any other news organization like CNN.
1554.68,1556.02, Courts would be able to determine
1556.02,1557.2, that the fairness doctrine applies
1557.2,1558.72, to these organizations as well.
1558.72,1560.06, But we can see that there are some shows
1560.06,1561.96, to which we wouldn't be able to apply the doctrine.
1561.96,1563.72," In those instances, I would point out"
1563.72,1568.96, that the degree of substitutability between internet shows and alternative media and traditional media is highly
1568.96,1574.56, limited hence why most extremists have not already shifted to alternative media there's a level of
1574.56,1579.04, familiar familiarity associated with traditional media given that it is what you grow up with
1579.04,1584.16, people who daily watch people like tucker carson or don king for example older people are far less
1584.16,1588.8," likely to be able to transition to social media, given that they have grown up with broadcast and traditional"
1588.8,1593.82," media, and so this switch is unlikely. Finally, even if some people switch to alternative media,"
1594.1,1598.3, the moderates that they talked about are unlikely to switch. It is true that these people dislike
1598.3,1602.48," cognitive dissonance, but they also value the trustworthiness of traditional media. Moreover,"
1602.8,1605.9, the fact that they are currently not exposed to alternative views is merely
1605.9,1607.88, a product of the fact that they don't want to exert effort.
1608.16,1609.16," Before I move on, I'll take the point."
1610.74,1614.74, So our argument isn't that we're going to use the media to alternate media.
1614.94,1618.44, Our argument is that those few individuals that do are going to do massive parts.
1618.56,1620.02, You have to engage the actual argument.
1621.06,1624.54," Those individuals would have likely shifted on your side of the house as well, given that"
1624.54,1628.64," their incentives were to have extremist views. Comparatively, we think that if the social"
1628.64,1635.04," media presence of traditional media organizations on social media itself is far less biased rather,"
1635.04,1638.72," we think that it is far more likely that on our side of the house, fewer people make the switch"
1638.72,1644.4," towards extremism. Comparatively, finally, rather on their point about corporate revenue, they say"
1648.34,1654.22, that you can no longer use money to leverage media interests. I would point out that this is probably a good thing if it means that you cannot pay for stories that show you in a favorable light.
1654.22,1661.06," It means that there's less media manipulation overall. But secondly, I would point out that no media organizations are at a competitive disadvantage,"
1661.06,1669.76, given that all of them have to comply with the fairness doctrine. to say that you no longer be profitable is untrue given that these media organizations already have widespread reach
1669.76,1673.44, we think that it is likely even if there is a reduction in their overall profits that they
1673.44,1677.44, remain profitable enough for investors to remain given the sunk cost that they have already made
1677.44,1682.16, in these organizations perhaps news media are not as well funded as we would like them to be
1682.16,1687.96," but if they are consistently reporting in a fair and balanced way, there is a trade off that we are willing to make for all of"
1687.96,1688.96, these reasons proposed.
1688.96,1698.44," All right, I'd like to thank the second proposition speaker and call upon the second opposition"
1698.44,1710.98," speaker. Hi, am I clearly audible and visible?"
1711.44,1711.66, Yep.
1714.36,1715.88, I'll take P.O.S. through chat.
1716.18,1717.92, I'll probably ask for it around my six minutes.
1723.54,1731.04," Speech will start in three, two, one. Proposition's idea of neutrality is nothing more than a facade"
1731.04,1735.68, that entrenches people further into the evils of alternative media. Even if the most important
1735.68,1740.2," issues are broadcasted on boast, the minority issues, the long-term issues that need investigative"
1740.2,1744.38, journalism is what they have to lose out on. I've never been prouder to oppose. Two sections of
1744.38,1747.36," responding to the speech, first regarding the principle, and secondly on decreasing"
1747.36,1751.66," polarization. Firstly, let's talk about the principle. Proposition says that people make"
1751.66,1755.58," better political decisions because they have more information. Three layers of response. One,"
1755.82,1760.16," this principle doesn't stand for two reasons. A, the premise of this principle is that people"
1760.16,1764.22," don't have control over the media they consume right now. I think this is false, because sure,"
1764.42,1767.56," maybe you can't watch two TV channels at once, but you can watch various"
1767.56,1771.36, TV channels in the limited amount of time spent that you have. We think their cherry-picked
1771.36,1776.04," characterization to say that people only watch BBC and status quo is unrealistic, especially in the"
1776.04,1780.7," age of information and variety. Secondly, I would rather posit to you that we are the prerequisite"
1780.7,1784.32," to their principle, because we proved in the second argument that the amount of information"
1784.32,1788.0, you have is inherently likely to decrease because you lose sponsors especially
1788.0,1792.48, the most crucial pieces of information like investigative journalism that expose the catholic
1792.48,1796.08, church sex scandals these are likely to be the ones that people have the least exposure to in
1796.08,1799.84, their daily lives in the first place second response is that we achieve their end goal of
1799.84,1803.76, the principle better which is accountability their logic here is that people expect fair
1803.76,1807.1," representation and status quo but it's not represented in the news which is accountability. Their logic here is that people expect fair representation and status quo, but it's not represented in the news, which is why there's"
1807.1,1811.9," a lack of accountability. We're happy to concede that most media is not biased right now, because"
1811.9,1816.68," if it was literally as extreme as they want to characterize, people would probably already call"
1816.68,1820.86, it out. I would flip this argument and say that people don't expect fair representation right now
1820.86,1827.8," because the fairness doctrine is not implemented. Rather, on their side, uniquely create this false perception that the FCC has an incentive"
1827.8,1831.38, to make this fair doctrine seem effective and people have a perception that the fairness
1831.38,1832.92, doctrine is working.
1832.92,1836.78," This policy then keeps audiences from critically thinking about the news they consume, whereas"
1836.78,1840.34," on our side, consumers are aware and know that the news they're receiving is biased,"
1840.34,1842.76, which means they're more likely to do things like research on their own.
1842.76,1843.76," Thirdly, of response."
1843.76,1848.06," Even if this is true, we don't think it is just for a third-party intervention to happen to decide"
1848.06,1853.18," what is controversial or problematic. Insofar as it does not fit three criterias. Firstly, unlike"
1853.18,1857.92," what the proposition side asserts, this bias does not cause harm to third parties. Secondly, it is"
1857.92,1862.38, not false information which is already banned in status quo. The more likely characterization is
1862.38,1869.0," that this is probably going to look things like increased value to tax or hosting national funeral of Abe Shinzo, which is likely to be the more"
1869.0,1873.12," controversial issues in the status quo. But thirdly, it is inherently speculative as to what"
1873.12,1877.92, information is correct or beneficial to democracy. It is then unjust for the government to decide and
1877.92,1881.7, limit what people's communities and voices look like and how they want to represent their viewpoints
1881.7,1885.86," online. Thus, regardless of the practical outcome, it is an unjust intervention."
1886.36,1888.22," Secondly, let's talk about decreasing polarization."
1888.84,1890.64, Proposition says they decrease polarization
1890.64,1892.14, because you show opposing views.
1892.42,1892.98, Three responses.
1893.44,1895.88," Firstly, I want to characterize what media looks like"
1895.88,1897.04, on both sides of the house.
1897.4,1899.56," Notice that this directly responds to their case,"
1899.76,1900.92, which is premised on the idea
1900.92,1902.74, that media in status quo is terrible
1902.74,1909.98," and that makes people act in irrational ways. Our responsive characterization here is twofold. A, that even if media is slightly left"
1909.98,1914.12," or right leaning in status quo, they are not as extremist to the extent that proposition claims."
1914.46,1918.88, Notice that they have very little characterization as to why media companies in status quo have an
1918.88,1923.54," incentive to cater towards people with limited views, which is a smaller number of people."
1923.76,1925.0, I think that's counterintuitive.
1925.38,1929.26," I would posit to you that in order for media companies to make profit, they need to cater"
1929.26,1933.32," towards the moderates because that's where the vast majority of their audiences lie. But secondly,"
1933.52,1937.38, that there's a long and overriding incentive to not be extreme because they will be called out
1937.38,1942.32," by individuals. This is because false information, anti-minority sentiment diminishes credibility,"
1942.32,1947.56," and the potential of money that they could earn in the long term is taken away, which means they're likely to do things like cross-check"
1947.56,1951.94," and peer review on our side. Secondly, even if you don't buy this, for the vast majority of"
1951.94,1956.3," individuals who are moderate by the definition that they're a moderate, there is a multiplicity"
1956.3,1960.94," of other factors such as nationalized education, increased exposure to information and status quo"
1960.94,1967.94," on a digital age, or having friends from various different backgrounds that deter people from being extremists in the first place, which means the likelihood of this"
1967.94,1972.48, slightly biased information making them make bad decisions in politics is unlikely in the first
1972.48,1976.42, place. The only way that second proposition responds to this is by pointing out that there
1976.42,1981.48, is a tension. Let me not. This is not a tension. We're telling that the vast majority of individuals
1981.48,1986.96," are moderates, but for those few people that are extremists that become further entrenched in their eco-chambers in alternative media,"
1987.18,1991.0, they do worse harm compared to the marginal benefit that they bring. This proves that media
1991.0,1995.08, on our side is likely to stay within an acceptable range and that their characterization is unlikely.
1995.56,1999.02," Secondly, let's flip the premise of their argument, because even if we can see that"
1999.02,2003.18," information is biased on our side, I would posit to you that the forms of bias you receive on"
2003.18,2007.66," proposition is worse, and this is where we're going to introduce our new substantive argument on how the neutrality"
2007.66,2011.68, proposition supports is inherently biased to government influence. Three layers of analysis.
2012.16,2015.96," Firstly, the premise of this argument is that media can get captured by dominant political"
2015.96,2020.42, parties. This is because the evaluation of what is controversial is likely to be determined by
2020.42,2027.38, the state because states inherently have a lot of media control. It's unclear why the FCC has enough power to be able to implement this in every single
2027.38,2028.38, country.
2028.38,2031.36, Proposition does not have fiat to say this is likely to be effective.
2031.36,2034.92," We think rather because governments have a lot of media control, they're likely to be"
2034.92,2039.44, able to pretend controversial topics are non-controversial and specifically regarding things like scandals
2039.44,2043.2," or voter frauds, they can portray those issues as non-controversial because it's likely to"
2043.2,2044.68, directly harm them.
2044.68,2048.4, This is bad because governments have perverse incentives to hide up their failures and decrease
2048.4,2052.48, backlash towards them. Prop First tries to model this out by saying there's going to be formed a
2052.48,2057.28," parliamentary bill. Two responses. A, this is unlikely and they need to prove why and why they"
2057.28,2064.96," have the capacity to do so. Secondly, this accountability mechanism that they say exists"
2064.96,2067.54," on their side does not work, because the way in which"
2067.54,2072.94, governments influence media is invisible. Things like tweaking how news media companies collect
2072.94,2077.14," stats, pressuring news media companies to say that they're going to stop funding them if they do not"
2077.14,2081.08, support their views. These are likely to be things that are done behind a screen. Second proposition
2081.08,2088.0," then asserts that courts exist, but courts are part of the state, and a lot of the big issues that we're talking about are abuses that happen within the court as well."
2088.0,2092.0, There is high likelihood the judges within the court are also likely to be biased.
2092.0,2107.92," So our argument isn't that democracy or voting doesn't exist, but it's that even if these demands exist by the people, it's hard for people to find out unless you have things like long-term investigative journalism. The second thing I want to point out here is that even if governments have good incentives, media does not have an incentive to report on it because the cost of"
2107.92,2112.4," doing so is larger than the cost of not doing so, i.e. the fact that you portray and include minority"
2112.4,2116.26," views and covering views means that you're likely to take backlash from the majority, which reduces"
2116.26,2120.62, viewers and feeds into our second argument of how this decreases minority awareness. The impact of
2120.62,2124.24," this is twofold. Firstly, that this reduces accountability towards the state and it's harder"
2124.24,2126.66, for opposition parties to have their views presented in society.
2126.98,2130.88," But secondly, this enhances biases because now you only have a single source that is controlled"
2130.88,2134.38," by the government, which flips government's principle because we prove that the neutrality"
2134.38,2138.9," they support is so likely to be biased neutrality. The implication here is twofold. Firstly,"
2139.12,2143.4, that this flips proposition's argument on increasing exposure because we prove that
2143.4,2145.26, the information proposition stores is not
2145.26,2149.72," only limited in scale because A, you have less funding, but B, it's also inherently biased to"
2149.72,2153.8," government influence. So we can see that people acting on incomplete information is bad, but we"
2153.8,2157.7," would prefer a world with information that is slightly biased to having none at all, so we flip"
2157.7,2161.76," their principle. But secondly, even if some extremists stay on mainstream media, because the"
2161.76,2167.34," amount of influence they have on mainstream is diluted and it's hard for them to collectivize, the likelihood of them producing harm is small."
2167.62,2171.46, And this is explicitly what happened when people kicked Trump out of Twitter and he formed Trump
2171.46,2176.3," Parler, which people use to mobilize and create demonstrative capital raids. Lastly, I'm going to"
2176.3,2180.0," weigh the best version of proposition to our argument, because even if we can see that only"
2180.0,2184.28, a few people opt into alternative media and the vast majority stay on slightly more biased
2184.28,2188.92," mainstream media, there's an overriding harm for two reasons. Firstly, because the scale of impact"
2188.92,2193.52," is larger. Mainstream media being slightly biased is not going to be a very large harm, as I proved"
2193.52,2197.0," to you above, because this is likely to remain within the scope of mainstream media, which have"
2197.0,2201.6," various alternative accountability mechanisms. On their side, there's an active incentive to want to"
2201.6,2208.2," cause harm on society because there's less accountability. Things like banning Muslim migrations, things like hate crime and anti-minority protests"
2208.2,2210.24, and blaming them for having bad economies.
2210.24,2212.64, And thus this harm overrides the marginal benefit.
2212.64,2216.16," But secondly, regarding the reversibility of the impact, once people start opting into"
2216.16,2219.56," alternative media, it's extremely hard for these individuals to leave, which means the"
2219.56,2222.92," future generations and the children of these people, which means the rationality of their"
2222.92,2226.0, decisions for every other political decision they make is likely to be worse.
2226.0,2233.0," For all those reasons, oppose. I would like to thank the speaker."
2233.0,2238.0," Just remind everyone, POIs are good and useful for engagement."
2238.0,2284.88," That said, I'd like to call upon the government web. Hi."
2284.88,2321.96, Hi. Sorry about that. Can you see and hear me? There are three crashes in my speech.
2321.96,2326.12, The first on how people are going to react to the implementation of the fairness doctrine.
2326.5,2332.66, The second on how we improve polarization and a final crash on government abuse and manipulation of the doctrine.
2333.1,2336.14," First, on how people are going to react to this doctrine."
2336.48,2350.64, What they say is that people are likely to view news organizations critically right now because they're aware of the fact that these news organizations have an undertone of bias but here's the problem panel all their analysis is extremely assertive
2350.64,2355.68, just because you know that a media organization is coming from a place of bias doesn't necessarily
2355.68,2360.16, mean that you have an incentive to check that bias because as long as they're telling you what you
2360.16,2365.42, want to hear you are more likely to go along with it. But the next thing I want to do is clarify
2365.42,2371.14," what a majority of viewers in this debate are. They agree with us in saying that they are moderates,"
2371.24,2375.44, but they disagree in the way in which they are going to react. And they have a conflicting
2375.44,2380.76," characterization here. First, they say that these moderates are likely to be so intolerant of"
2380.76,2389.84, opposing views that they move to social media because they are just that radical but in the same breath they say that media organizations have an incentive not to be extreme
2389.84,2395.2, because a majority of people or moderates just don't aren't extreme and would not want to listen
2395.2,2399.68, to those views we think these arguments undercut one another but we think that the latter
2399.68,2406.3, characterization is probably more true because most moderates are individuals that exist in the middle
2406.3,2411.82, they do understand that alternative views exist the difference is that they're just not willing
2411.82,2416.68, to go out and find those views because it takes a huge amount of effort in status quo when you
2416.68,2421.9, have biased media organizations not representing multiple views you have to take the time out of
2421.9,2425.16, your day to go out and find views that contradict the ones
2425.16,2429.58, that you see on your own media channel. We think that this is just something that people don't have
2429.58,2434.04," the time to do, but they would probably be okay with it if it was on the media channel that they"
2434.04,2438.44, consume right now. But the second thing is that these moderates just don't have the expertise
2438.44,2443.76, to compare the view that they see on their news site with a view that they see on another news
2443.76,2445.36," site, because oftentimes they"
2445.36,2450.92, don't make the effort to be comparative we think this is more an issue with effort as opposed to
2450.92,2455.14, an issue with radicalization which is something that we can solve on our side when the fairness
2455.14,2459.72, doctrine is implemented so considering that characterization of moderates in this debate
2459.72,2464.76, we give you three reasons why they're unlikely to switch to social media firstly because these
2464.76,2468.0," people are just not intolerant to the extent that they say,"
2468.12,2470.82, and they haven't responded to this too much just yet.
2471.0,2474.96, But the second thing we said is that these people are unlikely to make the effort
2474.96,2477.18, to switch to an alternate news channel.
2477.3,2480.76, Because oftentimes these people have grown up watching the same news channel.
2480.76,2483.06, They see it as a credible organization.
2483.4,2489.34," It probably adds at the time that they come back home from work, the effort that they would take to find a viable alternative to"
2489.34,2494.38, that on social media is probably just going to be too great. But the final thing is that moderates
2494.38,2499.7," tend to be more skeptical of the information that is found solely on social media, because you"
2499.7,2505.44," realize that there are things like very, very strong checks against bias on those organizations you"
2505.44,2510.88, recognize that like fact check for example is not as strong on a social media site as it would be
2510.88,2516.4, on a news organization and because of that there's a greater incentive to focus on to stick to the
2516.4,2523.68, broadcast organization that a broadcast organization that you know is credible even if
2523.68,2526.18, on their best case social media is
2526.18,2531.82, something that people move to note that on our side it's comparatively better because of the
2531.82,2538.24, fact that social media doesn't have biased news that is that is brought on from these broadcast
2538.24,2543.88, organizations as well because oftentimes the views that are brought from social media are justified
2543.88,2545.32, by the news that is brought from social media are justified by the news that is brought
2545.32,2550.8," from broadcast organizations. Because of that, we think that social media becomes better as well."
2551.0,2555.98," But then they backtrack in a POI, and they say that people that do switch would probably not"
2555.98,2559.68," be the moderates, but that those people are the ones that would cause the most amount of harm."
2559.68,2564.16," I would say that the people who would switch then are the extremely radical individuals,"
2564.44,2569.4," the people that are probably already on extreme organizations like Parler,"
2569.66,2573.96, the people who already are extremely antagonistic to opposing views.
2573.96,2578.22," We think that those people would likely act in similar ways on both sides of the house,"
2578.34,2581.04, and they aren't the majority in this debate.
2581.28,2585.18, So in proving to you that a majority of people wouldn't move to alternate
2585.18,2589.86," media sites, this takes down all of their argumentation on why money will no longer"
2589.86,2595.02," exist in media to begin with, right? We think that broadcast media is always going to be relevant"
2595.02,2600.06," because it has unique access to politics in a way that no other source can have access,"
2600.34,2605.36, which is why investors are unlikely to completely pull out. But I'm going to take them at their best case.
2605.6,2607.96, Let's assume it's true that moderates feel discomfort
2607.96,2611.18, when they have opposing views on their existing media organizations.
2611.52,2614.64, They need to prove why that discomfort is so incredibly high
2614.64,2618.28, that these people become antagonistic and that they choose to move away.
2618.5,2621.2, That is what they haven't done so far in this debate.
2621.5,2624.6, The second crash then is on polarization and how we reduce that.
2624.7,2633.24," Before that, I'll tell you why. So the people that create the most problems that are extremists on"
2633.24,2637.3, your side probably don't have the capacity to mobilize on our side because there's not that
2637.3,2641.96, type of platform that they can do that on. That's the delta of the debate. But platforms like
2641.96,2645.0, Palo already exist. Social media echo chambers already exist.
2645.0,2647.0, I think that claim is just a little far-fetched.
2647.0,2650.0, The second clash in this debate is on polarization.
2650.0,2656.0," Their argumentation is very mitigatory and assertive so far, because they said that media companies are not extreme."
2656.0,2660.0," They cater towards moderates, and that's why they don't have an incentive to be biased."
2660.0,2665.24, Note crucially that bias and extremism are two very different things. You don't have to be
2665.24,2670.36," biased, you don't have to be extreme to cherry pick examples to make an argument. We think a lot"
2670.36,2674.72," of people have been talking about the negative aspects of lockdown during COVID, even if they're"
2674.72,2679.8," not like economic aspects, even though they're not the most extreme people. So we think that that is"
2679.8,2691.6," an issue that can still exist. But in addition to that, the reason that bias is worse is because media organizations currently have an incentive to use people's biases to worsen polarization. Because if"
2691.6,2696.24," they continue to tell people what they want to hear, even moderate individuals are more likely"
2696.24,2701.84, to stick with them. So we think that polarization increases for as long as the fairness doctrine
2701.84,2707.14, is not implemented to a greater extent. Then they say that we can do things like cross-check and peer review.
2707.32,2710.56, But we don't think that people are actually willing to read all the cross-checks
2710.56,2714.6, and like the analysis later on of why these media organizations are biased.
2714.68,2717.64," If you like what you're hearing, you're probably going to stick with it."
2717.64,2719.48, So how does that change on our comparison?
2719.84,2720.3, Two ways.
2720.62,2724.46," Firstly, people who consume media and who are already biased"
2724.46,2725.6, are forced to check their
2725.6,2729.84, biases on our side of the house because of the fact that it is continuously prevalent in the
2729.84,2734.96, news media that they watch but secondly the people who are coming into uh people who are coming into
2734.96,2740.24, politics and getting access to news uh without set biases are more likely to have a holistic
2740.24,2744.56, view of how current affairs take place which means they're less likely to be subject to
2744.56,2748.56, misinformation they're more likely to do things like they're more likely
2748.56,2753.44," to make holistic choices on who to vote for, on whether they should take vaccines, etc."
2753.44,2757.08," On our comparative panel, we told you that polarization is a problem. We're the only"
2757.08,2761.32, side that actually does something about it. The final question in this debate is on abuse
2761.32,2771.2, and manipulation of the dirty. They say that it's easy for governments to exploit the exploit um these uh the the fact that there's a panel here that exists i
2771.2,2775.84, would say that it's easier in a democracy for governments to exploit a lack of legislation
2775.84,2780.64, than from than for governments to manipulate legislation that already exists two reasons
2780.64,2785.6," one because when the government chooses to manipulate legislation, it looks"
2785.6,2790.88, really bad on that image. Let's say that you unfairly treat an opposing media organization.
2790.88,2796.8, That media organization is now going to expose that unfairness to its viewers and opposers of
2796.8,2801.28," your government to begin with. We think that this emboldens oppositions, encourages protests,"
2801.28,2805.0, encourages swing voters to side against you in crucial elections.
2805.0,2809.0, So there are strategic incentives for governments to not be biased.
2809.0,2814.0," Panel, at the end of the day, we proved to you that we solve a problem that is extremely prevalent in society,"
2814.0,2820.0, while the opposition does very little to do so.
2820.0,2825.0, All right. I'd like to thank the speaker and now call upon the opposition web.
2840.0,2841.52," Hello, am I visible and audible?"
2843.52,2845.34, You are not visible yet.
2845.44,2846.32, You are audible.
2846.84,2847.9, I'm not visible.
2848.82,2849.88, Now you're visible.
2850.56,2850.92," Oh, okay."
2851.0,2851.38," Sorry, sorry."
2853.14,2853.36, Okay.
2854.12,2856.44," I like my POIs verbally, please."
2857.12,2857.82," So, yeah."
2858.72,2858.98, Okay.
2859.68,2907.3," So. Okay, I'll be starting my speech in 321. The government side tried to use an example to make their speech more intuitive, and yet the only ended up creating a tension within their case in the very first speaker that there are other things to consider rather than just the economic aspects of COVID lockdown."
2907.6,2908.2, Which is it?
2908.54,2913.34," Exactly the fact that just because media is somewhat biased, people still know there are"
2913.34,2913.8, other sides.
2913.96,2915.08, They prove that themselves.
2915.58,2918.24," Therefore, they have never been able to prove that they have any benefits."
2918.38,2920.7, This tension was devastating for their case.
2920.94,2922.4," OK, four things I'd like to do in this space."
2922.7,2928.44," First of all, flag out an unengaged point that is an independent path to victory, our point on coverage of information. Secondly,"
2928.56,2933.22," talk about the model and clarify what the government can and will do. Thirdly, engage on"
2933.22,2938.46," the principle. Fourthly, compare on the theme of polarization. Okay, firstly, on our unengaged"
2938.46,2943.02," point, our second argument, and coming from first, regarding the coverage of information"
2943.02,2950.02, and investigative journalism and reports on minorities. This has never been unengaged to our mechanism that investors invest
2950.02,2956.38, in these things because they want to push the media in order to give reports that are favorable
2956.38,2962.34," to them. Once they can no longer push some stories that are favorable to them, they're never going to"
2962.34,2966.84," invest in them. Therefore, there's going to be less investment. Therefore, there's going to be less coverage. This whole"
2966.84,2971.4," thing has been unengaged too. Why is this so, so detrimental for them? Because without coverage"
2971.4,2976.64," of information, there is no choice because information was the prerequisite to anything"
2976.64,2981.46, that they said or said. The fact that we get information comes analytically prior to anything
2981.46,2990.4," they're trying to propose. This was an independent path to victory. They already lose the debate. Now, secondly, I'd like to clarify on the feasibility of this model"
2990.4,2996.22," and whether the government will have any influence. Okay, so is the FCC fair? They tried to say that"
2996.22,3001.42," there are other political parties going to be opposing it. First of all, not every democracy"
3001.42,3005.88, is going to be a representative government. And so sometimes one political party
3005.88,3010.82," just controls the government, in which the fact that the government is going to be funding the"
3010.82,3014.86, SEC means they have to listen to the government in some way. The government is still going to
3014.86,3019.62," be able to influence it. Furthermore, even if there are opposition parties, if they're constantly"
3019.62,3024.7," arguing about what the metrics is going to be, they're never going to be effective in regulating"
3024.7,3025.14," anything. Rather, this is only going to be effective in regulating anything."
3025.46,3029.76," Rather, this is only going to mean that it takes time for media to put anything out into the public,"
3030.0,3035.62," which means that citizens who are unregulated, by the way, are going to report on SNS about what is"
3035.62,3040.0, actually happening and the fact that those are going to be the sources of information because
3040.0,3044.5, they are actually the ones reporting it faster. Now that I've proven that the FCC is ineffective
3044.5,3049.74," and going to be influenced by the government, what is the government's incentive? Are they"
3049.74,3053.88," more incentivized to be corrupt and try to push their own narratives, or are they going to try"
3053.88,3058.6," to keep it fair, right? The government's reasoning is that the citizens are going to backlash against"
3058.6,3063.06," them, and therefore they're going to be fair. Okay, let's compare which one is going to get"
3063.06,3069.32, you more backlash. Are you going to get backlash for potentially hiding information that the citizens don't know whether you hid or not?
3069.56,3074.76, Or are you going to get backlash for putting out a story into the public that harms your reputation?
3075.14,3079.82, The latter is clearly more probable. You're more likely to get backlash if you put information
3079.82,3084.22," out there that is actively harming you. Therefore, the government is incentivized to hide those"
3084.22,3088.14," stories. Therefore, they're going to be more corrupt than fair. Now, moving on to the second"
3088.14,3092.88," about the principle, right? So let me directly engage with this in saying that it is completely"
3092.88,3096.2," contingent on their practical. And so far as we have taken out in their practical, their principle"
3096.2,3101.22," does not stand. Now, let me prove why our side is actually superior on the counterfactual,"
3101.36,3105.26, because having control over political perspectives through which media reports
3105.26,3111.0, on news has very little influence on the ability of viewers to make a rational decision the reason
3111.0,3116.36, is because even in uh the reason is not because even in the absence of control there are going to
3116.36,3120.98, be access to multiple sources of media they're going to be able to talk to different people
3120.98,3129.64," they're they're going to be engaging with other people. However, the media is, therefore, regardless of how the media tells the story, is not really going to influence whether"
3129.64,3134.7," you choose right or left. Rather, the fact that the media is the only actor that can cover up the"
3134.7,3139.56," story, uncover the stories that are currently not revealed, is very critical. Because not knowing"
3139.56,3143.82," who is corrupt in the government is actually the only thing, that's the only one, the media is the"
3143.82,3145.54," only one that can reveal that information. So basically, I'm trying to say is actually the only thing, that's the only one, the media is the only one that can reveal that information."
3145.54,3148.56, So basically I'm trying to say is that the ability to choose
3148.56,3150.62, when you see multiple sides is largely symmetric
3150.62,3151.46, on both sides.
3151.46,3153.36, Our side is the only side that can protect
3153.36,3156.04, the unique benefit of allowing people to choose
3156.04,3159.0, based on niche information that we can provide.
3159.0,3162.86," Now, additionally, their whole principle"
3162.86,3165.42," led to the fact that it allows, of choice, led to the fact that it allows the of choice led"
3165.42,3170.5, to the fact that it allows them to make choices that maximize their utility however this was
3170.5,3174.52, completely contingent on the fact that the government actually has the ability to reflect
3174.52,3180.02, these choices in policies insofar as our side has proved that there's more accountability for the
3180.02,3189.82, government through investigative journalism and uncovering the fact of the corruption within the government. Our side is the side that actually enables the government to ensure that people's
3189.82,3194.82," voices and choices are actually reflected to improve the lives of the citizens. In conclusion,"
3195.02,3200.24," our side can both protect the choices and ability to reflect these choices. Therefore, we are more,"
3201.26,3205.12, we better achieve their principle as well as their practical benefits they're
3205.12,3209.12, trying to achieve from their principle before i move on to the comparison of the polarization
3209.12,3214.32, i'd like to take your point of information if as you concede only a small minority of extremists
3214.32,3219.52, switch to alternative platforms wouldn't advertisers and investors continue to find
3219.52,3230.86," it profitable to invest in media given that the vast majority of moderates remain. Our fact, our explanation as to why investors are not going to invest is not the fact only that the"
3230.86,3234.92," media is going to be less popular. It is the fact that the government is, for example, Twitter"
3234.92,3239.88," doesn't want, in the status quo, if Twitter doesn't want something bad published about them, they can"
3239.88,3244.52," pressure the media into not saying it. On the other hand, that's why they invest in it. On your side,"
3244.76,3248.92," Twitter doesn't get any advantage because you have to show opposing views as well. Therefore,"
3249.1,3253.48, Twitter cannot do anything beneficial for them. That is why they lose investment. Please listen
3253.48,3257.64," to our argument. Now, comparison on the theme of polarization. There are some conflicting"
3257.64,3262.02," characterizations between both sides, so let me clear that up. First of all, is media extremist"
3262.02,3268.58, or moderate in the status quo? The only reason they give you is that Jeff Bezos owns and that therefore it is extremist.
3268.64,3273.92," There's a logical leap here. Rather, we have proposed to you that corporations are going to check and balance each other in this status quo."
3274.3,3278.84, And rather than major majority of mainstream media is the viewers of it are moderate.
3278.98,3280.96," Therefore, they're going to cater to a more moderate view."
3281.98,3286.32," Even if so, basically, media is currently more moderate than they are extremist"
3286.32,3292.0, now secondly on the characterization of citizens let me explain to you that the government side
3292.0,3297.84, literally thinks people live in echo chambers that are physical chambers no people are engaging with
3297.84,3302.64, people of other different political views because of they go to things like school they go to things
3302.64,3308.56, like uh they talk with their family who have slightly different views. They're always countered with their beliefs because they are
3308.56,3312.9," constantly engaging with other people as well. Therefore, they are going to be able to still"
3312.9,3319.18, choose even if the media is slightly biased. People already know that other views exist.
3319.62,3323.26," Now, how are different people going to react? There's not a tension in our case. There are"
3323.26,3327.76, many different people. It's not either you are extremist or you are moderate there are people in the middle who
3327.76,3334.08, have slightly opinionated about the uh the media about politics we say these are the people that
3334.08,3337.84, are the biggest delta within the debate because they're the ones who are going to be moving to
3337.84,3343.92, alternative media these people becoming these few people becoming radical is extremely harmful in so
3343.92,3345.28, far as the few increase the marginal increase in people who become radical is extremely harmful insofar as the few increase
3345.28,3349.76, the marginal increase in people who become radical is much larger than the marginal increase in
3349.76,3356.24, people who can become more fair and neutral therefore even our burden was not to prove that
3356.24,3360.64, the majority of people are going to opt into alternative media insofar that our claim relied
3360.64,3367.18, on the fact that even a few people opting into alternative media was immense harm. They needed to engage with this and they completely failed.
3367.28,3369.1, It is too late for them to do so in reply.
3369.44,3370.9," So, so proud to oppose."
3376.7,3380.42," All right, I'd like to thank the speaker and close out the constructive phase."
3380.42,3382.72, And now I'd like to call upon the opposition reply.
3387.2,3412.42," Hi, can you hear me? Yep. Speech will start in 3, 2, 1."
3412.84,3422.6," I'm going to make the winning piece of weighing on our side extremely clear at the start of my speech, as to why even if the majority of individuals are moderate, which we concede from the very first speech,"
3422.86,3428.72, why that more people and the minority of individuals opting into alternative media and confirming their biases was the
3428.72,3430.38, worst harm in the debate.
3430.38,3434.44," We told you that even if the number of people who are extremists are small, the fact that"
3434.44,3439.22," they opt into these alternative medias does massive harm because uniquely on their side,"
3439.22,3443.82, they tip the tipping point for more individuals to opt into these pieces of alternative media.
3443.82,3448.22, More people are likely to pick an extremists because people who are not moderate right now will opt into this
3448.22,3452.5, because of confirmation bias. And that was the mechanism I gave you that they did not respond to.
3452.76,3457.98," But secondly, the people who are extremists right now, now have the capacity to mobilize this"
3457.98,3463.42," extremism into action. On our side, because they are on mainstream media, the amount of influence"
3463.42,3469.36, that they have is massively diluted by the vast individuals of moderates. So it's hard for them to use this to collectively
3469.36,3474.54," cause harm. So sure, Trump-Powler exists on their side, but it is uniquely on their side when"
3474.54,3478.98," Poller has the capacity to create harm, to riot against the Capitol, and to create massive"
3478.98,3484.56," political damage. And sure, maybe some extremists have long-term trust with a news organization."
3484.84,3487.66," But as they say, there is a degree and there is a trade-off."
3487.86,3492.22," For people who have grown up getting told that getting an abortion brings them to hell for eternity,"
3492.62,3495.98," even if the news they watched was something they had exposure to from a young age,"
3496.16,3501.88, they would probably still switch anyways because they are more scared of burning in hell than they are of the trust to this news organization.
3502.28,3503.48, Two themes I'm going to engage in.
3503.7,3508.3," Firstly, let's bring back the principal argument I told you about in second. Our principle split was quite"
3508.3,3511.76," simple, which is that neutrality that they support, which is the principle of their argument,"
3511.88,3515.96," is a facade, and that rather it is an unjust intervention of the government. The response"
3515.96,3520.86," we get from WIPP is that it is easier in a democracy for people to, that it is hard for"
3520.86,3524.4," people to exploit this in a democracy because there are things like legislature, and it looks"
3524.4,3526.1, bad if they manipulate these types of things.
3526.3,3530.1, But we already preempted this view in second when we told you that the way in which governments
3530.1,3532.1, control media are many times invisible.
3532.1,3537.8, They do things like changing the way that news and news medias collect statistics.
3538.12,3541.38, They change the way in which they give them funding depending on whether or not they concede
3541.38,3542.16, to these types of things.
3542.42,3547.84," And that was the invisible mechanism in which they have to use and they need to concede to. But secondly, regarding which it"
3547.84,3552.38," has better media, government whip realizes that they were strategically off and that proving media"
3552.38,3556.7," companies have an incentive to be extremist was unwinnable. So instead, they assert that social"
3556.7,3560.84, media is now going to become less polarized as because of the fairness doctrine. Two things to
3560.84,3565.92," note here. One, this is entirely an assertion. There is literally zero mechanism as to why this is the case."
3566.12,3573.2," But secondly, it is not true. As we told you in first, alternative media cannot opt into mainstream media, which is already saturated,"
3573.5,3577.22," which is why their only source of consumer base is the people who are severely extremist,"
3577.28,3581.64, which is why they are the main source of people that they can see to and the people that they get opted from.
3581.9,3587.04," But more importantly, let's talk about our claim of funding, which is the independent path to victory that we claim in this debate,"
3587.28,3589.58," where we told you that we least an increase of information,"
3589.74,3591.56, specifically in the most important areas.
3591.94,3594.9," Notice then that this was the wing that got very little engagement to,"
3595.14,3598.26," which is that, sure, the most visible or long-term cheat reports"
3598.26,3599.44, were likely to be symmetric.
3599.44,3601.52," But at the moment in which you lose viewers,"
3601.68,3609.4," the incentive for sponsors to sponsor you to a massive degree decreases. And for the most important pieces of information that mobilize change for minorities,"
3609.6,3613.72," that get long-term investigative journalism, that exposes corrupt politicians, that is the"
3613.72,3618.7," accountability mechanism the proposition asserts exists, that can only happen when you have long-term"
3618.7,3622.96, funding on our side. And this was specifically the types of places where the funding was likely
3622.96,3633.62," to get taken out first. Because even if only a few media organizations or a few sponsors pulled out, that lack of money was most likely to translate into those areas that were the most important that had no other alternatives."
3633.68,3648.16," What this means then is you're more likely to use this money on their side for alternative means of advertising, things like YouTube ads, funding magazines, alternative media, because that's where a lot of individuals are going to be, which further entrenches these alternative medias as well, so we flipped their case."
3648.16,3652.48, Proposition supports undocumented migrants being put in cages on the border as an inevitable
3652.48,3656.4," consequence or deserving. We think there are certain views that are so harmful, and the"
3656.4,3660.56," Fairness Doctrine allows us to hide behind the facade of truth, behind euphemisms and people"
3660.56,3663.04, playing the devil's advocate. I've never been prouder to oppose.
3665.94,3668.62," All right, I'd like to thank the speaker and to close out this debate,"
3668.74,3710.0," I'd like to call upon the proposition reply. Hi, can you hear me? so"
3711.92,3744.52, she Thank you.
3744.52,3748.92," Three questions in this speech. First, which side reduces political polarization? Secondly,"
3748.92,3753.36," reducing the likelihood of state abuse? Thirdly, the profitability of news organizations? First,"
3753.42,3757.72," on reducing political polarization, I want to first prove that opposition's argumentation"
3757.72,3763.16, on migration is unlikely. They say that if we attempt to implement the fairness doctrine on
3763.16,3768.26," traditional media, that this will lead to a migration to alternative media, particularly among extremists."
3768.42,3785.64," We told you a number of things. Firstly, in instances where the alternative media that they migrate to is functionally the same as broadcast media, such as, for example, Internet talk shows or news shows that are organizations, we could apply the same regulations. So importantly, as the viewership increases,"
3785.64,3787.14, there's a checking mechanism to ensure
3787.14,3789.76," that the fairness doctrine will apply in these instances as well,"
3789.76,3791.22, to which we had no response.
3791.22,3792.78, But the second thing that we told you
3792.78,3795.84, is that if it is true that it is largely extremists who will
3795.84,3797.74," migrate to alternative media, it's"
3797.74,3800.04," very unclear why this is the tipping point,"
3800.04,3802.38, although Japan continues to say that it is.
3802.38,3804.54," Presumably, on their side of the house,"
3804.54,3807.66, if traditional media were ever to attempt to moderate
3807.66,3809.42," for the same incentives that they gave,"
3809.5,3810.52, which is that you want to appeal
3810.52,3812.06, to the broad majority of moderates
3812.06,3813.54," and attract corporate sponsorship,"
3813.92,3815.72, then these same extremists would also flock
3815.72,3817.56, to alternative media on their side of the house.
3817.84,3820.02," So presumably, this is an inevitable harm"
3820.02,3821.72, that either side will have to contest with.
3822.02,3824.72, And it's unclear why this motion in particular
3824.72,3826.48, massively increases the incentive
3826.48,3827.82, to flock to alternative media
3827.82,3829.84, in a way that the incentives of traditional media
3829.84,3830.96, don't on their side of the house.
3831.42,3832.46," Finally, we told you why"
3832.46,3833.96," for the vast majority of people,"
3834.22,3836.58," even people who are slightly extreme and radical,"
3837.12,3838.58, the degree of substitutability
3838.58,3840.7, between social media and traditional media
3840.7,3841.46, does not exist.
3841.7,3842.66," The level of familiarity,"
3843.2,3844.44, age as being a limiting factor
3844.44,3849.04," to be able to access social media, the fact that you have less trust in social media and therefore you"
3849.04,3854.08, rely less on it even if you don't buy this analysis we also told you why traditional
3854.08,3858.56, media is more likely to act as a check on social media on our side of the house for two reasons
3858.56,3863.12, firstly in third we told you why traditional media often controls the kind of information
3863.12,3865.12, that is dispersed on social media and in first and second we told you why we reduced often controls the kind of information that is dispersed on social media
3865.12,3870.56, and in first and second we told you why we reduced the effects of a biased social media presence
3870.56,3875.2, of traditional media organizations like cnn and fox news which also disperse a significant amount
3875.2,3880.24, of information through social media they say that on weighing that they've been because the ability
3880.24,3886.04," for extremists to mobilize is significant they were unresponsresponsive to the POI that they asked us,"
3886.04,3887.72, which was that the ability to mobilize
3887.72,3889.38, already exists in the status quo.
3889.38,3892.34, It is unclear why this is likely to significantly increase
3892.34,3894.96, the incentive for extremists to mobilize
3894.96,3897.32, if already traditional media appeals to moderates.
3897.32,3899.78," But secondly, our intuitive vein from first"
3899.78,3900.94," was never responded to,"
3900.94,3902.82, which is that if fewer people believe
3902.82,3908.96," in increasingly biased perspectives of the other side, it means that you are more likely to vote internationally it means that the broad majority"
3908.96,3913.36, of people to whom political parties creator are likely to be more moderate this is where reducing
3913.36,3918.4, political polarization becomes important opposition can see that the status quo is insufficient when
3918.4,3922.96, they point to the fact that most people although they are moderates are still exposed to biased
3922.96,3928.2," media this points to the issue that we illustrated in first and to which we heard little response, which is that"
3928.2,3932.28, the cognitive dissonance that they use in their argumentation is a reason why even moderates will
3932.28,3937.36," not tolerate extremist view, will not seek out alternative views rather. Perhaps if we bring"
3937.36,3941.86," those alternative views to them, they are willing to tolerate it and won't migrate to other platforms,"
3941.86,3950.48, but the incentive to seek these out given the constraints of limited time and the incentive to limit carbon these are twofold firstly we have a greater
3950.48,3954.08, exposure to alternative views and it's harder to mischaracterize the opposition which means we
3954.08,3958.8, fulfill our principle of people having informed consent but secondly we improve fact checking
3958.8,3963.36, finally on the profitability of news organizations we pointed out in a poi that these news
3963.36,3965.04, organizations will remain profitable
3965.04,3968.72, given that advertisers will still find it profitable and that given that the doctrine
3968.72,3972.72, itself will apply to all media organizations perhaps the trade-off that we need to make in
3972.72,3977.68, this debate is that investigative journalism is marginally less likely but their mechanism
3977.68,3981.12, of corporate sponsorship is even worse because it means you can't criticize the corporate
3983.12,3986.48, we are far more willing to have governments have a greater degree
3986.48,3990.96, of control over the media than completely rely on corporate sponsorship given that governments have
3990.96,3994.64, greater checking mechanisms on them in most countries even in weaker democracies as we
3994.64,3998.96, illustrated in argumentation and given that governments have incentives not to misuse the
3998.96,4008.5, fairness doctrine analysis in second to which there was an insufficient response for all of these reasons proposed. I think it will do that.
4008.5,4014.56, All right. I want to thank everyone for what was an incredibly high quality debate and
4014.56,4020.46, a very close one. And that is represented by the fact that it was not a unanimous decision.
4020.46,4026.08, I think that that's also testament to the fact that all of us saw many of the same issues in this debate.
4026.08,4040.3," We saw many of the same arguments, and it ultimately came back to how we weighed things and saw the round play out, not necessarily in disagreements, which means that we did think that each team ran a lot of material and each team did prevail on some of it."
4040.54,4047.2," But ultimately, a majority felt one way about how that played out and how that ended up impacting"
4047.2,4053.92, in the end ultimately on a 2-1 split with myself and brooke in the majority we gave it to the team
4053.92,4062.24, in proposition sri lanka over the team in opposition japan so how did this play out
4062.88,4066.6, we thought that there were several areas of clash in this debate.
4067.36,4083.12," The first one being a principal clash. Secondly, looking at a lot of stuff in terms of the model, in terms of what is proposition doing and can they successfully do that, which both involves what's covered in terms of social media versus not social media."
4083.12,4085.5, Can you sort of fairly implement this?
4085.6,4087.46, How are you going to ultimately determine
4087.46,4088.3, what you're covering?
4089.36,4092.94," And sort of thirdly, basically on that,"
4093.34,4095.7, what are capacities for state abuse
4095.7,4097.5," and whether or not that's necessarily harmful,"
4097.96,4099.34, which sort of areas in the bank?
4099.78,4102.18, Then we thought there was a clash over extremism.
4102.54,4105.9, Where is there likely to be sort of more polarization
4105.9,4112.22, in terms of society and how do we end up weighing this up in terms of the debate?
4112.22,4116.9, I want to deal with the principle first because there was general agreement on the panel as
4116.9,4121.94, well as it seemed to some degree within the debate that as opposition themselves noted
4121.94,4125.66," towards the end, the principle is in many ways pragmatic."
4125.92,4133.58," The principle ends up basically being that there's ultimately a right to state information,"
4133.72,4139.66, that there is ultimately a right to state information. There is a right to basically
4139.66,4150.32, be acting on correct information. If you're going to be voting states derive legitimacy from being able to give an informed choice why the right to the informed choice is not properly protected
4150.32,4157.12, under status quo and this goes into a representation thing how this preempts all sort of opinions being
4157.12,4161.92, valid and how speech concerning public affairs should be held to a prior standard we're willing
4161.92,4169.84, to buy all of this but the thing is we don't necessarily think it's necessarily contested that there is an importance to it what ends up being contested is
4169.84,4177.68, do you actually improve the level of information people are receiving and on net does this basically
4177.68,4186.72, function both within the traditional media and does that trump people exiting from it and because it's ultimately pragmatic it does as
4186.72,4192.16, opposition said ultimately depend on who wins the rest of the debate so in a sense proposition runs
4192.16,4198.0, a principle it's uncontested it is the principle in the round but ultimately they have to prove
4198.0,4202.4, that they actually accomplish the things that everyone agrees they have a principal duty for
4202.4,4211.76, in order to win so it ends up not being particularly important. This then leads us into the sort of first area of clash that was important
4211.76,4217.6," for the panel. Now, the reason I want to sort of look at the model is that there's a lot of things"
4217.6,4224.12, that arise in terms of the model as to what proposition is doing and to what extent they can
4224.12,4226.72, do it versus what is likely to happen on
4226.72,4233.52, the other side and there's a lot of argumentation that's buried within it some of that argumentation
4233.52,4238.72, uh for instance ends up not sort of necessarily being tested which is one can you sort who is
4238.72,4243.84, going to be doing this and secondly what is cover well first of all i think it's best to start with
4243.84,4250.74, what is covered then secondly who is going to be covering it and deciding what it is and what are the impacts of it?
4250.88,4262.94," The first thing in terms of who's being covered is we get a very clear model from proposition that they're going to be covering not just, for instance, traditional broadcast media, but they're going to be covering other things."
4262.96,4265.0, They're going to be covering social media. They're going to be covering social media.
4265.0,4268.0, They're going to be covering podcasts and other things.
4268.0,4271.0," Now, this is an implicit effort to model this in."
4271.0,4276.0," Now, I think this is something that is to some degree controversial in this debate."
4276.0,4285.24, It's controversial in this debate because opposition from the first opposition speech is deciding to base one of their major harms on the idea that if you do this in the
4285.24,4289.4," traditional media, one, you're going to make it less attractive to people, which is an argument"
4289.4,4294.7," we'll come back to later. But two, that this will lead them looking for alternatives, for instance,"
4294.88,4325.44," in alternative and online media. Now, ultimately, our feeling in terms of where this is basically comes down to a basically large degree of this is we're willing to buy the idea that, for instance, there isn't an absolute prop fiat to say that you're going to apply this to all forms says news media and with significant breach and what we're"
4325.44,4330.4, ultimately willing to say that the first one is ambiguous at the point at which it's significant
4330.4,4335.28, reach we think that the second proposition is correct in saying that things get as big as for
4335.28,4340.4, instance the ben shapiro show so you're effectively having an entire company like the daily wire
4340.4,4345.96," or things that's making large amount of money doing advertising doing it that those things will be covered and what we're willing to accept that there will a large amount of money, doing advertising, doing it, that those things will be covered."
4345.96,4355.26," And while we're willing to accept that there will be some degrees of alternative things, the point at which the ones with the most reach are going to be subject to the fairness doctrine,"
4355.76,4364.26," the scope of alternative media that exists on opposition that is not covered is one less than in the status quo,"
4364.62,4366.52," which, as proposition points out that"
4366.52,4372.58, alternative media already exists to a degree and is also sort of mitigated. Now that doesn't mean
4372.58,4378.98," that opposition can't run the impacts of people looking at alternative forms, but it means that"
4378.98,4383.38," when we end up coming up with the comparative, which we'll come to at the end when we talk about"
4383.38,4385.28," polarization, which is how much"
4385.28,4390.24, worse does polarization get they're sort of operating in that comparative in the view of
4390.24,4396.24, majority panel in a situation in which the most the the one the alternative means that have the
4396.24,4408.2," largest reach are covered by this as is tucker carlson and to extent, it becomes a situation where opposition has to either engage on enough"
4408.2,4413.36," people going to the sort of alternative media with lesser reach for that to sort of have the impact,"
4413.5,4420.12," or they need to basically win on other independent lines, such as state enforcement and how it's"
4420.12,4424.4, going to be implemented. This brings us to the idea of sort of state abuse and how it's going
4424.4,4429.44, to be implemented. Proposition gives us a model where they're going to model this a bit like the
4429.44,4434.72, fcc in the united states where they say there's going to be representation by both parties in a
4434.72,4440.16, multi-party system they're presuming there will be some even a weak democracy rule of law the way at
4440.16,4445.68, least i uh read this is that even a country like singapore which is one party dominant
4445.68,4450.56, the might there'll be still be a cap on the number of members from each party which means opposition
4450.56,4457.04, representation there will be suits in the courts to sort of go off and challenge it there will be
4457.04,4462.96, public backlash and demands that you enforce it uh the challenge we get from this is sort of a couple
4462.96,4468.22, fold one that for instance we think this will be imperfect because governments will have incentive to do this.
4468.52,4478.06," This will be their ability to do it can either come outside of normal sort of legal means, which is things like changing the way you calculate stats and abusing rules."
4478.18,4486.38," Or secondly, in countries that are one party or authoritarian, this will be less effective. How did sort of each of these sort of play out?"
4486.88,4493.4," I think the feeling was that at the point at which you're basically, they're setting these"
4493.4,4499.2," things up as sort of checks on it, ultimately the impacts are comparative overall, which means that"
4499.2,4502.96, it's not opposition's job to say that there are going to be cases where this will be less effective
4502.96,4507.48," than others. I think there's concession of that when you have weaker democracies. The question is,"
4507.76,4513.7," is this tool going to be more effective than nothing, or are the abuse of this tool going"
4513.7,4519.88," to make it worse than nothing? So when we look at those two things subsequent to it,"
4520.38,4528.76," I think we feel that some of these checks, while imperfect, probably do function in places that do have some degree of institutions and rule of law."
4528.9,4533.94," Obviously, the weaker the courts are and the less democratic the state is, they work less."
4534.82,4542.46," The thing is, is that at a point at which a state has only one party, doesn't have independent courts and has authoritarian government,"
4542.46,4545.52, the impacts in this round are probably minimal
4545.52,4548.22, because the amount of independence and scope
4548.22,4550.26, of free media is probably minimal.
4550.26,4552.22," So I think ultimately, at least the majority of the panel"
4552.22,4554.46, felt that those things were not necessarily
4554.46,4557.04," where the debate was, which meant that they had"
4557.04,4559.02, a sort of minimalistic impact.
4559.02,4561.88," I think when it came to other state abuse mechanisms,"
4561.88,4565.22," for instance, manipulation, doing things behind the scenes."
4565.22,4569.24," It's unclear how this policy influences that,"
4569.24,4570.56, if they could still do it elsewhere.
4570.56,4572.88," Now, I think part of the panel did point out"
4572.88,4575.54, that our propositions pushback on this
4575.54,4578.96, could have been significantly clearer and more forceful.
4578.96,4581.5, And it ultimately led us in a situation
4581.5,4584.7, where we're unsure if opposition is comparative here
4584.7,4586.56, in terms of proving harms but
4586.56,4592.16, where proposition isn't necessarily pointing out the degree to which they may not be comparative
4592.16,4598.88, which leaves us in sort of how much do we weigh that and ultimately a majority felt that prop
4598.88,4606.08, opposition to some degree was setting up perhaps an impossible burden of saying that its proposition needs to prove this
4606.08,4611.76, works in all cases and if it doesn't work in some cases in some instances where their own comparative
4611.76,4616.8, doesn't necessarily that that's enough for them to win and a majority did not feel that way so did
4616.8,4623.04, not feel there was necessarily an alternative harm here so that then led us in a situation where
4623.04,4625.84, we're trying to engage in a world where this is
4625.84,4631.44, working and that means that we look at polarization so what does proposition say proposition suggests
4631.44,4636.96, that a large number of people are sort of to agree moderately they're invested in their traditional
4636.96,4651.52," media they may like some degrees of biases and be aware of fox one, they're unlikely to switch because there's a degree of laziness, they're invested in what they see. They also are, and they also say that I think is important,"
4651.52,4656.64," is they frame bias, not necessarily as explicit but implicit, not just in terms of what's covered,"
4656.64,4661.68," but what isn't. So for instance, the selection of stories you're going to see, and this is going to"
4661.68,4666.22, be important because this is probably where the strongest opposition pushback is.
4666.22,4669.42," But also in terms of, if you focus heavily on crime,"
4669.42,4672.96, this can be used to portray African-Americans negatively.
4672.96,4675.44, If you focus on COVID and lockdowns
4675.44,4677.74," and you only focus on the economic stuff,"
4677.74,4679.1, but not the other things.
4679.1,4680.98, And their argument in terms of balance
4680.98,4683.9, is that you need to cover both sides of stories
4683.9,4685.22, and you need to find roughly
4685.22,4690.26, equivalent speakers now I think there's actually probably was a lot of potential to attack
4690.26,4695.84, especially the equivalents on speakers and how necessarily do it what are the responses I think
4695.84,4701.6, one of them is you necessarily get the idea that you're going to avoid controversial issues this
4701.6,4705.04, is sort of the Philippines exampleines example of abortion uh proposition i
4705.04,4709.5, think is suggesting that you're issue neutral all you're saying is that you're going to have to
4709.5,4713.62, provide sort of both sides now i think there's an argument that this is also not fully responsive
4713.62,4720.26, but it's not necessarily followed up on in terms of pushback and the sort of abortion thing or
4720.26,4726.26," choice of stories goes out so we are left very much with one, the push that people are going to"
4726.26,4731.62," want to go and go into alternative stuff, that even if a small number of people do it, that this"
4731.62,4737.66," is going to lead to significant harms and where we're going. Now, I think in terms of the sort of"
4737.66,4743.0," alternative stuff, because we're buying the mitigation, and I think ultimately this is"
4743.0,4751.0," something to some degree opposition is aware of as an issue by the end of debate, which is why they pivot to why there is a limited number of harms."
4751.0,4760.0," They very much focus on why the online stuff is worse. We're not really, we do buy the idea that the number of people are going to shift is limited and things like Ben Shapiro being there."
4760.0,4766.16," So then the question becomes, what are the relative sort of impacts of this?"
4773.28,4773.38," So one, I think that the issue we come up with here is sort of a weighing issue, is what is the impact?"
4779.9,4780.02," We repeatedly hear, for instance, that it's worse if Trump is banned on Twitter, goes to Parliament, or it's worse if people are doing it."
4782.22,4782.28, But at what level of number is this worse?
4787.14,4789.42, We actually do buy the idea about minorities. We buy that the extremism you see on the extremes of alternative media online
4789.42,4792.8, are probably significantly worse than the extremes
4792.8,4794.76, we're seeing offline.
4794.76,4796.82," But we're not necessarily sure why,"
4796.82,4800.88," if it's even a small number, why that necessarily outweighs."
4800.88,4808.56," And that becomes a significant issue when, for a a lot of us we're attempting to sort of"
4808.56,4816.48, weigh on it um i did i was i flagged something when i was going to uh flip over on this and give
4816.48,4821.04, me just one second to look over my notes because there was something i remember saying that i said
4821.04,4830.0, was the strongest thing on opposition but now this is gonna sound weird but I just forgot to where I was on that on notes.
4830.0,4832.0, Where was it.
4832.0,4849.0," So this is gonna sound really weird to people remember the thing I flagged on that just briefly this is gonna look awful on video I know part of technical reporting, selective reporting, selective choice, selective spokespeople."
4849.0,4856.0," What was it? What was it? Sorry. I have, sorry, I'm just, this is 8am and I just got up early."
4856.0,4865.4," I am, just give me 20 seconds to look over what I was going. I'm going to have it. Oh, yes."
4865.82,4866.28," So, okay."
4866.46,4868.76," So the other big issue that came up here, however,"
4868.98,4871.0, is not necessarily whether or not
4871.0,4872.76, the impact of switching to online media is worse.
4872.94,4875.26, It is whether or not you're going to be hurting
4875.26,4876.56, the traditional media.
4876.96,4878.66," Now, the reason this is strong"
4878.66,4881.52, is that if proposition is correct
4881.52,4884.52," and there's significant attachments to traditional media,"
4884.74,4889.68," and that even if people distrust other things, they trust what they're doing, there are unique things it does."
4889.68,4911.44," And this is the investigative reporting, where opposition is arguing that there's stories that require a significant investment of is not going to exist if there's a significant financial exodus of people moving off into alternative things, because you're not going to be able to hire the reporters."
4911.88,4918.96," You're not going to be able to build these structures, which means stories like the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal are not going to be fully covered."
4919.08,4930.22," Now, I think this is the strongest material in some ways, the proposition that the panel found. Now, not necessarily strongest in terms of potential, but the strongest material that we felt that opposition sort of won on."
4930.22,4934.38," Now, this is the place where to dial back to the start."
4934.86,4947.52," The issue about the Ben Shapiro and other stuff matters because ultimately, in order for this to work uh we felt a majority felt that opposition needed to prove that not just that"
4947.52,4952.32, there would be a small exodus to the online stuff and that that extremism would be bad but there'd
4952.32,4958.0, be a significant enough exodus away that it would impact the funding and the amount of money
4958.0,4963.44, advertisers and others put into traditional media such that they'd no longer be able to do it and at
4963.44,4967.22, the point at which things like ben Shapiro and other stuff are being covered
4967.22,4974.22," by it, and that's mitigated, it wasn't necessarily proven to us why there would be such a financial"
4974.22,4976.36, hit that it would fully undermine it.
4976.36,4980.18," So while we were willing to buy that there might be some reduction in doing it, at the"
4980.18,4989.78," point at which this round becomes, whether or not a small number of people doing extreme, going to sort of extreme online media being radicalized, is more important than the majority."
4990.28,5005.92," Having more of this fairness doctrine to some degree imperfectly applied, but in most places doing it, we ended up having to weigh those two. that one because of the way the frame and because proposition kind of won on covering the largest"
5005.92,5012.24, social media opposition was unable to prove that you would necessarily have so much money coming
5012.24,5017.04, out of traditional media you wouldn't be able to do any investigative stuff so their strongest harm
5017.04,5022.96, that potentially outweighed the proposition case did not prevail then secondly in terms of weighing
5022.96,5025.44, we felt that the harm that did prevail which is that
5025.44,5031.04, some people will go this extremist stuff it is significantly worse for minorities um but it
5031.04,5037.28, wasn't clear why this outweighs the benefits on proposition it was assertive why it was but we
5037.28,5042.0, didn't feel that that weighing was there so the thing that opposition did win on we didn't feel
5042.0,5046.02," outweighed and for reason, a majority felt that proposition"
5046.02,5048.18, ended up narrowly prevailing.
5048.18,5051.2," I mean, a general sort of comments on this"
5051.2,5053.76," before moving in without doing it,"
5053.76,5056.32, I think the panel did feel that this was a very model
5056.32,5059.9, heavy round and that proposition put a lot of stuff
5059.9,5063.54," that probably was arguments into the model,"
5063.54,5066.54, which strategically worked out for them very
5066.54,5072.62," well in this debate, largely because I think for opposition, opposition needed to take"
5072.62,5077.42, out things that were in the model or do it in order for a lot of the argumentation to
5077.42,5078.42, work.
5078.42,5083.04," For instance, a lot of the argumentation about the social media alternative required proving"
5083.04,5086.16," that social media regulation was out of the round,"
5086.16,5088.22, or that the stuff that was out of the round
5088.22,5089.76, was a significant amount.
5089.76,5091.98, The same thing in terms of figuring out
5091.98,5095.2, where this round is set in terms of impacts.
5095.2,5096.8," Because a lot of the impacts,"
5096.8,5098.04," for instance of governmental abuse,"
5098.04,5102.42, exist on a spectrum between sort of authoritarian states
5102.42,5105.58," where those are probably maximal likelihood of occurring,"
5105.76,5110.6," but minimal impact in terms of this debate on comparative because they have limited free media,"
5110.94,5115.66," weak democracies where it's probably in the middle, and then strong democracies where the"
5115.66,5121.78, mechanism is most likely to work. And there are differential impacts. And I think position
5121.78,5135.0," there, figuring out where this round is likely to have the biggest impacts would also have been advantageous there in terms of the clash, and a lot of these clashes are decided not so much by who ends up winning them in terms of"
5135.0,5138.0," sub points, which is where we thought that opposition was very effective."
5138.0,5147.0," But ultimately, who ends up framing what this round is about, and where it sat, which then determines how we weigh up the arguments and why they end up going to the proposition."
5147.0,5171.0, I hope that is helpful. Are people wanting individual? Would like individual feedback if that's okay with you guys.
5171.0,5177.0," Okay, individual. Yep. I I can go with Sri Lanka."
5177.0,5188.08," I mean, Isaac, do you want to go with um uh because you understand do you want to go with um uh japan actually uh does japan"
5188.08,5193.68, want individual first because uh isabelle and isaac if you want to go with sri lanka because
5193.68,5200.64, uh you split do you want to go with them okay yeah i'm happy to do that uh do you want to go
5200.64,5205.54, with isaac or do you want to stick with me here? I don't care.
5206.08,5207.42, I can be with either of you.
5208.28,5208.58, Okay.
5209.18,5211.8," I mean, do you want to go with Isaac and then flip here?"
5212.06,5216.48," I'm sorry, this is a very strong panel, so I'm unsure how to sort of set this off."
5216.48,5216.9, I'll do that.
5217.06,5219.3, I'll go with Isaac and then come back.
5220.24,5220.54, All right.
5224.16,5229.0, So Sri Lanka and Rock should be we go into the prop prep room?
5229.94,5230.2, Okay.
5237.2,5237.84, Okay.
5239.18,5252.0, So I sort of was starting to give the individual feedback. I think what mattered a lot here was that proposition very cleverly buried a ton of critical stuff in the model.
5252.0,5268.48," And at the point at which you you sort of give some view of seeing this, because you do sort of a two line like a one line thing about what you think this is and the stance. And I think in the rebuttal, I'm just reading this out."
5268.48,5270.68, Alternative and this is from Ayaka's speech.
5270.68,5273.16, Alternative social media will not be part.
5273.36,5277.24, Motion says news media and with significant reach.
5277.56,5280.8, So the problem is the second part of that clause
5281.08,5288.26, and with significant reach is kind of opening the way for second prop to come up with
5288.26,5294.62," this. Now, I'm going to be perfectly honest on this. I actually, the moment proposition said"
5294.62,5302.26," they're covering social media, I went, can they do that in my notes? And I really wasn't sure they"
5302.26,5325.04," could. The way this exchange played out though, with you doing significant reach as your rebuttal and then basically moving on to the feasibility, the who constitutes the FCC board, the nitpicking, then allowed them in the second prop to come up with their, okay, but things like Ben Shapiro, at the point at which the daily wire becomes a corporation or llc"
5325.04,5330.72, and incorporates that's going to be covered we'll cover them on taxes and stuff for me that's a
5330.72,5337.04, sufficient thing and there is no subsequent pushback at all pretty much to that which means
5337.04,5343.04, the end thing for the debate for the majority of the panel is ben shapiro is being covered
5343.04,5345.02, alex jones is being covered. Alex Jones is being covered.
5345.02,5348.14, Anyone who's bringing in like millions of dollars
5348.14,5351.3, from alternative stuff is being covered.
5351.3,5353.64," And that effectively means one,"
5354.82,5358.74, you lost a frame in this debate that you didn't need to lose
5358.74,5360.9, because I'm not sure the motion gives it to them.
5360.9,5362.1," And I think that you have a,"
5362.1,5364.7, I think you do have an argument in terms of the motion
5364.7,5369.36," that what they're doing is, I don't, a squirrel would be unfair, but they're being greedy"
5369.36,5375.22," with the definition in this debate. But more importantly, almost your entire first part of"
5375.22,5387.32, your opposition and your impacts are dependent on not letting them do this. because once you let them regulate social media then all of your alternative impacts
5387.32,5393.34, become how day how much not is social is alternative media worse and more extreme
5393.34,5400.64, but is it sufficiently worse and extreme than the small number of people who are going to
5400.64,5405.08, smaller alternative media that isn't covered outweighs everything else.
5406.22,5411.72, So you're basically already behind in the first two or three minutes. And then after the first
5411.72,5417.3," three speeches by how it plays out. And like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I sort of want to stress this"
5417.3,5421.5," because like, this is at least for me and my impression was wrong, but you can ask them."
5421.74,5425.2, This was a big deal for me in terms of my call
5426.88,5435.92, in terms of weighing it up um and i think it was unnecessary in terms of doing it uh feasibility
5435.92,5441.04, stuff a bit nitpicky and doesn't really come up hugely who's going to be on the board that's
5441.04,5445.16," another sort of sliding scale thing that I think that you're not necessarily,"
5445.48,5451.24," I mean, it's probably true to some extent, but why is it winning? But ultimately your impacts are"
5451.24,5457.16," this. Now I want to say, I think you do an excellent job on the fairness doctrine,"
5457.62,5461.82, forcing a shift to alternative media. I think the setup for this is great. I think the people
5461.82,5468.88," have more incentive to opt in, why people shift shift it's uncomfortable to confront on it people lose trust in the media alternative media is more"
5468.88,5474.48, incentive even if they promote fake news they do it uh counterfactual mainstream media is greater
5474.48,5480.4, things they're losing companies are unwilling to be doing it the self-regulation why it's unnecessary
5480.4,5487.34, actually probably should have been uh flagged later on. But it's not necessarily there.
5490.94,5491.46, Okay.
5493.06,5495.12," So I think you've proven the second thing,"
5495.24,5497.4, why less capacity is incredibly harmful
5497.4,5498.98, and why this is important.
5499.24,5501.78, But I think it's the linkage for less capacity
5501.78,5504.84, is kind of requires you to prove your first point
5504.84,5505.52, in order to get your
5505.52,5509.92, second point which is why the fairness doctrine hinders ability to report on important issues
5509.92,5514.24, i'm sorry if this is too strategic versus delivery but the delivery is excellent uh
5517.92,5524.16, it's really just the strategic meta stuff that unfortunately undermines delivery and like
5524.16,5526.4, analytical content in isolation might very
5526.4,5532.88, well be winning or better than prop on this uh do you want to add anything on that or um yeah i i
5532.88,5537.6, agree with pretty much everything that daniel has said so far i also agree with the point about
5537.6,5542.16, things being meta in terms of just like debate basics delivery delivering comparatives
5542.16,5548.84," mechanization i think this was perfectly well done on opposition side, and I commend you guys for that. I think areas you could improve"
5548.84,5554.04," on are just the meta stuff. So specifically in my case, I saw the debate really wash down two"
5554.04,5560.26," clashes, firstly on polarization and secondly on government abuse. And here, there was definitely"
5560.26,5566.0, like room in my deliberation for opposition to come out on top um because I did
5566.0,5571.76, end up giving like the government abuse point over to opposition specifically um you know proposition
5571.76,5576.2, contends that oh they won't be government abuse because their Democratic checks and balances even
5576.2,5580.34, in the weakest democracies their opposition parties their courts things like that right
5580.34,5585.2, opposition contends and says that oh there's a lot of nuance indivisible methods that governments
5585.2,5591.76, can like check um can manipulate the news and secondly this is i i also bought into your like
5591.76,5597.44, argument on profitability given that like there will be less corporate sponsorship there will be
5597.44,5601.68, less money for even if it's marginal there'll be less money for the most expensive things such as
5601.68,5608.96, investigative journalism and like unveiling corruption which is analytically prior to all the checks and balances that opposition is trying to
5608.96,5615.92, like respond by right the problem for me in this debate was given that i had given that these two
5615.92,5622.24, teams were operating are winning on two different clashes um so like i gave the polarization the
5622.24,5626.36, proposition uh point and i think the majority of the panel agreed on this.
5626.36,5630.0, But I also gave the government abuse point to opposition.
5630.68,5647.36," Given this, I think you guys could have swayed me over if towards the end of the speech towards like whip and like reply. able to illustrate why um like the government abuse point weighed much more heavier like more"
5647.36,5652.96, heavily than the point on polarization and extremism like even if you lost the prior clash
5652.96,5659.04, how could you have won that one um i am not sure on how like you guys could improve on this given
5659.04,5668.38," that i'm also um uh like news is judging um but regardless, I'm actually agreement on it. I think the issue"
5668.38,5671.72, with the governmental abuse for me is not necessarily that you lose on it per se.
5671.9,5677.54," It's that you don't impact it because the impact, this is what I meant, is the impact is a sliding"
5677.54,5683.56," scale. The places where you most win on it seem to have the lowest relative impact, whereas the"
5683.56,5685.36, places where it's most ambiguous seem to have the higher one impact whereas the places where it's most ambiguous
5685.36,5689.92, seem to have the higher one so i think you do prove the government abuse will exist and the
5689.92,5694.32, government abuse will be total in countries that have other forms of governmental abuse
5695.12,5700.24, but and then and then probably government abuse will be less the stronger other things are and
5700.24,5707.92, i think making this the impact as to why that's winning as opposed to true is a big issue
5707.92,5714.56, um so i want to go back to um like i'll just run on to the second which is i think you want um i
5714.56,5720.08, think this is a good idea proposition idea of neutrality even if the major issues on broadcast
5720.08,5728.0, are minority issues um principle okay i think this is correct you do basically wash out the
5728.0,5733.44, principle here you do an excellent job of doing it which is i would argue that we are the prerequisite
5733.44,5738.0, to the principle uh we achieve their end goal principle can both i think you've successfully
5738.0,5742.8, proved that if you win on everything else like you win on the practical you also beat them on
5742.8,5745.04, principle like i think you have four
5745.04,5751.82, points here all of which are true and all of which end up establishing that you end up doing it
5752.78,5758.54, but the problem is that still leaves you with proving that you necessarily end up winning on
5758.54,5764.3, it now I think this is where again like the governmental stuff like I see the FCC thing
5764.3,5785.2, now I think the FCC has an incentive to make it appear to work. A i mean i think they will happen
5785.2,5792.72, it's just how often in way or and how important uh decrease um uh things um i think that in terms
5792.72,5798.72, of your contrast with decreased polarization this again is good um i think this is i think the
5798.72,5802.88, vast majority of people who are moderates are having friends from many different backgrounds
5802.88,5805.78," the friends from different backgrounds thing never really became important,"
5805.78,5808.28, but it played out weirdly at least in my head
5808.28,5810.34, in the sense that this seems like an argument
5810.34,5812.44, that could work on both sides if it's true.
5814.34,5816.2, Like it's a reason why this isn't a problem
5816.2,5817.3," in the first place,"
5817.3,5819.86, but it also mitigates the extremism thing
5819.86,5822.34," to a limited degree, why their side is worse,"
5822.34,5824.28," media can get captured by dominant parties,"
5824.28,5830.48, things like scandals. All of this is kind of dependent on proving that governments will use this to
5830.48,5835.52, weaponize it because they want to because they control the courts and other things which again
5835.52,5840.24, runs into i guess the issue of the places where this is most likely to impact already probably
5840.24,5845.76, have it so i think ultimately it is there but it's unclear why this is going to occur in
5845.76,5850.56, countries where it's not necessarily over occurring at least to myself and others um
5851.7,5858.6, I think that um for third opens with attacking sort of contradiction I'll flip in a minute um
5858.6,5864.36, I think the issue with contradictions at least for me is 90 time people say something is intention
5864.36,5865.06, it comes off
5865.06,5869.96," as not being generous to the other side, because there's usually a perfectly good explanation for"
5869.96,5874.64," why it's not, which we hear in the subsequent speech. Which is not to say that you shouldn't"
5874.64,5878.32," ever do it, but I think teams are a bit too generous with accusing the other team of"
5878.32,5884.38," contradicting themselves. Which is why I'm not sure it's the most effective thing, but others"
5884.38,5887.0, will comment momentarily in terms of how they see it.
5887.0,5891.0," Unengaged argument, investigative journalism. I think you're correct."
5891.0,5898.0," The investigative journalism point here, but that's dependent on proving you're not going to be able to get any more investigative journalism."
5898.0,5901.0, I think you do conclusively prove that investigative journalism is a good thing.
5901.0,5905.56," If it doesn't exist, that's a big hit."
5906.9,5910.1," I think the problem with the model is actually kind of encapsulated in the third speech in canon,"
5910.1,5911.6, which is they said they had other parties.
5911.6,5913.5, Not every democracy is going to have this.
5913.5,5915.7, Sometimes the government is funding this.
5915.7,5918.36, Sometimes the government is able to influence it.
5918.36,5922.08, Like all of those things are sometimes in some places
5922.08,5923.4, these things happen.
5923.4,5925.54, Almost all of that is almost assuredly true.
5926.4,5928.38, But how do we weigh that?
5930.86,5936.12, How do we weigh these sometimes in some places some governments will try and do this?
5939.1,5940.14, How often?
5940.54,5941.5, How many places?
5941.82,5946.0, And I think that's a problem for majority panel when it came to sort of the way.
5946.0,5954.0," Ah, and I think this comes up with the Poi as well when they ask if only a small minority would switch."
5954.0,5962.0, And I think that the pivot to the sort of one in terms of polarization ends up being a little bit bigger.
5962.0,5969.7, Otherwise it's very well delivered. but I think in terms of it the way in which you do the government thing kind of encapsulates both
5969.7,5974.64," the strengths of the argument, it being true, and the weaknesses, it being not really weighed"
5974.64,5981.74," as well as it could. And I think that the reply is solid, even majority of individuals moderate."
5981.74,5985.76," The principle split, yup, I mean the principal is out."
5985.76,5992.0," I do think pivoting to the funding thing is important, but again it's dependent on proving"
5992.0,5997.82," that you win funding, not proving that if you win funding you win the debate. I think probably a lot"
5997.82,6002.08," of us would be sympathetic to the argument you're making, but you need to prove you won on it, not"
6002.08,6009.54, if you won on it it's an independent path victory but we agree it is the correct thing to focus on there okay I can swap uh to the room
6009.54,6015.66, with Sri Lanka I'm sorry for leaving them waiting uh which they're in the prep room uh prop prep
6015.66,6032.2," room yeah okay debate 17. yeah I just quickly add one thing I've heard some of the feedback and I don't want to take too much of your time. You have the roll call soon. I think you did a fairly good job,"
6032.54,6036.84, but everything that Dan said and also when you do...
6037.84,6044.66," I was going on for a little bit of time on this. Oh, actually, I don't know if I should"
6044.66,6045.9, stop the recording.
6045.9,6045.98, Okay.
