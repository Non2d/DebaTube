0.0,7.6," industrial unions are better for unions' rights, workers' rights, and within this I'm going to be"
7.6,13.84, using the sub-point of why workplace unions are less effective for the representation of workers.
14.7,19.02," But before I define what these industrial unions would look like, let our stance to the opposition"
19.02,24.6," be clear. We do not deny that both workplace and industrial unions cannot exist together,"
24.7,28.0, and we do believe that both of them are important for the workforce.
28.0,46.0," However, fundamentally, we will explain to you why industrial unions can create industry-wide change, and this makes mass political action easier, and therefore industrial unions would be more preferable. So a workplace union is a union that only involves the workers of one specific company."
46.0,53.0, And so these unions would then therefore tend to focus on directly negotiating with the management of that individual company.
53.0,63.0," And later in my speech, I'm going to highlight how this in itself is problematic for the wellbeing of the workers and how it's less effective in implementing change for them."
63.0,66.08," And by contrast, an industrial union is a union"
66.08,72.24, with workers from the entire industry. And industrial unions more often will try and focus
72.24,77.12," on trying to implement industry-wide standards for workers' rights, rather than just negotiating"
77.12,83.28, with individual companies. And it's this meaningful mass change that truly positively affects the
83.28,85.78," lives of workers, and this is why we find it more"
85.78,91.52, preferable. A burden of proof in this debate is that we will prove to you that industrial unions
91.52,96.84, are more effective in protecting the rights of workers and overall improving the efficiency
96.84,103.28, of the industry as a whole. And so this leads me on to our argument on why industrial unions are
103.28,105.72, better for the rights of workers.
105.72,111.5," So to provide a mechanism for the workplace union, we think that it works by having the"
111.5,114.18," workers, like I said, negotiate with a company."
114.18,120.9," But ultimately with this mechanism, it's the management making the decisions, not the workers."
120.9,128.0, We find this detrimental as it inhibits the abilities for workers to deal with the issues that they find.
128.0,132.0," Sorry, was that a point? Yes. I'll take your point."
132.0,139.0," On your side of the house, there is still a collective bargaining aspect where leadership of the union is directly negotiating with companies,"
139.0,146.8, but they're directly negotiating with every company at once how is this more effective well we we find that the fact that
146.8,152.16, they're negotiating with the um the whole industry as a whole we find it we find it like more
152.16,157.92, preferable because we'd see industry change rather than if you're just negotiating with a specific
157.92,166.1, management position you might be implementing change for a smaller group whereas what we find more preferable is change for entire
166.1,173.84, industry which is more impactful and so we find it detrimental in workplace unions for the workers
173.84,178.3, to deal with the issues just with their management and achieve rights for the following reasons.
178.92,184.52, The first is that workers are still working for a company and therefore would might be hesitant in
184.52,185.36, bringing up ideas
185.36,190.42, and complaints because at the end of the day their earnings depend on the company and their bosses
190.42,196.38, so we find it less them less likely to bring up their concerns or issues as we believe that
196.38,203.8," this industrial change is more effective to implement for the rights of workers. Two, we see"
203.8,206.52," a conflict, I'll take your point in at the end of"
206.52,212.32," this argument, we see a conflict of interest between the managers and workers. Their rights"
212.32,217.36, clash with the policies of the company so we might see bias that is much less present with
217.36,222.56, industrial unions which overall provide a fairer solution to representing workers' rights.
223.3,226.76," Also three, it's unclear what the checks and balances are"
227.82,230.5, with workplace unions to ensure that the company
230.5,232.3, actually listens to the rights of workers.
232.3,235.0," Whereas in industrial change, we see change"
235.0,237.02, that is more likely to be implemented
237.02,239.36, for the rights of most workers.
239.36,243.3," And four, we see conflict between companies' objectives"
243.3,244.7," and the workplace unions,"
244.7,250.28, because companies will want profits and therefore we believe that wages will might will be less likely to arise.
250.88,257.16, And therefore we think it's less likely for the rights of workers to be achieved under their side and I'll take your point now quickly.
258.02,269.68," If a worker is so scared of their employers that they're not going to create a workplace union, what incentive do have to unionize against the entire industry which includes the company that they are so afraid of"
270.8,274.32, well um this is actually going to lead into my related point but we think that when you're
274.32,279.92, tackling a whole uh industry as a whole different factions of the entire industry could come
279.92,283.52, together and therefore they can implement meaningful change together it's that sense
283.52,289.1, of togetherness that is really um that provides workers with confidence to tackle um the industry
289.1,294.62, as a whole rather than just trying uh trying to defeat this their objective um through the company
294.62,300.54, as on their own basically on the flip side to provide a mechanism for industrial unions and
300.54,308.66," why they're more preferable on us out of the house. There are lots of different sectors within a company. So we see workers, cleaners and many different people."
308.98,312.8," And they belong to different industries, but they exclusively have different problems."
313.56,318.48," The issues that can arise from this, if they're blended together, are significant."
318.6,319.46, I'll explain this now.
320.06,324.04, Industrial unions are better set up to deal with the issues of the workers.
324.86,329.76," In a workplace union, specific areas of the job make up a minority, so it's unlikely"
329.76,333.52," that issues may be taken seriously due to limited resources of workplace unions,"
333.52,337.52, and it's more efficient for them to focus on the majority within a company.
338.16,340.8, We find it preferable that industrial unions represent all.
341.44,345.48," Within industrial unions, no thank you, they create forums for specific minorities"
345.48,349.84," within an industry, like I said, to unite under different factions so they have a stronger voice"
349.84,353.92, and make it more likely for issues to be dealt with. And this actually pressures the government
353.92,359.54, to make change because any disruption within the industry is important to the government as it
359.54,363.84, could cause economic disruptions and therefore the government has an incentive to intervene
363.84,369.28, to act in the best interest of the individuals and the economy so it's more likely that the government will listen
369.28,374.08, to these issues and additionally the government versus company we're going to additionally with
374.08,378.96, the government versus the company we see um we're going to explain who's the better actor to
378.96,383.92, initiate change it's the obligation of the government to incentivize to protect its citizens
383.92,387.04, um as this has positive feedback connection with trade unions.
387.12,392.7, So it's more likely to enact change and also personally detached from the workers.
392.84,399.34," So it will not be held back by biases. And this versus the company who is more likely to be profit orientated,"
399.62,403.68," whilst workers are the core of the company, it's ultimately the incentive to make more money."
403.9,410.14, And so it's more likely for conflicts of interest to occur between companies so therefore industrial unions as a
410.14,415.24, whole provide a more weighed balance to implement meaningful change that positively affects the
415.24,458.9," lives of the workforce and this in itself provides a more sustainable future for Industries as a whole. Proud to propose. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker, for the five remarks. I now invite the first speaker from side opposition. All right. Am I audible?"
460.82,461.56," Yes, you are."
462.14,467.14," Okay, perfect. And I prefer my POIs to be verbal. So if you can unmute yourself, that would be great."
468.86,485.3," The claim coming from Proposition 1 was incredibly simplistic. It seemed like their team line was just like teamwork makes the dream work. And if there's industrial change, then we're going to solve all issues that workers face. The biggest problem with their side is that they neglect the fact that workers have"
485.3,489.46," very different interests, very different grievances, and work in companies that have"
489.46,494.86," completely different conditions. They never proved to us how in a industry that was so different,"
495.16,498.82," how they were going to get collective change together. Instead, what was likely to happen"
498.82,502.92, on their side of the house is that you got diluted change and change that only occurred
502.92,508.7," at the least common denominator. They never provide you a single reason why they get unity on their side of the house,"
508.8,513.9, as opposed to fragmentation. We argue that workplace unions are going to be far more
513.9,518.58, representative and meet the direct needs that people ask for themselves. That's why we're so
518.58,523.8, far ahead on side opposition. I'm going to forward two substantive arguments for side
523.8,528.66," opposition, but before that, some framing and then rebuttal. First, on the level of framing, I think we largely"
528.66,532.5," agree with side proposition's framing that on our side of the house, there's less emphasis on"
532.5,536.76," industry-wide unions, and there's more smaller unions that exist at a company-based level."
536.92,541.0," But I want them to clarify in their next speech what industrial-level change actually means,"
541.14,548.74, because their entire case is very unclear. What kind of change occurs? Are they lobbying the government for legislative change or are they working with different companies? I
548.74,553.28, think side proposition needs to clarify this. I can clarify this for themselves because at the
553.28,557.2," end of the day, what they need on their side of the house is still for management and CEOs of"
557.2,561.38, companies still abide in the changes that occur across the industry. That's something that they
561.38,568.2, need to clarify. Moving on to some responses to their arguments. They make a couple points. The first argument that they make is that people are less
568.2,572.08, likely to share their ideas and complaints. I don't think this is true. This is significantly
572.08,576.32," worse on their side of the house, because when you have an industry-wide union, there's so much"
576.32,582.14," bureaucracy. Thank you. So if I'm a small worker, it's much less likely that my concern will be"
582.14,587.58, heard in an industry of thousands upon thousands of workers versus just my simple workplace.
587.58,594.74," So if people have grievances, those grievances are much more likely to be communicated within a smaller workplace than in a broad industry."
595.1,598.72," Secondly, they make this claim about how like minorities are going to stand to benefit."
598.88,605.04," I don't think this is true. I think on their side of the house, minorities are less likely to have their voices heard and have less leverage."
605.24,617.72," Because, for example, if we take, for example, like the steelworking industry within the United States, this is a white-dominated industry, but there are specific places in the United States, like Alabama or like Georgia, where there's primarily Black workplaces."
617.98,623.18, Those workplaces on our side of the house can get specific changes to deal with things like harassment and racism.
623.18,628.6," But on their side of the house, they have to go up to the white heads that run the industrial union and get support from them."
628.7,632.96, That was significantly less likely than them working within their own workplaces and creating
632.96,637.8, changes and different things like that. Their last idea was how they're going to pour resources and
637.8,641.92, get different people working together. I'm going to respond to this within my own material. With
641.92,649.62," that in mind, our first substantive argument is that we increase the effectiveness of unions. The thesis of this argument is that in a workplace, unions are better"
649.62,654.0, able to galvanize support from workers and accomplish their demands. The first layer of
654.0,658.08, this argument is how we increase support. I want to note that people are reluctant to join unions
658.08,662.34," for several reasons. A, because of the obligation of time. B, because of the dues of unions and"
662.34,669.26," different fees. C, because in society there's general union stigma, and D, there's a hierarchy that exists that deters people from joining unions."
669.46,673.84," That is very important because in order for people to join unions, they need to know that"
673.84,677.52, their concerns are going to be met and they have to have a guarantee that there's going to be
677.52,682.22, returns and tangible benefits from them joining the unions. There are three reasons why we get
682.22,689.48," people to buy in and join unions on our side of the house. Number one, recruitment is significantly easier on our side of the house. It is more likely"
689.48,694.66," that you're going to join a union if it's someone that's in your workplace, i.e. a co-worker or"
694.66,697.88," someone that you trust that is coming and recruiting you, rather than someone that's"
697.88,702.12," like an external marketing agent from the larger industrial union. Secondly, on our side of the"
702.12,710.2," house, we get much more specific messaging. People within the union are speaking to your specific issues as opposed to broad industry problems. So"
710.2,714.9," if, for example, you work for a manufacturing plant and the biggest concern is safety, you don't want"
714.9,719.44, to hear about hours and different things like that. You want to hear about safety. So messaging
719.44,724.3, on our side of the house is more persuasive and more compelling because it's specific to the
724.3,725.42," workplace. Finally,"
725.5,729.82," I think it's because you're more likely to see change quickly. When you have workplace unions,"
730.0,734.66," you're more likely to see immediate returns. This is number one, because like I said before,"
734.66,740.2," there's less red tape and bureaucracy that exists. But finally, for change to happen on their side of"
740.2,745.2," the house, there's to be large levels of buy-in i.e workers across different companies have to"
745.2,750.32, come together and agree that a problem is an issue strike for that problem or lobby for that problem
750.32,755.04, for that to be solved that requires far more work than our side of the house so if people
755.04,760.08, are more likely to see returns at a faster pace they were more likely to stay within the union
760.08,764.0, at that point we not only get better recruitment but people stay in the unions on our side of the
764.0,767.0, house before i move on to my second layer I can take a point if there is one.
770.66,773.36," OK, seeing no points, I'm going to move on to the second layer."
773.64,774.32," Actually, yeah, go ahead."
776.12,783.54," Don't you think in an industrial union where people have, where different people come from different backgrounds, they have different perspectives on things."
783.54,787.3," So therefore, it would make things more efficient instead of bureaucratic."
787.3,791.26," Less efficient. If you have different perspectives, it's better for you to work in your specific"
791.26,796.22," workplace and get those demands accomplished rather than competing with 5,000 other people"
796.22,799.48, who have different interests than you to get something accomplished. That was the collective
799.48,803.22, action problem on your side of the house. Second layer is how we improve the bargaining process.
803.66,808.94, Companies are more likely to comply on our side of the house because the demands that unions make are specific
808.94,813.8, to the workforce. The problem with an industry-wide union is that companies have different capacities.
814.16,818.92, That is to say that a company like Starbucks that has billions of dollars in profits has less of an
818.92,823.8," ability to support their workers than a smaller mom-and-pop coffee shop, right? So you can't"
823.8,825.56, implement a one-size-fits-all solution
825.56,829.8," for all companies. Why is this harmful? Number one, you get to erase the bottom on their side"
829.8,833.52," of the house, which means that for you to get industry-wide standards, you need to dilute the"
833.52,838.08, demands to make sure that companies get buy-in. That is even the lowest denominator of companies.
838.28,842.28," Even if on our side of the house, we don't get the lowest denominator, at least the majority of"
842.28,848.42," people get better benefits, get comprehensive changes in wages and working conditions, while on their side of the house, they dilute changes."
848.88,852.0," Secondly, on their side of the house, if they want to get more aggressive changes,"
852.2,856.72, they have to have longer extended strikes. And this is incredibly damaging because the longer
856.72,861.98," strikes go, the less income people are getting, the less capable people are to pay for things"
861.98,865.76, like rent and pay for things like food. This means that people
865.76,869.96, realize that the cost of joining a union is too high and they're less likely to join the union.
870.36,874.02, Second substantive is how we get better representation for workers. Even if we
874.02,880.52," assume that buy-in is symmetric, workplace unions are more effective at improving working conditions"
880.52,884.82," for specific issues that companies face. First of all, I want to note that different companies"
884.82,889.06," experience different issues. So for example, like Starbucks had a massive harassment"
889.06,894.58, and secrecy problem. Amazon had an issue of safety concerns and people working very long hours. That
894.58,898.34, is to say that different companies within individual industries have different problems
898.34,902.84, that affect them. The problem is that these specific issues are unlikely to be resolved of
902.84,905.0," the union at large in the industrial union,"
905.16,909.04, because the only way that the industrial union gets something accomplished is if there's broad
909.04,913.16," base support from all workers. So while on their side of the house, they may get some base level"
913.16,917.82," working conditions accomplished, the more specific issues that people face, like harassments that's"
917.82,922.0," occurring, or racism, or issues of oppression that are occurring in the workplace, those specific"
922.0,929.2, issues don't get resolved on their side of the house. Why were we likely to get representative solutions for workers? There were three reasons.
929.2,933.6," A, it's because workers have an established, known relationship with the company administration that"
933.6,938.24," they collectively bargained against. Secondly, it's because there was less internal gridlock"
938.24,942.0," within the union because there's simply less people. On their side of the house, you're more"
942.0,948.82," likely to see competing interests and fracturing where different people have different concerns, which means that no one is able to agree on actual"
948.82,953.48," solutions. And finally, on our side of the house, you got more reliably engaged members. They're"
953.48,957.34," more likely to participate in strikes, and they know that those strikes are going to directly"
957.34,961.8," benefit them. For those reasons, not only do we get more benefits, more union strength on our"
961.8,971.34," side of the house, but we get representative solutions as well very proud to oppose I'm the speaker for Defiant remarks I now invite the second speaker"
971.34,1022.72," from side proposition here here Okay. I will be starting in 321 today side proposition have mistaken the whole motion, we tell that"
1022.72,1025.44, we're not arguing for a pure
1025.44,1031.12, industrial union. We tell that this motion is not a zero sum. We tell that industrial
1031.12,1036.36, union can also coexist with workplace union. But what is the difference is that on our
1036.36,1042.18," side, we prefer industrial union better because we believe that industrial union could create"
1042.18,1049.12, an industrial wide change. And this is what is most important in this world and this is the most urgent thing that we need to solve and we think
1049.12,1055.44, that it makes mass political actions easier and more efficient so today i will be bringing to
1055.44,1061.44, this debate uh on my substantive about how uh industrial unions would be more efficient
1061.44,1068.88," would create better efficiency for the workforce but But before I start my substantive four pieces of rebuttals, first"
1069.08,1071.24, proposition said that
1071.44,1074.92, because that side propositions of that
1075.12,1078.8, the leadership of the unions need to communicate with every single company.
1078.8,1081.32, So that's why it makes the whole thing less effective.
1081.52,1083.2," However, we tell that if a policy is"
1083.4,1085.44, unanimously agreed by all workers we
1085.44,1090.48, see that there's a chain that needs to be made and we see that only at industrial level that this
1090.48,1094.96, chain would be the most effective and we tell that even if even if they need to communicate with all
1094.96,1099.2, the companies we think this is still more effective because the workers in the same industry is likely
1099.2,1107.04, to have similar demands or even if they are different it's just a matter of time we tell that at the end of the time
1107.04,1112.0, we tell that workers in the same industry would have similar goals and they argue for similar
1112.0,1116.4, stuff so therefore they will have to discuss these companies would have to discuss these issues
1116.4,1121.12, anyway in the future so therefore we believe that on our side we would get more efficiency in the
1121.12,1126.88, long term so and I will be expanding on that further in my point a second
1126.88,1133.44, point of rebuttal on how on uh their question of what does industrial level change mean we think
1133.44,1137.6, this is very obvious right we see that it looks like something like better safety standards for
1137.6,1143.2, construction workers um less working hours of increase in wages um for different sectors
1143.2,1146.32, uh catering to their needs and we tell that maybe for example
1146.32,1153.04, teachers arguing for working for a smaller class size because looking for a smaller class size so
1153.04,1157.84, we don't we don't think there's any confusion here and we don't think why these kind of changes
1157.84,1170.48, should not be on that industrial level and why is it not as important as the workforce workforce change so on to our third point of rebuttal is how
1170.48,1178.0, how um how work how workforce workforce union would be create would be increasing the effectiveness
1178.96,1188.0," uh they say that they say that because they have this specific uh demand for different companies, for different workforce in different companies,"
1188.0,1191.0, so therefore they are more likely to see the change quickly.
1191.0,1198.0," However, the whole premise of their argument is dependent on the workforce unions."
1198.0,1203.0, It's dependent on workforce union working.
1203.0,1225.68," However, they have not justified to us why little people means that it will have competing interests. However, they"
1225.68,1229.82, have not proven to us why workers from the same industry will have conflicting interests.
1229.82,1233.72," However, on the other hand, we tell you that workers from the same industry is very likely"
1233.72,1241.42, for them to have similar interests and similar things that they want to argue for because
1241.42,1248.8, they are experiencing the same industrial problems problems um for example miners in the
1248.8,1253.44, past they were experiencing uh poor and poor working environment and those kind of stuff so
1253.44,1257.44, therefore we believe that uh the interest there would not be competing interest so therefore there
1257.44,1264.0, would not be a trade-off in efficiency now moving on to my uh substantive on how it increased the
1264.0,1265.92, work efficiency of the workforce.
1265.92,1269.92," So why is that? There are four ways of how we see this happening. First, we see that there's"
1269.92,1275.52," less repetitive work in the industry because A, we do not need different people in different"
1275.52,1280.08," places to work really hard for the same change to occur. We tell that, for example, construction"
1280.08,1287.36, workers who fight for a higher salary if they are in an industrial union and we tell that so
1287.36,1292.8, therefore less human resources are needed to negotiate for the same change and second reason
1293.68,1300.24, um we tell that industrial industrial union is sort of like a melting pot because when people
1300.24,1308.96, when industrial unions industrial unions contain more people than workforce union you have people from a more diverse background so you have different points of views and perspective on
1308.96,1315.2, things so therefore you have more ideas of change so we have this intelligence of the majority that
1315.2,1321.12, we can solve the most urgent issues in this industry and that is the most important thing
1321.12,1326.02," uh in this debate and we tell tell that because there are more people,"
1326.02,1329.22, there are more suggestions on how this change
1329.22,1331.24, could be most effectively made.
1331.24,1334.7, So therefore we also get efficiency of the workforce.
1334.7,1337.92," The third way of how efficiency will be happening,"
1337.92,1342.5, we see that workers in an industrial union
1342.5,1344.18," will be a greater in number, right?"
1344.18,1346.12, We see that the workers are more
1346.12,1350.78," centralized on our side. So therefore, they're stronger, they're more powerful. So therefore,"
1351.06,1355.82, it is harder for the companies to ignore their demands. It's easier for change because there's
1355.82,1361.72, more that they can do. An example could be the railway strike in the UK. We see that when the
1361.72,1369.94," whole industry are coordinating to stop working, the pressure that they give the government is incredibly detrimental. It could cause"
1369.94,1373.98," the whole society to stop functioning. So therefore, the demands could be made with"
1373.98,1380.78, quick changes because of the power that they could do. And onto the fourth reason of why
1380.78,1385.96," with this increased efficiency of workforce, we tell that we gain long-term sustainability"
1385.96,1388.88, because we tell that when there are less repetitive work
1388.88,1391.3," within the company and the workplace union,"
1391.3,1392.62, workers come and go.
1392.62,1395.04, So it's very likely for the companies to refer back
1395.04,1397.86, to their original habits because it's more convenient
1397.86,1399.66, and more cost efficient.
1399.66,1402.42," However, if you're doing an industrial change,"
1402.42,1403.72, this change would be permanent.
1403.72,1410.76, So therefore we don't need people to continue fighting for the same rights or policies every time. So before I move on to
1410.76,1418.0," the impacts of having a higher efficiency, is there any POI at this point? You never prove why"
1418.0,1422.06, we need to unite different workers from different companies. Why can't they accomplish their
1422.06,1431.2, specific interests by striking the specific company they work at okay we tell that they want they will have the same goal because we tell that the the
1431.76,1437.36, problems within the industry is called is coherent right we tell that in an industry uh the problems
1437.36,1446.64, that people are saving are facing is very similar as the example i've given you on on uh how does the railway workers they want to strike for
1446.64,1455.28, a better a better a better working environment and a shorter shorter a better safety safety
1455.28,1459.92, standards we tell that these are the things that are common for all industrial workers and these
1459.92,1464.32, are the most important stuff as for individual companies if you have individual demands it's
1464.32,1468.88, okay for you to have this choice to create a workforce company but that is not the major
1468.88,1474.4, goal in the current status quo and that is not not the most emergent not the most urgent issues
1474.4,1480.48, so back to the points of this uh efficiency improved efficiency in workforce we we see that
1480.48,1485.52, into a perspective first and workers we tell that workers could argue for more rights because
1485.52,1490.32, this is easier and more likely to get the rights with industrial union and secondly we tell that
1490.32,1495.84, the workforce could divert their time and attention to doing real work instead of getting distracted
1495.84,1502.88, and this leads on to the benefits of companies obviously um having a more efficient workforce
1502.88,1505.0, so the company would gain more profits.
1505.0,1508.0, And then the second perspective of this is on industry.
1508.0,1514.0," So because we're initiating a change in one go, so we ensure the quality of the sector and have standardized rules."
1514.0,1520.0," So therefore, I'm so proud to oppose. Thank you."
1520.0,1563.24," Thank you, Speaker, for the final remarks. i'll invite the second speaker from side opposition Great."
1563.24,1566.0, And I would prefer verbal POIs.
1566.0,1567.0, Awesome.
1567.0,1575.48," Proposition cannot win today's round by simply asserting that it's really, really good when"
1575.48,1577.16, people work together.
1577.16,1580.98," That is, at its most fundamental level, just what a union is."
1580.98,1585.46, What they had to prove to you is the necessity of having a single union to
1585.46,1592.26, represent the interests of all employees across an entire industry. I am unclear as to why
1592.26,1598.76," when there is an industry-wide problem, specific workplaces cannot just individually unionize,"
1598.76,1603.2, why they need to all follow the exact same bureaucratic process that we think is going
1603.2,1609.32, to be counterproductive and far less likely to achieve the needs and wants of workers we are incredibly proud to oppose.
1609.32,1613.6," A few things in my speech. First, a question on what exactly they're standing for. Second,"
1613.6,1618.38, a note on a quick note on framing. And then on to two questions for today's round and
1618.38,1622.64, the third substance of given that I'm still very curious as to what industry change is.
1622.64,1626.86, I want to remind you that Ben asked this question in OV1 and still with no response.
1626.96,1629.3, All they say is it's like big structural changes.
1629.42,1631.48," For example, better labor standards, increased wages."
1631.96,1633.28," Yes, but like by who?"
1633.38,1634.42, Is this government policy?
1634.54,1636.1, Are you lobbying elected politicians?
1636.5,1638.18, Are you trying to get people out to the polls?
1638.18,1642.38, Or are you now trying to work and have like every single CEO of major companies agree
1642.38,1644.44, to the exact same workplace policies?
1644.6,1648.88, I don't understand the logistics of this they need to engage with that second then is they tell you
1648.88,1652.32, that like in this last speech that they're going to be able to access like both types of union
1652.32,1658.08, i want to specific specify what the term to prefer means right when workers choose on which union to
1658.08,1662.48, join they are going to choose workplace ones meaning that over time industrial unions are
1662.48,1666.16," inevitably going to decline as workplace ones increase in prominence,"
1666.38,1668.9," ultimately meaning you are going to have far fewer, if any."
1669.04,1674.04," Given that, first question in today's round on who mobilizes and organizes unions the best."
1674.32,1679.08, Why is this question so important in today's round and generally when trying to improve better workplace standards?
1679.22,1685.4, Because you literally need the collective in order to have collective bargaining. Having people actually show up and be
1685.4,1690.58, willing to join unions and be able to organize specific things like strikes to put pressures on
1690.58,1695.52," company is the only way that unions actually achieve anything. Whether it is a union, a workplace"
1695.52,1700.26," union, or an industry union, that is just like how they all function. This means that whoever"
1700.26,1709.62," wins this question is able to access the prerequisite to just like unions in general, why do we do this better? Why do we get more mobilization and resources? For two reasons."
1709.86,1714.8," Number one, we tell you that unions are always going to be a lot smaller. This leads to a few"
1714.8,1719.72," things. One, a lot easier recruitment. Second, it is easier to communicate with one another. Third,"
1719.8,1730.12," it is less bureaucratic. Fourth, it is regionally aligned in a lot of cases rather than being like spread out over the country. And five, this makes coordination a lot easier. I want to point"
1730.12,1734.78, out that this directly engages with their arguments about the unions being centralized and more
1734.78,1739.44, efficient on their side of the house. This proposition is just practically impossible.
1739.76,1745.6, It is always going to be harder to try to negotiate and organize and mobilize hundreds of thousands of
1745.6,1750.24, people that do not even have the same employer that are not usually based in the same part of
1750.24,1755.6, the country i know just like so many more of them in order to create things like massive amounts of
1755.6,1760.96, strikes that is why industry strikes are so rare compared to workplace strikes because just think
1760.96,1765.96," about it like it is easy to walk up to the person whose cubicle is next to you and tell them like,"
1765.96,1767.42," oh, you should join a union"
1767.42,1769.5, or send out like an email blast to people
1769.5,1770.66, that you know personally
1770.66,1772.9, in order to do something like organize a strike.
1772.9,1775.22, This is not something that happens with an industry union
1775.22,1777.02," when you have hundreds of thousands of people,"
1777.02,1779.72," which inevitably creates a very complex bureaucracy,"
1779.72,1781.56, making organization very difficult.
1781.56,1783.1," We told you this in the post speech,"
1783.1,1788.72, they literally didn't engage with any of the analysis. I think this is a major strategic flaw on their part second reason why
1788.72,1793.36, is because we think that you are inherently more representative no but they tell you they say that
1793.36,1798.08, unions are like a company has too many sectors a workplace union does not demonstrate like the
1798.08,1802.64, interest of specific types of employees first we think that this is untrue workplace unions tend
1802.64,1806.1, to be pretty tailored to specific types of employees.
1806.4,1816.92," But second, at their highest ground, people with different jobs in the same company probably have more similar issues than people that share the same job title technically,"
1817.3,1821.8," but work under completely different systems of leadership and authority issues, right?"
1821.8,1825.7," If racism and sexism is an issue between one specific company,"
1825.94,1827.86, it doesn't matter whether you're an analyst
1827.86,1829.04," or whether you're a coder,"
1829.22,1831.12, you are still going to face those issues.
1831.32,1832.64, I think that's a lot more likely
1832.64,1834.74, than like a coder on one end of the country
1834.74,1835.92, who works for one company
1835.92,1837.94, having the exact same issues as a coder
1837.94,1839.24, on the other end of the country.
1839.42,1840.94," The impact of this is quite clear, right?"
1841.04,1843.68," Workers now see their personal issues being spoken to,"
1843.88,1849.44, especially when it comes down to like demographic differences that are always going to exist when you're dealing with
1849.44,1854.34," things like geographical differences. The impact here is quite clear, right? People are willing to"
1854.34,1858.1, join. They are willing to do things like pay massive amounts of dues every year. They're
1858.1,1862.28," willing to go on strike and risk losing money. They need to know that they are going to be heard,"
1862.34,1869.0," that they are going to see a return in order to do that, because being in a union is always going to require a massive amount of sacrifice."
1869.0,1875.0," They never engage with this. In what world are people going to be willing to spend thousands of dollars in union dues, be willing to give up?"
1875.0,1883.0, They give up getting like they're getting their salary in order to protest for rights that they're not even sure they're represented in.
1883.0,1891.1," Before I go on to our second question, I'll take that up point if you have one. Surely don't you think that workers will still be"
1891.1,1895.88," more anxious to voice out their opinions on a smaller scale? Oh, I'm so sorry. I was maybe"
1895.88,1901.08, for that. Can you repeat that? Surely don't you think that people and workers will be more scared
1901.08,1905.2, to voice out their opinions on a smaller scale to their employer?
1910.64,1915.28," Right. We think that union workers are a lot less likely to voice their opinions when they don't actually have a specific target, right? Union workers currently know who they are working for."
1915.36,1919.06, It is very tangible. They have a lot of access to their employers. This doesn't happen with
1919.06,1923.26, industry-wide standards because they now suddenly have to fight people that they don't even work for.
1923.44,1925.08, They're a lot less incentivized to do that.
1925.18,1928.72, Second question on who gets access is the best policy and reform.
1928.98,1931.0," Number one, we just think that this is unlikely to happen"
1931.0,1932.64, because industry leverage is a lot harder.
1932.9,1936.12, We noted that it's very likely you're going to see like an industry-wide strike.
1936.26,1937.08, They never engaged with this.
1937.12,1939.62," But let's take them at their highest ground, say that they're able to mobilize."
1939.88,1941.74, Why is all of their policy going to be quite bad?
1942.02,1943.86, Because they are never going to be specific enough.
1944.1,1947.28, Note that they claim that this is all based on assumptions. This ignores all of the analysis
1947.28,1950.96, that then tells you what. We think that companies are always going to have different problems and to
1950.96,1955.36, different degrees. Amazon has a lot of prime day concerns over how people are treated when there
1955.36,1959.52," is a lot of work over those 48 hours, whereas people who work at Target tend to have concerns"
1959.52,1964.08, over like what is acceptable customer interactions. Just because they both work in the same area and
1964.08,1968.28," the same factories does not necessarily mean that they have the same problems. But second, let's take them"
1968.28,1972.08," at their highest ground, that unions are willing to pay attention to specific companies, meaning"
1972.08,1975.94, that this means specific problems. That means that that's a lot of specific issues you are dealing
1975.94,1979.9, with. It is inevitably going to receive a lot less attention and a lot less investment on their side
1979.9,1984.68, of the house because unions simply cannot afford to invest themselves fully in every single small
1984.68,1988.52, problem that all companies have. This doesn't happen in union problems because that's all
1988.52,1992.46," they're focused for. Second is that companies have different capabilities, right? What Starbucks can"
1992.46,1996.02," afford to do is different from what your local coffee chain can afford to do. On opposition,"
1996.02,1999.44," they have to go for the lowest common denominator because it's industry-wide,"
1999.64,2002.78," meaning that one, people don't get all the benefits they possibly could get,"
2002.96,2008.16," which means that the conditions are worse than they could be for workers on our side. But second, and a lot worse, is a lot of"
2008.16,2013.86, really specific issues get overlooked because they don't represent very broad ones. Industry-wide
2013.86,2019.44," problems can exist in workplaces. In that case, workplace unions can address them. But when there"
2019.44,2024.52," are workplace-specific issues, industry unions are unable to deal with. That's the comparative"
2024.52,2025.12, they have to engage
2025.12,2029.44, with third sub then on societal harms thesis here is it's really bad for the economy when entire
2029.44,2033.76, industries go on strike because even if conditions in some companies increase the entire industry as
2033.76,2037.68, a whole has to strike meaning that nationally they're going to be shut down for weeks this
2037.68,2041.52, happens to the most severe degree because oftentimes best policy is considered that you
2041.52,2048.88, can't like fire striking employees meaning that they're going to lose out on entire sectors of the economy all businesses are going to stop like producing and
2048.88,2053.52, distributing for weeks and months on end this is really bad because they are eventually not
2053.52,2057.6, even striking for a cause because some people have gotten what they already need this is light and
2057.6,2061.84, detrimental for the economy at large because it's ruining companies that employ thousands of people
2061.84,2068.48, all of this feeling anti-union sentiment as it takes an incredibly detrimental toll on the economy as a whole making it harder to get things done in the
2068.48,2077.44, future how to oppose and the speaker for defined remarks i now invite the government
2083.04,2089.72, i prefer my POIs audibly.
2089.72,2093.44, We never denied the benefits of workplace unions and we think that it is legitimate
2093.44,2094.44, for both to exist.
2094.44,2099.56," But ultimately, we think that due to industrial unions involving the government as a stakeholder,"
2099.56,2103.48, it makes it more likely for the rights of workers to actually be protected on our side
2103.48,2104.48, of the house.
2104.48,2110.08, We have told you very clearly in the first speaker that we see how like structural change is actually happening
2110.08,2114.88, by having like these industrial unions pressure the government in two ways either through like
2114.88,2120.48, strikes or online signatures or having like leaders of industrial unions directly negotiating
2120.48,2125.4, with the government to achieve an improvement in these standards in the industry.
2126.3,2131.64," So moving on to like the two main points of clash within this debate, we think it's firstly on the"
2131.64,2136.52," rights for the workers, who achieves better rights for the workers, and secondly on the efficiency"
2136.52,2142.82," of this mechanism. Moving on to the first point of clash on the rights for workers, our first"
2142.82,2145.12, speaker told you very clearly why the workplace
2145.12,2150.4, union is less likely to achieve better rights for workers due to biases or conflicts of object
2150.4,2156.64, objectives that may exist in the workplace whereas on the comparative with you industrial unions we're
2156.64,2161.04, able to fight for workers rights better as we think that the government is a stakeholder that
2161.04,2168.8, acts in a better interest compared to companies and that's like they would actually care about the interest of the workers more rather than the companies perhaps focusing
2168.8,2172.88, on like profit maximizing objectives and we think that's the political pressure put on the
2172.88,2178.56, government by industrial unions is more likely to lead to a response from the government so what
2178.56,2182.96, response that we received from opposition they told us two things firstly they think that it's
2182.96,2189.1, significantly worse on our side of the house for people to reflect their views as like they think that the industry is very broad.
2189.3,2193.72," And secondly, on how they think that it's less likely for minorities to have their voices heard."
2193.72,2197.78, Our response towards their first statement is that we don't think it's true. We tell you that
2197.78,2202.92, individuals are less likely to be seen as whistleblowers on our side of the house due to
2202.92,2209.6, the fact that there is like a small amount of people in the workplace in the workplace it is more likely for the workers to be targeted
2209.6,2215.28, by the managerial people within the company as there is a very direct and obvious conflict of
2215.28,2221.2, interest and whereas for like industrial what like for industry-wide standards to be achieved
2221.2,2229.24, usually only on our side of house usually only the leaders of the industrial unions need to act as a representative to negotiate for the rights of workers on their
2229.24,2234.2," behalf. And it's less likely for the people who, for people to actually need the confidence to"
2234.2,2239.4," negotiate face to face with their bosses, and for them to actually worry about maybe getting sacked"
2239.4,2245.7, from their job because of the fact that they're going against their bosses being involved in this workplace union.
2246.04,2248.18, And it's less likely for people to face discrimination
2248.18,2250.04," in the workplace on our side of the house,"
2250.18,2252.14, which is why we think that it's very untrue
2252.14,2256.16, that they say that people are able to reflect their views
2256.16,2257.28, more on their side of the house.
2257.68,2259.3, And with regards to their second statement
2259.3,2262.3," on how minorities are less likely to have their voices heard,"
2262.52,2273.0," we tell you that it is more likely for them to have their voices heard, as we have proven to you in analysis that it is likely for minorities to actually express their opinion in industrial unions, because a lot of times"
2273.0,2286.9," they're able to act like rather anonymously compared to like in their side of the house, and thus it's less likely for them to be discriminated against, as I've mentioned previously just now."
2287.64,2295.7, They then told us that they have better representation for workers on their side of the house as workers in different companies have different problems.
2295.7,2298.96, And they don't think we should use like this one size fit all policy.
2299.34,2305.4," Firstly, we don't think it's true that workers in different companies have different problems."
2305.76,2307.22," Sorry, is that a point?"
2308.16,2309.26," Yeah, I'll take it."
2309.7,2313.48," On our side of the house, we still have lobbying against governments that's symmetric."
2313.48,2317.36," But on your side of the house, you have to do strikes, sort of like tell the entire,"
2317.46,2321.18," like a lot of companies all at once, they must change their practices or you strike"
2321.18,2321.56, forever.
2321.76,2322.76, How is that sustainable?
2324.08,2325.84," No, we don't think we're only relying"
2325.84,2329.36, on strikes on our side of the house rather than that we think that on our side of the house we're
2329.36,2333.92, actually being able to put more political pressure on the government to actually enact some change
2333.92,2339.68, right even if like these strikes like even if we can't like continuously do the strikes we believe
2339.68,2344.48, that these strikes are actually more effective in achieving what we can achieve in terms of like
2344.48,2349.36, industrial standards whereas on your side of the house it's very unlikely for um that to actually occur
2349.36,2353.36, effectively as i've mentioned just now because of how people are actually scared of reflecting
2353.36,2357.68, their own views and we don't think that union that workplace union can achieve the same as what we
2357.68,2363.36, can achieve on our side uh back to our point of clash on why we don't think it's true that's like
2363.36,2370.38, workers in different companies usually have like different problems we think that ultimately workers and Industries are likely to
2370.38,2375.18, have similar problems such as like high needing for higher wages due to the fact that like the
2375.18,2380.52, industry like companies work side inside within the industry and like demand and supply of workers
2380.52,2389.32," working in this in this entire industry like with with like the wages, we think that it's likely that"
2389.32,2392.68, people will actually face the same problems in different companies.
2392.68,2397.86," And for example, it is likely for companies in the same industry to also be facing the"
2397.86,2401.8," same problems, for example, like safety standards, because we think that companies usually follow"
2401.8,2403.76, legislation outlined by the government.
2403.76,2408.32," And if these legislations are not updated, it's likely that the policies are not updated for these"
2408.32,2412.56, companies as well so we think that it's very likely that they face the same problems and even
2412.56,2417.6, if we assume that workers may have different problems we think that this only applies to the
2417.6,2422.64, minority of cases which in the in that case we think that they can turn to these workplace unions
2422.64,2431.0, for help but for the majority of problems we think that it is likely for the industrial unions to actually be able to achieve better rights for everyone.
2431.0,2449.02," And we think that it's very unlikely we have to dilute the wants of workers on our side of the house, as we think that industrial unions have more centralized power, and the actions of the union can impact the running of the whole industry as a whole. Thus, we think that in order to achieve a goal, it's more likely for industrial unions to stand firm"
2449.02,2453.0," on their ground to fight for what they want, as they have more support from workers and they do"
2453.0,2458.32, not have to fear backlash from individual companies if the problem is legitimate. Due to the fact that
2458.32,2463.84," the work of these industrial unions are actually public or publicized, we think that it is more"
2463.84,2466.2, likely for these issues to gain public
2466.2,2470.7, support to actually pressurize companies or pressurize the government to change industry
2470.7,2474.74," standards, whereas on their side of the house, it's more likely that they will actually have"
2474.74,2481.78, to dilute the wants of workers as companies are less likely to actually negotiate fully with
2481.78,2488.66," workers due to clashing objectives they have. For example, profit maximizing, which we have already outlined clearly in our first speaker, and the fact that"
2488.66,2494.16," managers of these companies ultimately have more power over these workers, and thus on their side"
2494.16,2498.66," of the house, they achieve less for the rights of workers. And we think that we win this clash"
2498.66,2502.8," because firstly, we prove to you why it's unlikely for workers' rights to be achieved on their side."
2502.98,2505.02," And basically, we think that this is the most important clash"
2505.02,2507.24, because we think that the workers are the main stakeholders
2507.24,2509.06," within this debate, and we do the best for them."
2509.48,2512.34," Moving on to the next clash on the efficiency of the workplace,"
2512.6,2514.76, our second speaker then told you very clearly
2514.76,2516.94, why change occurring on our side is more sustainable
2516.94,2519.6, and why industrial unions can increase the efficiency
2519.6,2521.24, of the workforce in a few ways.
2521.5,2523.6," And opposition, how they responded was that they said"
2523.6,2525.34, that coordination or
2525.34,2531.22, like organization it's easier on easier on on their side and it's less likely that we can do
2531.22,2536.32, things on our side but we firstly uh regarding our response we don't think you need to communicate
2536.32,2542.26, everything in the same place we think it can occur online we don't think um like negative sentiment
2542.26,2545.1, throughout the industry need to occur in the same place and needs to be
2545.1,2550.12," as coordinated as they think they need to be. And secondly, we think the industrial unions tend to"
2550.12,2554.76," have a better structure within as they're set up for a longer period of time, whereas it's usually"
2554.76,2558.72, the structure within these workplace unions are messier because they're less people and it's less
2558.72,2566.0, likely that people are actually that engaged in setting up a very good structure for these workplace unions.
2566.0,2576.0, And then they tell us about like how they have better effectiveness of unions because they think that people are reluctant to join unions on our side of the house due to time and union stigma.
2576.0,2581.0," We think that it's the same on their side of the house, and we think that it's the same that they need to use time to join unions."
2581.0,2588.48," And they on their side of the house, they even face more stigma, as i mentioned previously on how they it's likely for people to get discriminated therefore we're very"
2588.48,2614.76," proud to propose speaker for the final marks and i invite the third speaker from side opposition All right. I prefer verbal PYs, please."
2617.82,2622.24, The biggest fear of a worker when it comes to deciding if they should join a union or not
2622.24,2625.28, is not when they get to the union if they will speak up
2625.28,2628.8, because they fear they might be discriminated against or they might not be able to remain
2628.8,2634.32, anonymous it is if they should join the union in the first place they already feel retaliation is
2634.32,2639.76, a massive waste use of their time they have money that is spent in this they worry if it will ever
2639.76,2646.12," create any tangible impact for them to these people people, proposition says, well, we're going to lobby the"
2646.12,2651.14, government and hope that your rights as a worker are enough of a priority for the government to
2651.14,2656.38, outweigh economic or political concerns and hope that that is a way for you to get change.
2656.62,2661.32," We say this is not only never likely to happen, it is also far worse than the alternative,"
2661.68,2668.08," proud to oppose. In the speech, I'm going to give two points of tension proposition down proposition's bench, then debate the rest of the debate in three"
2668.08,2672.88," clashes. Two points of tension. First, I think there was a massive stance change in the last"
2672.88,2677.02," speech of the proposition where they say, no, our side of the house is lobbying directly against"
2677.02,2681.54," governments, whereas opposition is against companies. Here's the idea. First of all,"
2681.6,2684.8," we don't think this is the scenario in the first place, right? We think both sides of the house"
2684.8,2685.96, are addressing companies or largely as a whole think both sides of the house are addressing companies
2685.96,2687.24, or largely as a whole.
2687.24,2689.78, Our side of the house addresses specific companies directly.
2689.78,2692.76, Their side of the house addresses the group as a collective.
2692.76,2694.6, But if it is true that their side of the house
2694.6,2697.12," is truly like effectively a special interest group,"
2697.12,2698.62, where these groups like lobby the government
2698.62,2700.82, and they do it all collectively with the house scenario.
2700.82,2702.4, This is the worst case scenario
2702.4,2704.16, because it is so much less likely
2704.16,2730.1," that a government who is balancing every economic incentive of like, and every interest that a voter has Sarah alone the fact that every worker is not the same and they have different incentives down the line. Their best case scenario is when the government creates minor change in the least common,"
2730.32,2735.1, or in the issue that is the least common denominator among every worker. We say that
2735.1,2739.62," it's not only what workers want the least, it's probably way unlikely to happen. Secondly,"
2739.9,2743.38, a proposition repeats down the bench that they can have both on their side of the house. Here's
2743.38,2748.14," the problem. In a prefers debate, this is about inciters in which workers and people are choosing"
2748.14,2753.2," between the two, which they prefers we choose. We say we would rather have less industry-wide"
2753.2,2757.84, unions in favor of more specific unions because that addresses people's specific lives better.
2758.14,2762.28," With that, three clashes in the round. The first clash is on the broad strength of unions."
2762.62,2786.36," I want to note this is the single most important impact of the round. This is because unions are reliant on worker participation. If we prove we get less people, less people on proposition side of the house that are interested in joining a union, regardless of what kind of union it is, we win the round, because we have more unions on our side of the house, regardless of what form they take. Notably, this was framing we gave you from the one it never got engaged with."
2786.36,2787.24, What did we say?
2787.24,2790.44, We said workers are extremely skeptical of joining unions
2790.44,2792.24," because of the time, financial costs,"
2792.24,2794.96, and just general fear that they will be retaliated against
2794.96,2796.38," for making that choice, right?"
2796.38,2798.48," In the status quo, the biggest stigma"
2798.48,2800.28, against unions right now is the idea
2800.28,2802.1," that they're bureaucratic and undemocratic,"
2802.1,2804.2, and that workers are effectively wasting their money
2804.2,2809.44, for a response they will never get in return. we say the status quo stigma is only perpetuated in
2809.44,2814.16, proposition side of the house when they say we wait and we hope that we participate in a really
2814.16,2818.96, really large union and hope that eventually the issue that is most important for us actually comes
2818.96,2824.48, to the table becomes the central issue for the union we say this is unlikely but even if it's
2824.48,2825.28," likely to happen,"
2825.54,2830.22," we say no worker believes the like, believes like is an agreement about what is the single"
2830.22,2835.28," most important issue. So we say we give each union worker exactly what they want, whereas their side"
2835.28,2839.54, of the house like relies on the idea of all of them sort of believing the same way and having
2839.54,2843.62, the same rights on this down the bench. The second thing we said is our third substantive argument
2843.62,2845.12," that got no engagement,"
2845.12,2849.28, right? We said there's massive public backlash to industry-wide strikes because they affect
2849.28,2854.64, the economy far more directly and far more widely than a company-wide strike. No economy is reliant
2854.64,2859.68," on one company, maybe outside of Amazon, but I even think that is kind of unlikely. Whereas if"
2859.68,2865.0," industry-wide strikes occur, I think entire economies are least effective in the short term."
2865.0,2872.0," For example, if all of Japan's automation workers strike, I think that would be a really, really massive problem for every citizen there."
2872.0,2876.0," Whereas if Toyota strikes, I don't think they would care nearly as much."
2876.0,2890.3," Why does this matter? One, obviously there's an economic impact that affects people that had no real impact on the reason why problems exist in the first place. But second, it drains long-term buy-in and the bargaining power of unions. If the public is against unions,"
2890.4,2894.52," they feel like they're disruptive to society and make it harder for them to feed their families,"
2894.66,2899.2, right? All of this is a reason why unions have less political capital to do all the government
2899.2,2904.5, buying the proposition once and also get all the members that are necessary to achieve any union
2904.5,2905.4, action at all.
2905.76,2910.9," Third, even if participation isn't lower on their side of the house, it is still that like energy to"
2910.9,2914.86," participate in actual things like strikes or collective bargaining is, right? So even if they"
2914.86,2918.76," still get people, they're still paying the dues and like technically call themselves a member of"
2918.76,2923.76," the union, they're less likely to strike, which means the actual like leverage behind any action"
2923.76,2925.28, that a union does ultimately
2925.28,2930.4, goes away what is the impact of this is that workers lose their biggest advocate in the status
2930.4,2935.04, quo exploitation is on the rise and jobs are ultimately more dangerous and more exploited
2935.04,2939.76, than they were before we need unions more than ever we need to combat the idea they're undemocratic
2939.76,2944.32, so workers feel they're why places for them to put their time and money into on their side of the
2944.32,2949.34, house we both agree unions are important only our side sustains the impact of unions long
2949.34,2954.46," term. Before I move on, I'll take your point. How are companies incentivized to actually"
2954.46,2959.3," negotiate with workers if they face no pressure at all on your side of the house? Effectively,"
2959.4,2964.3," a union has one big leverage, is that if people work for the company and can decide not to work"
2964.3,2965.68, for the company at any time.
2965.68,2966.74, That is a strike.
2966.74,2967.78," On their side of the house,"
2967.78,2970.18, they do not approve what alternative form of bargaining
2970.18,2972.34," or like leverage a union has, right?"
2972.34,2974.26, Their side of the house has to employ
2974.26,2977.56, really large wide scale industry-wide strikes.
2977.56,2979.56," On our side, we say company-wide strikes"
2979.56,2981.8, are more likely to occur and are more effective
2981.8,2983.98, because those are actually the workers
2983.98,2989.3, that are affecting in the first place. Second clashashes on representation. We gave you three arguments. I think only
2989.3,2992.4," one of them was really redressed, which is the idea of like, there are not really that"
2992.4,2998.82," many issues that every specific union or company faces differently. We say, fine. Even if this"
2998.82,3003.3," is true, there are still varying degrees to which each worker experiences these issues."
3003.3,3009.28," So every worker might be generally concerned with things like safety and also their pay, some might be way more concerned"
3009.28,3012.98, with their safety compared to pay in the first place because they feel like that is a far more
3012.98,3017.86," tangible threat to their lives. On their side of the house, they ask workers to pull their resources"
3017.86,3023.56," and then say, pick one of the two to fight for at a mass level. We say this is unfair and likely"
3023.56,3025.44, just not responsive to a worker's need
3025.44,3030.12, on an individual level. So we get better prioritization that affects workers on an
3030.12,3035.06," individual level. Secondly, though, the unity the workers feel is far more likely to continue on our"
3035.06,3039.16, side of the house. Workers are just more similar to each other when they're fighting against the
3039.16,3044.68," same company. Decisions against collective action will be more representative of a much, much larger"
3044.68,3045.74, group on our side of the house.
3046.0,3053.7," Why does this matter? Importantly, I think the way that they never addressed was that industry-wide problems are also company-wide problems."
3053.7,3058.76," We address industry-wide problems, maybe not the same order, but they ultimately get addressed."
3059.14,3064.06," But company-wide problems are not likely to be industry-wide problems, at least not all the time."
3064.28,3070.06," We address both. They only address one. They never engage with that. Lastly, on effectiveness, we just think"
3070.06,3074.88, they're less likely to strike and sustain a strike in Proposition's world. It is harder to mobilize
3074.88,3080.02, and get enough group support to do this. A worker has to feel that the issue affects them.
3080.26,3084.76," Their company is particularly egregious on that issue, and they have to have faith in the long-term"
3084.76,3088.94, effectiveness of a strike to participate in it and to participate in it in a long-term manner.
3089.22,3090.36, We do not think this is likely.
3090.72,3095.82," Second of all, we said recruitment and messaging get way worse on their side of the house because the issues are broad."
3095.92,3097.14, They're the least common denominator.
3097.46,3102.24," On our side of the house, it's the issue that matters to a person the most, which is most likely to get them to join."
3102.48,3109.92, It's most likely to get them to be a participatory and active member we say a union is only as strong as its members we motivate its members to stay
3109.92,3112.96, and motivate them to be active very proud to stand in the opposition
3118.16,3138.74, speaker for the final marks and i invite the opposition to play opposition reply.
3139.48,3139.68, All right.
3140.68,3142.4, Am I still audible?
3143.02,3150.66," Yes, you are. This round has boiled down to two things, effectiveness and"
3150.66,3156.02, representation. Let's first talk about effectiveness. I'm going to assume the highest ground for side
3156.02,3161.78, proposition that all companies have the same interests and the same problems. Why do we still
3161.78,3170.0," win this debate? We give you two warrants down the line that weren't properly engaged with by side proposition. Number one, you got more membership recruitment on our"
3170.0,3174.72, side of the house. It was easier to recruit people at a local level rather than at an industry-wide
3174.72,3179.24," level because people had connections and trust with the recruiters in the workplace, and B,"
3179.3,3183.76, because there's more specific messaging in the workplace. So it was more persuasive to join a
3183.76,3188.96," union that was at your workplace that talked about your issues rather than an industry-wide union. Secondly,"
3189.16,3194.62," it was far easier to organize a union at a local level. In a smaller workplace, it's easier to"
3194.62,3198.46, communicate with people and it's easier to unify them because there's a smaller number of people
3198.46,3202.56, and they tend to have common issues. They tend to be the same people that you see at lunch every
3202.56,3208.76," single day, the same people that you work next to. So rallying around people was significantly easier in a smaller confine of"
3208.76,3213.76, a single workplace than a broad-based industry. The problem on their side of the house is that
3213.76,3219.22, they needed buy-in from every single worker to get massive levels of change. And we told you down the
3219.22,3224.04, bench that things like fracturing and competing interests was likely to happen. So the sustained
3224.04,3229.8," changes that they said would happen on their side of the house was very unlikely. So in the short term,"
3229.8,3233.9," what happens on their side of the house? Either number one, they don't get changed because they're"
3233.9,3238.96," not able to galvanize people to a significant extent. But second of all, even if they do get"
3238.96,3244.34," changed, there's a race to the bottom effect where people shoot for the lowest baseline in order to"
3244.34,3249.5, get broad based support from everyone. What was the new counterfactual that they gave on their side of
3249.5,3253.64," the house that I think actually hurts them? They say that, well, they're no longer negotiating"
3253.64,3257.62, with companies. They're negotiating with the government. Cam told you that the government
3257.62,3262.98, is even worse than individual companies because the government has so many legislative priorities.
3263.24,3265.28, The government has so many different people that are lobbying them.
3265.38,3268.0," There's gridlock, there's partisanship as well."
3268.2,3270.38," Not just that, I want you to think about this"
3270.38,3271.36, on a level of scale.
3271.68,3274.12, The government has to answer to every single citizen
3274.12,3276.02, in a country to get reelected.
3276.26,3279.44," On the other hand, if workers don't work for a company,"
3279.68,3280.88, the company goes under.
3281.14,3283.06," That means on a workplace level,"
3283.36,3286.24, workers have more leverage than if they're trying
3286.24,3291.46, to go and like organize on a political level so if their counterfactual was about government they
3291.46,3295.3, basically knife themselves because that was significantly less likely to lead to change
3295.3,3300.46, so what was the long-term impact of this the long-term impact is you saw massive decreases
3300.46,3308.78, in Union membership because what we told you down the off bench is that the cost to union membership were high that there was time there was money there was stigma around unions
3308.78,3314.14, so people would only join unions if there were immediate returns so insofar as on their side
3314.14,3319.0, of the house it takes years to lobby governments or years to convince the ceo of every company in
3319.0,3324.32, industry to get gain reforms people would simply leave the union because they realize that the
3324.32,3325.44, costs completely
3325.44,3330.48," outweigh the benefits. So even if on our side of the house, we don't get broad-based industry level"
3330.48,3335.04," change, we still meet the needs of people, which ensures that unions stay along for the long term."
3335.36,3338.82, Second thing I want to talk about is about representation. We told you that companies
3338.82,3343.42," would inevitably face different issues. As Cam and Hannah told you, there's differences in"
3343.42,3348.38," leadership strategies, there's differences in the size and profits of companies, and the demographics of companies."
3348.66,3353.94," So even if they face similar issues, the severity of those issues is still different. Why was that"
3353.94,3358.08," important? As Cam told you, the industry-wide problems that they talk about would be solved"
3358.08,3362.54," in either world. If everyone agreed that an issue was a problem, they could always lobby their union"
3362.54,3369.84, or strike to create change at the company-wide. The problem is the company specific issues never get resolved on their side of the
3369.84,3374.84," house. The harassment issues, the diversity issues that are specific to a company never get the"
3374.84,3379.2, broad-based support across the industry to actually get solved. So their benefits were
3379.2,3384.06," completely symmetrical, but the costs were unique to their side of the house because they weren't"
3384.06,3388.96, able to solve the specific issues that occurred. we think that we should prioritize the harms that most
3388.96,3393.9, disproportionately affect workers that's why representation was so important at the end of
3393.9,3399.2, the day our side was the clear winner we not only ensured effective change and unity but we also
3399.2,3403.54, ensured representation for every single worker that's the point of a union proud to oppose
3403.54,3405.82, thank you speaker for the final remarks and i invite the governor to conclude this debate presentation for every single worker that's the point of a union proud to oppose
3441.0,3443.52, thank you speaker for the final remarks and I invite the metrics of judging this debate? There are two questions that we should look at.
3443.52,3450.96," First, what are the issues issues what issues are more important industrial issues or workplace specific issues and second question"
3450.96,3456.56, who is more likely to get to get the change onto the first question of what issues are more
3456.56,3462.0, important today's side proposition keeps stressing that when you join a workplace union you can't
3462.0,3465.12, join an industrial union but But we have repeatedly told
3465.12,3469.66, you that it is not true. We believe that if you have a choice between joining an industrial union
3469.66,3473.9," or workplace union, we'll just prioritize industrial union because it makes bigger change,"
3474.1,3478.44, equal change for all workers in the industry. And we believe that this change is the common
3478.44,3483.62," most urgent issue for all workers in the industry. So therefore, it is much more important for the"
3483.62,3486.46, workers to join the industrial union.
3486.46,3489.0," As for workplace union for specific changes,"
3489.0,3490.14," small specific changes,"
3490.14,3493.44," we believe that if they feel as necessary,"
3493.44,3496.14, then they could like make another workplace union.
3496.14,3498.54, We don't think there's any conflict of interest
3498.54,3499.82," in between this,"
3499.82,3502.06, but just that we believe that all workers
3502.06,3504.34, should prioritize joining industrial union
3504.34,3505.76," because of the scale of the change that we have, all workers should prioritize joining industrial union because of the scale of"
3505.76,3512.48, the change that we have as uh we have repeatedly um mentioned throughout our case and interestingly
3512.48,3518.32, side prop side uh proposition have never denied the import a tight opposition have never denied
3518.32,3522.88, the importance of industrial change so to make things easier they said that industrial change
3522.88,3530.0," can be done on a workforce level and they say ah, even it will be even more efficient because there's less red tape or"
3530.0,3536.08," less bureaucracy. But we've repeatedly told you that, we have repeatedly told you that this is"
3536.08,3541.28," not true, right? We tell that the problem exists first and this is common for all workers because"
3541.28,3545.2," more or less they have, they are facing the same thing and they would more or"
3545.2,3550.8, less they want to increase wage to reduce working hours to have more welfare but then in my speech
3550.8,3555.92, i've provided you four reasons why it is more efficient in the industrials in an industrial
3555.92,3563.12, union to get to get to get the change because first it's a less repetitive work done by uh by
3563.12,3566.96, the by the workers and secondly there's more intelligence
3566.96,3572.4, on how the change can be best made and thirdly on why is this more powerful with greater people and
3572.4,3577.36, how it could exert pressure on the government and fourthly how it could have a long-term
3577.36,3587.76, sustainability having this new standards within the industry and how it would raise the and raise the
3588.64,3593.76, a barrier of entry within the industry we had no response from that and then they continue to say
3593.76,3599.12, that if the workers are coordinating and they continue to say that the workers are actually
3599.12,3605.0," coordinating then they are afraid that the people, okay, sorry."
3606.02,3607.48, So therefore we have proven to you
3607.48,3610.48, that this is more important for industrial change to be made.
3610.48,3612.22," And we tell that industrial change,"
3612.22,3614.14," in order for industrial change to be made,"
3614.14,3617.44, it's better for industrial unions to do that.
3617.44,3618.68," And then on the second question,"
3618.68,3620.1, who's more likely to get changed?
3620.1,3622.84, So I like to address your misconstruement of our case.
3622.84,3625.12, We said that our stance has not changed from the beginning.
3625.16,3627.64, I've told you from the beginning that the government is a better actor
3627.68,3630.96, for initiating change because the government has the obligation
3630.96,3633.2, to protect the rights of their workers.
3633.2,3636.56," And we tell that versus companies which were profit driven,"
3636.64,3639.24, it is more likely for the government to have better motivation
3639.36,3641.6, to create meaningful change within the workforce.
3641.72,3644.92," Interestingly, that also means that we'll get better collective actions"
3646.0,3652.0," and put pressure to the government. But then they start to worry that this scale of destruction is bad to the economy and because that the workers don't want to be seen as destructive,"
3652.0,3660.0," they wouldn't want to join. However, we see this as ridiculous because putting pressure on the government is a good thing because they're finally the workers are able to express"
3660.0,3666.8," their dissatisfaction and then which is the dissatisfaction, which is the whole purpose of the union."
3667.76,3671.6," And they can finally make changes. On the other hand, what I've told you from the first point of"
3671.6,3676.88," the first speech, that there's ultimate conflict between and dependence between the workers and"
3676.88,3681.52," their bosses. So therefore, the workers will feel pressured to make comments. So we get no reply"
3681.52,3685.76, from that other than the shallow one-liner that they could
3685.76,3692.22," always strike. So therefore, even presuming the best case from side proposition, we see"
3692.22,3698.5, that the workers will be better on our side. Thank you.
3698.5,3706.0," Thank you, speaker, for the fine remarks. I thank all speakers. What an excellent debate."
3706.0,3711.64, I'll now request the speakers to remain in this breakout room. I request the judges to
3711.64,3717.5, join. Give me a second. Prop prep one. We'll deliberate over there.
