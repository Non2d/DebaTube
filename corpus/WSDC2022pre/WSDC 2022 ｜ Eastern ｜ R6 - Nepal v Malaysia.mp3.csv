0.0,11.44," I would like my POIs to be strictly in the chat. Just give me a few seconds. Also, I am audible and visible, right?"
13.06,30.32, Yeah. So if you have any kind of gender pronoun preferences and you want two one in the late 40s 1984 was released
30.32,35.36, 30 years down the line people were desensitized to a point that there wasn't sufficient hope to
35.36,40.64, say that a better government than the thatcher government could exist a bit of characterization
40.64,50.58, the knowledge of my arguments first political fiction describes a vision of the world and how it is governed. It gives a what is the direct message here is that it gives what the
50.58,55.26, nature of law is and the nature in which these laws are going to be reinforced. There's also
55.26,61.1," usually some subtext as to what's going on right now in the world. When the 1984 was released,"
61.26,65.88, it was released in anticipation of the tyrannical direction Western democracies
65.88,71.02," were leading to. What does optimism look like? It looks like protagonists being the winner,"
71.38,76.48, moral victory being with the protagonist and justice prevailing. We think that pop culture
76.48,81.9, has a major influence in terms of outcome and understanding our place in the world. To win
81.9,85.84," this debate, we need to show that positive politic political fiction"
85.84,92.16, is better in terms of the consumption the positive political fiction doesn't mean that your movie is
92.16,98.32, entirely cherry on the top but it means that your usual arc of world building resolution
98.32,103.68, is still existing but you still see like stuff like uh sexual violence and stuff like that it
103.68,105.36, just means that the conclusion of the
105.36,112.24, movie is positive or it's hopeful realize that there is like enough anger and pessimism in this
112.24,118.0, status quo to drive you to a social movement it's the lived reality of the people stories of friends
118.0,123.52, and all of this means that movies do not really make a significant impact in terms of anger and
124.08,126.24, pessimism two Two arguments then.
126.24,131.04, Firstly on why the influence of positive political fiction is better in terms of outcomes for
131.04,136.64, consumers and secondly on why the narrative set for entire community of the people is likely to
136.64,142.56, be better on our side of the house. A. First argument. Generally you make a movie in the
142.56,145.52, anticipation of result. the message on either
145.52,151.36, side is to drive people towards success this is only created when there is positive message
151.36,157.68, revolving around the movie it influences the transitional transitional justice but b we create
157.68,162.8, an environment of optimism and we think that's really better the premise here is that optimism
162.8,167.4, is something that's good in terms of people who are fighting for change in the status quo.
167.4,173.28, The mechanism here is that you always see yourself as the protagonist when you're the consumer of their media.
173.76,177.66, Protagonists are the real people which you reflect yourself to.
177.9,185.92," That's how movie and stories are written, because you want to show some form of relatability between the consumers and the protagonists and the"
185.92,192.24," characters of the movie. When the protagonist of that movie or political fiction achieves success,"
192.24,197.84, you feel as though it's a victory for yourself when you consume the media. It motivates you in
197.84,206.32, terms of saying that there is a better outcome and a real hope. This hope is accessible in terms of relative characters being able to get
206.32,212.08, this success being able to get this win the comparison here is that they lose the sense of
212.08,217.36, hope and trust in the justice system in their side of the house why is this important then
218.08,226.08, a the current in the current political climate when you are an activist you're likely to face activism burnout this means that
226.08,232.08, people who are stopping to get leisure time on social movement because you're burnt out people
232.08,238.72, are generally less involved in social movement because of the pessimistic narrative that exists
238.72,246.86, around social movement and how the success from social movement cannot be derived. This pessimistic narrative exists too much
246.86,248.26, in the status quo.
248.26,250.56, That's why you're likely as an activist
250.56,252.6, to face that activism burnout.
252.6,255.56," But secondly, the media's portrays,"
255.56,259.38, since it sensationalizes people who lose hope.
259.38,261.2, This looks like media portraying the death
261.2,266.16, of an environmentalist in a social movement.
266.16,273.52, This also looks like media portraying the loss of the... media portraying the failure of a movement
273.52,278.0, or media portraying the problems within the movement in the status quo.
278.0,282.48," But then see, the current narrative in the society is that everything is nihilistic"
282.48,285.28, because there's also a large movement in younger
285.28,290.88, generation that they glamorize things like nihilism and complain but don't go out and actively
290.88,296.16, involved in movements because they don't have hope they feel like they can't make a change and these
296.16,301.84, people these nihilistic younger generation people when they read these sort of political fiction
301.84,306.4, they're more more likely to get pessimistic after reading that content why
306.4,312.16, do we change this in our side of the house a in our side you get the euphoria of hope which means
312.16,317.76, that you're willing to act in the movement you're willing to commit to rallies in the heat of
317.76,323.36, optimism that you get after reading that political fiction or after watching that political fiction
323.36,335.0," but then b there's a general dilution of the nih of the nihilist people or the nihilism in general, because these political fiction shows that there's a solvency of the issues."
335.0,346.88," There's a greater success in the social media, social movement. And all of this means that the nihilism that these younger generation have is greatly reduced but then see"
346.88,353.04, you have a sense of escapism when you're burnt out you see these books you see these movies and you
353.04,359.92, know that oh there are some like there are some instances where justice is prevailing that justice
359.92,365.28, can prevail you get more hope and even if you read this like you have to read this like when
365.28,371.68, your psyche of not having a solvency gets reinstated even more that that happens in
371.68,377.44, their side of the house where all these consume and all they see are pessimistic content but
378.0,385.1, and but um d we solve this because there's a definite sense of achievement with protagonists getting more
385.1,391.38, success in our side of the house. Why this hope and the general psyche of the people
391.38,396.86, being motivated even better and important in our side of the house? Because you get
396.86,401.32, more motivation to continue your effort even though your efforts are futile because this
401.32,405.52, fiction gives you more hope that justice is reliable it validates
405.52,411.52, your effort in so far as you achieve a success and even if the system is unjust they're still
411.52,417.04, like going to continue their fight for their right in the hopes of getting some form of
417.04,430.96, success in the hopes of changing their lives I think of UI activism often takes generations if hope is tied to tangible outcomes time and time again
430.96,436.56, after failure why is hope likely going to prevail in all instances because like when you're
436.56,442.96, surrounded only by pessimistic narratives you're less likely to even um go into activism you're
442.96,466.16, less likely to um fight for the justice or you're less likely to fight for your own that movement but secondly the narrative set for
466.16,471.44, entire communities of people is likely to be on better in our society house because unlike the
471.44,476.48, first argument the broad implication of movies having political implication is that they affect
476.48,482.32, entire community of the people this looks like that panther being influential and gongu by
482.32,488.76, influencing the feminist movement if we can show that positive political fiction on net betters the binding
488.96,493.36," of the community, then we're still better off than side opposition."
493.56,497.4," A, notice that the side of common enemy is not lost in either side."
497.6,501.56," Even in our side, the media still portrays the struggle against system."
501.76,504.36, It still portrays the struggle against the villains.
504.56,505.44, We're also likely
505.44,510.32, to have more emotionally charged narratives that in terms of these antagonists this looks like
510.32,516.16, man being out to get you the big brother setting a tyrannical government the only
516.16,554.72," difference is who wins this we are likely to win this very proud to propose of course Okay, if all judges are ready, we'll be moving on."
562.2,563.38," Hi, can I be heard?"
564.52,567.5," Yeah, thank you so much. Just a moment. Thank you so much."
570.2,581.1," Mai, ready to move on? Thank you so much. Okay, we thank a verifying speech by Prime Minister. Now let's moving on to leader of opposition to open up opposition's case. Hear, hear."
582.02,582.32, All right.
582.72,584.94, POI preferences. Thank you so much.
586.6,592.3," Yeah, I use sheer pronouns and I'll take my POIs verbally please thank you okay starting my speech in three"
592.3,599.32, two one the state is society's singularly most powerful actor in having apparatuses with the
599.32,605.38, capacity to shape entire populations on opposition we believe it is impossible to be too careful when we hold the
605.38,610.04," liberty of millions in our hands, and it's only on opposition do we represent what the state could"
610.04,615.84," become. Our stance is two things. One, we prefer the majority of negative and pessimistic representations,"
616.18,620.96," which looks like two main things. A, the context is usually very overwhelming odds of usually"
620.96,625.16, dystopian governments and an overreach of state power and B these main
625.16,629.48, characters usually fail in their endeavor to overcome the political obstacles or they are back
629.48,634.82, to square one secondly a positive representation means there's an overwhelmingly good governmental
634.82,639.62, system and proposition then cannot support presentations of predominantly bad political
639.62,644.18, actions i.e as first proposition asserts that there will be representation of sexual violence
644.18,648.96, or other harmful actions because the overall message will definitely still be the positivity.
649.48,669.12," If it is so visceral on proposition, so viscerally abusive, then people will still remember only the most horrible actions, and they won't be able to take a message of hope out of that film. crucially misses a huge part of what political fiction actually looks like because part of political fiction i.e west wing which existed in the info slide humanizes governments as ones"
669.12,673.12, they are trying their best and when they fail it's not because they're malevolent or they're
673.12,676.48, oppressive but it's just because they cannot do their best and we think that is inherently
676.48,680.92, oppressive and harmful to the most vulnerable but before i talk about two arguments from opposition
680.92,688.66," let's deal with the case from proposition in three three ways. Number one, on their mechanism. They try to say in their mechanism that there's enough anger and status"
688.66,693.3," quo so films and media don't make that big of an impact. Three things to say here. Number one,"
693.36,696.92, this is a contradiction because their first argument tells you that the films are going to
696.92,701.98, be so influential that activist burnout is going to happen on a mass scale and they are going to
701.98,708.76, give up on their literal livelihoods. I think we have to characterize what activists are because activists fight for their lives. Proposition is telling us
708.76,713.46, that movies are so uninfluential and yet somehow so powerful that activists choose to give up on
713.46,717.38, their livelihoods just because they watch a movie. We think that's a contradiction that cannot stand.
717.62,721.06," But secondly, when they tell you in your first argument that you relate to the protagonist,"
721.24,728.96, that is exactly why they are influential and why you will be able to take crucial messaging from it. Why is this contradiction crucial? Because we think that is
728.96,734.12," the concession that these films innately encourage anger, and we think that anger and that urgency"
734.12,738.38, exclusively exists under our staff to help. We're going to prove in arguments why this is important
738.38,742.8," when it comes to holding the state accountable. On their first argument then, about how this creates"
742.8,748.1," better outcomes for consumers. That's what they tell you, but I think they don't actually benefit society as a whole. They're only"
748.1,751.98," talking about very specific social movements that don't actually, like they don't even prove the"
751.98,756.8, outcomes in those instances. The only impact they give to you under this argument is activists burn
756.8,761.16," out, people then lose sense of hope and trust in the justice system. Three things to say here."
761.38,768.7," Number one, I think we need to criticize the framework of justice to begin with, and it is not enough to believe in the justice system and think that everything will end up well."
768.94,775.32," The problem with status quo is that it is imperfect, and that it's on the trend towards negativity, and we need to represent that in political fiction."
775.64,789.5," But secondly, I think the loss of hope in these films is directly like these films are set in the future right so crucially political fiction doesn't display the hopelessness of the present they display a hopelessness of the future"
789.5,795.44, where society has like degraded so terribly that there is no more way out opposition crucially
795.44,799.54, says that we are at a turning point and this is where you must act now that is the importance of
799.54,803.92, political fiction incentivizing people to be hopeful for today but thirdly i think hope is
803.92,809.6," not the underpinning of social movements it It's about survival, which means that is their foremost incentive. But also,"
809.66,814.02, we think hope is very fragile. Hope is contingent on positive outcomes to continually refresh that
814.02,818.78," hope, because hope cannot last forever. Insofar as proposition concedes that social movements and"
818.78,822.96," social change takes a very long time, their hope is unsustainable, and they don't actually benefit"
822.96,829.68," individuals. Before I go on to my arguments, i will gladly take that point on both sides there are enough sources of anger"
829.68,834.72, such as news media and things as such on our side we have some balance in terms of bringing about
834.72,839.36, hope on your side that is lost why is this not a good thing on our side right i think it's also
839.36,843.36, unclear why hope is not mutually exclusive like there is things like past precedence or like
843.36,848.0, future like or like thoughts about the future that still make you hopeful but that actually takes me nicely into
848.0,852.96, my first argument about uniquely political fiction empowers all of these skepticisms the first
852.96,856.8, argument then about how we empower the skepticism of the state that is crucial to a healthy
856.8,860.56, government three parts number one i think pessimistic political fiction is the most
860.56,871.0," effective political caricature which hyperbolize the obvious deepest evil of our governmental structures, illustrating the possibility of corrupting the very morality of the structures of our state."
871.0,877.0," This is crucial to impacting negativity, because this opens up a worldview of the ugliest possibilities of humanity."
877.0,889.58," Why is this unique? Two things, because the unique nature of political fiction, absent of all other political advocacy, is that it's not only apolitical, so it is not bipartisan, but also because it's especially crucial for the most disengaged political actors"
889.58,894.14," who usually take for granted their human rights, that the state is going to always respect my"
894.14,899.22, humanity. And this is crucial because we break the bubble of privilege by depicting a relatable
899.22,903.82," protagonist compared with visceral outcomes, and we show you that your life isn't always going to"
903.82,909.04," be perfect, and this is why you must take action now status quo we have voter tampering in literal western"
909.04,913.68, liberal democracies where people engaging with messing up the supreme court in poland for example
913.68,918.72, there is very little and despite all of these harmful status quo action there's very little
918.72,923.68, actor to there's very little action made to strengthen democratic structures clearly even
923.68,929.18, though you can see the action there's a disconnect but you don't see what could possibly happen given that this is only the
929.18,934.1, first step in many of state oppression political fiction world views the process to devolving into
934.1,940.16, a system of pessimism i.e 1984 was perfectly fine prior to the book's beginning but it warned of
940.16,943.94, the importance of post-war nationalism it told you that if you believe too much in government
943.94,948.4, structures and the media that is where you devolve into a system where you no longer are able to have
948.4,953.44, autonomy. We crucially remind people of the autonomy in the turning point only on opposition.
953.44,957.36," Secondly, we think we give individuals the hindsight to be able to recognize early warning"
957.36,961.84," signs of oppression and backsliding. Why doesn't this happen on opposition? Two reasons. Number one,"
961.84,967.84, because of optimism bias. We think you are living your current life now and you can see the mature quality of life that you're living is good
967.84,971.68, therefore you think this will not happen to you or that this will only happen in the most extreme
971.68,976.0, instances not realizing that this is the first step of many to lead to the extreme instances
976.0,980.08, but secondly there's a difficulty in conceptualizing what the repercussions of certain
980.08,984.56, actions entail i.e a government can oppress you but the visceral depictions of your rights
984.56,988.46, literally being stripped from you you're not being able to walk to and from work without
988.46,991.82, being afraid that somebody is watching you and tracking your thoughts that is what we're able
991.82,995.96, to push under our side of the house lastly then this creates the important necessary sense of
995.96,1000.34, urgency for mobilization for two reasons one because we're telling you this is a point of
1000.34,1005.36, no return in positivity you say that this harmful state system is only a bypass. You pass
1005.36,1009.0, this phase and you're going to lead to freedom again because freedom is the end goal that
1009.0,1013.46, prop would like you to take away. We tell you this is the only chance for you to mobilize. You cannot
1013.46,1018.02," act again, so you must be urgent now. But secondly, we improve the sense of self-preservation because"
1018.02,1022.22, these are the only ways that we're able to empower the urgency. This empowers political literacy and
1022.22,1029.14," we are better able to criticize the state. The second argument about how we produce a society that forgives state failures on proposition, we think"
1029.14,1033.0," we're going to engage with a range of representation of what positive political fiction looks like,"
1033.2,1037.34, and DPM must come up and tell us why this happens on their side as well. They can't just defend
1037.34,1042.7," Fahrenheit 451. Two options here. Number one, you're very positive in your outlook of governmental"
1042.7,1048.0," structures, like we told you in setup, like West Wing. This is inherently bad because it relies on the benevolence of"
1048.0,1051.36," government in three ways. Number one, we think they have perverse political incentives, so they're"
1051.36,1055.88," not going to be nice to you. Secondly, they're industrial lobbies that inherently self-incentivize."
1056.1,1059.84," But lastly, we think the state has too much power, and therefore, you must err on the side of"
1059.84,1064.78," caution. They can mobilize the military and media, but proposition gives imperfect government systems"
1064.78,1067.6," too much credit, that the government members are trying their best."
1067.6,1068.6, They're just human.
1068.6,1071.14, Then not everybody can benefit under a democracy.
1071.14,1075.16, All of it as an excuse for marginalizing individuals that doesn't happen under our side.
1075.16,1078.8," But secondly, if you're talking about the context first prop gave you, i.e. bad structures"
1078.8,1081.76," where you can overcome them, we still think that it's inherently harmful."
1081.76,1084.44, The state will always be slated against you.
1084.44,1169.96," If you're a minority, you will always be oppressed. Only opposition presents the reality of the world. you you Thank you. Should I start now?"
1171.32,1172.56," Oh yeah, sorry."
1172.86,1173.58, Thank you so much.
1173.58,1177.14, I was waiting for Maya because I can see Martin is ready
1177.14,1179.52, and Jacob is ready to move on as well.
1180.36,1180.64, Okay.
1181.72,1182.5, Thank you so much.
1182.96,1184.76, We thank Elo for a very fine speech.
1184.9,1186.28, Now let's move on to DPM.
1186.64,1191.8, Your chat preferences as well? Thank you.
1194.44,1234.56," Maybe your preferences in your chat, just to clear it out, just give me a few seconds. Thank you. Is there a reason why?"
1235.28,1240.3, I think our internet died out for a quick second.
1241.2,1242.26, Did the speaker already start?
1242.5,1243.6, We're so sorry if they did.
1244.48,1248.0," No, I think the recording has already resumed."
1248.0,1252.0, Yeah.
1252.0,1256.0," Um,"
1256.0,1260.0," starting in three, two,"
1260.0,1264.0, one. We live in a world where nihilism
1264.0,1267.0, is something that's a popular rhetoric to a massive extent.
1267.0,1272.0," Side opposition literally forgets or probably does not strategically engage with this point,"
1272.0,1280.0, specifically when this is one of the major things that people normally use in society because of the pop culture we are facing a lot.
1280.0,1286.4, We don't see why hopelessness is something that they're constantly trying to disagree with.
1286.58,1288.3, I'll be doing three things in my speech.
1288.64,1292.52," Firstly, I'll be providing a direct response to what they said in their speech."
1292.72,1296.26," Secondly, I'll be talking about hope and the solidarity in general."
1296.66,1301.4," Thirdly, I'll be providing an extension on how political incentives change, why that's important."
1302.02,1306.02," So firstly, on direct responses. So firstly they talk about this"
1306.02,1313.04," visceral, they talk about how our world is not like me specifically when the end goal is something"
1313.04,1317.52, that's like painting a good picture of the world. We think that's not true
1317.52,1323.2," specifically in instances where you know the visceral, the you know victory that comes after"
1323.2,1326.56, the visceralness is something that's largely portrayed. This is to say
1326.56,1333.68," that even in the David and Goliath example, the monsterness of Goliath is something that people"
1333.68,1340.16," generally remember, even when David won at the end of the day. We think that the villains are"
1341.36,1346.16, likely going to even be noticed even in instances when they're not true.
1346.16,1351.52," But secondly, under the idea of anger and the entire point of urgency and things like"
1351.52,1356.12," such, we tell you why this anger is going to be largely symmetric on both sides, specifically"
1356.12,1361.1," because of the large overarching narrative in society, which includes such as A, news"
1361.1,1370.0," media, second experience of people, but thirdly, they're also activists who are actively incentivized to actually work for things like, you know, movements or probably"
1370.0,1374.96," urgent issues that are the problems in the modern day society. If any problems exist in society,"
1375.22,1379.08, they're necessarily going to be talked about. We don't see how it's not going to be talked about
1379.08,1386.24," at all in their world. But even when, even when in these instances these instances are awesome let's see what the distinction really"
1386.24,1392.08, lies right the distinction lies in the point of optimism specifically filled in a world that is
1392.08,1396.96, inherently nihilistic when people are a believing that the world is hopeless and things as such we
1396.96,1402.48, think that we think that there is an overarching you know narrative that covers there is a massive
1402.48,1405.36, amount of hopelessness hopelessness means there is
1405.36,1411.28, a lesser motivation to learn or work and things as such in general we think that this lesser form of
1411.28,1416.8, motivation is worse off right but they say oh the hope is something that's you know that's not going
1416.8,1427.24, to last forever and things are such right um what we need to understand then is that what prompts immediate outcomes from individual
1427.24,1428.5, is something that's hope.
1428.5,1432.6," So if you're hopeful right today, you would want to do something right now."
1432.6,1437.76," And these sort of small, small instances are equally important in society to an extent"
1437.76,1443.44, when you are able to actually bring urgent changes in societies in general.
1443.44,1449.92, We think that these people are likely to inherit but even if they say oh hope is something that's like not going to last forever
1449.92,1455.92, we don't see how that that how the change actually occurs on their side specifically when people are
1455.92,1461.84, hopeless when they have no any motivation to actually learn or grow more in general but thirdly
1461.84,1465.92, on the idea of how the governments are imperfect and you know they
1465.92,1470.32, are trying their best. We think that's not necessarily true because because like all the
1470.32,1475.44, governments and the politicians within governments have a lot of incentives to focus on personal
1475.44,1480.32," interests. They're not necessarily working for like people in general. We see corruptions happening,"
1480.32,1485.44," scandals happening, even like US which is like one of the liberal democracies,"
1485.44,1490.04, still has instances where politicians are doing wrong things and doing necessarily harmful
1490.04,1494.94," things in society, which means that they're not trying their best in and of itself."
1494.94,1502.18," But secondly, we think that even in those cases where there is like this privilege bubble"
1502.18,1505.86," or things of such, we think that this privilege bubble needs to be"
1505.86,1511.02, broken in a sense that these people need to realize and take the responsibility for it they're only
1511.02,1516.68, able to take a responsibility when they can when they won't get away by saying oh it is something
1516.68,1522.18, that is probably not able to create as much impact and things as such in general we think that's
1522.18,1529.92," massively important under our side but secondly under this idea of like solidarity that Aba points out, right, we think that friction binds people in"
1529.92,1535.68, groups and that's necessarily very important. Why is the community in general then better off under
1535.68,1543.12," our side? Firstly, the sight of common enemy is not lost at all. Even in our media, we do portray"
1543.12,1545.26," struggle against systems, villains, and things"
1545.26,1550.84," as such. But secondly, the reason we're better off is that a positive outcome implies that being"
1550.84,1555.28," part of the group is something that's extremely meaningful towards individuals. But thirdly,"
1555.48,1561.04," proletarian writers wrote work in order to lift worker of some, inspiring them to accept"
1561.04,1565.6, hope of social change. This revolution came about and it was able to generate
1565.6,1571.08," a communist region. How the communist regime turned out isn't our fault, but the fact that"
1571.08,1576.0," they were moved in such a way that they brought this regime is more important. But fourthly,"
1576.0,1580.82," bickering and fighting not in terms of what they want to do about the problem, but whether"
1580.82,1589.72," they should address is extremely important, right? This looks like Ghetto being distrustful of systematic change, people thinking that there is no resolution"
1589.72,1594.4," to crime and things as such. They need to defend all dishonor their side. Before I move on, I'll"
1594.4,1599.68," take that to you, Aya. So hope means you think your future will eventually shape out to benefit"
1599.68,1603.96," you eventually. So why won't society just tie out the bad administrations of corruption,"
1604.3,1605.1, especially since
1605.1,1611.4, you say social change is so hot because it will just in the future because there are nuances that
1611.4,1617.52, you say that the end result is not a direct outcome but uh but but it is a form of thing
1617.52,1622.5, that you get out after the you know disadvantage that you have gotten but moreover the hope acts
1622.5,1625.0, as an agency to actually bring changes for people.
1625.22,1629.86," In a hopeless world, we don't see how the agency actually works out for people to work actually"
1629.86,1635.84," harder. Thirdly, then, on how political incentives change in general. The premise here is oftentimes"
1635.84,1641.32," politicians use the existing narrative to weaponize the inaction of others, then promoting their own"
1641.32,1646.2, action. This looks like the Biden government winning the election
1646.2,1650.56, just based on the fact that Trump is bad. This is something that Democrats have been doing
1650.56,1657.12," historically, right? But the mechanism of political change then on our side becomes that first,"
1657.6,1668.22," at any point in time, optimism becomes a norm narrative in society that's overarching. Keeping the worst is not necessarily a priority."
1668.22,1671.68," Secondly, then what becomes the priority?"
1671.68,1674.44, The priority becomes challenging politicians
1674.44,1677.68, to bring positive change that are likely and possible.
1677.68,1680.24," Now, the change is not something that's unrealistic"
1680.24,1681.54, or something out of the way
1681.54,1683.5, that they are trying to put you under their will.
1683.5,1684.94, It's something that's realistic.
1684.94,1689.44, It's something that's achievable. So even if they don't reach to the maximum amount
1689.44,1694.08," of change, they're at least able to make something impactful or reach around it that's extremely"
1694.08,1700.0," important. But thirdly, this particular argument is independent of opposition saying that the"
1700.0,1706.08, portrayal of political fiction is unrealistic. This demands change leading to marginal form of
1706.08,1710.96, concessions by politicians which is largely essential in the present world in general.
1710.96,1717.84," The importance then becomes firstly merit which people, in which like people are able to win"
1717.84,1723.44," election in the form of meritocracy. They focus more on electoral debates, manifestos, that's more"
1723.44,1725.46, focused on positive action rather
1725.46,1730.22," than the inaction of another, which is massively important on our world. But secondly, the"
1730.22,1736.94, perception of evil is also something that's very high. So that's when we're able to reduce
1736.94,1742.6, the sort of negative connotations that's generally attached to it. We think that we're better
1742.6,1745.28, able to then like counter their point
1745.28,1750.32," on how benevolent leader and government exist and things as such. We don't think that they are,"
1750.32,1754.32, that's the like right portrayal of people. We don't think that's how people should perceive
1754.32,1758.88," these people, these like governments in general, specifically when governments are working in"
1758.88,1830.4," inactions in the status quo. For all those reasons we're very proud to stand on proposition. you Okay. We thank DPM for verifying speech. Now let's move on to DLO, continuous opposition case."
1830.56,1833.84," Hi, can I double check that I'm audible?"
1835.02,1836.58, Clear and loud. Thank you very much.
1837.24,1857.16," Great. I'll take POIs verbally, so just unmute yourself. Setting up the timer starting in three two one panel an emotion that is far stronger than hope is fear because hope"
1857.16,1863.24, is fleeting and hope is abstract the hope that proposition argued for is tied in outcome that
1863.24,1865.46, only once we achieve and see that something is
1865.46,1871.3, possible can we hope for it. Often hope is only derived when we think that there is the possibility
1871.3,1876.66, of change or else the hope is not enough to actually counteract the impossible scenario.
1877.1,1882.74," On opposition, we're very clear that do we even know, number one, what are these structures within"
1882.74,1885.38, the political scene that we need to call out?
1885.38,1889.34, And can we conceptualize a state to be that malevolent in the first place?
1889.34,1894.54," But secondly, do we have the heightened sense of fear to act that currently exists to want"
1894.54,1898.22, to ensure that the outcome never manifests in the first place?
1898.22,1903.42," Because on proposition, they tell you that even in the worst scenarios in society and"
1903.42,1906.18," in status quo, you can always change the structure."
1906.48,1909.64, What opposition tells you is that society cannot afford
1909.64,1911.94, for the devolution of political structures
1911.94,1914.4, because there's the possibility of no return.
1914.66,1916.96, We told you that was a far greater mobilizer
1916.96,1920.3, when you realize that you need political literacy in the now
1920.3,1922.08," because if you don't educate yourself,"
1922.24,1924.5, the outcomes are going to be cemented.
1924.66,1934.7," Before I move on to a new piece of argumentation as to how the political dystopia applies to all and disables the privileged from insulating themselves from participation,"
1935.12,1939.92," a few levels of responses, observations and rebuilding of the first opposition case."
1940.22,1948.0," The first thing I would like to point out is how contradictory and how the tension in Proposition's case is still unresolved, even after the point out from First Offosition."
1948.36,1949.84, What is the contradiction inherently?
1950.3,1959.84," They want to argue on their side that there exists a sufficient level of anger and mobilization currently, which is why we don't require negativity."
1960.46,1967.16," I think just for the purposes of having a clean debate, Proposition is being far too strategic in wanting to go out both sides of the aisle."
1967.4,1971.74," They want to have their hope, but they also want to have levels of anger and pessimism on their side."
1971.98,1977.54," Here's why it can't work. Because if we have such strong negative and pessimistic individuals in society,"
1977.88,1982.46, then their benefits of hope is extremely minimal in trying to counteract existing biases.
1982.46,1985.62," But second, and more importantly, can only occur"
1985.62,1991.5, if a majority of people are able to overcome the negative biases. So what proposition's burden now
1991.5,1996.7, has to be is proving to me why the consumption of political fiction is going to change the minds of
1996.7,2002.36," the currently hedonistic, nihilistic individuals within society, or else that means they cannot"
2002.36,2009.76, achieve any of their outcomes if people don't actually change their minds which means proposition has two things they need to do but it's likely going
2009.76,2014.34, to be too late either number one they need to concede that they can't have the best of both
2014.34,2019.2, worlds and need to argue that their side likely is going to overwhelm and overshadow the negativity
2019.2,2023.88, and therefore only have the positive narratives as the majoritarian view which means that they
2023.88,2028.52, have to concede the harms that we propose from first opposition in the first and second argument to
2028.52,2033.88," its fullest extent, rather than the catch-all response in second part that they use. Or second,"
2034.1,2038.18," that if they want to still string along on the idea that there is negativity on their side,"
2038.3,2042.72," you cannot credit any of their case to the fullest extent, given number one, the benefits therefore"
2042.72,2048.8, are watered down in terms of it counteracting the positivity but number two they still have not proven to you why individuals would
2048.8,2053.6, pivot if nihilism and the idea that her life is meaningless is far too strong that rebuttal is
2053.6,2057.68, extremely important i would like you to take note of it and hold the third speaker accountable in
2057.68,2062.48, their speech but on to actual responses number one on the idea of hope for advocacy because i think
2062.48,2068.24, it sufficiently responded to you in first opposition but it did not actually want to pay attention and just asserted that we did not
2068.24,2073.36, here's the nuance rebuttals therefore we told you why code that keeps you going cannot be the metric
2073.36,2078.72, because it is inherently tied to optimistic outcomes we question them from first opposition
2078.72,2082.96, what happens when you're unable to achieve set outcomes because i think the problem with
2082.96,2089.36, proposition is they don't mechanize and illustrate how any of their benefits are able to materialize they just say that there's optimism
2089.36,2094.4, and therefore people push we argue what happens in between is what is important and crucial for
2094.4,2099.28, how their argument actually plays out we said and they're considered in second proposition by the
2099.28,2103.6, way when they use the exact terms that you have optimism based on outcome but the problem with
2103.6,2108.78, that is that often activism try to uproot and change political structures is not something that happens
2108.78,2114.42," overnight. Often takes generations, if not decades, and if not in the status quo is still problematic,"
2114.42,2119.06," which is why when you tie it based on outcomes, the thing that we said crucially in nuance was"
2119.06,2123.88," that hope can potentially be fleeting, that hope does not sustain you indefinitely, and you need"
2123.88,2130.08, to be able to see the gains and the wins. but if you tie it to large political outcomes and large structural changes
2130.08,2135.6, the point of your own to achieve this proposition's hope disappears and dissipates and activist burnout
2135.6,2140.88, actually occurs more on their side but second let's assume their best case assuming that you
2140.88,2144.36, did have to push in the short term in order to do this what was the thing that we told you on
2144.36,2146.94, opposition number one we explained to you that hope was never
2146.94,2152.0," needed to initially mobilize these individuals, given oppression and survivability were tangible"
2152.0,2156.32," reasons enough to fight and to advocate for yourself. But secondly, on our side, when"
2156.32,2160.24," it's not outcome based, you're able to better take these small wins in order to prevent"
2160.24,2165.16," things like activist burnout. So in, for example, African Americans, it does not require"
2165.16,2170.38," us to restructure a corrupt internalized system, but rather being able to vote one day, being able"
2170.38,2175.06, to send your children to school are things that can keep you going. You cannot allow feelings and
2175.06,2179.5, things like hope to decide advocacy. It needs to be your certain circumstances that continuously
2179.5,2184.48," pursue. But secondly, on the nuance as to why they can't have cake and they can't have their cake and"
2184.48,2185.06, eat it too. We gave you the nuance if they did they can't have cake and they can't have their cake and eat it too.
2192.62,2193.04, We gave you the nuance. They did not want to engage. They just said that individuals are not individuals are still able to see the overwhelmingly positive outcome.
2199.64,2199.94," The nuance was this, that there is a limit to how large the political obstacle on proper zero can be within their political fiction."
2207.5,2214.16," Because if the story is, for example, one person single handedly being able to overthrow an autocratic government, no one can buy into that. Which is why the structure and the obstacle needs to be lowered in order for the optimism to trump and try to overcome in the end."
2214.36,2220.02," Because individuals need to see that there's a pathway for me being able to emulate said actions, which is why they could not actually co-opt our case."
2220.24,2225.18," But lastly on nihilism, they said we never strategically engaged. We told you why it did not even matter in this debate."
2225.42,2229.14," They have to explain first that we put on the first at the top of the speech, how they"
2229.14,2229.96, change nihilists.
2230.2,2236.98," But second, and very easily, a nihilist doesn't want to die in terms of nihilists choose to"
2236.98,2240.74," live every day, that even if you believe life is meaningless, you also believe that you"
2240.74,2243.64, can feel pain and would not like to live under state oppression.
2243.78,2245.7, Before I'm one sure.
2251.34,2251.44," If it is the case that you get absolutely no changes structurally over like 10, 20,"
2254.58,2254.7," 30 years, then this debate does not make any difference."
2258.98,2259.6, The realistic case is that you do get some concessions in terms of solidifying hope in the real world.
2260.3,2262.1," Yeah, we said you get small concessions."
2262.2,2262.64, We agree.
2262.64,2264.9, You require the large political outcomes.
2271.04,2289.12," And saying that advocacy does not take decades is just disingenuous. Look how long women took to be able to have the right to vote. On to the third argumentation then, state and aren't actually politically participant. Because even when there are real world politics that are"
2289.12,2292.96," toxic and problematic, the privileged or the individuals are able to insulate themselves"
2292.96,2297.96, from that harm. So often narratives of positivity and optimism never really apply to these
2297.96,2301.52, individuals because they are able to shield themselves from the necessary harms that the
2301.52,2306.94," state is propagating. But second and crucially, only pessimism and negativity would affect the upper echelons"
2306.94,2311.02, of society because positive and optimism are able to be shielded and require people to
2311.02,2315.6, live under a position and condition where they feel defenseless and have no power.
2315.6,2319.12," Hence, on our side, when we say that these structures are inherently going to discriminate"
2319.12,2323.44," all individuals, when you conceptualize the world as one that can also be distasteful"
2323.44,2328.24," to yourself, we mobilize the most influential of individuals to be politically participant?"
2328.24,2331.52," Note, panel, that we live in a world where the state literally engineered our choices"
2331.52,2336.24, in Cambridge Analytica. Only under negativity and pessimism can we conceptualize such a malevolent
2336.24,2340.08," state and take preemptive measures against that. On proposition, they would hope the state is"
2340.08,2404.18," benevolent and pray to gods. you Hi, just let me know when to start."
2405.0,2408.24," Yeah, thank you so much."
2408.24,2410.24, I think you're good to go.
2410.24,2416.8," Okay, I was hoping to get a few more seconds."
2416.8,2419.56, My PY preference is strictly through the chat.
2419.56,2421.1, Please don't interrupt.
2421.1,2422.46, That is all I ask.
2422.46,2427.36, No gender pronoun preferences. Say whatever. Just give me a few seconds to
2427.36,2467.82, gather my notes. starting my speech in three two one notice the intrinsic difference between positive and negative political fiction if in
2467.82,2473.14, positive political fiction the agency of what can be done about your situation is placed within
2473.14,2479.02, yourself that is to say the outcomes of a positive conflict for instance is that you end up winning
2479.02,2483.96, if not physically at least you have the moral victory which means that you earned it by doing
2483.96,2487.54, something in terms of self-preservation or survival that they want to talk about.
2487.76,2497.0," Whereas on their side of the house, imagine in 1984, the entire conclusive messaging is that you were never responsible for anything that you did."
2497.3,2501.6," Because necessarily, Conan, at the end of the day, pulls the trigger on Wilson."
2501.88,2505.12, That is the conclusion that you did not have agency in all of
2505.12,2509.74," this. And this is crucial in terms of this debate and where it is better off in terms of outcomes,"
2509.84,2513.74," right? Three questions then in this debate. Firstly, who improves the position of communities"
2513.74,2518.82," and social justice movements? Secondly, is the communication of hope important for people?"
2519.14,2523.3," And thirdly, in terms of where the political climate is healthier? Firstly then, in terms of"
2523.3,2527.84, who improves the position of communities within social justice movements.
2527.84,2529.8," They have two major claims there, right?"
2529.8,2532.66," Firstly, their claim is that pessimistic fiction"
2532.66,2534.52," is effective and secondly,"
2534.52,2537.04, that it indicates for early signs of oppression.
2537.04,2538.52," Quickly on the second point, right?"
2538.52,2540.52, That it indicates early signs of oppression.
2540.52,2543.08, I want to note that media has a large incentive
2543.08,2545.0, to cover it in terms of this reality.
2545.0,2554.0, So this is likely to be symmetric on either side. And also the fact that social media is so globally outreaching means that this is likely to be covered in all facets on either side.
2554.0,2557.0," The difference, however, is that people are not dumb, right?"
2557.0,2568.52," Like, you know, from your lived realities that things are turning south, that certain things are getting worse off. If you're African American, the militarization of policing within your neighborhoods is getting worse because you"
2568.52,2574.12, literally see like police officers with bolsters walking around your streets. That is not the
2574.12,2579.3, difference here. The key difference is that the movie will still show a fictional reality
2579.3,2584.7, wherein the differentiation is literally in terms of feelings as opposed to anything else that they
2584.7,2585.04, wanted to
2585.04,2588.88, talk about within the next speech right like pushing the limits on what people feel and
2588.88,2593.44, things as such the differentiation in terms of movies and books and literature in general
2593.44,2598.72, is hope and is feelings which means that we're better off under this claim right but secondarily
2598.72,2606.58, in terms of pessimistic fiction being effective notice why their claims are in contention with one another. They said that
2606.58,2612.3," at a point in time where we portray viscerality too, that is the only lasting impression. If that"
2612.3,2618.22," is true, then this impact is literally symmetrical on both sides. But we're going to argue that having"
2618.22,2622.68, the impression of hope is something that is probably more realistic and probably something
2622.68,2627.02," that is lasting. Why is this the case? And Ruthen pointed this out, I'll expand upon it, right?"
2627.02,2629.78," It is untrue that in terms of positive portrayal,"
2629.78,2633.76, viscerality gets lost because necessarily the thought process you go through is
2633.76,2637.3," despite facing this violence, despite facing this oppression,"
2637.3,2640.42," you as the protagonist were still able to overcome it,"
2640.42,2645.6, which means that there are instances in which the overwhelming consensus is against you and
2645.6,2651.76, still you can win out and come out on top which is we think an important message right but like even
2651.76,2656.48, if we say that like you know they'll never be successful as opposition wants to point out
2656.48,2668.82, we think the general perception of hope itself is something that is beneficial in sofar as your already pathetic life does not get even more visceral to the extent
2668.82,2674.0," where even when you go to watch a movie for sake of entertainment or for sake of escapism,"
2674.0,2679.02, you're not berated with hopelessness and berated with nihilism and berated with an absolute
2679.02,2705.08," sending effective. They said that it was effective insofar as it pursued the causes of survival. I want to note that in a lot of instances, survival is a positive outcome coming out of these political fictions, which means that that is about survivability relate more to our side,"
2708.52,2708.74," insofar as survivability itself is a net positive,"
2712.36,2712.54, as opposed to being a dystopic portrayal of these government institutions.
2713.8,2715.72," Before I move on, I'll take your point."
2718.98,2719.1," Is it realistic for you to say that in every instance of state oppression,"
2720.62,2720.7, you're always going to be able to win out?
2723.62,2731.52," Because if that's the case, your premise of hope is a premise of something that will never exist in real life your time is over yeah um we didn't say that it is realistic we said that"
2731.52,2736.56, having a perception of hope is generally still better off insofar as every other facet of your
2736.56,2740.96, life is miserable insofar as you don't contest that claim we still don't understand what the
2740.96,2745.0, positive value of your case is to like the people who are living pathetic
2745.0,2750.12, lives right so like you have to work on that on off web but thirdly in terms of pessimistic fiction
2750.12,2755.02, being more effective right like movies are literally consumed for escapism and relaxation
2755.02,2760.26, insofar as political fictions do not do this people will move to alternate movies to watch
2760.26,2765.58, such as comedies and things as such i do not understand why this is a positive shift insofar
2765.58,2771.44, as political fictions still illustrate all of the things that they talked about in terms of like
2771.44,2776.72, breaking the assumption of human decency and showing the possibilities of ugliness in realities
2776.72,2782.4, while having a positive conclusion right like that is a much it's much better to have these people be
2782.4,2786.0, hopeful while watching these things as opposed to just not watching them in the first place.
2786.0,2790.0, Second question then is the communication of hope important to people?
2790.0,2794.0," And I think this is where we have significant clashes in terms of what was said on either side, right?"
2794.0,2803.0, Because they said that hope is tied to outcomes insofar as survivability and other sorts of positive positive like messaging is not.
2803.0,2806.32," I want to note, as I I did earlier that survivability is a"
2806.32,2812.0, positive outcome but secondarily we think we live in a status quo where you do get certain levers of
2812.0,2816.64, structural changes occurring here and there right like these are things that are emphasized by
2816.64,2822.08, activists all over it. These are also things that are likely to be portrayed in symbolic terms in
2822.08,2825.12, the very like political fictions that we're talking about
2825.12,2829.9, in terms of the small concessions that you got out of government which me which meant that your
2829.9,2835.48, community could survive or even in some cases thrive it also means that hope in terms of like
2835.48,2840.82, what outcomes it shows you what possibilities it shows you in future of your life right because if
2840.82,2845.2, you're an african-american who lives around in and around the ghetto it hope is
2845.2,2850.48, the differentiation between you joining a crime force versus you trying to pursue higher education
2850.48,2856.24, within community colleges this impacting is much better off under our side insofar as we get real
2856.24,2861.36, people to go for real changes within their own lives because they think that they are the agents
2861.36,2868.32, of changes within at least the story set within their own lives right this is something that they have not explained why it occurs under their side but
2868.32,2873.76, certainly then in terms of like uh hope and why it's important right they said people with social
2873.76,2879.68, power illustrate uh insulate themselves from like this sort of misery which means hope is not moving
2879.68,2896.0," to them i want to note that in their side of the world, in the dystopic portrayal of fiction, it is more likely that people who are in positions of power still feel their security because they still know the ways in which the power was consolidated in that fiction is through the very means that they have."
2896.0,2899.0," Things such as money, things such as political capital, etc. etc. Right?"
2899.0,2905.9, So the conclusion to make here is that the communication of hope is something that is on net a positive.
2905.9,2911.0," But even if it is not, even if they said that, oh, like desperation exists to such an extent"
2911.0,2913.46, that hope is literally a non differential.
2913.46,2917.7, We don't see why this changes under their side for like mechanisms of survivability
2917.7,2921.52, and thriving insofar as mass media already has an incentive to cooperate.
2921.52,2924.16," OpWhip is way too late to reply, right?"
2924.16,2925.36, But final question then in terms
2925.36,2930.32," of political climate, and I want to note that we have heard zero responses on this from the"
2930.32,2935.68, previous speaker. We said that there are politicians who can weaponize the inaction of
2935.68,2942.4, other people as opposed to making their own actions amplified in order to win election
2942.4,2949.04, campaigns and things as such. This is something that the democratic party has been doing for the past four election cycles right this is something
2949.04,2954.64, that they needed to address in so far as they had to tell us why agency being ripped away from you
2954.64,2959.76, is a positive narrative to set within the climate of political instances insofar as
2959.76,3016.76," elections can be decided on this narrative for all these reasons we're very proud to propose you Okay, we thank GovWeb for a very fine speech."
3016.76,3018.64, Now let's move on to Opposition Web.
3018.64,3019.64, He here.
3019.64,3027.12," All right, am I audible?"
3028.06,3029.18," Yes, clear and loud."
3030.32,3032.66," I'll take POS in the chat, so feel free to ask there."
3034.28,3037.6," Starting in three, two, one."
3038.4,3041.4," Team Nepal wants to talk about changing dystopias in books,"
3041.68,3044.84," yet at the end of the bench, the only dystopia they couldn't change"
3044.84,3045.04, was the grim counterstopia they couldn't change was the
3045.04,3050.32, grim counterfactual they supported. The problem with the proposition case was their misunderstanding
3050.32,3055.2," of reality, because notice their case has a very unrealistic vision of how people interact with"
3055.2,3061.76," political fiction. Their case was that once someone reads 1984, they'll become so nihilistic"
3061.76,3065.22," that they give up survival, they give up self-preservation and let"
3065.22,3071.16," the government oppress you to no end. Not only is this extremely unpersuasive, it undermines their"
3071.16,3076.7, own case because it suggests that this political fiction has such massive influential power over
3076.7,3081.56, you. The argument it accuses of not responding to was that certain politicians have malevolent
3081.56,3090.56, incentives to capitalize off how people act. If you believe our second argument about how these politicians are more likely to hijack the narrative of hope
3090.56,3094.12," and people buy in towards this without any resistance,"
3094.46,3097.48," it means that people are able to be pushed towards certain ideologies,"
3097.48,3100.84, which meant that they can so strongly force you to follow one path.
3100.98,3105.76," Then in the instance where slow internal change fails, you still follow it. You don't"
3105.76,3110.34," evolve your methods, you remain complacent and ineffective. So all the arguments about proving"
3110.34,3114.68," why this is a massive cultural force ends up working for our side as well, because it shows"
3114.68,3120.08," that where you fail, it also means that you will never try anything else. Don't let them get away"
3120.08,3124.54, with saying we didn't respond. We told you that positivity created inaction. That's why they can't
3124.54,3129.52," say politicians will be inactive, because their argument only talks about people on the"
3129.52,3133.84, ground the people who read these books and there's no incentive analysis as to why politicians will
3133.84,3138.88, react to this but also the malevolent people it feeds into our characterization of how it creates
3138.88,3144.96, further inaction let's clarify the burden in the round then the prop wanted to hinge monumental
3144.96,3145.9, political reform
3145.9,3150.22, on a few fictional books. And note they had to prove success because the emotion they were
3150.22,3154.84," hinging on, which was hope, was contingent on the positive outcomes of success. And second and third"
3154.84,3159.76, prop concede to this. Our burden was never to take on this huge monumental reform on the same
3159.76,3164.28, level. What we're able to prove here is not only that people want to push towards more forms of
3164.28,3169.34," reform, but also how that reform happens. That was something they never responded to, which means"
3169.34,3173.58," even if you believe them that they got reform, they never proved to you why how that reform"
3173.58,3177.9," happened was going to be good. There are three issues I want to talk about in this speech. First,"
3178.0,3182.52," on motivations for change. Second, on better criticisms of the state. And thirdly, on more"
3182.52,3185.92, inclusive forms of change then first on motivations
3185.92,3190.32, for change and in comparison as to why it was significantly better on the opposition there were
3190.32,3195.68, three categorical reasons for why hope is an unreliable and bad strategy first hope was
3195.68,3202.24, contingent on positive outcomes that one day that you utopic reality will eventually materialize the
3202.24,3205.78," problem with this was that you can lose hope, but you can never lose"
3205.78,3210.02," sight of things like survival, things like self-preservation, things like hunger, things"
3210.02,3213.98, like poverty. And this is why there are far better emotions to capitalize on when it comes to things
3213.98,3218.9," like fear and your own protection. And the reason for this is given to you in first proposition,"
3219.22,3224.44," because they told you that things like activists burnt out, which fundamentally concedes that hope"
3224.44,3225.24," can be lost,"
3225.5,3227.52, which means that hope isn't something that you rely on.
3227.78,3230.0, Their actual burden was not to defend hope in a vacuum.
3230.28,3235.14," It was sustained, continuous hope, which you've never been able to prove why it was always going to work."
3235.46,3239.7," Second, hope was easily instrumentalized to downplay issues."
3240.06,3244.32, Note there were inescapable categorical differences about how hope is portrayed in fiction.
3244.64,3249.32," Things like individual perseverance, things like homogenous historical endpoints that move towards justice."
3249.66,3253.04," Narratives like saying the moral arc of the universe always bends towards justice,"
3253.2,3256.06, which is a common theme in these books to catalyze that change.
3256.32,3262.0," Or third, the things like humanization of political structures to make you feel more sympathetic or empathetic towards people in power."
3262.46,3264.54, Third prop concedes that it's unrealistic.
3264.64,3265.52," But this is damaging, because if this fiction is so unrealistic, then you cannot apply it to yourself. empathetic or empathetic towards people in power the prop concedes that it's unrealistic but this"
3265.52,3269.96, is damaging because if this fiction is so unrealistic then you cannot apply it to yourself
3269.96,3275.18, you cannot see them in your shoes which means they don't get any of their impacts then but thirdly we
3275.18,3279.5, told you this from first to very little response that hope did not matter because it was our side
3279.5,3284.0, the identification of issues came analytically prior it was the only way you're able to get
3284.0,3286.38," change is identifying the precondition for that,"
3286.56,3287.78, just understanding there were issues
3287.78,3288.76, you needed to fight for.
3288.98,3289.82, So even if you believe
3289.82,3291.44," they were going to fight for change on their side,"
3291.56,3293.26, it was never the most important issue.
3293.52,3294.0," So for example,"
3294.08,3295.92," if you were fighting for an environmental cause,"
3296.2,3297.78, you will criticize that one politician
3297.78,3299.98, that's not fighting for environmental causes
3299.98,3302.52," rather than instead criticizing the entire system,"
3302.78,3303.7," the entire party,"
3303.98,3305.06," entire policies,"
3306.46,3306.72, they're not banning party hopping.
3308.34,3310.68, That's far more likely to happen on our side because we don't lose sight of the most important things.
3310.96,3312.18," Their only response was the matter,"
3312.4,3314.0," new matter and third prop was like,"
3314.46,3315.5, watch comedy instead.
3315.6,3317.26, But I don't know why that's particularly important
3317.26,3318.42, if it still leads to our outcomes
3318.42,3319.48, and it's probably something that's good.
3319.8,3320.76, What was our comparative?
3321.12,3323.36, Second prop makes a fatal damaging concession.
3323.68,3329.36," They claim the anger is symmetric. But in fact, I don't think anger is symmetric. On their side, anyone who is angry"
3329.36,3333.8, is shamed or they're seen as radicalist. They're seen as anarchist because they created a social
3333.8,3339.3, norm of optimism and complacency. So anyone who diverges from the norm is harmful. That's why our
3339.3,3344.1, comparison of emotional motivators was better. It was not inaction. It was other powerful emotions
3344.1,3348.9, like fear and survival and self-preservation. But then another response I want to give here is that if
3348.9,3353.6," it's things like anger, it's who you ascribe blame towards. On our side, if we fail, that's fine"
3353.6,3357.74," because we recognize it was the state who made us into this mess. On their side, if you believe so"
3357.74,3362.52," strongly in protagonists, when your political fighters fail, when your social movements fail,"
3362.66,3368.46," you don't blame the state, you blame your social because you see you are the ones who fail even though it is so possible for you"
3368.46,3372.48, to get success you fail and that's why they get more activist burnout on their side compounding
3372.48,3377.46, all their harms what's the conclusion to this issue not only do we prove op adds urgency to
3377.46,3382.32, change but prop actively reduces urgency for change by watering down the true gravity of
3382.32,3390.54," darkness and lie to people that eventually justice will be gotten. Before that, I'll take their point. Right, so we said that agency is a"
3390.54,3395.46," narrative that drives social changes. You didn't respond. Instead, you said that hope is contingent"
3395.46,3400.24," on outcomes, which we showed was realistic. Yeah, so most of these people don't believe in autonomy"
3400.24,3403.9," because if the state was so bad to them, telling them their free will isn't likely to achieve very"
3403.9,3408.7," much. Second, if you have autonomy but autonomy doesn't manifest successfully there's no"
3408.7,3413.44, impact of that autonomy which leads very nicely to the second argument about better criticism of
3413.44,3417.94, the state there are three pieces of weighing here first this is about the process it's very important
3417.94,3422.32, because prop only says change will happen that's not enough here to show why the change it was the
3422.32,3427.92, process while be successful second prop says you have hope to fight but we told you that hope is useless as long as you have nothing to fight
3427.92,3432.64, for but third positive fiction hyper fixates on outcome not the process they can't claim that
3432.64,3436.56, people learn about the journey of change because the entirety of the movie is about taking down
3436.56,3440.8, those structures in comparison a pessimistic piece of fiction is more grim it hits you deeper it
3440.8,3444.96, makes you reflect way more what's the major hole in their case then which is about things about
3444.96,3449.2, major activism burnout first if they argue there's major activist burnout then how
3449.2,3452.96, are they going to get any impact on their side because you have no vehicle for your change
3452.96,3457.12, but second this extrapolation shows that all of their change is individualized first prop says
3457.12,3460.88, they showcase how the protagonist succeeds which means it's individualized even more so therefore
3460.88,3469.24, it's harder for you to collect device for these levels of change but second no there was no response to our second argument about how hope is hijacked as a facade
3469.24,3474.04, for sustained exploitation by people in power able to say things are all right force you to
3474.04,3478.84, work internally within the system do things like voting in democracy rather than major changes to
3478.84,3483.64, the political system even if democracy has failed you this is important because it meant that even
3483.64,3488.14," if you were extremely charitable and your have a symmetric incentive to improve quality of life, the categorical"
3488.14,3492.92," difference is on one end. You held on to stagnant internal change, which is far harder to get their"
3492.92,3497.56," positive outcomes. So once again, at their best, they get the same capital, but we say it because"
3497.56,3501.62," when people fundamentally think differently, when you accept a diversity in thought, rather than"
3501.62,3508.72," homogenizing everyone into saying, we can only follow how the state wants us to do it because the state is a benevolent actor means you're far harder to get"
3508.72,3512.88, changed the third issue was about universality of this change we explained from second op that
3512.88,3517.12, their hope and their mechanisms were exclusionary we bridged this gap because pessimism was
3517.12,3521.28, immediately a narrative that was more inclusive of everyone the lower class the ethnic minority
3521.28,3528.64, the proletariat but also affected the people at the top because they finally felt they had hope and they had these forms of like harm towards them which is their
3528.64,3532.72, fear and their survival third prop concedes to this but he also had no response which means
3532.72,3536.8, this argument is still standing take off the rose tinted lenses let's call it for what it
3536.8,3540.4, is it's not optimistic political fiction it killed the only tool the politically
3540.4,3586.0, disillusioned have to bleed the torch for change. We are's move on to invite opposition reply.
3586.0,3590.0," Hi, can I be heard?"
3590.0,3596.0, Yes. Can you be a little bit louder? I think your voice sounds a little bit distant.
3596.0,3601.0," Alright, sure. I'll speak a bit louder. Starting my speech in 3, 2, 1."
3601.0,3608.24, Proposition needs to understand the definition of fiction. It means that political fiction is not a play by play of the present.
3608.24,3612.28," It means that status quo both zero or really in governmental structures, but we can warn"
3612.28,3617.28, society to fear the early warning signs so as to not degrade into that kind of reality.
3617.28,3619.66, Why is this misunderstanding of the context crucial?
3619.66,3620.66, For two reasons.
3620.66,3629.36," Number one, because this engages in propositions best case, even if we are absolutely hopeless in our media, it is not the status quo. It means you have to take action now to prevent"
3629.36,3634.76," the future of hopelessness. But secondly, it means Proposition cannot co-opt agency, and agency is"
3634.76,3639.4, only empowered insofar as the pathway is a realistic one. We must highlight the barriers
3639.4,3643.64, to agency before we can fight them. Proposition tells you you are free when ultimately you are
3643.64,3645.92, not. Two issues to talk about in this speech.
3645.92,3647.86," Firstly, on who gets a stronger opposition"
3647.86,3649.84, to the overwhelming state authority.
3649.84,3652.68," And secondly, on society which talks about other stakeholders"
3652.68,3654.88, outside the oppressed and outside activists.
3654.88,3657.18," Firstly then, on autonomy and how you are able"
3657.18,3658.66, to hold the state accountable.
3658.66,3659.76, Four things broadly.
3659.76,3661.68," Number one, we tell you that from the start,"
3661.68,3663.74, our first argument already implicitly dealt
3663.74,3673.0," with everything about activist burnout. Why is this the case? Because proposition tells you we have no hope to fight, but we are telling you that people don't know that they have to fight until it is too late."
3673.0,3689.38," We told you also that hope is unimportant insofar as people fight for their survival, not for happy moments, which means that our analysis is unique and exclusive insofar as we get hope as well. But secondly, the burden that proposition takes onto themselves is to prove social change exists. But how? Because when people don't even"
3689.38,3694.04," recognize the severity of the situation they are in, proposition cannot co-opt this kind of anger."
3694.46,3698.64," Proposition also cannot co-opt the depictions of viscerality, because we think it's important"
3698.64,3703.32, that the third proposition speech already concedes the importance of the illustration
3703.32,3707.88, of the propensity of harm when they say that there are other avenues to achieve this kind of viscerality.
3708.18,3713.26," We told you no. We told you three structural reasons they have still been unengaged with, which means that all they have is assertions."
3713.46,3718.2," We told you, number one, it's about the people outside the political sphere to increase mobilization and increase awareness."
3718.2,3721.48," We told you, too, it's about a political nature to unite against the oppressors."
3721.72,3728.76," We told you, three, that films exist in an alternative world role which means it's much clearer than political analysis and news feed it is only here you're able"
3728.76,3733.26, to visualize what's going to happen meaning that only on our side of the house we get that on that
3733.26,3737.34, kind of engagement but lastly what is else is unengaged we told you the structural reasons
3737.34,3741.6, of optimism bias and why that only happens under our side of the house that we're only able to
3741.6,3748.16," defeat them we told you about the optimism bias, a chronic lack in imagination. Check your notes panel. It is Nepal that has been unengaging in this debate"
3748.16,3752.34, and parallel when it comes to engagement. Why is this important then? Because we think on
3752.34,3757.26," proposition, by the time you're even able to get out of your privileged bubble, you're unable to"
3757.26,3762.78," act anymore because there's no more agency left for you to exercise. Under our side of the House,"
3762.84,3769.16, we think this is crucial insofar as we're able to inform people. Notice that proposition cannot say that we're going to have a terrible
3769.16,3774.12," circumstance and also have hope, because that is unrealistic. They have to choose one. Either they"
3774.12,3778.44," have a realistic depiction of some hope and activism status quo, so people actually relate"
3778.44,3782.56," to it and therefore they attain the benefits of hope, or they have a very unrealistic representation"
3782.56,3787.74," and that is only where you can depict the visceralities of government imposition that only we get to claim, meaning"
3787.74,3791.76, that we exclusively protect people against the most oppressive and worst kinds of governments.
3792.0,3795.68," But secondly, let's talk about society and the stakeholders outside activists. Number one,"
3795.94,3800.44, third proposition's case shift to say that the political value of entertainment is just to be
3800.44,3805.36, an escapist form already is damning for the entire case because if the politics is unimportant
3805.36,3810.32, in entertainment then why did proposition waste 16 minutes of speech telling you about how the media
3810.32,3814.48, is going to fix activists and help them like achieve political change right meaning that they
3814.48,3818.56, have to concede and third proposition speech was unimportant in this debate but secondly there was
3818.56,3823.04, no response to the third argument under our staff the house we told you about oppression uniquely
3823.04,3828.42," from the state and this is where we're more nuanced in our analysis, that the state's oppression is one that uniquely affects"
3828.42,3832.22, everybody. But it is for the most privileged who have never been able to conceptualize what
3832.22,3837.28," oppression means, they are unable to be mobilized. Since proposition tells you that mobilization is"
3837.28,3842.24," crucial to social change, we are ultimately able to pull up that. Insofar as we assume,"
3842.48,3845.28, most people become aware of the issues they have to be fighting for.
3845.28,3848.76, Proposition tells you you cannot fight. We tell you you don't know you have to fight.
3848.76,3879.14, We are the prerequisitely for verifying speech.
3879.14,3883.14, Now let's move on to invite the last speaker to conclude the entire debate.
3883.14,3910.0," Thank you. Okay, I'll be starting my speech in three, two, one."
3910.0,3918.0," Full strategic flaws that side opposition made in this debate. Firstly, their case is entirely based on desperation and anger that really points out,"
3918.0,3924.0, but they don't really materialize on what sort of impact that comes or change that comes in society in general.
3924.0,3928.9, We don't think we tell you how survival is something that's symmetric on either side. Hope is something
3928.9,3934.58," that's unique. But secondly, they literally strawman our case on nihilism when they say that,"
3934.82,3940.22," oh, just because of political fiction, there is no nihilism that really exists. But understand"
3940.22,3969.42," here, nihilism is something that's a major rhetoric of pop culture in everyday life. This is something we have pointed out from our first speech. It's not just this political fiction, but there are multiple other narratives in society that literally propagates nihilism to a greater extent, that promotes nihilism and, you know, hopelessness amongst people in general. their entire point on like how negative, watching negative fiction literally leads them to like,"
3969.8,3976.68," literally leads them to like, probably, the entire point of how watching negative fiction"
3976.68,3982.48," leads them to like going, leads them to like changing things and things as such, right? There"
3982.48,3990.08, is a massive logical gap there. We don't know how they're able to solve it but fourthly they say that state is something that's benevolent
3990.08,3994.72, and uh and something that's not supposed to be uh supposed to be questioned especially because
3994.72,4000.24, they are working in their first speech and in the third speech they go go and say that you know we
4000.24,4005.12, should not we should these states should be responsible instead of individuals there's a huge
4005.12,4010.66, contradiction in general three things to why we win this debate firstly on effectiveness of urgency
4010.66,4016.24, thirdly on community secondly on communities and thirdly on political inactions and climate in
4016.24,4021.8, general right firstly on effectiveness we tell you that hope is something that's extremely important
4021.8,4027.28, under our side they tell us us that survival and hopelessness
4027.28,4031.46, is an instinct that died in the visuals in order to work.
4031.46,4033.22, What we need to understand is that if there
4033.22,4036.14," is a mechanism to why hope does not work is something that's,"
4036.14,4039.56," oh, it's only like something that's going to be short term."
4039.56,4041.9," Understand that things like fare are also short term,"
4041.9,4044.36, or things like survival needs are also short term
4044.36,4050.56, to a massive amount of of cases especially because they have to let go but even
4050.56,4056.64, when let's say fair is something that's long lasting the need to actually feel hopeless and
4056.64,4062.88, not do anything is why is it not overwhelming over the need to actually bring change and things as
4062.88,4069.44, such they never prove to us why that happens we tell you that hope is unique under our side specifically because of
4069.44,4074.72, the fact that we're able to actually materialize these sort of incentives on different ways we
4074.72,4079.28, tell you that urgency and the fact that you know problems generally exist in society and are
4079.28,4084.08, propagated by activists because even in the absence of these fiction there are going to be other
4084.08,4085.28, mechanisms in society that are still going to be other mechanisms in society
4085.28,4087.02," that are still going to be present,"
4087.02,4089.38, because of which there is still a sense of urgency
4089.38,4090.86, that people feel in general.
4090.86,4094.72, This literally means that the distinction of optimism
4094.72,4097.08," is massively important to bring that form of hope,"
4097.08,4099.14, and that's going to be more effective.
4099.14,4102.06," But we also talk about how activism burnout,"
4102.96,4108.86," how activism burnout is something that's like, that's like massively occurs under their side, specifically"
4108.86,4113.68," when hopelessness is an increasing tendency. Under our side, this burnout is less likely"
4113.68,4118.16," to occur, specifically because they're hopeful about the future. We think that's massively"
4118.16,4122.46, important because that's what people like activists are facing right now because of
4122.46,4125.2, the massive tendency of like believing that there is
4125.2,4131.2," hopelessness in general. Secondly on community, we tell you why agency of individuals is something"
4131.2,4136.48," that we're able to prioritize, agency to bring change and all of these things that's likely to"
4136.48,4141.92, happen. But we also tell you that there is an intrinsic form of solidarity within the community
4141.92,4152.64, because there is no internal conflict and things as such it's like massively important the point to state is failure we basically show a better form of solvency but
4152.64,4158.16, thirdly on political inaction we tell you why this inaction is massively likely on your status quo
4158.16,4164.4, and things as such but it's like less likely under our world when we are able to question the state
4164.4,4165.74, or other mechanisms for these reasons for all those when we are able to question the state or other mechanisms
4165.74,4170.52," for these reasons. For all those reasons, we are very proud to stand on proposition. Thank you."
