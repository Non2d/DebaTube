0.0,4.0, I think I can record that.
4.0,5.0, Perfect.
5.0,7.24," All right, so let's start."
7.24,10.08, Let's welcome Prime Minister.
10.08,17.76, We shall eat after night.
17.76,19.76, Am I audible and visible?
19.76,21.76," Yeah, you are."
21.76,49.0," Okay, let me just set my timer and I'll start my speech in 321."
49.0,54.0," Hello, constantly viewing negative things tunes your mind to negative right?"
54.0,65.68," You know, while we are people view their government negatively, we need a way to push people closer to the governments right in order to create a more sustainable development right now what is political fiction in this"
65.68,70.24, instance right three issues yeah a this is when literature uses its capacity to comment on
70.24,75.84, political systems and theories i.e it can be expressed through books movies or like different
75.84,81.04, plays that actually perform this instances b it is it has a high viewership as it is a source of
81.04,85.04, entertainment to different groups of people and like a source of information
85.04,90.72, right this is like the children few cartoons and like novels and like voters to actually see who to
90.72,96.08, vote like how they actually vote right moving on secondly it can be based on current political
96.08,101.52, events past political events the future or even alternate world without necessarily portraying
101.52,105.88, what happened in those events but you you can pick some sort of inspiration
105.88,107.8," to make like these sorts of things, right?"
107.8,113.7, This debate is on whether fiction should take a positive outlook towards politics or a negative
113.7,114.7, outlook towards politics.
114.7,118.04, What is the impact of fiction on the lives of people?
118.04,121.56," First of all, due to like the high viewers it has, right?"
121.56,125.44, It has the power to create narratives that influence personal opinions and
125.44,130.32, like personal decisions like how we actually perceive our governments how we actually pursue
130.32,134.64, our governments how we relate to their governments secondly it has the power to influence public
134.64,139.44, opinion and how we perceive other groups in society that is to say groups that are affiliated
139.44,143.52, to the government groups that carry out voting processes and all those political things that
143.52,147.0, that is basically what it actually does on the different kinds of people.
147.0,149.0, Now let's look at politics in of itself.
149.0,158.0, Politics is a sector in the society that deals with governing how a particular system in a society actually works.
158.0,168.84, PANO basically makes decisions for people like politics or like different mandates on different things like drugs right now we have to understand the politics are here to stay and henceforth we
168.84,173.12, need to find ways to work with politics in order to create a more sustainable development
173.12,178.24, right panel not that in this debate today we do not take away negative and pessimistic
178.24,183.32, fiction right but we make majority of the fiction positive and optimistic so this is
183.32,185.2, a premise that's like negative
185.2,187.12, and actually venting and actually making
187.12,189.12," a particular case in this process, right?"
189.12,192.28," Now pardon, what does negative political fiction"
192.28,193.84, look like in of itself?
193.84,198.84," A, it looks like politicians always marginalizing."
199.28,202.12, It looks like how governments are always benefiting
202.12,204.56, themselves in decisions and the like corrupt
204.56,206.0, at that particular point in time.
206.0,213.0," It looks like expressing images of governments not giving people freedom of speech, governments killing people, governments silencing people, right?"
213.0,222.0," It looks like stereotypes, right? It looks like how politicians lie about opposition and politicians have praised what opposition actually says in the vast majority of instances, right?"
222.0,226.12," Now, what does positive political fiction actually look like"
226.12,227.22," at this instance, right?"
227.22,229.12, It looks like painting better images
229.12,231.0, of like different politicians
231.0,233.26," and like how like they tell people,"
233.26,235.14, like how they make policies that actually lead
235.14,236.9," to the development of the society, right?"
236.9,238.94," It looks like expressing governments that,"
238.94,240.62, expressing governments that allow people
240.62,242.26," to express themselves, right?"
242.26,244.74," People to express their alternative views,"
244.74,245.36," people to actually engage in what government policies they want, people to express themselves right people to express their alternative views people to actually"
245.36,250.16, engage in what government policies they want people to actually bring themselves out and
250.16,254.72, connect with like these different governments looks like good policies that politicians make
254.72,259.52, like let me say policies that help people get food policies that help people like get vaccinated
259.52,263.28, all those sorts of good policies that help like the government or like that help the different
263.28,268.6, people in the society well that is what positive political fiction actually looks like in the
268.6,273.24, vast majority of instances right now what is our case for today right i'm going to handle
273.24,289.0, a why trust is important in the development of the nation right secondly why we reduce reduced on the humanitarian crisis that would have arose due to the pessimistic views.
289.0,296.84," Secondly, our second subject is when to handle further analysis of how this is legitimate"
296.84,299.88, and how it actually makes for more sustainable development.
299.88,304.44," First of all, why trust is important in the development of a nation?"
304.44,325.6," We have to first understand what is trust, right? Trust is basically a form of belief, right? When you believe in someone, when you believe in a system, right, that you actually take in and like you believe in and like you actually denote what that system actually takes you right now when your governments are actually trusted right it's the policies"
325.6,330.8, actually run smoothly right it is easy for the government to run their policies smoothly
330.8,335.44, making right it is easy actually but when citizens of a nation actually trust their different
335.44,340.56, governments right now what do we see in their side of the house right their world has different
340.56,350.8, stereotypes right when people are constantly fed with negative points about the government like some sort of ideology that our governments are bad our governments are not here
350.8,354.0, to help us we're working these governments and they don't give us what we are supposed to get
354.0,358.96, right now basically even if one government member out of that 20 does something bad they are more
358.96,363.36, inclined and they are more likely to actually generalize their whole government as bad right
363.36,368.88, they generalize their government and they paint a bad image about their government so what does this particularly lead to
368.88,373.92, right it is harmful because citizens then start opposing their government right citizens then
373.92,377.68, start not following the things that the government actually put up to help them right at this
377.68,382.24, particular point in time citizens start abusing like their sorts of governments and they start
382.24,388.08, like promoting public discourse to go against like these sorts of governments right now that is particularly what their world actually
388.08,391.92, looks like but what does our world look like right we give them more good views it's not like we
391.92,396.72, separate it's not like we remove the bad views right then we give them more good views right
396.72,400.24, when we give them more good views majority of people are going to watch them and it's going
400.24,404.08, to create better correlation between the governments and the people because the government
404.08,408.24, the people actually able to understand what the different governments go through how these
408.24,412.24, different governments actually help them to do what they're supposed to do and like basically
412.24,416.96, how these governments actually serve to their people to like these different sorts of cartoons
416.96,422.16, and this is like more development because you trust and develop with trust and like better
422.16,425.04, working conditions you can develop your nation for a better cause
425.04,430.46, secondly in their world hope is reduced right when one is pessimistic right they believe that
430.46,434.6, worst will always happen they do not believe that their gamut can actually work right now why is
434.6,438.96, this particularly harmful and why does it arise because you've given them pessimistic views right
438.96,446.96, if there was no hope right people would live careless lives right People would live lives and they won't vote for people who
446.96,448.9, actually are worthy of these things.
448.9,450.12, That's what we see in the world.
450.12,452.48," They vote for people just because they're supposed to vote,"
452.48,454.04, but they do not vote for these people
454.04,455.9, because they know that these people are going to work.
455.9,457.1," Because they know, after all, these people"
457.1,457.94," aren't going to work for these people,"
457.94,459.32, they're not going to do some other things.
459.32,460.88, This is usually implemented in their head.
460.88,462.3," And basically, people don't actually"
462.3,463.82, hold their governments accountable
463.82,467.36, because they do not see the use of holding things that do not actually work out for them right
467.36,471.84, they have a very negative outlook on life and a negative outlook on this day different governments
471.84,476.8, right secondly in our world hopeful and confident we actually talk full and confident about the
476.8,480.96, government that is to say we give our trust and we hope that they actually work for us and this
480.96,487.6, basically pushes these governments to like come and like they work for us it pushes these governments to come and like they fulfill the policies that they
487.6,490.82, were supposed to fulfill because they see there are cities that actually want them to
490.82,494.24, fulfill them and they actually want to be voted back into power by these citizens to
494.24,498.12, actually trust them right why are humanitarian crises reduced on our side right in their
498.12,502.7, world people revolt against governments because they see only the negative outlook on like
502.7,506.26, these different sorts of governments right right? Basically these governments respond
506.26,508.54, by shutting down these people.
508.54,510.24," Like in Uganda, they actually take you,"
510.24,511.46, they beat you up.
516.02,517.3," Because you have actually,"
517.3,519.68," let's take a look of China, right?"
520.68,523.6," China neglects the citizens, beats them up, right?"
523.6,525.16," We see less public discourse,"
525.16,526.92, and we see these governments are less likely
526.92,529.32," to come and commit humanitarian crises,"
529.32,533.92," like gas sites and all those sorts of things, right?"
533.92,536.76," We go for a while, which actually gives the citizens"
536.76,539.6, the better pessimistic ideologies and hope
539.6,542.24, in their government for more sustainable development
542.24,543.24, for their governments.
546.0,548.0," All right, I thank the speaker for the speech."
548.0,578.24," Let's welcome Lira Afaf. My speech starts in three, two, one."
582.24,587.5, I'll start things off by saying that not everything that happens in this world is easy.
587.8,590.18," If you want to get things done, you work hard."
590.26,594.42, You have to shed blood and tears to make things work if you want to get a good and proper job or else.
595.58,600.06," So if you want things to go the easy way, you're never making it to this world."
600.28,601.98," That's why I'm here, to give you a reality check."
602.3,605.0," If the political fiction is positive and optimistic, it's all false."
605.0,607.0, Politics isn't all about that.
607.0,609.0, How do you think America became the strongest country?
609.0,610.0, Through strong and powerful choices.
610.0,611.0, Hence politics.
611.0,615.0, The world can be a dark place filled with gore and greed.
615.0,616.0, That's politics.
616.0,619.0," Before I get to Marge, I have three rebuttals."
619.0,622.0, You're stating that political fiction went positive.
622.0,627.62," You're stating that political fiction went when positive, they have powerful opinions."
627.9,630.42," Let me remind you that it doesn't need to be powerful, but needs to be true."
630.76,631.88, Those are two different words.
632.48,636.24," You also stated that political fiction, when negative, has negative benefits."
636.76,640.12," I mean, the negative side basically is the truth."
640.54,644.76," The reality of the side, I mean, I'm trying to give you the reality of the things right now."
644.98,645.5," Also, you didn't of the things right now."
645.5,648.18," Also, you didn't say the specific types of negative benefits."
648.18,653.44, So I would like the second speaker to state the negative benefits of the negative side.
653.44,658.02, You're also saying that they have a negative outlook.
658.02,661.76," If it's negative, it doesn't mean it's true."
661.76,667.04," Start off with, I have three words to define. Political fiction."
667.04,672.44," Political fiction uses storytelling to comment on current events, political structures and"
672.44,673.44, theories.
673.44,678.02," Political novels, for example, frequently directly critique a current society and depict"
678.02,680.46," an alternate, even fancier reality."
680.46,684.5," Definition two, pessimistic."
684.5,691.74," It is a negative mental attitude in which an unfavorable outcome from a particular scenario is predicted, which in our side is the right side."
692.24,706.0," Definition three, propaganda. Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may or may not even be an objective. objective and may include selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or"
706.0,711.84, or perception or using loaded language to elicit an emotion rather than a rational response to the
711.84,718.56, information being used so where's our stance our stance is we oppose the uh we oppose the status
718.56,723.44, quo of having a world where majority fossil fiction should be a positive and optimistic
723.44,730.64, rather than pessimistic and negative we don't need and negative. We do not need to provide and counter factual or not told of
730.64,735.12, all we need to do is prove you why pessimism in political news should be encouraged.
736.24,741.04," Before I move on to our first arguments in today's debate, what are the principal parameters within"
741.04,749.04," this debate to take place? First argument, it will give people a sense of reality more realistic and prevent giving viewers readers false hope which"
749.04,754.0, you which you stated that that false hope is a good thing uh but but but i but i counter that
754.96,758.96, which i will explain uh throughout this debate it can reduce propaganda influence
759.6,764.48, so it will give people sense of uh so the first argument has three routes to this the first route
764.48,769.92, help people think more objectively helps people uh think more objectively rather than subjectively
770.88,775.6, reality check is basically on an occasion is an occasion on which uh one is reminded of the state
775.6,780.56, of things in the real world like like you can't uh you know in mental hospitals and the kind of stuff
780.56,790.0, they're all they're all out of their mind so they gotta get a reality check most likely uh using this analogy just like on this type of debate second when reading or watching
790.0,795.68, a movie uh uh per uh when reading or watching a movie a person's mind is mostly focused on that
795.68,800.0, specific type of movie and this generation that can make a lot of things uh look real so you're
800.0,806.4, going to give them fake political fiction because not all politics is easy and optimistic. They can
806.4,815.52," also be hard and maybe some people can't take that type of heat. Third of all, the ability to"
815.52,820.96, distinguish between reality and fiction in one's own thoughts is an important aspect of development.
822.32,825.52, Errors in thinking that can influence the ability to distinguish
825.52,828.5, between a reality and fictions and one's own stars is an important aspect of the
828.5,832.0, development errors and thinking can influence behavior and lead to anxiety
832.0,835.72, yeah reality testing highlights the importance of recognizing common errors
835.72,841.76, and one's thinking and correcting them Ruby the dangers of false hope you
841.76,866.62," stated that false hope can lead lead have powerful opinions, these leaders that you stated, but you didn't, like, they give out false hope to the parents, you know,"
866.86,869.3," their son is going to be fine, but could end up dead, you know."
869.76,873.44," False hope can change one's confidence and is mostly a big mistake with doctors, you know."
874.48,877.92," In novels and movies, there's a lot of false hope where the president promises something"
877.92,878.86, but doesn't deliver.
879.68,882.4, That's mostly where it happens and where it starts.
882.4,885.12, The negative side is basically what we're trying to
885.12,892.0, give the uh we're trying to make you see the things that that you cannot see because because
892.0,896.0, of all this uh negative and optimistic so the future is gonna be great the future is gonna be
896.0,901.28, right i mean you don't see the world today where it's mostly not sustainable like even the world
901.92,907.42," right now you know with political readers and that kind of stuff they're trying to figure out you know global warming and all that kind of stuff, they're trying to figure out global warming and all that kind of stuff."
907.72,909.46, They're all trying to figure out one and one only thing.
918.28,923.66," Building a bigger infrastructure, a more sustainable life."
923.8,925.8, That's what they're all trying to do.
927.12,930.76, All this to say that public change should be negative and not optimistic
930.76,934.12, because what this can do is create false hope.
934.44,938.24," Have you ever heard of the phrase, new tomorrow, or a bright future is ahead?"
938.68,943.82," That's what basically trying to give hope for the people,"
943.82,947.08, but maybe the hope cannot hope could not cannot be right
947.08,953.9, for them uh route c how it helps people change their ideas and possibly make uh make or promote
953.9,959.52, if the political fiction is wrong then it will influence others to listen to the wrong like
959.52,966.24, like if someone states that that could be wrong then that that kind of person will understand what's
966.24,972.16, wrong because like if they think throw i've said that uh reality check you know creates wrong
972.88,975.76, before getting into before i get ahead any pois
979.44,988.0," all right thank you um he's talking a lot about reality check. Now, we're wondering, do you believe in making a conducive environment for the work of the"
988.0,994.0," government, or would you rather leave impediments that can actually be removed?"
994.0,996.0, Can you repeat?
996.0,1003.0, You spoke about the American struggle.
1003.0,1011.0, You characterized a struggling environment whereby somebody triumphs too. Do you believe in removing impediments that would be removable?
1011.0,1026.82," It can be removable because in America, in America basically what happened was that it was basically a weak country back then in the day, like 1800s. They fought many wars. This is the reality of it. Not what I'm trying to take it that it's just politics,"
1026.82,1028.34, basically just filled with war and greed.
1028.34,1030.46," That's the world, that's the reality."
1032.72,1034.12," That's my speech, thank you."
1038.04,1039.64," All right, I think this will be cover the fine speech."
1039.64,1041.2," Let's welcome DPM, thank you."
1042.54,1043.94," That's my speech, yeah."
1048.32,1052.88," Thank you, my name is um we're pronounced as sheep"
1054.16,1059.28, i think they disconnected
1068.0,1072.4, uh okay let's wait up to five minutes i think i'm back oh yes i'm back um
1073.52,1079.04, i'm sorry for that
1085.04,1091.92, all right um i'm trying to get serious okay let's see the divinity of my name is zepa nice we should be starting in five four three two one hannah fiction is unreal fiction is
1091.92,1097.68, very unreal in this debate we concede to impact of expression and we accept people's ideas but we
1097.68,1102.16, also focus on the power of our voice and the power of our narrative you see in this debate we're
1102.16,1108.64," wondering what is the impact of our voice a voice voice that can make you, can break you, can change your mindset and the way you think."
1108.64,1114.0, We are crafted by what we had as children from when we were born. So we find out how real the
1114.0,1118.32," narrative we tell is highly crucial, especially in today's day and era. First I'm going to"
1118.32,1122.56, characterize the situation that we're in. The situation of the movie industry which was
1122.56,1128.48, characterized in the info slide is that they have real life experiences because their families are the most profitable they're looking at high
1128.48,1132.8, emphasis on historically accurate situations what do i mean by this they're going to say that
1132.8,1139.28, situation a can lead to situation b b may lead to c c could probably lead to d and then i'll conclude
1139.28,1143.68, that a leads to d but when i'm realizing this figure that this takes a more conspiracy theory
1143.68,1148.32," kind of time and a under no circumstances can lead D. So by using facts, they make people"
1148.32,1152.78, believe situations that aren't there. When you pair such a mindset with adding high end
1152.78,1156.76," actors who are perfect at creating illusions that don't exist, as well as technology such"
1156.76,1162.0," as 3D, 4D, even 7D technology these days, you realize that this is not a safe world"
1162.0,1168.88, to be putting people in because it's an alter our mindset. What's the next thing we realize in this debate? We realize that it yields a question.
1168.88,1173.96, Can human beings actually resist the mindset in that an inception actually exists in a modern day world?
1173.96,1179.4," We realize that yes, it does. In a coronavirus pandemic, people are known to carry out some people doom scrolling,"
1179.4,1183.96," whereby they continuously read information, true or untrue, and they were practically addicted to it."
1183.96,1188.96, They follow such information. so people actually gain interest a lot of people ended up getting no self-esteem
1188.96,1194.32, no mental health because of such situations so realize that it is actually very possible in this
1194.32,1199.04, debate now what's the worst case scenario panel we have to actually say now what's the scenario
1199.04,1205.68, in today's debate we see that one can't identify in this fiction who the bad person is. So it's fictional.
1205.84,1206.66, There are no real names.
1206.82,1207.74, You don't know if it's a senator.
1207.88,1209.34, You don't know which member of Congress it is.
1209.54,1214.02, So you tend to generalize the whole government rather than identifying one particular person.
1214.26,1215.72, So you don't know who the problem is.
1215.74,1217.82, So you generalize everyone else as an issue.
1218.08,1219.04, So what's our case approach?
1219.3,1221.84," First, we have two disclaimers."
1222.0,1225.84," One, we do not, the narrative the narrative is supporting our world in that we"
1225.84,1231.68, offer a reduction in negativity one because this negativity is entering a past place and yet it has
1231.68,1237.04, an effect so we tend to offer a reduction in such negativity but not removing it completely because
1237.04,1242.4, we believe in expression we believe in opinions coming but secondly we encourage non-fiction what
1242.4,1245.8, do i mean by this non Nonfiction is purely researched information
1245.8,1248.36, whereby one is so confident in such information
1248.36,1251.18," that they can include actual names, actual sites,"
1251.18,1253.86," actual resources, whereby they prove these situations."
1253.86,1255.42," They've been written on President Putin,"
1255.42,1257.16," they've been written on Biden, Trump,"
1257.16,1258.72, and we accept such information.
1258.72,1261.2," But in a case that this is something somebody dreamed out,"
1261.2,1262.82," in fact, it could probably be something someone had"
1262.82,1268.54," in a dream and the exact same is as reality, we feel because of its strong effect. It should not be considered"
1268.54,1274.3," as much as honest, good opinions in today's world for the issues characterised in today's"
1274.3,1279.5," debates. Now, we recognise three stakeholders. First of all, the government and the army"
1279.5,1283.5," themselves. You realise that we recognise these people putting a lot of effort, a lot"
1283.5,1289.76, of knowledge into running the country a particular way you can imagine sending off your husband in the army to fight
1289.76,1294.4, a war and then him being characterized as a double agent and traitor to the government that would make
1294.4,1298.08, you feel right when you put out a sacrifice and instead consider and that's what we are considering
1298.08,1303.2, is the bed the workers who put in a lot of effort and then they are summarized as a whole as false
1303.2,1305.04, people but secondly the people their
1305.04,1309.28, mental state and stamina even just from kobe 19 cannot be further ruptured by the current status
1309.28,1313.04, quo of a dominant mindset saying that the government is against us all the time because
1313.04,1318.0, this is the time most things they need to take so you can't tune somebody's mind to identify only
1318.0,1330.24, the negatives they watch the news a child has died oh no it's the government a drug war is going on no the government's actually support
1334.0,1337.6, you know what i read this book i watched this movie where by the government is against people or a new bill that they don't like and automatically blame the government such a
1337.6,1342.96, cycle of negativity can't be incorporated in today's world it's very dangerous and you cannot
1342.96,1348.24, take out literally somebody's eyes and then later on reproach them for being blind because if that's what people are always seeing
1348.24,1352.16, it's eventually going to become their general mindset in today's debate now what's our rebuttal
1352.16,1356.32, we don't say in this debate why would you actually encourage more negative media to be put in
1356.32,1360.88, it's imaginary and it's impactful those are two dangerous things in today's debate in today's
1360.88,1365.2, debate so first of all they brought that case of easy decisions whereby they said a
1365.2,1370.8, reality check world is full of wars and this is being characterized as a world today's debate is
1370.8,1375.52, a war whereby the negative media should exist i mean that's an environment that people have dealt
1375.52,1379.92, with before but to realize just because someone has overcome a dangerous environment doesn't mean
1379.92,1383.28, they should continue to be putting themselves in dangerous environments especially when it's
1383.28,1388.16, a dangerous environment you can actually control as an individual we see that we believe in removing
1388.16,1393.84, what is removable fix what is fixable don't kill a person with cancer treat them remove that flow
1393.84,1398.72, and keep living your life we see another case where they talk about how powerful opinions are
1398.72,1403.84, true they criticize some of these fictional ideas that's true but no panel none of them are true no
1403.84,1405.44, writer of a fictional book can come forward and explain panel none of them are true no writer of a fictional book can
1405.44,1411.28, come forward and explain that our information is actually true no if it was true you don't
1411.28,1415.28, categorize it as non-fiction and actually would have generated a higher market because people are
1415.28,1420.4, more interested in what's the truth that's why they work with reality but to realize that fiction
1420.4,1424.88, is not real that's we think it should not be a premise in this debate we feel like it should not
1424.88,1428.4, be a premise actually in the debate of the world in a way people think in their mindsets and
1428.4,1433.28, decision-making process but then again the benefits of our model our first thing about is our benefits
1433.28,1439.04, of our model has a better mindset hope and trust inside in people whereby people are more comfortable
1439.04,1442.96, with their government they stop looking at them as false people they encourage to look at the values
1442.96,1445.58," of the education they brought up, the wars they are fighting,"
1445.58,1446.82, the countries they are helping.
1446.82,1450.34, Less of the false ideas whereby they felt at one point
1450.34,1452.92, in such a time the government did this one thing.
1452.92,1455.9, I explained how some of these cases are historically accurate
1455.9,1459.16, in that they follow actual back in the day formation.
1459.16,1461.84, They can take the assassination of our president
1461.84,1465.52, and say a whole web of activities that surrounded it and if
1465.52,1469.24, you like this isn't fair people shouldn't be overthinking and generating anxiety where
1469.24,1472.9, it shouldn't even be in the first place but then hope and trust in our government whereby
1472.9,1477.8, we encourage a group of people who actually have a proper amount of faith in their government
1477.8,1481.72, because our government is trustworthy not everyone in the thousands of people in our
1481.72,1488.8, government infrastructure can be bad if they were there are certain organizations and bodies in check who are supposed to be working these out not the
1488.8,1494.56, overactive mind of a citizen at night and not the mind of a movie writer in the middle of his
1494.56,1508.0, writing session basically so i'll take any pois at this point um there was a poI from the Prime Minister. Is there any POI?
1508.0,1513.0," All right. Conclusively in this debate, we have a case of two worlds."
1513.0,1525.12," One is a world whereby we can allow imaginary and impactful information to keep on dominating the media, to keep on dominating our mindsets and ideas in daily society and we have another world whereby we are looking at"
1525.12,1530.64, a combination of honest opinions whether honest or not but true opinions good opinions opinions
1530.64,1534.48, that are not going to possible to generate rare psychological problems because they are thinking
1534.48,1539.04, of unreal items we are looking at the value of stakeholders such as the governments and armies
1539.04,1542.88, in today's status quo we are looking at the contribution of these people but i would like
1542.88,1545.28, to end this debate if you're going to forget everything I've said
1545.28,1546.58," in today's debate,"
1546.58,1548.98, let's acknowledge citizens for our government.
1548.98,1551.62," Citizens can react to what the government,"
1551.62,1553.88," they can react to the status quo said by government,"
1553.88,1556.04," they can riot, they can go against them."
1556.04,1557.56, Why are we putting these on them?
1557.56,1561.06," Panel, impact and imagination are two things"
1561.06,1563.76," that should never coexist in today's society,"
1563.76,1564.76," in today's debate,"
1564.76,1565.38," especially in the rise of social media, are two things that should never coexist in today's society, in today's debate, especially"
1565.38,1570.0," in the rise of social media, whereby information can be spread in no time."
1570.0,1574.9, I conclude this debate by saying Said Affirmative has definitely won this debate.
1574.9,1575.9, Thank you very much.
1575.9,1579.38, I thank the speaker for the fine speech.
1579.38,1583.38, Now let's welcome Dio.
1583.38,1589.48, Am I seen and heard?
1590.38,1590.96," Yeah, you are."
1591.98,1592.46, Okay.
1592.94,1597.1," So I am going to start in three, two, one."
1599.38,1606.88, People tend to like having positive views rather than negative and pessimistic views.
1607.4,1614.18, Because and only because it encourages people to be more positive and in some cases unrealistic.
1615.32,1620.74, This can put people down by making them think that they are capable of doing something they aren't.
1621.72,1622.32, Rebuttals.
1622.32,1623.1, First speaker.
1623.34,1628.5," As the proposition team come in good faith, the first speaker is implementing that."
1628.5,1639.16, They are not taking away negative or pessimistic views when that is what the motion says and that is what they should be proposing to.
1639.52,1645.18, They should be proposing that they should remove these negative and pessimistic views when they are
1645.18,1651.04, not. And the second speaker has not spoken about the related topic in my point of view
1651.04,1660.34, basically for me to rebut on but has actually said some points to solidify our points. Now
1660.34,1666.5, onto my argument. Points to talk about and focus here.
1666.5,1673.38," Firstly, we're going to start with root A. If propaganda was negative and pessimistic,"
1673.38,1676.68, less people are eager to be influenced by it.
1676.68,1683.24, It won't encourage a particular synthesis or perception and will also show the reality
1683.24,1684.28, of things.
1684.28,1687.82, This is one of our strong points in this debate.
1687.82,1690.66, Propaganda is basically the communication
1690.66,1695.66, that is primarily used to influence
1695.78,1700.06," or persuade an audience to further an agenda,"
1700.06,1703.78, which may or may not be objective
1703.78,1713.84," and may include selectively presenting fact to encourage a particular synthesis or perception,"
1713.84,1725.0," or using loaded language to elicit an emotion rather than rational response, the information being presented."
1725.0,1727.36, Point number two.
1727.36,1733.0, Propaganda is widely known to be encouraging and somewhat positive.
1733.0,1737.78, It's the factors that make it deceive people.
1737.78,1743.82," Take an example of World War II, the famous We Can Do It by Westinghouse."
1743.82,1746.12, It was meant to be positive and encouraging.
1746.6,1749.92, Now let's say it is put in a pessimistic way.
1750.44,1753.1, Don't you think that they will have less influence on people?
1753.7,1756.12, This is an example of a harmless propaganda.
1756.76,1759.12," However, if the same logic was applied"
1759.12,1761.84," to be a more influential propaganda,"
1761.84,1766.16, do you think people will follow it if it's not the reality?
1766.16,1769.34, I personally don't think so.
1769.34,1770.34, Point number two.
1770.34,1776.36, It is simply showing the real situation with a filter like the book that is in the motion
1776.36,1779.64," as an example, 1984."
1779.64,1787.52, It was published in 1949 where the novel explains the negative effect of a person who went to a party
1787.52,1793.6, and so on and he didn't like and so the the basically what happened in the story is that
1793.6,1799.36, they they didn't show the right side of the story the reason why it's a good thing to reduce
1799.36,1808.12," propaganda though propaganda is a potent weapon in conflict. In certain circumstances, it is used to dehumanize"
1808.12,1815.94," and instill hatred against a perceived adversary, whether internal or foreign, by instilling a false"
1815.94,1827.66, image in the minds of troops and populations. Point number three. One story might change if the story is portrayed in a positive matter.
1828.22,1833.68," For example, there is a Netflix documentary that goes by the name El Chapo."
1834.34,1847.26," This Netflix documentary is a story of a drug cartel who sell drugs in Mexico. His story was portrayed not,"
1847.26,1850.04, I'm not saying that it was portrayed positively
1850.04,1853.22," by any means, I'm saying that it wasn't portrayed right."
1853.22,1856.16, This is one of the effects that can happen
1856.16,1860.36, if you try to portray everything positively
1860.36,1861.82, and encouragingly.
1861.82,1864.46," So if the story was put to the point,"
1864.46,1868.36," it will come to your knowing, but"
1868.36,1877.4, actually Netflix sued El Chapo for not being to the point. Here I will tell you. It is a story
1877.4,1886.56," of drug cartel El Chapo who sell drugs in Mexico. His story was portrayed not necessarily positively, but the story was portrayed to look"
1886.56,1895.28, better in the eyes of the viewer. Is the show El Chapo accurate? The Netflix drama show explored
1895.28,1907.76," the lives of the notorious El Chapo Guzman, but did most of the events depicted happen in real life uh the way the way they did in the"
1907.76,1917.36, series did not most of most of the developments on the show and series do not most of you most
1917.36,1929.76," of you hear uh that sorry okay most of the developments on the show are historically accurate. Most, so not all."
1929.76,1938.12," This led to the wife of a child pursuing Netflix but not getting much out of it. Most of, you"
1938.12,1947.0," hear that, but not all of. Some people who watch the series still do not know about the reality of the series."
1947.0,1956.0, False hope is an argument that the first speaker of the proposition team had mentioned.
1956.0,1960.0, Yeah. So false hope is shown in most of these series around the world.
1960.0,1965.04, And this is showing people that they can do something that is unrealistic which
1965.04,1970.24, might affect their lives if they are not capable do i have any pois
1976.72,1986.32, anyone do you feel that um propaganda happens on our side alone or does it also happen on your side?
1992.08,1999.68," Propaganda happens on both sides. You cannot ask this question because I think it is not too relevant because propaganda happens in both sides of the story, in both sides of our world because"
1999.68,2005.12, it is something that can affect the negative and positive side at the same time.
2006.18,2013.24," And, uh, yeah, that is the end of my, uh, argument and I am proud to oppose."
2019.1,2019.32, All right.
2019.32,2030.8, I think the speaker for the fine speech let's welcome government work
2034.32,2047.0," hi everyone my name is So I'm going to start my speech in three, two, one."
2047.0,2053.74," The anger cannot be given to one man, right?"
2053.74,2055.74," So okay, no."
2055.74,2061.24," Let's first look at what opposition brings to this debate, right?"
2061.24,2070.24," First of all, they analyze the argument in their first speech as you know reducing propaganda right right but let's first you know they talk about propaganda as how"
2070.24,2076.8, it will be reduced on their side of access no analysis here they talk about you know uh like
2076.8,2088.02," they gave an example of a drug cartel in mexico right al chap right, but how they were portrayed positively even in the eyes of the"
2088.02,2090.14, you are even though they are committed in your strength.
2090.14,2093.56, But let's analyze that there was no kind of explanation
2093.56,2095.62, on how this benefits in this debate.
2095.62,2097.44, There was no linkage on how it affects
2097.44,2099.12, any kind of stakeholders in this debate.
2099.12,2101.9, There was no linkage to any specific point
2101.9,2103.26, in this particular debate.
2103.26,2106.18," So now when you ask them a POI on the point of propaganda,"
2106.42,2107.46, what did they tell us?
2107.62,2110.34, They told us that propaganda happens on both sides.
2110.72,2112.48, So they consider the fact that propaganda
2112.48,2113.7, also happens on their side of the case.
2113.9,2115.22, But let's not confuse ourselves.
2115.48,2117.54, Let's just understand what propaganda means.
2117.98,2121.32," Information, especially of a bias or misdemeanor,"
2121.74,2126.96, used to promote a political cause or point of view
2126.96,2132.16, right so why do we feel that there's actually more propaganda on the other side of the case right
2132.16,2139.36, but when you have a kind of uh uh when you kind of promote a kind of fiction in in in in in society
2139.36,2145.5," right a negative fiction right you find that even though fiction is untrue, it has the ability"
2145.5,2150.16," to influence a lot of people, right? A lot of people take it up to be, you know, kind"
2150.16,2156.52," of real because, you know, they believe that the books have, they attach significant values"
2156.52,2161.24," to these particular books that we read, right? So what happens here is that it creates a"
2161.24,2171.32," kind of stereotype about these particular politicians in society, right? So this stereotype may not necessarily be untrue, but there are only one side of"
2171.32,2178.54," the story, right? So it's not a complete truth. So you find that people are going to not trust"
2178.54,2183.04," politicians, aka the government, they're going to have a kind of biasness towards governments."
2183.04,2186.18," This is a kind of propaganda that's promoted towards,"
2186.18,2187.9," you know, politicians in this debate."
2187.9,2190.7," So you find that on the other side of the case,"
2190.7,2193.26," they are trying to promote a kind of, you know, negative,"
2193.26,2196.36," they kind of remove any kind of negative, sorry,"
2196.36,2198.4, they try to remove any kind of positive
2198.4,2200.7, or optimistic ideology.
2200.7,2204.3," They are promoting a world where politicians are,"
2204.3,2210.0," they are promoting a world where politicians are regarded as what? As negative individuals,"
2210.0,2217.0," right? And this particularly harms that. Why? Because governments, right? Governments who are looking towards protecting,"
2217.0,2221.0," sorry, to provide for their citizens, right? Through the social contract theory."
2221.0,2229.36," It's very difficult because, you know, when you're providing policies and making laws you need to have a kind of collaborations with the people you're working with"
2229.36,2233.68, say for example there's a kind of conflict existing in society you need to work hand in
2233.68,2238.08, hand with the system to identify what the problem is but with the kind of values that exist people
2238.08,2243.68, will not look to uh to their government for any kind of source of health or security there are
2243.68,2249.1, other local alternative ways what does this look like like? You see people joining gangs to try to protect
2249.1,2253.6, themselves because they no longer feel that they have trust in their government to protect
2253.6,2261.54, them. What happens here is it leads to gang-related violence where kids are made to join a particular
2261.54,2266.24, gang in order to protect themselves. So in the event that you are trying to join a particular gang in order to protect themselves so in the event that you know
2266.24,2271.36, that's that you are trying to remove any kind of positivity from society you find that on cyber
2271.36,2277.28, position case it's going to actually harm majorly children that's therefore that in the debate it's
2277.28,2286.72, going to harm citizens of our country because in a longer field uh the need to trust governance then moving on they talk about how you know it's uh it
2286.72,2293.28, took about how we need to establish right the ability to distinct to distinguish what is you
2293.28,2297.6, know reality from what is fantasy you know like the truth outside of the case like some kind of
2297.6,2307.28, fantasy that you know promoting a kind of positive outlook is actually detrimental but let me do this by saying that having hope in something does not
2307.28,2313.28, mean that you know it is uh it is a kind of a fruitless event right you know they talk about how
2313.28,2320.24, uh and they quote you know uh like uh promoting also that a bright future is ahead but let's
2320.24,2325.8," analyze the problems of having no hope at all, right? Having no trust in your government at all"
2325.8,2328.72, and thinking that the world is full of chaos and so forth.
2328.86,2331.26, You're going to find individuals no longer caring
2331.26,2333.26," in any kind of democratic citizen, right?"
2333.44,2337.24," You find people not caring to vote, right?"
2337.36,2339.84, Making decisions that are going to benefit them.
2339.94,2340.04, Why?
2340.2,2342.28, Because they have that generalized ideology
2342.28,2344.96, that everyone in their government is corrupt.
2345.12,2350.8, Everyone in their government is very unfair and biased. So you find that individuals are
2350.8,2355.36, no longer going to care about who they got in power because they believe all politicians are
2355.36,2360.64, going to be that particular way. So you find that even in the event that you want to remove any kind
2360.64,2365.68," of bias, to remove any kind of ideology that politicians any kind of you know that ideology that that politicians are good"
2365.68,2371.12, you're going to find it needed to more corruption because you are not making any kind of informed
2371.12,2378.48, decision in society and then secondly when this when you promote this kind of ideology that these
2378.48,2383.36, people are negative that person negative you have to also analyze how it affects this particular
2383.36,2385.04, individual in in particular you're
2385.04,2390.32, going to find people attacking you know because like they have that mindset of how you know that
2390.32,2396.0, every politician is somehow negative or negatively affects your development economic social you know
2396.0,2401.28, political development that it it's always the problem of the politicians so you find here
2401.28,2405.38," that there's going to be a lot of backers and politicians who, in other"
2405.38,2410.44," words, had nothing to do with, you know, had nothing or actually have nothing to do with"
2410.44,2412.66, corruption and actually trained for more good and success.
2412.96,2417.2," But because of this, they are going to be actually deterred away from joining these"
2417.2,2423.24," political roles, which even gives a new way for negative individuals, for people who don't"
2423.24,2427.2," care at all, who only make profit and actually making money, who don't care at all who only meant l is you know profit and"
2427.2,2431.28, actually making money who don't care because you know the righteous individuals feel like oh well
2431.28,2436.08, look here my work i'm trying to do something good here but since you're treating me this way even
2436.08,2440.64, though i'm trying to do something good yeah let me just maybe you know you know let me go away
2440.64,2446.76, so people are going to it's going to cause more people like very bad individuals to join
2446.76,2452.0," those kinds of, you know, policies and then it's going to come, you know."
2452.0,2453.0, Yeah.
2453.0,2456.76," So what side position first analyze is the debate, right?"
2456.76,2461.4," So they argue that in our side of the debate, we want to promote a kind of society where"
2461.4,2464.3," we remove all kinds of, you know, negativity."
2464.3,2465.92," But Pando, let me read it for you"
2465.92,2471.52, because cyber opposition has failed to understand that it prefers a world where majority of
2471.52,2478.4, political uh fiction is positive and um optimistic right we are promoting one majority not necessarily
2478.4,2486.68, removing all kinds of negativity but panel we are promoting a world where the majority of it is positive so that we can have a more
2486.68,2492.5, impactful society to the stakeholders aka the government and its citizens. Unlike the
2492.5,2497.5, world where we have a majority being negative which then harms society in the ways I've
2497.5,2503.8," explained in this debate. But what do we prove in our debate? Number one, we prove the dangers"
2503.8,2511.68," of not having any kind of particular hope in our development as a country or a developing country in Uganda,"
2511.68,2517.64, by believing that everything is always going to be harmful or wrong about our political system.
2517.64,2526.16," And then secondly, we prove the importance, right, in our case of having hope having hope right of having trust in and and and and"
2526.16,2531.44, in our government right in the event that even though some politicians are corrupt we still show
2531.44,2537.04, you how it is important you know to have a certain kind of hope and then hardly we prove that the
2537.04,2542.72, kind of vastness that happens on their side of the case towards a generalized way of like uh showing
2542.72,2546.0, how all politicians are going to be biased in some particular way or type.
2546.0,2552.0," So in these reasons, I beg to raise by saying that site proposition clearly takes this to the next."
2555.36,2625.64," Well, I think the speaker for this speech must welcome Alcon Snowwood. Thank you. Is up here. Right, one, two, three. Hello, ladies and gentlemen."
2626.08,2629.22," In today's debate, we, as Team Opposition,"
2629.76,2632.72, have presented you with our argument regarding the motion.
2633.06,2636.5, This whole refers a world where a majority of political faction
2636.5,2641.52," is positive and optimistic, e.g. Wingwest, etc.,"
2641.52,2644.36," rather than negative, with us taking the negative side"
2644.36,2647.82, and preferring to have majority of negative
2647.82,2651.7," and pessimistic nobles rather than their bear,"
2651.7,2654.5, which is the positive and optimistic.
2654.5,2657.14, And we have presented you as the opposition team
2657.14,2659.82, with some arguments that proves that the majority
2659.82,2662.78, of state factions should be negative
2662.78,2664.76, for everyone's sake and enjoyment.
2667.12,2674.88," As we know, politics have been and will always be a sensitive topic around the people when they try to and people try"
2674.88,2707.0," to avoid as much as possible unless there is no other way for them so when the first fraction of political faction came out in the betrothal in the 18s, it was quite the shock, it was quite the new thing, it was quite the wave that came to them as it spoke boldly about the political side and whatnot."
2708.0,2725.72, All right. And we believe as the opposition side that there should be majority of negative content that is dedicated towards this topic. speaker had stated and claimed was that the novels or shows will give people a sense of
2725.72,2733.24, reality more realistic and very and prevent giving viewers and readers or everyone else
2733.24,2740.24, false hope in our desired world by giving people a roof of expectation to what and how
2740.24,2746.0, does the Baltic... What? Point of information.
2746.0,2748.0, All right.
2748.0,2750.0, Amir Said
2750.0,2752.0, characterizes negative media
2752.0,2754.0, as honest media. You talk about
2754.0,2756.0, documentaries. Are you aware that documentaries
2756.0,2758.0, are non-fiction?
2758.0,2760.0, Most honest media is non-fiction
2760.0,2762.0," and this debate is about fiction, imagination"
2762.0,2764.0, basically.
2764.0,2765.6, All right. I'll answer that later on. this debate is about fiction imagination basically
2769.76,2770.72, all right love through that later on now to continue with what i have been saying
2775.68,2789.32, the in our desire where we're giving people a roof of expectation to what and how does the political field look like slash works like we are given a much more realistic view on the subject matter because politics has never been easy or optimistic
2789.32,2794.26, as it is far too complicated to be anything but dark.
2794.26,2799.64," And if by chance it turns out that there is a positive and optimistic side to it, it could"
2799.64,2811.2, be a facade or it could be a much more complicated story behind the scenes. What they said as the first speaker of the other team had said that
2811.8,2819.1, that say dark media creates a dark media distends the people from the government
2819.1,2826.0, and positive media brings them closer and make their bones much more tight and much more and they make
2826.0,2834.08, make the citizen much more stressful of their government and the authority we have uh we have
2834.08,2840.4, to have a clue on what happens as we have to have a clue on what happens affects how we view the
2840.4,2848.64, government uh lying about they say that it's lying about politicians they thought about
2848.64,2854.48, the people who are in power and banks a uh the government politician all the people and
2854.48,2859.76, authorities in a bad lie make them seem as the bad guys that could never be redeemed the people
2859.76,2866.24, who are uh irredeemable while on their side of the house by giving them the best and the positive
2866.24,2873.76, contact we are making these people politicians and authorities and otherwise uh people who are
2873.76,2878.96, aiming to help who are may aiming to construct the country and make it into a better place
2878.96,2886.54, and protective protecting and trusting and which leads to the people protecting and trusting the system
2886.54,2899.5, and being much more capable of accepting and cooperating with the government.
2900.66,2927.88," Why is it wrong? We have said and stated before that people's actions toward authorities are not the responsibility of the book slash series that they are, and they are rational people and human beings that are capable of creating their own fact that they are beating up. You say that the people would feel like they are being misled,"
2928.06,2930.42, feel like they are living in an unjust world.
2930.76,2934.22," There are governments which try to cover up the facts,"
2934.6,2938.06," but still get leaked their punishment, corporal punishment,"
2938.36,2943.42, and the painful consequences that come to people that might not even have made a mistake.
2943.68,2949.28," You are asking us to trust our governments blindly, like the citizens of America had"
2949.28,2954.42, trusted their government in the 80s only for the citizens of the lower class to be killed
2954.42,2962.1," mercilessly but with toxins, with toxin waste, because people were told that they are being"
2962.1,2967.4, hit by the Russian rockets and what else.
2967.72,2973.14," So as I've been saying, the trust and blind trust to these people"
2973.14,2975.66, and the government is not going to get you anywhere.
2976.8,2981.18," Second, our second speaker had claimed that in a world"
2981.18,2985.28," where the majority of the political factions are negative,"
2985.28,2993.2," that it reduces propaganda, which is something every sound citizen will be relieved to let happen,"
2993.48,3001.06," as more and more people will acknowledge the dangers of propaganda and how it affects the people,"
3001.36,3005.2, and therefore they will be much more immune and much more cautious and
3005.2,3011.68, careful around these kind of strategies and there's got this kind of situation where certain
3011.68,3016.4, people empower trying to take these people under their wing in order for nefarious or i'll tell
3016.4,3023.44, your motives what they have said is that it makes people paranoid people reading these factions and
3023.44,3031.62," being of being much more cautious toward their government will make them paranoid, will be afraid of cooperating, which is not what is supposed to happen."
3031.62,3037.0," We are saying that they will be much more cautious and careful, not be entirely in cooperative with their system."
3038.0,3049.32," They also say that reading this would keep them in the old mindset, in the worst case scenario, that they'll become aggressive toward the government and politicians and what else, and as I have"
3049.32,3055.98," stated before, that will not happen if they were rational human beings."
3055.98,3061.76," And why is it wrong again and again and again, we stated that people have rational thoughts,"
3061.76,3065.38," people have rational feelings, and they will be able to judge and make their own decision."
3077.4,3089.0," And the reading of the faction and the shows are nothing but mere moments of enjoyment that they have from the TV or the book. And we have presented you today with the reasons that our opposition win that would by not following the positive approach, but following the negative approach."
3089.0,3097.0, And why is it going to be helpful and keep people safe in the long run from the from the from the negative political influence?
3097.0,3114.7," If it existed as they had claimed, thank you, I think the speaker for the speech. Let's welcome opposition reply."
3114.7,3118.76, Am I seen and heard? Yeah.
3118.76,3132.28," Okay. So I'll start in three, two, one. To start off with my first point, the proposition team are proposing that there is more propaganda of their side of the case."
3132.28,3141.36," When I tell you not, and we have mentioned a couple of times in our arguments, from first to second speaker."
3142.14,3147.16," They also said that we are regarding politicians as negative,"
3147.66,3154.6," and we have never mentioned such thing, which also said that we are suggesting"
3154.6,3160.8, there should be no hope in the world where we also never mentioned such thing.
3161.6,3167.44," They mentioned that there should be no hope in the world, but we are only suggesting"
3167.44,3174.6, that there should not be false hope in politician fiction. They also made it clear that they
3174.6,3181.06," are not proposing what the motion suggests exactly, but are proposing only what they"
3181.06,3219.92," want to propose. For example, they said that they do not want to remove all negativity from political fiction. Secondly, and they also made it clear that they're only proposing what they want to propose, but not proposing what the motion is telling them to propose."
3220.94,3226.0, And now I would sum up everything that's happened in our debate from outside of the world.
3226.0,3246.76," First, opposition team, which is our first speaker, suggested that we are helping people think more objectively rather than subjectively. We have also stated that what reality check is"
3246.76,3250.46, and stated examples why their structure
3250.46,3252.7, is all over the place.
3252.7,3255.3," We've also stated definitions, examples,"
3255.3,3257.94, that's why our stance still stands.
3257.94,3262.94, And what our opposition second speaker has mentioned
3263.04,3265.86," that he was talking, I was talking about"
3265.86,3275.22," having people rather having positive views than having negative pessimistic views,"
3275.38,3281.06," because it is only what they want to see. And not, they do not want to see the reality"
3281.06,3288.32, of the negative and pessimistic side of things and our third and final speech
3288.32,3294.88, has helped us balance out everything and thank you very much and that is my reply speech
3297.36,3306.0, all right i thank the speaker for the speech now let's welcome gov reply Am I audible?
3306.0,3326.84," So I'm going to start my speech in 3, 2, 1. Panel, false hope is better than no hope at all. If we did not have hope in the end of the COVID-19 pandemic,"
3327.18,3329.1, would we still be living till today?
3329.4,3332.22, We affirm this motion in favor of development.
3332.5,3335.64," First of all, side negative mischaracterizes the motion, right?"
3335.64,3338.56, This debate clearly specified preferring a world
3338.56,3342.1," where a majority of political fiction is positive and optimistic,"
3342.26,3344.04," which means, panel, in this debate today,"
3344.06,3350.32," we do not take away negative and pessimistic fiction, but we make majority positive and optimistic which means panel in this debate today we do not take away negative and pessimistic fiction but we make majority positive and optimistic right moving"
3350.32,3354.96, on secondly to propaganda right they concede to the fact that propaganda exists on both sides of
3354.96,3360.88, the house right but then we come and clear and show to you that our propaganda is actually better
3360.88,3364.8, if it did exist on our side of the house right i know we have to understand that that's good for
3364.8,3368.24, them politics has always been a sensitive topic in humanity right now
3368.24,3372.32, panel let's see a world where you fit people with negativity you keep telling them that
3372.88,3377.76, negative politics are negative politicians are bad politicians so our money right it pushes these
3377.76,3381.92, people right if majority of the information they watch is bad right and analyze from the past which
3381.92,3388.24, right it pushes them to actually believe the things and take them them out and pushes them to actually do negative things right it's toughest with the
3388.24,3392.88, rationality of the human being pushing them to do things that they wouldn't actually want to do
3392.88,3397.52, right which is like public discourse which is that end of the run um gives harm to them which
3397.52,3401.92, actually characterized you from our first speech but it's not handled adequately right secondly
3401.92,3410.72, distinguishing between reality and fiction panel not that this debate is about which fiction is better which is negative or positive fiction right fiction about
3410.72,3416.4, like what politics right fiction is not real things right you have to understand fiction is
3416.4,3420.8, fake things as was actually characterized enough as before i showed you non-political fiction
3420.8,3425.2, movies can actually take inspiration from our that happened but they do not necessarily
3425.2,3430.32, create the content of the world they lie about the war right they add in things they put things
3430.32,3435.76, they change that they just write fake things right this is the reality that this case claim
3435.76,3439.28, which is actually fiction and we believe they fall out secondly they come and tell us
3439.28,3445.04," americans trust governments blindly right Hannah, we believe that this debate today"
3454.3,3458.0," tell you to kill these people, shut them up"
3458.0,3459.38," and all those things, and they create this kind"
3459.38,3462.22, of public discourse because they're harming other citizens.
3462.22,3467.2, And that is to support the good side of everything.
3469.3,3471.44," Then we still bring out that, but we-"
3480.08,3481.78," I'm sorry, I think you're lacking."
3486.48,3493.16," The negative and like moderate the negative points of view, right? That is the world that we preach aside affirmatives today."
3494.0,3505.78," Two things we actually analyze in our case today. A, why trust is particularly important in the development of the nation and we get them a comparative analysis how their world actually takes away government trust. And when government trust is actually taken away,"
3505.78,3508.04, we cannot see development or policies
3508.04,3509.48," because people do not trust their government,"
3509.48,3511.74, cannot see accountability because people will not actually
3511.74,3513.76, be pushed to actually work on their government.
3513.76,3515.46," But finally, we show you how it actually"
3515.46,3517.24," leads to public discourse, which can actually"
3517.24,3519.02, lead to the development of our nation.
3519.02,3520.76, These are all mechanisms that they don't actually
3520.76,3521.9, tackle in their speeches.
3521.9,3524.72," Secondly, we come and show you in our further analysis"
3524.72,3526.58," how the propaganda that they actually claim is actually worse they're speeches, right? Secondly, we come and show you in our further analysis how the propaganda that they actually claim"
3526.58,3528.98, is actually worse off on their side of the house.
3528.98,3530.86," Even the fact that they coerce people, right,"
3530.86,3532.5," with their negative ideologies,"
3532.5,3534.02, they push people to actually believe
3534.02,3536.36," these negative ideologies because they are the majority,"
3536.36,3538.36, which actually leads to more public discourse.
3538.36,3540.46," And like when this public discourse actually happens,"
3540.46,3543.98, that impacts actually far worse on their side of the house
3543.98,3545.0, and on our world.
3545.0,3547.0," I will show you a better world in society, right?"
3547.0,3551.0," We might have some wrong things in our society, but our society is actually more sustainable"
3551.0,3555.0," and like more working together than the society that we actually preach, right, Pano?"
3555.0,3558.0," First of all, three things that they don't do in their speech, right?"
3558.0,3561.0," They give us no responses to how our world doesn't work,"
3561.0,3563.0, no responses to the mechanisms that we actually give them.
3563.0,3568.0," Secondly, they come and give us no clear analysis or not clear mechanisms about how all the claims that"
3568.0,3572.32," they actually made. And finally, Pano, we rest our cases by saying that we win this debate today"
3572.32,3576.8, because we show you how rationality actually works and how reality actually looks like in the
3576.8,3580.08," vast majority of instances, other than the world that they actually preach to you about. Thank you very much."
3582.64,3585.9," All right, I thank the speaker for the speech and thanks everyone for the debate."
3586.14,3587.1, So I'm going to stop.
3587.36,3588.34," Wait, wait, let me record first."
3588.62,3588.78, All right.
3589.98,3590.26, Okay.
3590.38,3591.34, I'm going to start my OAN.
3591.5,3592.82," Three, two, one, go."
3593.28,3596.24, So we as a panel all agree
3596.24,3598.28, that this debate is a bit messy.
3598.28,3601.3," Overall, we still saw at least a big clash"
3601.3,3603.28, or like two big clashes in this debate.
3603.78,3605.76," And overall, we gave a unanimous"
3605.76,3611.28, decision to proposition congratulations and commiserations so what we saw here is firstly
3611.28,3616.8, there is a clash about trust and distrust and whether that's a good thing so on government
3616.8,3621.52, we think they gave us a lot more effort on what that trust might look like and what impact will
3621.52,3627.08," bring so what we got was that when that when you have more positive fictions,"
3627.14,3629.48, you're able to have a better governmental system
3629.48,3630.78," because on opposition side,"
3630.78,3633.0, people are likely gonna generalize the government
3633.0,3634.78, because they don't actually see
3634.78,3637.0, like individual characters in the movies.
3637.0,3639.46, Therefore they create an antagonistic view
3639.46,3642.2, of us versus them narrative
3642.2,3643.6, between people and the government.
3643.6,3645.12, The problem will be there is firstly
3645.12,3649.76, things like very low voter turnout and therefore the government that even if it's elected has little
3649.76,3654.96, accountability and awful government is gonna likely make bad policies if they know that people
3654.96,3659.44, don't trust them secondly people are not able to access government help because they're not willing
3659.44,3666.0, to in the first place so in things like developing like in conditions like developing countries they're
3666.0,3670.48, often even times going to turn to rebels for help or they are going to like rebel against the
3670.48,3675.6, government and the impact of these will be uh less peace and sustainability that is important for
3675.6,3681.12, developing countries so they think that on government even if it's not like true and
3681.12,3686.06," accurate hope at least with this uh with the trust of government and with the hope,"
3686.3,3689.46, people are able to have more engagement with the government and have the will to
3689.46,3694.44," have discourse. On opposition, what we heard was that this is ultimately a false hope."
3694.72,3699.88," I think our problem with opposition, although to be honest, the panel didn't really buy all"
3699.88,3704.44, government's mechanism because we were unclear as to how the government is integral in the first
3704.44,3709.24," place. At least what we heard from opposition is that this is just a false hope because firstly,"
3709.36,3713.94, it's factually not true. So the comparative on their side is that they have things like reality
3713.94,3718.66, check. But I think government did point out that this is not really the debate because both sides
3718.66,3722.56," are defending fictions. And therefore, if opposition wants things like reality check,"
3722.62,3726.06," it should appear in things like documentary, which is out of the debate."
3726.46,3731.38," Secondly, opposition talked about how people now are going to blindly trust the government and it's bad."
3731.38,3736.2," And we heard examples like Chapo, for example, but we think the impact was really unclear."
3736.42,3739.7, So what people are actually going to do with this false hope isn't clear.
3740.14,3746.26," And more importantly, I think government's case doesn't really hinge on the like the whole hope being true."
3746.26,3755.24, I think what government what what proposition proves is at least people are willing to engage with the system and willing to follow government rules in a like at certain times.
3755.24,3765.2, Right. Certainly what opposition told us in terms of this is that having a sense of reality is good because people are able to distinguish between probably generally more
3765.2,3770.18, like what are right and wrong in society. I think the problem is it was not really pushed forward
3770.18,3775.24, as to why it's very important. Opposition whip also kind of contradicted it by saying that people
3775.24,3781.22, are generally rational on both sides. So we are also unclear why that accrues on opposition. And
3781.22,3791.28, that's why ultimately we gave this like most important discussion with government now there is another thing like another discussion about propaganda which i think was not clearly
3791.28,3796.56, delivered in the case that's why we as a panel actually struggled as to what impacting that
3796.56,3802.88, propaganda looks like i think opposition pointed out that government probably has more propaganda
3802.88,3806.24," bad propaganda such as dehumanizing people, things like that."
3806.52,3809.24," And if the propaganda becomes very negative,"
3809.38,3810.12, people don't follow.
3810.26,3811.8, But we think these two framings
3811.8,3813.32, are kind of a bit contradictory.
3813.32,3815.5, And we don't actually think opposition proved
3815.5,3817.36," like why on proposition side,"
3817.5,3818.86, there is negative propaganda
3818.86,3820.58, or just overall bad propaganda.
3820.58,3822.44, And people are going to buy into it
3822.44,3823.96, as long as you agree that people
3823.96,3831.28, are probably rational in the first place so i think overall that propaganda as like compared like also along
3831.28,3836.56, with your false hope that isn't really the like tipping point for government to prove that
3836.56,3842.48, government's case of trust is actually like false trust or is going to lead to more harm so that's
3842.48,3846.86, overall what we see as a case uh i'm going to first give some general feedback.
3847.04,3847.9," And I think later on,"
3847.98,3851.26, you can approach panels for individual feedback.
3851.48,3853.52," So generally, because we think this debate"
3853.52,3856.14," wasn't really clear in many places,"
3856.36,3858.4, the first feedback I would give
3858.4,3860.76," is to try to make your arguments clear,"
3861.08,3862.68, especially in terms of telling us
3862.68,3864.44, what the linkage to the debate is.
3864.62,3865.08, So if you're
3865.08,3870.62," talking about propaganda, or if you're talking about a certain setting, for example, it's in"
3870.62,3875.22," developing countries, and why sustainability is very important. I think these are the things that"
3875.22,3880.12," you should flag out, especially in the claim of your argument. And don't make the claim of your"
3880.12,3885.92," argument a sentence and or an example, because we were not sure what that actually leads to."
3886.24,3891.22," Secondly, I think mechanisms are important, yes, but sometimes mechanisms also include"
3891.22,3896.7," preemptions for both sides. So I think for government, for example, it is better for you to"
3896.7,3902.1," explicitly tell us why even if it's false hope, it's still better than not having hope. I think"
3902.1,3909.12," I did hear this weighing in, I think, government reply, but this could be flagged out more clearly. And thirdly, I think in terms of engagement,"
3909.54,3915.26," both sides actually didn't really engage with each other to the fullest extent. For example,"
3915.26,3921.78, we think that opposition's argument of sense of reality is actually a legitimate argument and can
3921.78,3925.26," actually be flagged out more. But unfortunately, it wasn't"
3925.26,3929.72, really clear to the panel what the impacting was. But I think in order for a government case to be
3929.72,3934.48," better, you can actually engage that to a greater extent of how people on your site are still able"
3934.48,3940.18, to be like rationally distinguishing between propaganda and things like that. And also the
3940.18,3945.84," relation of propaganda, like government directly posting propaganda in fictions, compared"
3945.84,3950.86, to fictions that are created by media in of itself. I think these are the things that
3950.86,3955.58," both sides can actually try to make clear. So apologies if it's a short OA, but I think"
3955.58,3961.52," it's more important in this round to approach feedback. So yeah, does anyone have any questions"
3961.52,3972.8, or want to approach feedback
3976.96,3981.12, no thank you we thank you so much for your time and for your feedback thank you so much
3987.0,3993.0," uh and team omen you can as well. All right. Thanks, everyone for the round. If you also want feedback, we have a wonderful panel."
3993.0,3999.0, So please approach the panel. You can also approach me on discord for feedback and for the recording.
