0.0,2.24, to order on the given motion.
2.24,4.6, And I invite the prime minister to open the case
4.6,5.52, that stands in their name.
5.52,6.02, Keh keh.
8.62,12.22," Hi, just to check, am I visible and audible?"
12.22,12.96," OK, great."
12.96,15.72," Once again, I use he, him pronouns and POIs"
15.72,16.62, to be given verbally.
16.62,20.22," Please, I won't be looking at the chat."
20.22,25.28," Starting my speech in 3, two, one."
30.54,31.0," The root of all of Africa's ailments is poverty, and when allowed to fester over generations,"
35.9,40.4, opposition forms an ecosystem of chronic inefficiencies that predate on the livelihoods of the most vulnerable in the forms of disease and destitution. We are so proud to propose.
40.84,44.8," Before I introduce two arguments within this speech, what exactly do we support under this"
44.8,49.32," proposition? First of all, a three-pronged model. Firstly, we think post-colonial"
49.32,54.8," African states share a few characteristics, namely, one, strong grassroots movements formed"
54.8,59.66," during colonial rule to fight for independence. Two, their economic system was designed for"
59.66,65.76," colonizers to extract wealth from them, so poverty is rampant. And three, note that all post-colonial African"
65.76,72.34, states in the status quo pursued a mixed bag of political and economic strategies. So this debate
72.34,76.88, must be about reimagining the world on which of the two we should have prioritized at the point
76.88,82.18," of independence under the rule of a good faith government. Otherwise, neither team can deliver"
82.18,89.18," their promise of economic or political rights. Two, the process of fighting for economic and land reparations will be spearheaded by the state."
89.44,90.86, This will look like roughly three things.
91.18,95.46," Firstly, establishing committees responsible for fairly redistributing wealth and property"
95.46,99.36, who prioritize distribution from those who unfairly took wealth under colonialism
99.36,101.54, to the economically disenfranchised.
101.92,105.56," Secondly, establishing quotas within the workplace and schools to ensure"
105.56,110.72," equitable access to employment and education. And thirdly, cash transfer programs to marginalized"
110.72,116.68," groups. Three, we think in reimagining the world, a post-colonial Africa, absent of civil and"
116.68,121.44," political rights, will not be a society that lacks all fundamental human rights. This is because"
121.44,125.34, local leaders in a newly independent state have directly suffered
125.34,130.34," under colonialism, incentivizing them to ensure that the basic humanity which was eroded under"
130.34,135.94," colonial powers is now safeguarded. Therefore, fundamental human rights such as the freedom from"
135.94,140.82," slavery and torture exist, whereas civil and political rights such as expression, the political"
140.82,145.08, expression and assembly are not specifically codified by the law. Two arguments
145.08,150.14, in this speech. The first on how immediate economic relief is second to none in safeguarding
150.14,154.26, the livelihoods and upliftment of African nations. There are three parts underneath this argument.
154.64,159.14," First of all, I'd like to note that in the hierarchy of competing rights, economic upliftment"
159.14,163.82, must supersede political empowerment. This is because economic rights are instrumental to the
163.82,169.56," right to life, because the biggest obstacle is in the state. It's starvation, disease, and intergenerational"
169.56,174.74, poverty. Finite resources mean that millions spent to build voting booths on op could have
174.74,179.0, been used to feed the malnourished and earn acceptable income so their children could go
179.0,183.66, to school instead of being forced into child labor. Perishing means there aren't any political
183.66,189.6," expressions to be made, because when you survive, it becomes your utmost priority. The right to life is a gateway right"
189.6,194.3, that is fundamental to human dignity and comes prior to everything else. Why then is saving
194.3,199.28, lives exclusively a prop? Because it's a time-sensitive issue. Lives are at stake. Democracy
199.28,204.24," requires the state to carefully debate, pass, and implement public policies. So even if you get"
204.24,210.22," political rights, economic policies will only come way after. In the meantime, the lives we lose waiting"
210.22,215.3, for immediate relief are irreversible. But economic policies on the side of op will be far less
215.3,220.94," efficient, as state resources are stretched thin for nationwide projects. On-prompt, direct cash"
220.94,226.92, transfers and land in the hands of the people gives them the agency to ameliorate their specific economic situation.
227.24,233.58, Those who need medical care and shelter can get it directly instead of waiting on the state to develop things like public housing or hospitals.
233.92,238.76," But secondly, we think our economic reparations uniquely empower the people in a few key ways."
239.12,250.1," In many African states, natives were robbed of their land and consigned to barren parts of the country. In South Africa, the 1913 Natives Land Act was apartheid's original sin because it conscripted"
250.1,255.22, Black South Africans who formed 76% of the population and restricted them to land ownership
255.22,259.62," in just a tenth of the country's land, systematically shutting them out of metropolitan"
259.62,273.6," cities. Only we reverse it by the restoration of land rights because ownership over land land improves integration between ethnic groups, because we prevent things like segregation, and we allow individuals to use their land as collateral for things like investment to build their wealth."
273.6,290.02," We don't provide access to education and jobs for disenfranchised groups. It opens up access to income streams where otherwise they would be impoverished, allowing access to upward social mobility but lastly we think economic reparations in the wake of decolonization addresses Africa's crippling underdevelopment"
290.02,295.42, because their underdevelopment stems from foreign powers using them to extract natural resources and
295.42,300.94, exploit cheap labor when consumers are impoverished there isn't a viable market and labor exploitation
300.94,307.14, perpetuates the cycle of poverty because workers never gain adequate disposable income to attract meaningful FDI.
307.5,310.92, Economic reparations means consumers will have purchasing power.
311.24,314.8," Hence, foreign investors won't stop at just setting up low-cost supply chains."
315.04,318.22," Rather, they'll set up businesses and invest in the growing economy."
318.22,323.6, This sparks job creation and lessens the economic burden of the state when FDI contributes towards growth.
323.86,329.84," But without economic reparations, we think opposition creates a unique vulnerability in africa as prolonged destitution"
329.84,334.96, means they're more prone to the outbreak of things like conflicts disease and death the lack of
334.96,340.16, resources exacerbates existing social ills and is insufficient to create any meaningful impact
340.16,351.66," before i move on to the second argument sure i'll take point. In a post-colonial impoverished, largely backward economy like Africa, who creates all these jobs, has enough money to create healthcare and education, and how?"
352.44,358.48," So we think, first of all, if you're going to contest the lack of resources, that is a problem your side needs to deal with as well."
358.68,368.82," Because note that the implementation of rights is also contingent on resources. If you solely want to make this debate the fact that post-colonial African nations are broke and they have absolutely zero resources,"
369.04,373.78, your side cannot claim your benefits as well. Moving on to the second argument as to how civil
373.78,378.04, and political rights cannot be exercised meaningfully without new wealth. Three parts
378.04,382.42," here. The first, wealth inherently allows participants of a democracy to gain the"
382.42,390.0," political system in two ways. One, through lobbying. The financial elite and the state will collude to create an ecosystem of power at the top"
390.0,395.26, where political and economic favors are constantly exchanged. Companies that receive state subsidies
395.26,400.28," and contracts inevitably cement themselves as the dominant market force, and these newly crowned"
400.28,405.16, financial elite then fund political campaigns of the ruling parties to continue receiving these
405.16,409.64," favors. Note that this is a problem that exists within developed democracies as well, where"
409.64,414.4," political rights are strongly entrenched, like in the US, where lobbying actively undermines the"
414.4,419.96," public will. But two, we think meaningful access to free speech and association is impossible without"
419.96,424.64," money, because the financial elite who dominate mainstream media have excessive channels to"
424.64,429.52," exercise those rights, their platforms to shape public opinions in their favor and a greater"
429.52,434.48, influence in determining which parties and candidates get into power thus we leave you
434.48,439.76, not challenged the concentration of wealth the financial elite heavy chokehold on power what
439.76,445.04, keeps them in the driving seat of democracy is to keep others locked in an inescapable poverty trap
445.04,450.16," by the deregulation of industries, low wages, and low redistribution of wealth, which is exactly"
450.16,454.96, what we see in Africa today. But the second part of this argument is how economic oppression is in
454.96,459.84," the heart of African suffering, and political rights uniquely fail to alleviate it. Because"
459.84,464.96," the lack of economic enfranchisement means that while segregation may be abolished on paper,"
464.96,469.46," it's purely tokenistic, because Black South Africans stay trapped in slums because"
469.46,474.42, they simply do not have the resources to move elsewhere while white Afrikaners prosper across
474.42,475.76, city lines.
475.76,479.24, That is the world of modern apartheid that opposition stands for.
479.24,483.44, We think therefore money is the prerequisite for the state to enshrine rights because when
483.44,489.0," faced with limited resources in a nation's coffers, the state has no choice but to trade off certain rights."
489.26,494.12," In those instances, the wealthiest actors who have the largest political say get their rights paradise."
494.26,502.12," Finally, we put power back in the hands of people by giving them wealth, because disposable income empowers individuals to make their political opinions impactful."
503.02,505.5, They're able to fund campaigns and signal their strength
505.5,507.8, to governments because it cements their influence
507.8,509.54, as an important voter block.
509.54,512.48, Hunger rings louder than any political promise.
512.48,515.22," On opposition, they hand the impoverished words,"
515.22,517.2, we uniquely grant them the ticket to survival.
517.2,518.44, I'm so proud to propose.
521.32,523.28, I think the first prop and my first stop.
528.0,553.68," Just a second. Just setting up a timer. Hey, can I just confirm that you all can hear and see me okay?"
553.68,554.68, Perfect.
554.68,561.4, I'll be taking POIs verbally.
561.4,570.0," So yeah, just I will think I'll see it in chat okay starting in three two one"
570.0,573.92, on opposition we're going to prove three things in this debate firstly how we lessen ethnic conflict
573.92,577.6, secondly why democracy is far better than reparations and thirdly i will tell you how
577.6,582.32, we get far better fdi access before that i just want to be incredibly clear on what the enshrining
582.32,588.32, of civil and political rights actually looks like. It looks like ensuring free and fair elections. It looks like having these elections
588.32,592.0, being fair in terms of the election watches there. It looks like lobbying restrictions from
592.0,596.64," companies, for example, because look, coding this in constitutions allows like citizen positions,"
596.64,601.12," for example. Understand this, this is not a four-year thing, right? It's not you voting"
601.12,605.22, every four years. It's a formal culture that's in present. Why is this likely to be done well?
605.5,608.9," Firstly, I want to be clear that most people want to work together because they have a"
608.9,612.92," common interest, i.e. the narratives of the country, the narrative of independence, the"
612.92,614.08, right to self-government.
614.14,614.9, But not crucially.
615.22,621.04," In response to the POY state that this thought asks them, I think that NATO, the UN, and"
621.04,623.7, international treaties are likely to be far greater on our side of the house.
623.78,646.42," And they're exclusive because of the fact that the country is seen as being interested in democracy on their side of the house is one is starting present The first thing I noticed the process of redistribution of like,"
646.54,650.06, or it's going to be like economic operations likely involves things like
650.06,652.0," being dictatorial, like at least, right."
652.12,654.68," If a government, for instance, is all the power and all the resources and"
654.68,656.32, determining how land is distributed.
656.48,659.66, I think they have the ability to give a lot of these land to their friends.
659.66,661.66," They have the ability to do things like cement the dominant,"
661.82,669.28," that their power in some way, for instance, like this happened in Singapore in singapore right okay first argument then how does proposition increase ethnic and political"
669.28,673.52, violence the first thing i note here is that most african countries and nations just have
673.52,678.56, sign they just have like extremely diverse religious parties in general they're incredibly
678.56,682.72, diverse post colonization why because i think the british and french often like actively
682.72,689.88," brought different ethnic groups from their areas and they colonized in order to do things like mine certain precious minerals, for example, or do things like set up railways."
690.2,698.92," Right. Therefore, they needed like large labor pools in that sense. But secondly, I think they wanted to divide and conquer policy so that different minorities could not just unite and rise up in protest against them."
698.92,708.78," And I think that's why they drew borders arbitrarily. Now, here's the thing. Given that most African states are thus multi-ethnic, the failure to truly enshrine democratic rights means that there's going to be far more conflict"
708.78,712.48," between these tribes. Understand how this undercuts a lot of the proposition material,"
712.74,716.22," because to the extent that, let's say, reparations are somewhat helpful, the point of which there's"
716.22,720.36, some sort of conflict means that there's going to be significant economic harm as well on their
720.36,725.2," side of the house. Now, note, why is it going to be hard because like look i think the"
725.2,729.52, failure literally means that you're literally taking away money from that say one tribe and
729.52,732.96, giving that money away from the other tribe it looks like giving taking money from the
732.96,736.88, virtues and giving it the tootsies for example the reason you have this incentive is because
736.88,741.12, the right to let's say the because like right after you become independent you want to get
741.12,748.0, resources right you want to help your loved ones in your in these oppressed tribes but also you don't have like greater tensions until like the negotiation
748.0,752.96, processes actually get ugly let's be clear on what happens on the comparative firstly i think we get
752.96,756.96, far more that we can like power sharing agreements on our side between the majority and minority
756.96,761.68, tribes a lot more because democracy itself involves this process of negotiation to figure
761.68,767.9, out the best way to represent people it It looks like the majority and minority tribes are getting different areas of land and redistribution
767.9,771.36, of natural resources between these tribes because they have that common agreement to
771.36,774.18, help ensure the democratic right to vote is within people.
774.18,776.14, Why is this so much better than their side of the house?
776.14,780.18," The first thing I note here is it involves better relations, no thank you, between parties"
780.18,783.34, and incentives for them to portray these relations with their populace.
783.34,786.0, It looks like keeping each party in check with regards to abuses.
786.0,792.0," That is to say, if one party abuses against their people, for instance, the other tribe can do more to show how they're better."
792.0,801.0," In that sense, I think it also incentivizes each party to give reparations and economic goods to those people on the ground, because there's a ways to the top."
801.0,808.8," Look at the implication here, panel. This literally coop see a lot of population benefits on that sense secondly even if like power sharing agreements"
808.8,813.12, you have shared like the unifying narrative of the government is like really important here right
813.12,817.6, because this is when you look at like the unified this is literally when you like look at the
817.6,821.68, unified history right one of your independence like how you have the right to democracy right
821.68,828.32, the right to self-govern this is better because the narrative is far better because it forces tribes to focus on the common goals either way
828.32,832.24, panel on proposition side there's backlash there's backlash from different stakeholders
832.24,836.0, in post-colonial african states in the case of reallocation of resources from one ethnic type
836.0,840.64, to another the fact that they're like long years of tribalism it means that it's far worse and far
840.64,848.72, harsher because i think like you would refocus on who would come into power right as a result it's going to be less accountability on their side of the house you literally internalize
848.72,853.12, racist narratives what are the impacts of this the first thing is this is a significant decrease
853.12,857.16, in conflict on our side of the house because it involves fewer people notice how bad propositions
857.16,861.66, world is oftentimes these communities get closer to each other and they can be impoverished the
861.66,867.58," fighting that erupts on their side of the house looks like skirmishes between people on the ground. It looks like the destruction of their own houses,"
867.84,872.04, further impoverishing them. This strips away a lot of their economic benefits in the first place.
872.32,876.96," Before I move on, sure. Your argument on preventing ethnic conflict is contingent"
876.96,881.14, on political participation. But if people are still suffering tangibly because their economic
881.14,886.48, needs aren't fulfilled on your side of the house. They simply don't have the time nor the resources to engage in politics.
887.12,893.06," The first thing I note here is that, look, we literally give you two reasons as to why people are incredibly likely to be participating here."
893.28,896.72," Why? Because there are father figure narratives, for instance, there's the narrative of independence."
896.9,900.38," I think on our side of the house, there is going to be political participation. I think that's symmetric."
900.72,904.22, The difference is the fact that there's going to be more conflict on your side of the house. Right.
904.4,906.98," But more crucially, never actually proved to us that you're going to get like fair"
906.98,911.48, redistribution in the first place. The summary of this argument here is that people fight a lot
911.48,915.82," more on propositions world. The fighting worsens the issues on their side. Second argument, I think"
915.82,919.46," this outweighs the majority of the proposition case, because I want to prove here why democracy"
919.46,923.58," is just far better than drug operations. At its most basic level, I think the right to choose"
923.58,925.28, is a prerequisite to utility.
925.28,927.28," Because note, at the point of a nation democracy,"
927.28,928.74, a lot of people have similar wants.
928.74,929.36, They have food.
929.36,929.78, They want food.
929.78,930.44, They want income.
930.44,932.06," They want infrastructure, et cetera."
932.06,934.2, Given that the outcome of the prioritization
934.2,936.02," can be uncertain to an extent, I think"
936.02,939.12," the fact that we get things like more economic and more systems,"
939.12,941.3, the fact that we can ensure longer term structures
941.3,943.64, for politics in general is far better.
943.64,950.08," For example, the right to protest if on their side of the house like these like reparations can be redistributed to wealthy people"
950.08,954.32, only i think this is entirely possible right i think on our side the fact that you can at least
954.32,958.88, protest and get your point of view heard is essential to fixing such kinds of policy moreover
958.88,963.36, the ability to have a true democracy is what ensures policies in general are like far better
963.36,965.12, notes here democracy fosters
965.12,969.04, a culture of transparency and information spreading because it asks for criticism and
969.04,972.96, ideas and checks and balances within the government as a result i think we're far better
972.96,977.36, in this debate panel because we prevent against the worst forms of harms that accrue on site
977.36,982.88, proposition what is the way off here i think we prioritize like the worst forms of harms or the
982.88,985.52, greatest benefit here as the worst harms actually
985.52,989.3, involves like taking away people's rights right there's a simple intuition pump here this is why
989.3,994.22, you like having moral duty to not kill somebody but you do not have a moral duty to do like to
994.22,999.0, give charity to that person notice here voting every four years is quite insufficient you need
999.0,1003.44, the vigor of culture of petitions you need town halls but the second thing i know here and this
1003.44,1006.02, is like this is unpreemptive in general coming
1006.02,1007.02," from proposition, right?"
1007.02,1010.2, I think it's quite clear that money can be stripped away in the future.
1010.2,1014.06, The ability to have a free and fair election and press is literally what guarantees stability
1014.06,1015.06, on the other side.
1015.06,1016.06, Why is this the case?
1016.06,1018.96, Know that future unaccountable politicians can also be in place.
1018.96,1022.94," Like they can put bad economic policies, for example, they can be inflation, they can be"
1022.94,1026.28, political instability that can make your plot of land literally worthless
1026.28,1027.28, on their side of the house.
1027.28,1029.26, The ability to vote is what ensures
1029.26,1030.72, politicians fix these issues.
1030.72,1032.7," Why is democracy so certain, on the other hand?"
1032.7,1034.22, It's because people have similar goals.
1034.22,1036.36, They have similar policies when nation building.
1036.36,1038.78, They stop government abuse on our side of the house.
1038.78,1040.7, They can vote for basic infrastructure bills.
1040.7,1042.24, The leaders on the opposition's world
1042.24,1043.74, are not necessarily going to be that great
1043.74,1048.96, with economic policy in the first place. And this just rebuts a lot of their case as well if leaders
1048.96,1053.04, of such movements have like better experience and knowledge from canvassing and setting up ballot
1053.04,1056.72, boxes because they're often indulging this in the first place they researched these methods
1056.72,1059.76, i think they're far better on our side because on their side they don't necessarily have that
1059.76,1064.16, good experience with economic redistribution in that sense we're better on our side of the house
1064.16,1066.72," because you get far better policy, we help these African nations."
1071.04,1073.6, I thank the first top speaker and the second prop here.
1076.24,1077.76," Hi, can I check that I'm audible?"
1080.0,1091.2," Okay, great. I'm gonna take PO pois verbally so just unmute yourself"
1099.68,1106.8, starting in three two one it seems like a no-brainer at face value panel that we are the black majority if we all had one vote we would control and gain the system. Namibia's largest racial
1106.8,1111.7," group, the Ovambo people, which is half the population, and Black South Africans, which are"
1111.7,1117.42," two-thirds of the population, are statistically in status quo the poorest and the most ill-treated"
1117.42,1123.34," individuals in their homeland. In Namibia's capital and financial hub, Windhoek, not only are most"
1123.34,1125.12," businesses white-owned, but the whites"
1125.12,1129.22," overwhelmingly live in the heart of the city, while the Ovambo people and other racial groups"
1129.22,1134.42, live in the outskirts or outright slums. Was this the will of the people? Was what opposition
1134.42,1138.56, needed to answer? Because I think the reason they have to lose this debate is they are far
1138.56,1144.02, too parallel in just arguing in a vacuum about democracy. We gave you argumentation that directly
1144.02,1149.44, had comparatives as to why even in the perfect scenario of opposition what economic redistribution and
1149.44,1154.56, economic prior economic rights could not take a back seat because it was about survivability
1154.56,1159.52, and the livelihoods of individuals right now these safety net mechanisms would only kick in and it's
1159.52,1170.56, far too reactionary but individuals were already lost that was the comparative that was made clear in the third minute of first proposition that saw little to no engagement at all i will do the wing and i
1170.56,1174.88, will do the comparatives later on but that's just something to note at the top of this speech i have
1174.88,1179.12, three things to do in the speech i'll number one give you observations and framing number two i'll
1179.12,1183.76, strengthen the case that was unresponded to and add additional layers of responses and analysis
1183.76,1190.58, and lastly i'll introduce a third substantive argumentation as to how economic empowerment is a healthy democracy.
1190.92,1196.42," No, I'll take one later. Moving on to observations and responses. Note that first on their mechanism,"
1196.78,1201.58, they wanted to just assert that they would have free and fair elections and in response to our
1201.58,1206.86," harm that they did not prepare for, would just simply ban lobbying. Note firstly, this is just a literal frivolous response."
1207.08,1208.58," You can't just assert banning lobbying,"
1208.82,1211.76, especially in the context of post-colonial African states
1211.76,1213.3, where these are nascent democracies.
1213.6,1215.14, And we've also outlined and highlighted
1215.14,1216.76, that even in entrenched democracy
1216.76,1218.24," and strong Western liberal ones,"
1218.54,1219.74, lobbying isn't actually banned.
1219.92,1221.64," But even if we assume this were to be true,"
1221.8,1224.3, they never actually responded with this catch-all response
1224.3,1226.1, towards the argumentation at all.
1226.22,1229.46, Because we told you two unique things regardless if you ban political lobbying.
1229.8,1246.24," Number one, in terms of even if you ban political lobbying, what is the enforcement mechanism insofar as they still haven't told us why the individuals on the ground are financially empowered to actually be act in order to actually be political agents within society to hold them accountable. But number two, social privilege still existed,"
1246.24,1248.5, which meant that the second analysis that came up
1248.5,1252.1, from first proposition as to how the elite control media.
1252.1,1254.96, The elite are the ones that control TV and airtime
1254.96,1257.16," and interviews, only the wealthy and privileged"
1257.16,1259.9, and the words that they say hold weightage in society.
1259.9,1262.22," So regardless, even if you believe you could ban lobbying,"
1262.22,1264.78," these social influences that you had still existed,"
1264.78,1268.78, they need to deal with that in second opposition or they can see the entirety of the harm still.
1269.08,1273.42," But thirdly, we told you even if it was the case where you banned lobbying, it was implicit"
1273.42,1277.7, expectations when you gave massive amounts of money to political donors.
1277.7,1282.54," So it did not matter that I explicitly said, vote for, I will give you a million dollars"
1282.54,1284.78, and therefore you don't vote for certain policies.
1284.94,1289.84, It was about corporations implicitly giving a large sum of money to large political candidates
1289.84,1294.64, and assuming implicitly there's a promise for certain outcomes and certain policies so their
1294.64,1298.42, catch-all response in their own mechanism and their own setup does not actually work and they
1298.42,1302.74, can't just assert that it will be done well because note that it first the Poy to first off
1302.74,1306.0, proposition is entirely entirely disingenuous in
1306.0,1312.06, terms of they want us to defend our broken system that for some reason if we are the same government
1312.06,1316.98, and the same structure on our side it will be done badly on our side these malevolent actors
1316.98,1321.66, will subvert the economic redistribution but on their side in the same actor that would run the
1321.66,1328.62, same political rights they would do it perfectly and give it to each and every individual. Either this debate needs to exist cleanly where we both assume we
1328.62,1333.02," have the fear to institute our policies initially, or their side needs to also argue for discrimination"
1333.02,1337.0," of individuals because you would likely not institute and give Black African Americans,"
1337.3,1342.04," sorry, not African Americans, Black South Africans the same level of political leverages as the white"
1342.04,1348.28, majority because that would quote-unquote anger them. That is the crucial observations and responses. They have to resolve this or their
1348.28,1353.52," case needs to concede to prop. But on to material responses. On the idea of conflict, not that we"
1353.52,1358.36, think it's highly simplistic why conflict exists as the backbone of the case. They said that you're
1358.36,1364.26, angry at the minorities for taking money and redistributing it to individuals. Note that this
1364.26,1366.34, exact same analysis applies to them
1366.34,1371.18," because the majority that was privileged from colonialism under divide and conquer, certain"
1371.18,1375.7, ethnicities benefited more. Certain ethnicities were granted the right to education through
1375.7,1381.32," English schools, for example. Some of them were allocated to more proliferating and more"
1381.32,1386.12," socially uplifting jobs, for example, in the agriculture sector,"
1386.28,1390.46," where some individuals were forced to work in the mines, which means that granting them equal,"
1390.58,1394.62," if not the same political rights, and in a case where they would be the overwhelming majority,"
1394.88,1398.98, would also make you pissed off at minorities and equate to the same kinds of outcomes.
1399.24,1403.62, The only assertion as to why you would be able to correct this is power sharing agreements that
1403.62,1408.24," incentivizes the race to the top, and therefore you co-opt all the propositions benefits in the first"
1408.24,1412.72," place. We told you in our second proposition speaker two things. In terms of number one,"
1412.72,1417.32," political participation is unlikely to exist insofar as the individuals are the most impoverished,"
1417.32,1421.16," which meant that it isn't the race to the top, but rather it's extremely easy to cater"
1421.16,1429.38," to the simplistic needs of individuals on the ground to keep them quiet. It looks like giving them financial aid from politicians and say, vote for me, giving them"
1429.38,1433.8," bags of rice, and therefore that is sufficient for them to vote for you in office, which means"
1433.8,1437.16, that they don't get a raise to their top because it's extremely easy to sway these individuals
1437.16,1442.04, into voting into those systems. So it's likely the exact opposite insofar as you're able to
1442.04,1450.3, exploit the individuals where you don't give them economic resuscitation in order to mobilize but second is more important than reparations all they say here
1450.3,1455.24, is that the right to choose is important and the democracy fosters transparency before i move on to
1455.24,1459.02, the point i'll move on to this i'll take a point she talked about how rich white people are the
1459.02,1462.68, minority but they have the majority of political and economic power so isn't it more likely that
1462.68,1467.32," the black majority will be able to vote these people out and potentially regain some amount of power, which"
1467.32,1472.46, doesn't happen on your side? The entire second argument from first proposition was explaining
1472.46,1477.54, to you why money was important in deciding political outcomes in terms of the social
1477.54,1482.48," influences, the social spheres, because the status quo based on their vote should not be the status"
1482.48,1488.62, quo that we see today. But the only reason of logic for why democracy is more important than reparations is the right to choose. We told you
1488.62,1493.08, straight up from first proposition why the right to choose takes a backseat insofar as exercising
1493.08,1497.68, the autonomy requires you to be in a certain level of financial privilege to access all of
1497.68,1501.84, those sorts of things. Whether individuals even vote in the first place is questionable insofar
1501.84,1506.8, as people care more about their financial survivability
1506.8,1510.78," in the meantime. I think this takes out two of their argumentations, but it was also comparative,"
1511.02,1515.56," the only thing Proposition was willing to do. On to a third argumentation then, as to why economic"
1515.56,1520.9," empowerment is the backbone of a healthy democracy. Three parts. A, economic upliftment is exactly"
1520.9,1528.84," what elevates the social class of citizens to become the working class majority. Quotas for unemployment, land for businesses, and disposable income to increase"
1528.84,1534.0, employability are all the conditions PrEP creates to mobilize the impoverished to the working class.
1534.26,1538.6, This translates to more participation within the education system when children no longer have to
1538.6,1543.84," choose food over school, which increases political literacy within the population. This argument is"
1543.84,1548.32, uniquely explaining to you why only economic rights needs to be first rather than and it leads to an
1548.32,1553.04," eventual organic roadmap to political change. But second, the working class form the largest and"
1553.04,1557.68, most influential persons in every democratic system. We never required the legalization of
1557.68,1563.12," formation in order to associate or the right to vote. Grassroots labor movements, birthed from"
1563.12,1569.0," the economic demands of the most populous and the most empowered, are the individuals that control the system. This is for two reasons,"
1569.28,1573.4," money and critical mass. Money is the prerequisite, as we explained earlier, to increase political"
1573.4,1578.24, awareness and participation. Only when we enable participation do we get the critical mass needed
1578.24,1582.74, to pressure the state to institute change. The same way women's suffrage movements never had
1582.74,1589.0," the right to vote, us being able to be in positions of education and leverage enabled us to mobilize and engage and get the right"
1589.0,1591.06, to vote in the process of advocacy.
1591.06,1594.72, If you want to actually uplift the individuals on our side and the people that are the most
1594.72,1596.72, disenfranchised side with prop.
1596.72,1612.4," I'll take a second, prop speaker, and then the second drop speaker invite the second off"
1613.92,1616.0, i hope i'm audible and visible
1627.36,1627.62," okay i'm going to begin in three p us verbally by, sorry, going to begin in three, two, one. Panel, here's the deal."
1633.14,1642.7," If you have white people being rich and black people being poor, that's because governments structurally prefer the former. Governments are corrupt, governments are discriminatory."
1643.1,1646.94, Proposition gives in the nation and all we do is try to hold them
1646.94,1652.82," accountable. Three questions on team opposition. One, which side gets economic and land reparations?"
1653.12,1660.2," Two, which side gets less toxic spheres? And three, which side gets better foreign relations"
1660.2,1666.68," and investment? But first, I want to clarify something. They make it seem like we don't give people food,"
1666.92,1668.24, water or housing on our side
1668.24,1669.84, and just toss ballot boxes at them
1669.84,1670.88, and ask them to vote.
1671.26,1674.16, Democracy includes certain taxing systems.
1674.38,1677.58," It includes investing in things like healthcare, education."
1677.94,1680.0," However, we just don't prioritize"
1680.0,1681.72, economic and land reparations
1681.72,1683.34, and do something as radical
1683.34,1685.26, as making a post-independent state
1685.26,1691.0, entirely socialist and distributing all the land like trying to do so equitably now which side gets
1691.0,1695.6, economic and land reparations we tell you we get it better because we're able to get it later on
1695.6,1701.1, as the democracy progresses as people immerse why is our likelihood better firstly because their
1701.1,1730.1," side of the house isn't equitable the only incentive that people on their side have, meaning to say, after you are elected, it is likely that the independence party is in charge. These are people that are likely to be power hungry. This is why they sacrifice so much that at the end of the movement, they're able to be in a position of power. We don't think they have any other overarching incentive to do this. We don't think they're messiahs as such we tell you on our side because what happens on their side is simple right there is backlash when they engage in this"
1730.1,1735.02, meaning to say countries in the west due to increasing McCarthyism due to increasing
1735.02,1741.64, capitalist tendencies actively like discriminate against socialist things meaning to say even if
1741.64,1765.68," they prove incentive they do not prove capacity why Aiman says this, we don't get a response. Economic issues are not the expertise of liberation leaders. They often have good oratory ability, right? We tell you that on our side, we have a number of things. Our likelihood is this. We have foreign help from Germany. We have foreign help from the UN, from the US that help us set up democracy. We have"
1765.68,1771.04," elections. They know all the canvassing, all the hotspots of people when it comes to things like"
1771.04,1775.72, elections. The very nature of insurrectionist self-government means they're a lot more prepared
1775.72,1782.04, for this than they are radical economic policy. We have foreign help. We're able to get political
1782.04,1785.12," participation. But we think even though,"
1785.28,1786.44," even if we don't get this,"
1786.64,1789.26, it's better to have a bad democracy
1789.26,1791.42, than to have their best case scenario.
1791.6,1792.86," Because even on their side,"
1792.86,1795.42, you are more likely to even unknowingly
1795.42,1797.64, mess up economic distribution
1797.64,1799.28, than you are to get away
1799.28,1802.2," with democratic backsliding intentionally, right?"
1802.34,1805.54," Better to have our worst than their very best, right? But we think the likelihood is this. On backsliding,, right? Better to have our worst than their very best,"
1805.74,1810.74," right? But we think the likelihood is this. On backsliding, here's what happens. We prove to"
1810.74,1816.16," you that democracy is a prereq to economic and land reparations. We co-opt their benefits,"
1816.38,1821.12," meaning to say you need accountability in order to actually prove things, meaning to say when"
1821.12,1828.54," they say things like the elite or like the elite will still on their side of the house, distribute land in a manner that favors the elite."
1828.54,1831.62," Except on our side, what happens is you are able to protest."
1831.62,1832.82, They say it themselves.
1832.82,1837.2, The media controls the narrative and the media is elite filled.
1837.2,1839.26," On our side, we do not need the media."
1839.26,1841.62, We can have people protesting on the streets.
1841.62,1843.86, We can have people submitting petitions.
1843.86,1845.12, This is a unique exclusive
1845.12,1850.72, benefit that only we get. We get better cooperation when it comes to actually pursuing economic
1850.72,1856.0," reparations. Why? Because when our side, when you slowly immerse into a democratic system,"
1856.0,1861.52, people themselves see the need as a fruit of democratic discussion that land distribution
1861.52,1865.52," is necessary. On their side, they blindly follow liberal leaders."
1865.52,1867.5," On our side, you still have these leaders."
1867.5,1869.72," You still have a post-independent society,"
1869.72,1871.1, because we think the likelihood is
1871.1,1875.04, that you have someone that is either the sun or the liberation
1875.04,1876.48, leader themselves.
1876.48,1878.18, We think you're still able to gather people.
1878.18,1879.76, You're still able to galvanize people.
1879.76,1881.66," But on our side, crucially, you still"
1881.66,1883.88, have less international scrutiny.
1883.88,1891.14," We think with time, McCarthyism does die out after, say, the 1970s. We think you're able to then get better on our side."
1891.4,1896.56," Now, why do we get less toxic spheres? This is something we absolutely win on panel because you"
1896.56,1901.64," do not respond to it. Or even tells you that there are heaps of conflicts within these societies,"
1901.64,1910.08," meaning to say, let us cite the white and the blacks for now right what we think is important also is the tribal conflicts we're able to settle ethnic"
1910.08,1914.76, conflicts with Democratic negotiation we think that's easier to do that with the political
1914.76,1920.28, capacity that democracy brings you on the other hand when land comes into play you tend to take
1920.28,1930.44," take things personally they try to make it seem like negotiation will be fruitful without democracy. I really don't see why. Argument three then, on which side gets better foreign relations"
1930.44,1935.06, and investment? This is an independent path typically. They say we need to solve the problem
1935.06,1939.86, of no resources on our side too. Here's how we do that. This is not contingent on whether the
1939.86,1945.34," democracy is fully functioning or not, because this is contingent only on the existing of a good"
1945.34,1950.44, political system now why does in this why does investment matter panel you are a poor country
1950.44,1955.42, that has been deprived of land power and resources and there are virtually no Industries that exist
1955.42,1960.7, post Independence the only actors here that can help you are those of foreign investors this means
1960.7,1965.12, the amount of money the nation can get in the future is going to be far more than what
1965.12,1969.84, there is now and we secure that. This is also non-contingent on whether the leader actually
1969.84,1975.12, has good incentives or not. Which actors invest? Foreign companies and NGOs of the west are
1975.12,1980.64, irreplaceable. Why? Because they are by miles the richest actor that can invest in other countries.
1980.64,1989.68," Their history of acquiring resources through colonization, their presence of strong institutions help them incentivize foreign investment. We give them two unique"
1989.68,1994.08," benefits that they mitigate. First, we give businesses guaranteed rights to democratic"
1994.08,1998.76, checks and balances. Businesses from the West are used to certain legal practices and norms
1998.76,2003.56," like guaranteed property rights, IP laws, and civil liberties, which means more familiarity."
2004.02,2005.96, They let this be when you have
2005.96,2011.72," people previously owned property forcibly seized and redistributed, especially white contacts that"
2011.72,2016.28," you know. This is bad for business confidence. Secondly, we think during the Cold War, there is"
2016.28,2021.24, heaps of backlash about everything that is even remotely socialist. The US is increasingly
2021.24,2025.64, McCarthyist. They have an incentive as the torchbearers of democracy
2025.64,2029.24, to actively invest in countries that show democratic potential.
2029.52,2031.38, We instantly got that.
2031.56,2032.42, They mitigate it.
2032.66,2035.4," Now, before I get into even their best case in terms of FDI,"
2035.58,2036.16, I'll take a few.
2036.28,2038.8," You wanted to co-opt all of our economic benefits,"
2038.94,2040.16, such as land redistribution.
2040.5,2044.06, So then deal with your own harms of tribal individuals feeling robbed.
2044.16,2049.24, Why are you exclusive and not able to suffer these same harms if you want the same policies just later on?
2049.24,2057.84," I think I made that painfully clear. Later on, democracy works, you have more accountability, you are able to have peaceful negotiation."
2058.28,2069.92," On their side, the powerful tribe can just seize the land of the less powerful tribe and there'll be no one to hold them accountable there'll be no systems of protest time is the factor here we do co-opt your benefits"
2069.92,2075.88, their best case panel is this they get investment but they get investment from the ussr because the
2075.88,2081.42, ussr has a history of going towards socialist orientations and that like that's more likely
2081.42,2089.84, on their side why is this dependence in the ussr bad because the ussr is inefficient as they have no competition in their economy making inefficient machinery also
2089.84,2095.6, it lost the cold war it was in the ussr's incentive to prefer dictatorships over democracies
2095.6,2099.76, because they are far more non-reliant on the changing mood of the populace and easier for
2099.76,2104.4, them to control meaning they actively tried to create them and bribe leaders accordingly what
2104.4,2108.14," are the implications of this we have more more jobs, more economic upliftment,"
2108.24,2112.6, and food security for millions of people over the span of decades. We're able to get
2112.6,2117.52, Western FDI and low-interest loans while giving African countries the sovereignty they deserve.
2117.52,2130.16, We have a long-term cash cow on team opposition. we win this debate
2131.52,2144.0, and i'm second off um
2145.06,2148.12, uh hi am I audible?
2150.92,2153.64," Alright, I'll take POIs in the chat."
2158.56,2159.4," Starting in 3, 2, 1."
2166.08,2170.96," The fight to elevate post-colonial Africa was always meant to be a war against poverty, not against poor people. The problem with the opposition case was a misunderstanding of context. This was not the"
2170.96,2176.16, modern-day Western world. This was 20th century Africa that was rife with poverty and inequality
2176.16,2180.96, when the colonizers left. They can preach of democracy all they want and say accountability
2180.96,2190.0," 10 times in the same minute, but when real and visceral suffering occurred, that was blood on their hands. All of the economic context you hear from First Prop went completely"
2190.0,2194.52," unengaged with by this opposition team. Because I want you to know, if you really look at your notes,"
2194.78,2198.12," their only strategy was just to squirrel around the burden and counter-assert,"
2198.36,2203.4," hey, here's another issue, but only prop-weight specifically both of these concerns with one"
2203.4,2206.94, another. The only thing we heard later on was that some of these policies
2206.94,2209.92," were likely to be given to people anyways, that people won't be dirt poor."
2210.3,2213.7," Obviously, it's true that people will still have some food on the table."
2213.7,2217.36," The question was, was that enough to break you out of the poverty cycle?"
2217.6,2219.56, Was that enough for social mobilization?
2219.9,2222.62, Was that enough for Black people who have been historically oppressed
2222.62,2227.46," to be able to build businesses and start up their own communities, even if they are oppressed by the majority?"
2227.74,2231.34, There was a baseline low-hanging fruit that team opposition wanted to argue for.
2231.54,2233.28, They could not co-opt our benefits.
2233.8,2235.16, Let's clarify the burden here.
2235.42,2241.16, I think the first opposition set an extremely high burden for themselves because they not wanted to defend a democracy.
2241.24,2245.82," They wanted to defend a healthy, flourishing democracy because all of"
2245.82,2250.88," their principles and impacts were contingent upon this initial claim, which meant, given our second"
2250.88,2256.2, argument from first prop explains to you why most of these democracies aren't going to be as healthy
2256.2,2261.38," and as inclusive as they claim, because wealth begets the most power within that democracy,"
2261.38,2265.02, means all of their principles don't fall because their initial
2265.02,2270.52, representation does not work. Given we've proven that people with most amount of power control the
2270.52,2275.62," levers of the democracy, their representation does not stand. But the second thing I want to do is"
2275.62,2280.34, that most of their harms just stem from the original premise that there is conflict. But
2280.34,2284.52, the reason why conflict doesn't make sense is because of First Ops' own setup. They say that
2284.52,2288.8, people have similar wants. If it's true that different ethnicities and tribes have similar
2288.8,2292.96, similar ones then going to conflict makes absolutely no sense because they will lose
2292.96,2297.36, the common goal they will lose resources and they will lose their property and lands clearly if
2297.36,2302.0, they have a common goal we can use that same common goal to be able to extract concessions
2302.0,2308.24," from the colonizers to be able to get these economic and land reparations together. So we have common goals, we're just using the same common goals"
2308.24,2312.88," to be able to make all of us more wealthy. Team UAE lost this debate not because of our responses,"
2313.1,2317.54," because of the way their own case responds to itself. So therefore, what is the burden here?"
2317.86,2322.12," We explained that they have to prove now why their democracy was likely to be very, very good,"
2322.22,2329.52, because that was what they set up for themselves. comparison they have to provide status quo where most countries actively used civil and political
2329.52,2334.16, rights were going to be successful most of the failures you've seen is what countries in africa
2334.16,2338.32, have been just have been put in very destitute situations and they have to engage with those
2338.32,2342.72, contexts specifically if we're able to prove that economic and land reparations would be way better
2342.72,2345.1, for these people we were already winning this debate.
2346.44,2347.14," Before that, I'll be happy to take a point."
2354.96,2355.76," Right. If governments are inherently racist or democracies are never flourishing, then how do you ever get equitable distribution of land?"
2359.94,2360.26," First, both sides assume it's the same actor, it's the same government."
2368.26,2368.74," So clearly, if it's a bad faith actor, then none of your rights will also be equitably distributed because the people at the top want to preserve their power for themselves."
2375.0,2375.98," Second, assuming they were still allowed to be racist or any forms of bigotry, laws and rights are contingent upon enforcement."
2380.9,2381.04," So just because it's written in the Constitution, we protect your right to property, we protect your right to free speech."
2389.14,2393.3," If you are still racist, then they're likely to not have enforcement. But secondly, I think the way this works is most of the racism doesn't come directly from the get go because clearly at this point, all tribes have the common goal of exiling the oppressor."
2393.5,2398.34," So once the colonizer has left, you don't have these forms of innately evil incentives. Most"
2398.34,2402.12, of these things only come because you're able to hijack the political system. So given that we've
2402.12,2408.4, told you the hijacking of the political system comes from the way you're able to hoard wealth from first prop that went completely unresponded
2408.4,2412.42," to, this does not stand. So even if we don't get complete benevolence, the way it works is because"
2412.42,2416.26," we don't have these innate incentives from the very get-go, means you're better able to hold"
2416.26,2421.08," them accountable over time. First issue, can we actually get our policy? So I want to note they"
2421.08,2428.24, have two main responses here. The first is that they claim in second op that economic issues are not the expertise of liberation leaders. I want you to review
2428.24,2432.2," your notes and consider whether this is persuasive. Because clearly, if you want to build an entire"
2432.2,2436.74," democracy from ground up, you also needed assistance. So if you wanted technocrats and"
2436.74,2441.3," consultants to build your political institutions, clearly we could get the same people as well."
2441.3,2445.4," But second, their side claims that this will to major conflict in the inter-tribes"
2445.4,2451.22, but what's the comparative presumably if wealthy ethnicities were so invested in preserve preserving
2451.22,2456.74, their own power and wealth then they will also be very averse to giving up political rights because
2456.74,2461.0, it means that other ethnicities can challenge democracy can use the free media and free speech
2461.0,2468.38," to challenge their Authority so once again we need to assume some good faith under the side prop, the reason why they will want to give up those lands is because they can"
2468.38,2474.38," use the rhetoric of, we are revitalizing the economy, we are reducing poverty, we're attracting"
2474.38,2480.32," investment, we are reclaiming the land that was once stolen by the colonizing oppressors, and that"
2480.32,2484.5," is why it's likely to be something that gets popular support as well. But then later on, they"
2484.5,2486.48," claimed they wanted to co-opt our benefits,"
2486.76,2489.12," which I want to note, concedes the merit of our policy."
2489.38,2491.36," So if they want to claim 20 years down the line,"
2491.52,2493.44," they also want to co-opt the benefits of this,"
2493.62,2495.44," getting the land redistribution back,"
2495.44,2497.74, then clearly you also have to make the majority mad
2497.74,2499.94, because you still have to seize their land at some point.
2500.18,2503.92," The difference here is that if you wait 20 years to seize their land in the future,"
2504.18,2508.0, that's when they've already hijacked the political system because of their wealth so if they wanted to
2508.0,2512.0, be mad at you and they'll be mad at you far worse on their side because you're not on equal ground
2512.0,2515.52, immediately post-independence is when it's the most equal ground because that's when we can
2515.52,2520.4, reconstruct our society to a new level then therefore if given we've proven this is able
2520.4,2524.96, to work here are three categorical pieces of weighing for what economic and land reparations
2524.96,2529.26," need to be prioritized the first was that in terms of the immediate outcome,"
2529.62,2533.34, given that you're able to alleviate the most excessive problems that exist in status quo.
2533.52,2537.86," So clearly not all of them have no food on the table, but we're able to enable people to break"
2537.86,2542.46," a poverty cycle, which affects everyone on that on a good level. But second, I want you to know"
2542.46,2545.28, that votes are still likely to be highly unimpactful
2545.28,2549.44, because you're delegating your political power to someone else and they make decisions on behalf
2549.44,2553.52, of you the difference here is that money gives you autonomy for you to decide what's best for
2553.52,2558.0, yourself political votes are way more uncertain in terms of outcome because you may vote for someone
2558.0,2562.0, else but you still have other interests that are still ignored so for example if there are three
2562.0,2569.28, ethnicities but only two of those ethnicities get their elected representatives in power that one ethnicity is still like to be ignored per their
2569.28,2572.88, own analysis that they're likely to have differences within them the difference is that
2572.88,2577.84, wealth is getting given towards those communities even if some communities have less are still
2577.84,2582.24, oppressed under our side because of differences the difference is wealth can then protect yourself
2582.24,2585.8," you can create self-sustaining communities. You can then trade with different things,"
2585.82,2587.4, which means that you remove your biases
2587.4,2589.38, and say this is a person from another ethnicity
2589.38,2591.62, because we're all engaging on economic grounds.
2591.9,2593.28, The second thing I want to talk about here
2593.28,2595.46, is the ability to exercise our rights.
2595.78,2596.8, Prop simplifies the debate.
2597.1,2598.84," From the start, we were charitable and took the trade-off."
2598.84,2600.42," Yes, you would get votes."
2600.54,2601.5," Yes, you get free speech."
2601.68,2602.84, That was low-hanging fruit
2602.84,2608.88, because instead of claiming you could get free speech and free association you have to prove why it was meaningful we told you why
2608.88,2613.74, when you have all these people and also meant that the people the people in power are the ones that
2613.74,2617.88, are most likely to be able to use these levers of the political institutions things like you'll
2617.88,2621.18, never be able you're able to go to court but whether you can win the court case is something
2621.18,2628.48, entirely different I want to note that their response here was saying people can vote in democracy to tackle any issue by taking them on your best possible grounds
2628.48,2632.56, democracy needed bypassing bureaucracy you need to compete with other public policies such as
2632.56,2637.28, criminal justice or education the final thing was then about fdi their claim was the fdi from the
2637.28,2642.32, west comes here first fdi is more likely to happen on our side because the wealth is more equitably
2642.32,2649.28, distributed the natural resources are able to have more disposable incomes for all consumers but second even if the west refused to enter we still
2649.28,2653.12, have the briggs investment bank we have the bri from china who are still willing to invest even
2653.12,2657.04, if you're not completely democratic but thirdly it ignores the initial premise that we proved to
2657.04,2661.84, you from our third argument which went unresponded to which eventually people become more politically
2661.84,2666.02, literate become people become more politically conscious when you're able to have this
2666.02,2668.06, wealth in your hands. The conclusion
2668.06,2669.96, of this is it's time we call it for what it is.
2670.14,2672.32, The failure for land reforms was state-sanctioned
2672.32,2673.98, violence we are very proud to propose.
2677.88,2679.86," I'd like the third drop, and then"
2679.86,2680.58, I'd like the third off.
2683.84,2691.9, Am I audible and visible? the third off uh am i audible invisible
2691.9,2692.9, uis
2692.9,2711.68, all right All right.
2714.7,2715.3," Three, two, one, go."
2716.8,2716.86," Ladies and gentlemen, I must say,"
2718.08,2720.38, today is Malaysia's lucky day because I've chosen to be extremely charitable to that case.
2720.9,2721.72," Now, let's understand."
2721.82,2722.72, Let me take them at their best.
2722.8,2729.2," Let's assume money is the most important thing in this debate, that is what is going to guarantee the african people get real development"
2729.2,2732.56, so let's look at the two areas of class in this debate that actually matter number one fdi and
2732.56,2736.88, number two i'll be talking about equitability and development beyond that but let's look at fdi the
2736.88,2742.48, responses to this clash were equal to the amount of resources africa had back then in their backward
2742.48,2746.38," economy very limited because not only have they chosen not to reply to this,"
2746.54,2748.04," they tell us China and BRI,"
2748.26,2750.9," which happened like 30, 40 years after this period of time."
2751.2,2753.24," So we tell you, what have we told you about this clash?"
2753.3,2755.14," We firstly told you that because of these limited resources,"
2755.48,2758.92, they desperately need businesses from especially the West
2758.92,2760.32, who have large amounts of resources
2760.32,2761.96, to actually invest in the long run.
2762.2,2763.22," These long-term investments,"
2763.22,2764.6," not only from these businesses,"
2764.74,2768.14, but also the countries in the West and also multilateral institutions
2768.14,2772.0, are guaranteed on our side because of the democratic signaling that took place during
2772.0,2775.7," the civil war, during the Cold War period. And we tell you that because of the fact that the"
2775.7,2780.04, United States wants to portray this idea of democracy and also these businesses. Why do
2780.04,2783.42," we tell you this? We tell you firstly, these businesses fear nationalization. We think that"
2783.42,2787.76, these businesses are also more likely to invest in areas that are more economically stable or more likely
2787.76,2792.0, politically stable because we think that those guarantee better long-term investment areas
2792.0,2796.0, thirdly we tell you as i said earlier that no one really cares about the fairness of the economy in
2796.0,2800.8, the beginning they care more about the fact that they have to be supporting democratic countries
2800.8,2807.76, and that signaling is extremely important in this period of time so what do they tell us then they say china i've already told you how that's a bad actor and i
2807.76,2811.32, mean how that's an irrelevant actor because they weren't really in a position to invest at this
2811.32,2815.42, period of time but what actor actually ends up investing is the ussr we told you how the ussr
2815.42,2819.22, is a bad actor because of the fact that they have unstable investment they literally broke down
2819.22,2822.8, like a couple of decades later and moreover we tell you that their incentive is completely
2822.8,2827.42, different from the west because their incentive is not to maintain this democratic signaling therefore they have no checks
2827.42,2830.96, and balances on the way they actually invest which means these investing processes are largely
2830.96,2835.4, unaccountable and largely feed into like particular dictatorships and autocratic governments in these
2835.4,2840.22, african regions and moreover we tell you that that incentive is to control because they can do so by
2840.22,2844.4, establishing good trust and faith with these dictatorships and control the resources of africa
2844.4,2848.66, meaning this is bad but even at their best case let's assume the West does actually invest. I'm
2848.66,2851.44," going to, even though they didn't mention this, I'm going to say, okay, let's assume the West"
2851.44,2855.66," actually does invest. We think this West actor is actually bad because we think that the West,"
2855.98,2860.22," when investing in a non-democratic country, firstly has no sort of political government"
2860.22,2863.72," that can actually engage with them democratically, which means they're more likely to be hostile"
2863.72,2866.88, and they're more likely to actually look to try and displace far.
2866.88,2871.28, This looks like the US in the Middle East where they were forced to try and change up
2871.28,2872.82, the political stability of the country.
2872.82,2874.56, This of course creates political vacuums moreover.
2874.56,2878.48," Thirdly, we tell you this can also create proxy wars between the US and the USSR, creating"
2878.48,2880.44, further political instability in the region.
2880.44,2884.34, Forty lack of public transparency also means that the US can engage with this government
2884.34,2888.86, without actually the people knowing what's going on without them having the option to actually hold
2888.86,2892.16, their government accountable for these foreign relations so we already win on this slash this
2892.16,2896.3, is an independent path to victory we're giving you this money we have more money on our side
2896.3,2900.0, because the amount of money that they're trying to redistribute is very limited we have money in
2900.0,2903.28, the long run and that's coming from outside and we think this foreign investment is extremely
2903.28,2907.6, important in the development of the technology industry and also the development of agriculture and things
2907.6,2911.2, like that coming to the another area of clash which is the clash i must give credit to i mean
2911.2,2915.12, they have engaged with this at least so let's look at equitability in development right we tell you
2915.12,2919.12, apart from that that front we're also going to win on this front why because we tell you the crux of
2919.12,2923.52, this clash is the fact that we can co-op their benefits prevent their worst harms but they do
2923.52,2925.14, not get our best benefits.
2929.24,2932.66," Why? Let's assume for a second, my first and second speaker told you extensively why these leaders who are going to be carrying out these actions, going to be carrying out these depredations"
2932.66,2936.58," have bad incentives. But I'm going to assume for their sake, because I want to be charitable today,"
2936.8,2940.08, I'm going to assume these are great people with great incentives. They love their country. They
2940.08,2947.08, love their nation. I'm particularly talking about people who have the political will and capital to actually go on doing these land distribution methods.
2947.46,2949.04," Firstly, when they say economic rights"
2949.04,2952.06," will somehow give access to healthcare,"
2952.34,2954.34," education, quotas and jobs, wow."
2954.76,2957.3," The problem is there are no jobs to give quotas in, right?"
2957.3,2959.32, We tell you that this is an underutilized economy
2959.32,2960.84," where this massive inflation,"
2961.02,2962.52, it's economically unstable.
2962.78,2964.36, So the immediate short-term impacts
2964.36,2968.56, of this economic sort of benefit doesn't really exist really there isn't enough domestic money
2968.56,2972.96, to distribute in the form of cash transfers we tell you that the the nation is yet to tap into
2972.96,2977.04, these natural resources and they have no expertise or methods to actually go about doing so thirdly
2977.04,2981.28, these leaders are politicians right they are largely father figures probably held out in the
2981.28,2988.32, freedom movement and whatnot these people have no experience in economic policy ladies and gentlemen let's not forget land distribution at this scale especially in a
2988.32,2994.62, like an area like africa is a radical policy that involves so much of like good economic expertise
2994.62,2998.5, now of course to this they have an interesting response when i ask this pui they say well you
2998.5,3003.0, need resources even expertise even for like political institutions to create them as well
3003.0,3007.9, firstly you need less political resources or less resources in general in order to create
3007.9,3008.74, political institutions.
3009.0,3012.62," Secondly, we told you we get foreign help that's exclusive to our side because multilateral"
3012.62,3016.0, institutions like the United Nations set up special agencies for Africa.
3016.28,3020.04, They will only assist Africa if these nations choose to want to become democratic.
3020.38,3023.24," They don't want to, especially in the time of the Cold War, these multilateral institutions"
3023.24,3026.4, are unlikely to help these countries set up autocratic institutions.
3026.6,3029.38, And we don't think they will look to entrench these autocratic institutions even further
3029.38,3032.78," as well, which is why you won't be able to create democracy in the future as well."
3033.14,3037.12," Now, moreover, as my second speaker told you, it's easier to set up political institutions."
3037.46,3039.44, You're more likely to mess up economic policy.
3039.6,3044.42," But coming to what happens if these leaders actually manage to redistribute well, we tell"
3044.42,3045.06," you, even if these leaders successfully manage to redistribute well we tell you even if these"
3045.06,3049.52, leaders successfully manage to create these quotas create this brilliant land distribution everything
3049.52,3053.84, in the one actually happens we still think this is a short-term issue we tell you that we give
3053.84,3057.84, you an example of the great leap forward in china we tell you how these autocratic governments even
3057.84,3060.88, in the temporary period they're able to create these short-term sort of economic gratification
3060.88,3067.82," because of lack of like number one because of lack of checks and balances they you're entrenching greater power in these people right number two we tell you because of lack of like number one, because of lack of checks and balances, they are intention greater power in these people, right?"
3067.82,3069.98," Number two, we tell you because of lack of the transparency"
3069.98,3072.34, of information and accountability within the system
3072.34,3075.08, of like actually going about executing these policies
3075.08,3076.38, or whatever they try to create.
3076.38,3078.5," We think that in the long run, what tends to happen"
3078.5,3081.04, is that eventually last decisions and things like that
3081.04,3082.76, overturn these economic benefits.
3082.76,3084.12," We think that in the long run,"
3084.12,3085.36, you're still not to be able to guarantee
3085.36,3086.9, economic policy is going to be good.
3087.18,3089.82, And we don't really get any mechanization from them on this.
3090.06,3091.48," Thirdly, we tell you that these leaders"
3091.48,3093.62," are particularly people who, as they said,"
3093.8,3094.54, care about their nation
3094.54,3095.74," and probably likely to do something,"
3095.92,3097.26, they want to do something good for their country.
3097.54,3098.76, We think this is particularly bad
3098.76,3100.4, because these are leaders who think
3100.4,3101.78, that they're the only ones who can actually do
3101.78,3102.74, what's good for their country.
3103.04,3104.1," Therefore, they're more likely to think"
3104.1,3106.86, that their unilateral decisions are right and self-justify for it.
3107.04,3110.08," And moreover, they have the ability to coerce the public and make them believe that,"
3110.08,3114.14," you know what, we're doing this for the benefit of the nation and people have no choice but to listen to them."
3114.4,3118.96," We tell you that, we give you the example of Hitler, who probably thought he was doing what's right for Germany."
3119.2,3121.56, And this is exactly how autocratic governments are created.
3121.86,3127.68," Number four, there's no incentive for people with so much power and the belief that they're going to do good for the country to actually end up creating"
3127.68,3132.16, democratic institutions in the future so what do we tell you we they don't get democracy we can
3132.16,3136.24, still get all that money which i told you my first area of clash but moreover on the point of ethnic
3136.24,3142.4, tensions but before that poi you seen 01 that people are united by their hatred for the colonizer
3142.4,3146.88, who is the us your entire model of development is contingent on the same governments
3146.88,3148.48, collaborating with these oppressors.
3148.48,3150.28, Why on earth would the people stand for this?
3150.28,3151.64," Okay, firstly, there are different actors."
3151.64,3154.44," We think that the oppressors, the colonizers, at least from the past,"
3154.56,3156.28, are not necessarily the same institutions.
3156.28,3159.52, Like the United States is not necessarily the colonizing part
3159.52,3161.44, of the African people actively hate.
3161.44,3164.96," Moreover, even if these African people actually want to sort of prevent"
3164.96,3168.76, their governments from forming these relations from these particular countries like
3168.76,3173.32," the United Kingdom or France, we still think that they at least have the option to do so by keeping"
3173.32,3177.32," these governments accountable. And because of the transparency of information, they can control what"
3177.32,3180.82," kind of foreign relations, what kind of powers they collaborate with. Moreover, at least we have"
3180.82,3184.46," multilateral institutions investing. We don't even have that. So even if it's not particular countries,"
3184.6,3185.52, we still get that FDI.
3185.82,3188.46," One of our ethnic tensions, we tell you, is a lot worse among tribes."
3188.72,3192.32," We tell you, leaders are forced to affiliate with certain tribes and prioritize their needs,"
3192.56,3195.94, which means when they talk about how the black majority is probably not going to have enough
3195.94,3199.7," power, you're actually letting the white majority control the narrative, at least to some extent."
3199.94,3202.7," Even if, okay, sure, it's not going to be great levels of accountability."
3202.72,3204.94," On our side, these black people at least have a voice."
3205.22,3207.5, The minorities have a voice and these ethnic tensions
3207.5,3209.26, can actually be negotiated peacefully
3209.26,3210.4, through democratic means.
3210.4,3212.38, We at least have some methods of accountability
3212.38,3214.82, in the short term and we create better long-term governments.
3214.82,3216.32, We actually have money on our side.
3216.32,3217.66, You don't have any of this to win this debate.
3217.66,3218.5, Thank you.
3221.32,3227.0, I thank the third speaker and I invite the author to reply.
3227.0,3231.0, I'm going to begin in.
3231.0,3235.0," Okay, give me a sec."
3235.0,3239.0, I'm going to begin in 321.
3239.0,3253.0," I'm personally insulted today, because I spent three minutes of my life, I'll never get back, You spent three minutes of yours noting it down, and the spectators spent three minutes looking at me speak about FDI."
3253.0,3266.48," Their only response to this is that they get FDI from China as well through the Belt and Road Initiative panel, which was founded in 2013. I was seven years old when the Belt and Broad Initiative came out and I promise"
3266.48,3272.24, you I was not born in post-colonial Africa. If there is urgency on their side of the house to
3272.24,3278.54," actually address things like economic distribution, they do not get, they cannot count on FDI that"
3278.54,3284.8, comes 30 years later. We win this debate on FDI. Umar spends only 40 seconds actually responding
3284.8,3285.2, to this.
3285.46,3289.88, They assert that wealth is equitably distributed and that's why the West contributes.
3290.16,3293.88," We tell you that even if it is, there are two reasons the West does not contribute."
3294.18,3305.0," One, that businesses are scared of going to a socialist place simply because they've heard from their white or like white contacts within these nations that land is being seized, land is being distributed,"
3309.74,3314.68," and that property is volatile. And secondly, because of things like McCarthyism, because of the fact that you're unlikely to actually want to like go to a socialist state, because the backlash"
3314.68,3320.8," you face from your own people as the torchbearers of democracy, as the first people to engage in"
3320.8,3326.46," capitalism, you do not get FDI from the West. They give us an even if and say China BRI."
3326.96,3332.76," Obviously, that's not in the scope of any debate, even closely dissembling anything before 2012."
3332.76,3340.72," We tell you then that not only do they miss out on Western funding that we exclusively get, and this is an independent path and I'll prove that later."
3341.02,3346.66," They also have a harmful actor in the form of the USSR, because the USSR steps in"
3346.66,3351.8," where the West doesn't. And we tell you these have insane harms, because the USSR is unstable."
3351.8,3357.5," They lost the Cold War. We tell you that the USSR has a tendency to become dictatorial,"
3357.68,3362.08," become autocratic. This is even worse for their economic and land redistribution,"
3362.38,3366.24," because you're giving it to an autocracy. Now, why does this win us to this bit?"
3366.24,3369.18," Because you can distribute land even to its best,"
3369.18,3371.56," 120% on their side of the house,"
3371.56,3374.12, but the land is still inherently unproductive
3374.12,3375.94, because of the fact that the country
3375.94,3378.16," has been plundered by colonizers,"
3378.16,3380.5," because of the fact that there are no industries in place,"
3380.5,3382.8, because the British took everything.
3382.8,3384.64," Even in the most equitable manner,"
3384.64,3385.6," the West is still much better on our side of the house, because the West is the. Even in the most equitable manner, the West is still"
3385.6,3390.18, much better on our side of the house because the West is the richest actor in the world. The West
3390.18,3394.58," gets Africa into the Commonwealth. Literally, because it's more money, we still win this debate."
3394.82,3399.24," I find it quite funny that their speaker says, well, why would you want to take money from Britain"
3399.24,3404.18, after everything they did to you? Because they did everything to me and now I get to feast on
3404.18,3409.56, their money. Simple response. We get equitable land redistribution. This is a second independent
3409.56,3414.18, path to victory that we don't need but we get anyway. But this isn't important because they
3414.18,3419.5, don't get equitable distribution. We tell you on our side that you have bad on their side you have
3419.5,3423.98, bad actors just like you have on ours. You have people that are elite. You have people with
3423.98,3429.6, political affiliations. People that are power hungry. We tell you liberation leaders are unnecessarily
3429.6,3435.3, glorified because of the fact that they made certain sacrifices that other people did. But
3435.3,3438.96, we don't think that the selfless individuals people make them out to be. We do think that
3438.96,3450.48," they do have political affiliations. Their response to this is that it's symmetric, but panels that cannot be enough, because if we rely on flourishing democracy, they rely on equitable distribution."
3450.98,3455.74, They cannot simply say that we don't get equitable distribution either. But here's why it's not
3455.74,3461.1," symmetric, because on our side, as democracy progresses, as democracy grows, and you eventually"
3461.1,3466.0," have equitable land redistribution, you're able to counteract corrupt forces."
3466.3,3468.58, You're able to counteract the power hungry.
3468.92,3472.3, You're able to mitigate conflict with peace negotiation.
3472.6,3474.54, You're able to do so with protests.
3474.84,3475.68," On their side of the house,"
3475.88,3478.2, let's assume the government does everything right.
3478.42,3481.5, It is still likely then that a powerful tribe
3481.5,3484.06," feasts on a minority, seizes their land,"
3484.18,3486.32, and then the minority has nothing they
3486.32,3490.56, can do because they do not have democratic frameworks that help them protest that help
3490.56,3496.48, them form general assembly as our first speaker said so proud to have won this debate do give it
3496.48,3505.0, to us i thank opera fly and invite shop reply.
3505.0,3510.0," Yeah, I assume I'm audible."
3510.0,3517.0," Okay, good."
3517.0,3526.24, Starting in 321. one. The same way I think it's a shame I have to spend four minutes walking through Team UAE
3526.24,3530.92," with your hand held in order to understand the proposition case, I think that truly is a shame"
3530.92,3536.14, as well. Because the reason why opposition needs to lose this debate is because they could not
3536.14,3542.44, continuously argue for equity because they argued a democracy and they had to accept any and all
3542.44,3545.14, outcomes that individuals voted for and how the political system
3545.14,3549.9, existed. So they couldn't unilaterally blanketly say that in the end we will economically
3549.9,3554.54, redistribute and everyone will be fine. You needed to defend the status quo and note that they kept
3554.54,3559.78, on trying to pin the African status quo to us when a majority of African states chose more civil
3559.78,3564.26, rights than economic rights. So the institutions that are corrupt right now are a byproduct of
3564.26,3569.76," opposition's world, not ours. That in in those same instances that was the democratic process that they protected"
3569.76,3574.4, and never actually ensured individuals on the ground even when gave each and every person
3574.4,3579.2, a vote three clashes in the speech number one an immediate relief versus the rights on paper
3579.2,3583.52, secondly as to wealth as a prerequisite to mechanizing political rights and thirdly how
3583.52,3585.04, economic empowerment sets up
3585.04,3587.32, the condition of a healthy democracy.
3587.32,3589.3, Not only I think opposition in the first class
3589.3,3591.94," continuously tries to engage in a false model,"
3591.94,3594.2, because when African-Americans and women in the US
3594.2,3597.04," had no political rights, that did not mean we defaulted"
3597.04,3599.12, and we are an autocracy and a regime.
3599.12,3601.84," They constantly try to engage in that contextualization,"
3601.84,3603.7, and that is the reason why they can't actually
3603.7,3608.72, engage in our argumentations. And they were highly parallel and non-comparative we use and the only thing they
3608.72,3613.78, have left standing is would we distribute fairly we gave you three mechanizations and three attacks
3613.78,3618.36, that were never actually dealt with and responded to we use number one ops own context against them
3618.36,3622.86, op when explaining why implementing civil and political rights will be done well said that most
3622.86,3629.44, individuals want to work together after coming out of colonial oppression so when we redistribute land if we all wanted to work
3629.44,3634.16, together we wouldn't have the levels of conflict and levels of injustice given we all would likely
3634.16,3639.12, agree to that we told you secondly their analysis was symmetrical it was sufficient because you are
3639.12,3643.12, the only team in this debate trying to argue against the mechanization for any impacts to
3643.12,3648.0, occur because they wanted to defend literally nothing because if we can't implement our policies and we also
3648.0,3651.28, do not have political rights there is no comparative in this debate the same way you
3651.28,3655.6, would install your own family members as members of government would likely apply to you but last
3655.6,3659.92, we say that even when you don't have enough money and know that it's engaged in their best case
3659.92,3664.24, in their best and not their worst because we assume that they will be able to enforce all of
3664.24,3668.26, their rights we told you number one that you always had the initial capital to
3668.26,3672.92, spur and give cash handouts to individuals that you would use to set up and enforce your
3672.92,3677.8, democratic structures. But land redistribution and quotas literally required signing a bill.
3677.8,3681.16, We never understood why it did not require any money. Their only response later on in
3681.16,3688.24, Third Op was that there aren't enough actual jobs. But we think that the job creation and the fdi was the thing that created it not that therefore the only thing
3688.24,3693.28, left standing from them is the idea that they have fdi we told you in a first argumentation
3693.28,3698.16, what fdi was perverse on their side they just never wanted to actually engage with it and try
3698.16,3702.48, to claim it as their own the only thing that that that's the only thing left standing for how they
3702.48,3707.96, can clock our benefits or else up to this debate from force because they never actually engaged in the trade-off or the
3707.96,3712.64, comparative they said that they have more trust because they're not a quasi-democracy we told you
3712.64,3717.04, that the u.s for example or the idea that your democracy is not the singular thing as to what
3717.04,3721.78, determines fbi investment we told you that in third proposition the u.s massively trades trades
3721.78,3727.36," with the ccp a communist regime and a democracy, but there are strong trade relations."
3727.36,3733.76," They didn't even hear our first argument on resource extraction because we said purchasing power is what created good FDI,"
3734.02,3740.18, to set up infrastructure as opposed to FDI where they steal and rob your diamond mines and rob oil from individuals.
3740.3,3743.68," They caught nothing in this debate, no comparative, no trade-off, their burden fails."
3744.42,3748.94," Secondly, I as well pre- prerequisite to mechanizing political rights we told you why their case is"
3748.94,3753.92, their case and ours and ours comes prior we told you in terms of weakening lobbyists and
3753.92,3758.18, platforming and allowing participation required money in order to correct these social imbalances
3758.18,3762.44, that were previously entrenched because of colonialism the current the status quo right
3762.44,3768.52," now of corruption and imbalances isn't because, oh, the democratic structure was corrupt. It's because the colonialists set up these structures."
3768.76,3773.24," We corrected it. Lastly, no engagement to economic empowerment. We told you how we slowly mobilized"
3773.24,3776.92, individuals to levels of political consciousness where we would eventually set up a strong
3776.92,3780.96," democracy where individuals actually held them accountable, side with the prox."
