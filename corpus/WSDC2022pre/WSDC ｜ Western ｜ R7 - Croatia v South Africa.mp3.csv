0.0,6.92," Now, on the motion, this House prefers a world in which post-colonial African states had"
6.92,12.4," prioritized achieving economic and land reparations over enshrining civil and political rights,"
12.4,16.24, I would like to welcome the first speaker of the proposition to open this debate.
16.24,17.24, Thank you.
17.24,24.32," When it comes to POIs, I'll just put them in the chat, please."
24.32,26.26," If everybody's ready. I'm sorry. When it comes to POIs, I just put them in the chat, please."
28.0,29.5, Everybody's ready? I'm sorry.
40.14,40.42," After the end of apartheid in 1994, it was thought that the Beers, a Dutch mining company that has done horrendous human rights violations in all of Africa, would be called to account for its crimes."
46.0,53.0," But this didn't happen, and the Beers survived untouched because of its stranglehold on the economy. It controlled 85% of companies of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and the new government could simply not risk an economic collapse."
53.0,62.0, This imbalance of power in terms of money and land is keeping Africa under the strong grip of neo-colonialism and keeps democracy as only a pretty word on a paper.
62.0,69.06," That's why redistribution should have been a number one priority for post-colonial Africa. Three substances which will show you why that's the case. First,"
69.06,72.48," an economic ability, second, a bargaining power on an international level, and third,"
72.48,76.74," and our second, a boundary conciliation. Before that, let's use your points of frame. First of"
76.74,80.52," all, this debate takes place in terms of post-colonial Africa, so 60s and 70s of the"
80.52,84.54," last century. In opposition's world, that's when African states have priorities ensuring"
84.54,88.24," civil and political rights, such as rights to vote or rights to protest and the mechanisms for this"
88.24,92.8," were usually either work of civil society groups or protests as such, so think protests that were"
92.8,97.2, part of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Now opposition may have gotten these
97.2,101.28," rights to some extent, however most of these rights still exist solely in paper. Take for"
101.28,109.36," instance Angola's constitution that stands for freedom of protest and speech, but then their government kills protesters just like it did last year when people protested in"
109.36,116.24," the political alternatives through 45-year rule of the governing party. Now that being said,"
116.24,120.48, what is the alternative are economic and land reparations? So these are things such as land
120.48,125.28," redistribution quotas and important experts. So these are quotas and things like food and raw materials,"
125.28,128.16, experts from the colonized nations
128.16,131.44," to their ex-colonized, ex-colonized power."
131.44,133.5," And lastly, these are things such as unconditional cash"
133.5,135.32, transfer to the victims of the colonial rule.
135.32,137.16," Now, why is our alternative likely to be successful?"
137.16,138.04, Two reasons.
138.04,139.54," Firstly, it's because new national governments"
139.54,142.5, need to legitimize themselves because the popularity
142.5,144.62, and success of ruling parties is based on a narrative
144.62,150.08," taken back from the colonizers. Hence, if there is a strong preference for redistribution of capital, the"
150.08,153.68, government is highly incentivized to go through with it. The second reason why it's likely to be
153.68,157.04, successful is simply because the West has an incentive to have good relations with newly
157.04,162.16," founded countries so they can still have access to Africa's raw materials and labors, but also so"
162.16,165.54," they don't side with the USSR, with whom the West is currently"
165.54,170.38," at that time in the Cold War with. And lastly, it's likely to assume that on proposition,"
170.96,174.48," the political situation would at first stay the same. So meaning undemocratic governments,"
174.58,178.94," for instance, are in power and are unlikely to lose the next election. However, this is a trade-off"
178.94,182.48," we're willing to make because in the short term, we enable better economic stability of the people"
182.48,187.92," in Africa, but in the long run as well, we can assure them all with political rights why that's the case i'll be moving on to my first"
187.92,192.56, substantive first on the economic stability so to contextualize there are two things firstly as a
192.56,196.88, consequence of colonization when black people are often banished from their land the land is today
196.88,202.96, highly unequal redistributed among races so this looks like namibia where white people own 70 of
202.96,205.12, land second thing you have to notice is that many of
205.12,209.52," these countries' key industries are agriculture and mining resources, meaning economical branches"
209.52,214.48," directly dependent on land ownership. That being said, what are the two consequences of people not"
214.48,220.4," receiving land and money in the status quo? First, on the individual level, it's impossible to access"
220.4,224.64," social mobility because these people have no land, meaning they cannot grow their food, they cannot"
224.64,228.48," sell it, they cannot rent their land that they cannot exploit the other resources the land"
228.48,233.36, has to offer but moreover there is no social mobility because there is no money for further
233.36,238.0, higher education for these people meaning these people are generally stuck in one exploitative
238.0,243.76, job which is being a farmer on another man's land that is the sole reason 4654 african countries
243.76,245.44, are still in the bottom half of this
245.44,250.16, global social mobility index list the second consequence then on not receiving land or money
250.16,254.72, is simply on a country level of economic uncertainty and poverty this is so because the
254.72,259.44, whole economy is structured in a way that money eventually goes to the hands of the rich or white
259.44,263.92, elite because they're the only one big employer only one big landowner what is the comparative
263.92,268.4, we bring you we tell you if we had a focus first on a problem redistribution of both land and money
268.4,272.16, none of these things would happen to the same extent what would happen instead would be
272.16,276.64, redistribution of land which would enable people to have capital to achieve social mobility or with
276.64,279.92, cash transfer programs people could afford themselves with land or education and as a
279.92,284.56, result of both of these things the impact here would be economic stability because people would
284.56,287.68, have bigger purchasing power because locals would have more control over
287.68,291.58," the production of goods and their prices, and social mobility overall would be provided"
291.58,295.6, a long-term possibility for the development of secondary and tertiary sector as people
295.6,297.32, have more capital for education.
297.32,300.9, Now to preempt opposition that is going to tell you all about how important political
300.9,308.8," rights are, we agree, but we believe that access to land and money is the logical prerequisite for achieving political rights because otherwise these rights"
308.8,312.52," exist solely on paper for two reasons. First, they have some leverage in lobbying. We believe"
312.52,316.64," that since the rich elite have the most capital, they can threaten the firing workforce and"
316.64,320.74," control prices of key products. Hence, people have no real recourse in a country with such"
320.74,325.06," big economic inequality. But moreover, secondly, people may have right"
325.06,328.62," on opposition, however, they're less likely and less able to practice them if they're"
328.62,333.56," working multiple jobs or survive and don't have capital for education. So to conclude,"
333.56,338.42," if we're way on metric of logical order, on proposition would give people economic stability,"
338.42,341.62," people have their own land and education, which nobody can take away from them or use"
341.62,347.62, it to manipulate them. And only then people should and can have access to successful protests and gain their rights.
347.86,350.34," That being said, I'm going to my second substantive report."
350.56,351.48, Are there any to your wise?
352.66,357.72," Thomas Sankara, the liberation leader of Burkina Faso, was ousted in a coup initiated by France"
357.72,360.18, after trying to implement economic reparations.
360.98,366.16," OK, I can name you a few examples where there was also coups and civil wars when people"
366.16,367.5, tried to gain some rights.
367.5,371.16," We believe that on both sides of the house, there will be some certain extent to people"
371.16,373.02, being dissatisfied.
373.02,375.52, We believe that this is quite not the debate.
375.52,378.42, Second substantive bargaining power on an international level.
378.42,383.12," So during colonialism, colonized nations modeled African economies after their own needs."
383.12,388.88, So this looked like Britain forcing Ghana to massively produce their cocoa so they can export it to Britain for their beloved Cadbury
388.88,394.7, chocolate factory. And that's the reason why 60% of Ghana's exports was solely basically cocoa.
395.14,399.44," And generally, the West prevented product diversification by forcing Africa to specialize"
399.44,404.54, in producing only a few products. So this prevented local economic growth and made African
404.54,405.0," economies completely dependent on the West for any other products. Now, in opposition, only a few products, so this prevented local economic growth and made African economies"
405.0,407.68, completely dependent on the West for any other products.
407.68,412.52," Now in opposition, after colonialism, Africa prioritized ensuring political rights."
412.52,417.96, This means that all economic plans were characterized by the governments of newly independent nations
417.96,420.34, hastily taking loans from the West.
420.34,424.76," This allowed the West to impose their own conditions and structural adjustment programs,"
424.76,426.0, which is today known as neocolonialisms.
426.88,432.06," This program includes removing any obstacle to trade, privatization, devaluing their current currency, etc."
432.32,435.84, This is detrimental because this enables Western exploitation.
436.24,438.9," Firstly, with conditioned loans, so Africa stays dependent on the West."
439.16,445.46," So this looks like, for instance, Angola, which in order to get a new loan, the imf conditioned it to sell 195 of their own"
445.46,449.86, businesses including their old company and their diamond firm but moreover this looks like with
449.86,454.72, flooding african markets with cheap products and ruining the local economies which for instance
454.72,460.38, looks like europe that has successfully ruined south africa south africa's poultry market by
460.38,464.6, selling meat for 30 cheaper than the price of local farmers what is the comparative that we
464.6,465.0, bring again?
465.28,468.7," We tell that on proposition, Africa could develop their own economy"
468.7,471.82," because people would have their own land to farm and they can sell their crops,"
472.2,475.34, lessening their dependence on West and giving them more bargaining power.
475.84,479.66," Moreover, due to quotas on imports, they would have more power over the food prices"
479.66,481.64, and they wouldn't allow Western market flooding.
481.98,483.86, So what is the overall impact of this substantive?
484.56,486.28," Firstly, it's more bargaining power"
486.28,488.06, in international institutions
488.06,490.96," because they aren't as dependent on foreign commodities,"
490.96,493.28," nor Western corporations creating jobs for them anymore,"
493.28,494.54, so they can bargain more
494.54,496.92, in terms of setting their own tariffs and trade conditions.
496.92,498.78," But moreover, there would be significant"
498.78,500.16, product diversification
500.16,502.18, as people are able to make money off of their own land
502.18,504.18," or with the help of cash transfers,"
504.18,508.72, more local businesses would be popping up that the IMf could no longer condition to shut down and would grow
508.72,512.88, with the purchasing power these businesses would grow so all in all but i want you to remember from
512.88,517.28, my speech we firstly have to give these people land and some money we have to give them economic
517.28,522.64, stability we can have to give them some bargaining power so neocolonialism doesn't happen and that's
522.64,527.84, when we can actually have maybe some rights but but after so proud to stand on side proposition.
533.6,537.36," All right, I thank the speaker for that speech. Can I check if the panel is ready?"
537.36,538.56," If you are, just give a thumbs up."
542.4,550.0," All right, to open this debate for the opposition, can we have the first speaker of the opposition?"
550.0,571.0," Okay, just a reminder, my pronouns are she, her, and I would like pure eyes in chat. I will count myself down in 3, 2, 1."
571.0,590.24, The only way for side proposition to win this debate is if they proved to us how economic reparations are actually going to solve the economic harm of colonialism that they spend majority of their time characterizing. We don't think that they effectively prove this and they ignore the harsh reality that Africans face when the wrong policy
590.24,595.52, is prioritized. Our case is going to prove the multiple ways in which their economic reparations
595.52,601.2," don't fix this economic harm. Our stance on side opposition is twofold. One, we would have preferred"
601.2,605.52," states devoting their time, money, and political will into enshrining political rights."
605.76,609.02, This looks like a strong judiciary with specific and accurate law.
609.02,615.7, It looks like increasing democratic access through enough polling stations and ensuring political parties campaign freely.
616.22,619.74," Secondly, what is the economic policy on our side going to look like?"
620.0,629.88," No reparations programs, sure, but still using the mechanisms that African countries use to uplift people, like welfare, like pumping money into education."
629.88,639.56," The difference is that it is slower, less invasive, and focuses on giving Africans access to an already existing economic system, even if that system is colonial."
640.08,644.12, But what this means then is that a lot of props benefits aren't actually mutually exclusive.
644.48,649.44, We're not neglecting the economy in its entirety entirety it's reparations that we think they didn't
649.44,654.64, justify we're willing to trade off the immediate economic upliftment of people because we think
654.64,660.64, prioritizing political rights creates a framework for long-term permanent and equitable economic
660.64,665.96," development to happen before i get on to my, two points of rebuttal we just"
665.96,670.88," quickly need to deal with. Firstly, they say that there are failures to maintain political rights"
670.88,675.14," today in African countries, and they give us a couple of examples. First response, we don't think"
675.14,679.62, this is entirely true. We think there are lots of African countries like South Africa and Botswana
679.62,683.76, and Namibia that have functioning democracies where their people have a lot more political
683.76,685.0, freedoms than they had under colonialism.
685.0,690.0," But secondly, we think we're allowed to not be satisfied with how the political rights were maintained."
690.0,695.0, But we think the reason that they weren't maintained was because of bad governance.
695.0,699.0," This is something worse on opposition side with the implementation of economic freedoms,"
699.0,703.0, as there are no ways to hold governments accountable for their economic failures.
703.0,710.24," We think on our side, even on our worst case, where states backslide into less political freedom, because the people have the"
710.24,714.86," institutionalized right to that freedom, they're able to fight for it. I don't have to tell you"
714.86,719.08," more about the Arab Spring, etc. But we think there's evidence of this happening. Second thing"
719.08,724.36," I need to rebut is this idea of land reparations, because they give us a lot of analysis on purchasing"
724.36,725.2," power and capital, but they don't actually explain to us how land reparations because they give us a lot of analysis on purchasing power"
725.2,729.6, and capital but they don't actually explain to us how land reparations work let's explain to
729.6,734.0, you how it works we think there are permanent colonial structures that prevent land reparations
734.0,738.48, from happening equitably this looks like the scramble for africa leading to arbitrary
738.48,743.04, divisions of land which makes land claims incredibly complicated but secondly we think
743.04,745.24, that one person owning land 50 years ago
745.24,750.8, is now five people. The amount of people having a claim to that land has grown. How do you fix
750.8,754.78," that on your side? We think they ignore the reality that they are defending Zimbabwe,"
755.06,759.04," where land reparations were not only unequitable, but quite literally destructive."
759.9,764.9," Understanding why we've disproven their case on an assertive case on economic development,"
765.64,770.2," let's give you two substantives. Firstly, on why economic reparations won't lead to development this"
770.2,775.12, directly classes with their analysis and also deals with the idea of how the international
775.12,780.16, community is going to react first argument here we think you're going to get a major backlash from
780.16,785.52, Colonial Powers the premise of this argument is to say that the vested interest of colonial powers
785.52,791.52, is to keep their economic stronghold of Africa and creates which creates an incentive to retaliate
791.52,797.12, against economic reparations. Why is this true? A the original premise of colonialism was European
797.12,801.6, powers needing to fulfill their internal demand through extracting resources from Africa. This
801.6,811.0," led to the creation of a mercantile system, meaning cash crops were prioritized like German policies in East Africa that forced local farmers to produce cotton for the sole purpose of exploiting it."
811.0,818.0," But B, it looks like the geographic importance of developing nations for trade and security like the Suez Canal in Egypt."
818.0,828.8," We think that they agree with this, but then they say that they allow for the maintenance of that power under their side and we get more backlash like because of political changes we think this is completely untrue"
828.8,833.6, we think that economic reparations actively disrupts the process of accessing that mineral
833.6,839.28, wealth and creates a strong incentive for backlash but moreover we think the only time that the west
839.28,845.2, has acted in this way politically is in the instance that political rights had led to the infringement of
845.2,850.64, their economic power. This looks like the British still allowing traditional systems of government
850.64,856.04," at the instance where they get economic benefits. This directly disproves their idea that, oh,"
856.08,860.02," if you change political structures, they're going to have the same reaction. We think that their"
860.02,864.5, reaction is entirely based on an economic harm. What does this backlash look like on proposition
864.5,869.82," side? We think it looks like imposing sanctions, invading again, staging coup d'etats, and staging"
869.82,874.62," assassinations. There are many examples of when this happened, but the clearest is with Patrice"
874.62,879.7," Lumumba in Congo, who prioritized economic reparations, which threatened the mineral"
879.7,886.06," exports out of the DRC. He was assassinated by the CIA and the Belgian government, which created a power"
886.06,892.12, vacuum and long-term economic and political instability in the DRC. Our POI spoke to this
892.12,897.04," as well. Secondly, on governance, we think that the context of the leaders that exist is the same"
897.04,902.24, on both sides. The majority of struggle leaders drew on the concept of freedom and enshrining it.
902.46,905.58, They studied politics. They wrote manifestos about it. I can
905.58,910.58," talk about Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba and Thomas Sankara for hours. What does this mean for"
910.58,915.96," the implementation of policy on both sides of the house? On our side, we have leaders that are better"
915.96,921.08," adapted to making political decisions as opposed to making economic decisions, both in experience"
921.08,925.78, and incentives. This concludes that regardless of what they deem
925.78,928.9," actually more important between economics or politics,"
928.9,931.34, by virtue of these leaders being more equipped
931.34,933.1," to enshrine political rights,"
933.1,936.38, the way up becomes bad economic policy on prop side
936.38,938.4," versus better political freedoms on outside,"
938.4,940.22, something we're always going to prefer.
940.22,942.4, A clear example of this is Kwame Nkrumah
942.4,944.04," fixing the price of cocoa,"
944.04,945.12, which significantly harmed
945.12,949.52," the farmers within Ghana, but he's still considered a hero when it comes to writing about"
949.52,954.96," the political freedoms of Africans. The impact is we disprove the premise of their entire case,"
954.96,959.68, that economic reparations would have led to the economic development of African countries. They
959.68,964.0, needed to do far more. Before I tell you about the practical manifestation of the political
964.0,970.56," rights they decide to ignore, I'll take a POI if there is one. Why do you believe that there won't be"
970.56,976.32, ethnic conflicts in cases where you give just when you purchase only one ethnic majority and
976.32,981.18," give them all rights on your side of the house? Quite simply, we think on your side, at the point"
981.18,989.02," we have the colonial legacy that entrenched economic harm that harms the ethnic minority, you have no way to change that. Your reparations are going"
989.02,994.02," to benefit the majority. On our side, when we enshrine the rights like equality, the"
994.02,999.08," rights to vote for change, that is when ethnic minorities get a say in the changing of institutionalized"
999.08,1003.76, systems that harm them. Second argument on the practical manifestation of political rights.
1003.76,1025.0," This directly clashes with their comparative on how, oh, you can't access anything unless you have economic empowerment. Why is accountability so important? The context here is that African citizens were seen as property of the state. was constitutionally justified and even more so for those ethnic minorities."
1025.0,1029.0," This meant for harsher punishment and more unfair conditions within the workplace,"
1029.0,1034.0, like the arbitrary arrests in Nigeria and the exploitation of labor quite literally everywhere in Africa.
1034.0,1039.0, This speaks to the crucial importance of civil and political liberties in relation to economics that propagates.
1039.0,1045.84," What do we change? On our side, the state is obligated to enshrine and protect political rights in a nuanced manner."
1046.16,1049.78," But secondly, individuals' role within a democracy is recognized."
1050.06,1056.38," Their role as holders of personhood is recognized, which means we have stronger and we have stronger institutions that protect that."
1056.38,1062.3," The impact here is that we prevent the possibility of exploitation, even in the instance of economic development."
1062.64,1066.28, We think we no longer allow companies to have the same exploitative practices.
1066.72,1068.74, We think Uhuru means freedom.
1069.0,1071.28, The cage bird sings for freedom.
1080.66,1082.48," All right, I thank the speaker for that speech."
1082.82,1084.2, Can I check if the panel is ready?
1087.12,1092.32," All right, to continue this debate for the proposition, can we have the second speaker of the proposition?"
1092.32,1098.32, Here you are.
1098.32,1106.0," Okay, am I audible and visible to everyone?"
1106.0,1109.0," Yep, yes you are."
1109.0,1132.54," Okay, so just to remind you my preferred pronouns are she, her, and I'll take my POIs verbally so just unmute yourself, and I will take the POI or not. And with that said, okay, I can start my speech in three, two,"
1132.54,1138.14," one. If you look at this historically, Europe got the rights the moment in which it was"
1138.14,1142.9," distributed, the middle class grew, and they could fight for their rights, and even more"
1142.9,1145.04," important, put them to practice and this"
1145.04,1148.8, is something that we want to see happen in africa in post-colonial africa and this is something that
1148.8,1154.24, happens in proposition so what we believe on this side is that we really should prioritize economic
1154.24,1160.96, reconciliation because this is the uh this is the logical uh condition for any kind of rights to
1160.96,1169.2, actually develop in these kind of countries what type of position what side opposition needs to show you is the likelihood of democratic uprising the coop thing they ask us
1169.2,1174.8, in the field why is completely symmetric because to some extent people will be unhappy on both sides
1174.8,1180.64, so it is symmetric but if we waste surviving because you have food and some and the importance
1180.64,1185.36, of abstract rights that they talk about we can clearly see that having food and
1185.36,1189.56," surviving is much more important. But furthermore, they give us examples in which we tell you, okay,"
1189.7,1195.14," so for example, Guayana, this is a democracy in paper, but we still had coups last year. And this"
1195.14,1199.26, is something where we can see that their side is not proving rights and their side is not proving
1199.26,1202.68," all the things that they want you to believe. Furthermore, in my speech, you will hear some"
1202.68,1208.24," rebuttals, and then I'll be going on to my third argument about reconciliation so firstly something that they tell you is that"
1208.8,1213.2, we need to show economic stability first of all we tell you this is our whole first argument that
1213.2,1216.88, they didn't really respond we tell you on a personal level this is really important to a
1216.88,1222.8, person to have some uh some land because in that case even if that person can have like a group of
1222.8,1228.88, chickens that means enough for him because that means that at the end of the day that person will have food on their table and
1228.88,1234.72, that person will survive on a whole country level we can see that these are that once we can like
1235.6,1240.8, uplift their economy from the inside then africa can actually become stable and then africa doesn't
1240.8,1248.0, have to rely on on the on the bargaining bargaining power that the West has with them.
1248.18,1251.54, And this is something they also haven't responded to in our second argument.
1251.54,1255.78, We tell you that African economies were tailored to benefit the colonizing power.
1256.12,1260.98, And what they produce and what quantities and all of this was actually like conditioned from the West.
1261.26,1265.38," Ghana, for example, Lara gave you, had to produce only cocoa powder because this is"
1265.38,1269.7," something that English wanted. So after decolonization, Africa was dependent on taking"
1269.7,1273.84," loans from the West, and this allowed West to create their own demands and thus put Africa in"
1273.84,1280.1," a lesser position in bargaining, ergo neocolonism. And even further by this flooding African market"
1280.1,1286.0," with their cheaper products such as poultry in South Africa. And on top, Africa can develop their own economy from within."
1286.0,1290.0," Farmers can sell crops, invest or even themselves bargain with the West."
1290.0,1294.0," And the impact of this is the bargaining power that they never responded to,"
1294.0,1298.0," and then product diversification, which we believe is very important."
1298.0,1301.0," But on the extension, we tell you what happens inside opposition."
1301.0,1304.0, Africa has to keep taking money from the West.
1304.0,1307.44, Then what happens is West can put any kind of sanctions that they want
1307.64,1310.68, because they because Africa will have to accept it
1310.88,1314.56," because reality check democracy can develop into years,"
1314.72,1317.24, something that side opposition decided to not talk about.
1317.48,1319.56, And then what happens is economy stagnates.
1319.56,1322.48, We remove all of the companies that could have been created in Africa.
1322.6,1326.76," And this is when you get absolutely no benefits inside a position, something they never rebuttal."
1327.02,1328.06," But furthermore, we tell you"
1328.06,1329.42, on holding government accountable.
1329.76,1331.86," First of all, we believe that institutional rights,"
1331.96,1332.86," something they talk about,"
1333.04,1334.76, means nothing if it's only on paper.
1335.14,1336.42," What they trade off,"
1336.48,1338.26, let's take a look at the weighing on their economy.
1338.38,1341.2," On their side, their economic alternatives"
1341.2,1344.2, are harmed by the Western companies coming to Africa.
1344.2,1346.0, They stagnate all economic
1346.0,1351.6," progress, side-op trades off short-term financial benefits and allow foreign companies to come and"
1351.6,1358.08," destroy local markets. And on intensity, Africa is being conditioned by the West's economic aid"
1358.08,1363.04," on side opposition. On their side, foreign companies price gouged and destroy local"
1363.04,1365.04, markets. Those companies then bargain power away from the locals. And on their side foreign companies price gouged and destroy local markets those companies then bargain
1365.04,1369.92, power away from the locals and on their side african markets are not independent and are being
1369.92,1375.04, price gouged even more and this is when you get even less economic stability and by that logic
1375.04,1380.64, prerequisite you gain even less um even less even less price but on the relationship between west
1380.64,1385.2, and africa we tell you that this is happening during the cold war meaning 50s and 60s
1385.2,1390.48, this means that africa will have to side either with russia or with the west this gives the west
1390.48,1395.68, intention intention and incentive to actually be nice to africa and give them like all the
1395.68,1400.4, necessary necessary things that they want but furthermore if they want to prove that west is
1400.4,1405.54," so malicious then what's happening inside purpose opposition, you give them even more time"
1405.54,1407.68, to actually become even more malicious
1407.68,1410.18, and even more like destroy African markets
1410.18,1411.62, as well as African rights.
1411.62,1414.42," So the ethnic conflict thing, they also talk about,"
1414.42,1416.4," we tell you that in RPOY, we tell you that,"
1416.4,1418.84," okay, ethnic conflict can also happen on your side"
1418.84,1422.16," because by that logic, like if some ethnicity"
1422.16,1424.24," gains more rights and the other doesn't,"
1424.24,1429.34," this is when you get this ethnic conflict. But furthermore, we tell you that you derive your political rights"
1429.34,1432.72," from your land and property. If you have the money, you can influence politics. If you"
1432.72,1436.62," don't have the money, you don't have to like work every single day of the week, then you"
1436.62,1440.94, can like engage yourself in politics. Even if you do have political civil rights inside
1440.94,1450.08," of, they're more symbolic on paper because people still can't engage in politics and but even if we side with their metric and civil and political rights we win long term"
1450.08,1454.96, because this is a logic prerequisite to have some land in order to have some rights with that being
1454.96,1461.44, said i'll take a why before i move on to my argument the country in africa most infamous
1461.44,1465.52, for its land reparations has faced economic and political destruction.
1465.52,1472.08," A count for Zimbabwe. Okay, I can name you a thousand examples where economic"
1472.88,1479.04," reconciliation was much better, such as Rwanda, that is in the like top countries in the world"
1479.04,1488.0," of social mobility. I don't understand your point, it's very extreme. Anyways, going on to my argument. So how was the population affected at the time of colonization?"
1488.0,1492.4," Those in power, mainly Western European white men, had all the power over the land."
1492.4,1495.12, This looks like them coming to a family and forcing them out.
1495.12,1499.84," And even if those families survive, the original owners would be forced to work manually,"
1499.84,1502.88, live in small spaces with no hygiene and small amounts of food.
1502.88,1508.64, They were thrown out to live day by day. So what was the situation that in post-colonial africa they still didn't get their
1508.64,1512.64, land back they still have angst and hatred towards the leading power and the pure fact that their
1512.64,1517.28, grandparents have land that now they can't have because of the political power means they stay
1517.28,1521.2, they still feel robbed and abandoned by anyone who could have helped them and the impact of this is
1521.2,1531.82," on a psychological level this means they lose motivation to try and fight for their rights land even good living standards, putting them in the same situation as it was when they lived in the colonial country had all the power."
1532.16,1539.26," And this creates an overall sentiment in which people have little to no power or motivation to actively engage in politics, which could be their way out."
1539.26,1549.44, This unfair land distribution means that certain groups do have land while others don't. Those groups then want to act in some way to get their land back and they do this through violent attacks because they
1549.44,1553.44, don't see any other way of doing it. This is something they also talked about and this is
1553.44,1558.16, how ethnic conflict is created and how we further the already existing tension. This is exactly why
1558.16,1562.88, for example in Namibia there are violent attacks and like coups and murder rampages on people
1562.88,1569.56, owning farms by those who whose answer to the land was taken so how do we reconcile through fair land distribution we figure the
1569.56,1574.28, practical as well as the principal problem and injustices done to the population firstly through
1574.28,1578.3, land distribution we would give them the land that is rightful owners which are the original
1578.3,1582.9, owners who were thrown out secondly direct money transfers that served as a stepping stone for them
1582.9,1589.44," to get back on their feet but thirdly dealers, dealerships with big companies who own the land and have plantations or factories."
1589.8,1593.86," On the comparative, when you give them political and civil rights, they don't have the private"
1593.86,1598.58, property. The fact that they have rights serves only as a symbolic gesture that they can't put
1598.58,1602.66, to practice. They still feel robbed and don't want to engage with the system who robbed them.
1602.82,1608.7," Furthermore, they don't have the education to do do that but also they don't have the time because at all times they have to work in a"
1608.7,1615.0, factory in order to feed their family on prop we focus on economic reconciliation we fulfill the
1615.0,1619.14, principal need for justice as well as giving them money or land to invest their feedback
1619.14,1623.42, this is the way they start to engage in politics and work towards ensuring their rights
1623.42,1628.88, and thus create equality and this is why i'm so happy to propose thank you
1641.76,1646.14," hi can we just have seconds oh sorry to interrupt can we just have seconds, oh sorry to interrupt, can we just have 30 seconds to"
1646.14,1648.14, reconnect the speaker to our app?
1648.14,1650.14," Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
1650.14,1651.14, Thank you.
1651.14,1654.5, Just let us know when you're ready and then we can move on to the next speech.
1654.5,1657.24," Yeah, in the meantime, can I just check if the panel is ready?"
1657.24,1749.92," Okay, can we just wait for Team South Africa to reconnect the speaker. you you Sorry, I forgot we were seeing something. You're you so much for your patience. Again, Qadlah Mokhosi, OQ,"
1749.92,1772.32, and also reply. Here's your page.
1775.28,1776.42," Here, just checking that I'm still visible and audible."
1797.0,1802.0," Yep, yes, you are. I will begin my speech in three. Sorry, before that, could I just get my POI preferences again? Sorry."
1802.0,1806.96," Oh, sorry. POI for the team south africa is in the chat thank you"
1808.88,1818.0, starting in three two one we introduced a very important metric in 01 which is to say that
1818.0,1823.2, site proposition needs to prove that they get reparations not only in principle but in practical
1823.2,1829.84, specifically important because their whole case does hinge on the practical outcomes of their policy my whole speech is going to be
1829.84,1834.0, dedicated to firstly deconstructing those practical outcomes but secondly showing you
1834.0,1838.64, why opposition gets them 10 times better firstly let's engage with the context that this debate
1838.64,1842.8, needs us to speak to the first of which is about the leaders on both sides we agree we have the
1842.8,1847.06, same level of symmetric leaders this is important then because they have the same level
1847.06,1848.34, of malicious intentions.
1848.34,1851.26," So even if they prioritize economic reparations,"
1851.26,1854.32, what does militia manifest as an economic reparations?
1854.32,1856.86," It looks like individuals not being able to get the money,"
1856.86,1858.4, not being able to get the land.
1858.4,1860.26, It looks like the unequal distribution
1860.26,1862.54," that they tried to fight for so hard on their side,"
1862.54,1863.6, not being attained.
1863.6,1870.08," On our side, here's the comparative introduced in first, is that we have learned behaviors from 80 populists secondly we"
1870.08,1875.52, have a strong judiciary but then you have external mechanisms of accountability that mean we can
1875.52,1880.08, actively revolt against that and stop that probability and nip that in the bud secondly
1880.08,1884.16, here there's a bottom line that we need to engage with and that bottom line is the west is always
1884.16,1885.48, going to develop from Africa.
1885.76,1891.36, They have permanent infrastructure. They've set up permanent mineral resources and these are vested interests from Western powers.
1891.82,1898.66," The truth is the team that wins this debate is the team that shows you that Africa can benefit, too, not that the West is going to leave."
1898.94,1901.4, The third thing that we need to engage with is their alternative.
1901.4,1909.66, The alternative is simply not true because we don't think necessarily that the alternative on our side is going to be like complete anarchy and violent revolt because
1909.66,1914.84," the truth is when political rights were enshrined, people were happy on the outside. Secondly, let's"
1914.84,1919.44, look at majority of their argumentation and what it leads to because there's no real progression
1919.44,1923.84," from first to second. Two main ideas that they thrust in their case. Unequal distribution, which"
1923.84,1929.12," is going to be fixed by upward social mobility, secondly that they do better for the situations of these"
1929.12,1933.28, individuals economically the strategy of these two arguments is hung right because they say in the
1933.28,1937.76, first argument that the inter the distribution is going to be equal therefore social mobility is
1937.76,1942.24, going to manifest and a whole lot of other things i'd also like to introduce a secondary principle
1942.24,1946.66," consideration here is to say even if the acquisition of the land was unjust,"
1946.78,1952.62," which is to say it was forcefully taken, it was colonially taken, and it was not compensated for that land."
1953.08,1960.78," The maintenance cost put into that land over the 50 years, the labor put into that land have exponentially increased the value of that land."
1960.78,1965.84," So our proposition needs to defend is taking an additional harm, incurring a harm"
1965.84,1970.64," that didn't exist before, i.e. when that land was acquired, when you want to reparate that land."
1970.88,1975.76," This is to say they have a higher burden to show us why A, MNC is unlikely to comply, but B,"
1975.94,1980.84, that compliance is something that is valuable and something that is principally legitimate.
1981.08,1989.38," We think they can't just run away from the harm. Now that I've engaged with the strategy of the arguments, let me deal with them on a substantive level. On the first idea of"
1989.38,1994.24," unequal distribution, three levels of responses. The first of which is to say they assume that the"
1994.24,1998.6, land these individuals are going to get is profitable land. We think this is categorically
1998.6,2006.28, untrue. The majority of the land claims in South Africa are estimated to take about 50 years to adequately
2006.28,2010.54," reparate. The mechanism might first it. But secondly, when we look at Zimbabwe and Tanzania"
2010.54,2015.74," specifically, the land that was given to these individuals is often unoccupied, unarable,"
2016.06,2021.38, and unprofitable land. We think this is the likely comparative that site proposition needs to engage
2021.38,2027.14," with, not like this kumbaya under their site. Secondly, they assume a level of skill to maintain this land."
2027.14,2029.42, This is to say that farming land and owning land
2029.42,2030.96," is something specifically different,"
2030.96,2033.06, especially when that land is used to export
2033.06,2034.5, the mineral wealth of the country.
2034.5,2036.66," So even if they had the skills to farm their land,"
2036.66,2038.86, they're unlikely to have the skills to own that land
2038.86,2040.5, and therefore profit off that land.
2040.5,2043.58, This is to say that now the land is used by Western powers
2043.58,2044.62, and there's a vested interest
2044.62,2048.84, and they're unlikely to manage that. Specifically when their second speaker tells you that their
2048.84,2053.78, educational levels are so low that they're unlikely to engage in like business of this level.
2054.1,2058.72," Secondly, the idea of neocolonialism. Three responses to this. Firstly, we think it's"
2058.72,2063.28," unlikely to happen. My first book about this. Secondly, we think they lost majority of their"
2063.28,2071.54," funding at the point at which the USSR collapsed. By the late 1970s, 35 out of 60 countries were aligned with the USSR. We think"
2071.54,2078.02," UNITA, SWAPO, ANC, throughout Africa. This is important because by the time independence was"
2078.02,2082.56," reached, the USSR had already collapsed and the individuals that were going to fund this land"
2082.56,2088.66," reparation, that were going to fund these economic reparations that are going to fund these economic reparations were no longer funding them this then meant that they had to turn to"
2088.66,2093.92, nefarious actors like the imf the nefarious actors like the world trade organization with a symmetric
2093.92,2098.76, on both sides on our side we control their power i've done a lot responsibly what have i done
2098.76,2102.98, firstly i've shown you why the strategy is misaligned with majority of the context secondly
2102.98,2109.28, i've shown you why the conclusions that the argument does proves are unlikely to manifest in the real world and thirdly i've shown you why
2109.28,2114.16, the neocolonialism argument isn't necessarily an argument on its own but secondly it's worse on
2114.16,2118.72, their side before i move on to my substantive as to why we're better long-term economically yes
2118.72,2124.24, you are can you show us a systemic analysis as to which why the malicious intent of the government
2124.24,2130.0, doesn't exist in our side of the house and why they're likely to give in to the rights and not just give us an
2130.0,2135.68, assertion about how because it's happened all the time right we think the malicious intent
2135.68,2140.72, specifically manifests as governments being power hungry we regulate that power hungry government
2140.72,2147.64, by the learned behaviors that the population has i i.e. unionizing and mass protests
2147.64,2152.1," that we've seen in the past. One argument then, better for long-term economic growth. First level"
2152.1,2156.76, is to say we attract economic growth. Investors and business specifically need to know that there's
2156.76,2160.88," a political stability and rights so that the investment won't be appropriated. Secondly,"
2161.02,2172.0," there's security, which is to say protect private property. And thirdly, accountability, which is to say that you have the ability to go and get legal recourse against any harm like that comes on your company."
2172.0,2177.0, This necessitates a strong court system that are well founded on political representation.
2177.0,2182.0, This is important specifically when you think about one of the most successful companies throughout history.
2182.0,2189.94, The Dutch East India Company wasn't successful because of its colonial context. It was largely successful because the Netherlands was pioneering court
2189.94,2195.1," systems. This then meant that the Dutch East India Company had good business practices, could"
2195.1,2200.22," actively give workers the necessary rights they needed, and use that and make those transferable"
2200.22,2204.74," skills. We think on the comparative, they need to defend anti-private action by methods of"
2204.74,2209.14, distribution and have a more anarchic state and tell us where they get their funding because it's
2209.14,2213.82," not going to exist. Secondly, we think political freedom specifically encourages free thinking and"
2213.82,2218.94, creativity. We encourage individuality and we encourage dissent and skepticism. This is all
2218.94,2224.1," essential for innovation and upending the way things are done, especially when it comes to"
2224.1,2229.04, questioning authority. Think about why prisoners are prevented from accessing certain literature because the
2229.04,2233.2, government doesn't want to them to think in a certain way specifically post independence when
2233.2,2238.16, individuals are no longer censored they need this access to dissent something that they only get
2238.16,2242.56, when you nuance their political rights instead of just giving them blank political rights we think
2242.56,2246.54," the ability to unionize, the ability to associate politically"
2246.54,2248.92, is something you're only going to get on our side.
2248.92,2251.64, The comparative is they teach a culture of obedience
2251.64,2253.82, and they're unlikely to get accountability
2253.82,2256.14, in the long term for bad economic policy.
2256.14,2258.84," The impact is A, business is more willing to invest,"
2258.84,2260.34, which is especially impactful
2260.34,2262.8," given the skepticism surrounding this country,"
2262.8,2269.48," given that it's new and the conception is still young. But secondly, you get more free thinking, which means you're likely to incentivize innovation"
2269.48,2274.76, with governments that can sustain that innovation. The importance here is that developing nations
2274.76,2280.66," aim to be developed. One, we say the presence of MNCs brings upskilling and sharing of business"
2280.66,2285.84," practices. Secondly, we think skill transfers to small to medium enterprises."
2285.84,2289.12," And thirdly, we think innovation allows governments to find niches"
2289.12,2291.12, and specifically compete internationally.
2291.12,2296.32, An example is the Serum Institute in India for vaccines.
2296.32,2298.8, What is going to win the debate?
2298.8,2301.88," The side that frees the bird that cries freedom,"
2301.88,2316.32, the side that sings uhuru with that bird side with up
2318.32,2322.4, all right i thank the speaker for that speech uh can i just check if the panel is ready
2325.28,2325.9, all right to continue this debate for the proposition can we have the third speaker Can I just check if the panel is ready? All right.
2326.1,2327.86," To continue this debate for the proposition,"
2328.1,2330.18, can we have the third speaker of the proposition?
2330.6,2337.86," Yes, so my pronouns are she, her,"
2338.04,2340.74, and I'd like my POIs in the chat as well.
2341.42,2356.4, And just give me a second so i can set my timer and then we'll start the speech
2356.4,2364.88, okay uh so without further ado i'm coming to start it south africa tries to debate this with this
2364.88,2366.76, uh this motion with examples.
2366.96,2374.64," They're all statistics about Zimbabwe or about South Africa, but they never give us substantial enough analysis on why their model is better,"
2374.94,2377.88, why their model works and why these statistics are relevant in this debate.
2377.98,2388.58," And this is why we win a few things in my speech. First of all, three clashes on the feasibility of our model, the intensity and the quantity of people we help. But first, let's just say that I did never rebuttal our third argument, which is about"
2388.58,2393.24," reconciliation, which is about the feeling of empowerment you get when you're giving land back"
2393.24,2397.38," by the people who tortured you for years and years, when you see these people finally getting"
2397.38,2402.06," their due done. Okay, so now let's talk about the feasibility of our model. When you say we have less"
2402.06,2407.84," democratic government, that is true. And we're fine with that, First of all, because in terms of economic stability and accountability, our governments"
2407.84,2411.08," are going to be much more accountable, actually. Why? Because if an authoritarian government does"
2411.08,2415.16," a horrible job at leading a country over and over again, people's dissatisfaction leads to violent"
2415.16,2418.68," pushback or a revolution, because that's the only way they can remove this authoritarian government."
2419.02,2422.32," In an already unstable country, you don't want that to happen. This is why Rwanda,"
2422.44,2427.92," with an authoritarian government, ranks higher than the Netherlands and Switzerland in easiness of doing business and liberty despite"
2427.92,2432.08," being an autocracy. Secondly, governments, democratic governments can scapegoat their"
2432.08,2436.16," failures by saying this is the mess the previous government left, we don't have the majority in"
2436.16,2440.56," parliament, etc. Or scapegoat economic failures by saying well we gave you voting rights, you have to"
2440.56,2444.64, vote to fix the economy. And people are less likely to react violently because they're being manipulated
2444.64,2447.56, constantly and believe it's always someone else's vote and it will get better.
2447.9,2452.56," In that moment, we believe it's more beneficial to actually have a slightly more autocratic"
2452.56,2458.54," government on our side. But okay, let's go on to the incentive of the West to go along with the"
2458.54,2462.8," redistribution of goods or retributions. First of all, when we talk about good relations,"
2462.94,2475.0," we're telling you not everyone became independent in the 90s when the SSR fell apart. Most people, most colonies became independent in the 70s. In that moment, it was really crucial for the West to be in good relations with these economies because of the SSR because they did not want to side with them."
2475.0,2486.26," Secondly, note that this incentive isn't contradictory to the West's incentive to have malicious conditions in their loans because they package those conditions as benevolent aid. Secondly, on international pressure, during decolonization in the 70s,"
2486.32,2488.58, liberalization movement happened in the West as well.
2488.8,2491.1," For example, protests in France against the war in Algeria"
2491.1,2493.18, or protests against the Vietnam War in the 70s.
2493.4,2494.9, This is the basis for international pressure
2494.9,2496.9, for the Western states to atone
2496.9,2498.18, for their atrocities and colonialism.
2498.58,2500.98, And this is why Germany offered reparations
2500.98,2502.6, to Namibia self-incentivized.
2502.84,2504.88," But lastly, when you claim the West is so malicious"
2504.88,2505.02," by waiting so long to become economically independent, when you claim the best is so malicious"
2505.02,2508.02," by waiting so long to become economically independent,"
2508.02,2509.76, you're letting the West have their way for longer.
2509.76,2511.44, You're giving them more time to exploit you.
2511.44,2513.42, And we're ready to risk some backlash from the West
2513.42,2515.08, in order to not stay exploited by the West
2515.08,2517.68," until they decide to become benevolent, which is never."
2517.68,2520.16," Okay, so now that I explained the feasibility of our model"
2520.16,2522.66, on the basis of the type of government we have
2522.66,2524.14," and on the relationship with the West,"
2524.14,2528.88, let's talk about the quantity of people we have people can't participate in your democracy an analysis that
2528.88,2535.04, was never uh that side opposition never rebuttaled they have no access to information 90 of niger
2535.04,2539.2, still doesn't have access to internet today now imagine how many people had access to campaign
2539.2,2544.32, information in the 70s almost none secondly they have no formal education to understand the
2544.32,2545.0, information they're consuming even if they formal education to understand the information they're
2545.0,2549.4," consuming, even if they can access it. And thirdly, they're enduring full days of hard labor in"
2549.4,2554.08," someone else's land, probably starving and worrying how they'll feed their kids. These people have no"
2554.08,2557.9," time to think about who they're going to vote for. And more polling stations, which was your only"
2557.9,2562.02," rebuttal on this analysis, can't counter this. All the decisions then are being made by the rich"
2562.02,2567.0," elite, who are the only ones who have the access to this democratic process because they have education, money, and time."
2567.0,2575.0," And even if more people do vote, these rich elites still have a majority of the resources in the state, and they still have disproportionately more power than the average voter, which they can use to lobby."
2575.0,2588.08," These analysis were never countered from side opposition. They cannot do that in Op 3. That is too late. Okay, so despite prioritizing democracy, you're not actually achieving a legitimate democracy because of the functionality of democratic process relies on participation"
2588.08,2592.48," of majority and representation of majority, neither of which you get. Our side, the redistribution"
2592.48,2595.84, policy is much more likely to trickle down to a larger amount of people because there's no
2595.84,2599.68," prerequisite for you to get land, unlike participating in democracy. Now, why will,"
2600.56,2604.48," and we already explained the incentive for governments to give land because on our side,"
2604.48,2606.06, governments can't scapegoat as easily.
2606.18,2608.44, This was an incentive analysis at the beginning of my speech.
2608.76,2612.2, Note that this incentive analysis applies here when you say reparations won't be done well.
2612.46,2616.04," But also, why will reparations be given more equally to ethnic minorities?"
2616.04,2619.36, Because these minorities are also a large percentage of the population in many states.
2619.62,2624.04," And so obviously, prioritizing the ethnic, not prioritizing or completely ignoring the minority would cause instability."
2624.46,2626.96," It's in the interest of the state to give these minorities at least some land,"
2627.02,2631.46," because in Uganda, for example, 77% of people are different ethnic minorities, and only the other"
2631.46,2636.3," 23% are made up of two ethnic majorities. Compared to the other side, the government can blame ethnic"
2636.3,2639.24," minorities for their own problems because they could have voted better, and the government"
2639.24,2643.42," defends their discrimination by calling it serving their own constituency, who is the ethnic majority."
2643.8,2647.84," But lastly, even if ethnic minorities don't get anything, even without them, we're helping"
2647.84,2651.48, a much bigger amount of people because all the poor people from the ethnic majority who
2651.48,2655.14," don't have representation on your side because they don't have access to the democratic process,"
2655.14,2657.12," have some money, have some land on our side."
2657.12,2661.06," So on weighing, we help a much greater quantity of people and that is why this slash goes"
2661.06,2662.06, on our side.
2662.06,2663.06, But let's talk about the intensity in which you help.
2663.06,2666.56, When we talk about the problems of the people in the status quo these problems are urgent they are
2666.56,2670.4, starving they can barely afford their food their livelihood is on the edge you address this to
2670.4,2674.08, policy and that's great but with the way the democratic process works first you have to have
2674.08,2677.36, campaigning then elections then you have to vote in parliament then implement the policy if you
2677.36,2680.96, have the money for it that takes a very long time and then at the end of the day the policy still
2680.96,2684.72, might not help everyone because your policy is for example subsidies for cocoa farmers anyone
2684.72,2687.2, who isn't a cocoa farmer doesn't benefit from it these policies
2687.2,2691.12, aren't necessarily a bad thing but they're not urgent enough on our side how do we help we give
2691.12,2696.0, people land right away or we give them cash right away now on intensity private property is basis
2696.0,2699.92, of fulfilling all your other needs by buying a sewing machine because you got an active cash
2699.92,2703.28, transfer you can start your own business doing for people in your village and finally be able
2703.28,2707.92, to feed your two kids or send your kids to school because you have some extra money the land you claim the
2707.92,2711.36, land is not profitable but this is an assertion and contradictory to your claims that this land
2711.36,2715.28, would go on the other hand be seized from existing colonial farmers who wouldn't work on non-profitable
2715.28,2719.6, land and it's a land to which of which value grows and that is the characterization we're going to
2719.6,2723.6, adopt and say this land is profitable but secondly we have active cash transfers which we never uh
2723.6,2727.84, engage with and at the end of the day you say these farmers don't have skills to make a huge business from
2727.84,2731.04, one they don't need to make a huge business from their land they're starving they can't feed their
2731.04,2735.2, kids they need a small farm to grow some food so they can save some extra money that is all they
2735.2,2739.36, need and all and secondly land is the only thing that gives you agency and independence otherwise
2739.36,2743.12, you're completely dependent on government policy which you can't guarantee will always be successful
2743.12,2748.06, or fast enough so on intensity we win because we're helping these people much more intensely than
2748.06,2752.26," you are by bringing some policies which may never be implemented well. Before I go on, I will take a"
2752.26,2761.14, POI. Reparations mean nothing in isolation. How are people going to profit off of land without
2761.14,2768.82," upskilling? We think at best you rely on the long-term project of education, something we claim on ourselves. We already explained we have active cash transfers,"
2769.18,2772.44, we literally don't need people to profit off land as long as they can save money by growing some of
2772.44,2777.46," their food. You have no analysis in this POI, this is just an assertion with fancy words, I'm sorry."
2777.76,2781.34," So now let's go on to long-term stability. When we say prioritizing democracy, this means the"
2781.34,2786.82, economy takes a back seat. So most property stays in the hands of the rich white elite and they get richer while the rest of the population
2786.82,2787.66, stays poor.
2787.66,2789.58, And all the profits from the rich white elite
2789.58,2792.4, go out of state because these are foreign companies
2792.4,2793.28, and foreign people.
2793.28,2795.18," So when you talk about any economic growth on your side,"
2795.18,2797.42, it does not exist because the property is not
2797.42,2799.52, in the possession of the people from this country
2799.52,2801.16, who would bring money back to this country.
2801.16,2805.12," So when we talk about your side decreasing the value of land, it doesn't"
2805.12,2808.8, matter because that value would never come back to the country where the land is from anyways.
2808.8,2811.68," So in your best case, you do nothing to change this, but in your worst case, you try to have"
2811.68,2815.44," your cake and eat it too, but you don't have the capacity to both democratizing and focusing on"
2815.44,2819.12, the economy. This is when the West steps in and offers you loans and technical assistance. And
2819.12,2823.28," if you comply with certain conditions like lowering tariffs, opening up this trade,"
2823.28,2827.36," and you're not focusing your resources and time and economies, you have no capacity to research the actual effects"
2827.36,2831.2," of these conditions, and that is when your economy becomes exploited by the West. That's when you"
2831.2,2836.0, become even more dependent on the West and the victim of neocolonialism. This is what we're
2836.0,2840.16," preventing by developing local economies, because when locals become independent from Western"
2840.16,2844.32," economies, when they have their own ecosystems within the country, then they also fund their"
2844.32,2846.66," local administrations, which in turn bring them"
2846.66,2849.3," health care and education, et cetera, which then in turn"
2849.3,2852.1," makes people a smarter workforce, which then builds"
2852.1,2852.9, your economy.
2852.9,2855.84," So on the fact that we affect a greater capacity of people,"
2855.84,2858.16," have a greater capacity of people with bigger intensity,"
2858.16,2860.22," have a more long-term economic stability,"
2860.22,2871.94, please vote side proposition.
2873.64,2873.88," All right, I thank the speaker for that speech."
2875.02,2878.38, Checking if the panel is ready.
2880.5,2880.7," All right, before we move on to the next speech,"
2882.08,2884.52, just a reminder for speakers to please give the person asking a POI
2884.52,2889.28, the full 15 seconds to make the point. Try not to cut them off before that. Because you did
2889.28,2893.16," accept a point, you should also listen to the point to its fullest extent. Also, cutting"
2893.16,2897.5," them off makes it quite hard for the judges to hear the point as well. Okay, to conclude"
2897.5,2901.02," the substantive portion of this debate, can we have the third speaker of the opposition?"
2901.34,2992.28," Here, here. speaker of the opposition. you you Okay, sorry for the delay. My name is Marcus Kodera, I'll be the O3. My POI preference is in the chat. I'll begin my speech in three, two, one. Struggle movements"
2992.28,2999.98," were fought hard for with blood, sweat, and tears. The decisions that they make immediately"
2999.98,3006.0, after the victory of independence matter. It is not just a paper that individuals on the other
3006.0,3010.86, side of this house want to talk about. It is what people dreamt for. It's what people gave their
3010.86,3015.86," lives for. What am I going to be doing in my speech? Before I'll do one strat issue, and then"
3015.86,3020.22," I'll go into three questions that you should judge this debate on. One, does economic reparations"
3020.22,3026.82," lead to economic upliftment? Two, who provides political freedoms? And then three, how will the"
3026.82,3033.9, colonial powers react? So one strap issue. Some proposition likes to give a response that we can
3033.9,3039.38, give a thousand other examples to every example that we give them. Note that we've been very
3039.38,3045.54, careful about not repeating examples. So we've been closer to that number of 1000 than they have. But the point
3045.54,3051.54," is, we have to consider examples, because this debate is not a theoretical one. It's a one about"
3051.54,3056.16," real countries that has happened in the past, things we can point to. That was important,"
3056.3,3060.4," given that they haven't engaged with Zimbabwe to the end of this debate, which is literally"
3060.4,3068.4," what happened and is their model. Okay, first question then, does economic reparations lead to economic upliftment?"
3068.4,3069.4, What did they tell us?
3069.4,3071.94," They characterized the problem of colonialism,"
3071.94,3073.94, something we never disagreed with.
3073.94,3078.16, But then they said land will give social mobility
3078.16,3081.3, and it will prevent stuff going to the elite.
3081.3,3083.1, How do we respond to this?
3083.1,3086.14," Look, before we get into the responses, let's understand"
3086.14,3091.34," what economic policy can happen on our side. That's to say, they have to support a very specific"
3091.34,3096.86," economic policy. That is economic reparations. On our side, we can do what African states have"
3096.86,3101.74," been doing for decades, social welfare programs. So it looks like upskilling programs. It looks"
3101.74,3105.26, like grants to elderly and unemployed people. These are all
3105.26,3109.94, things that have prioritized political freedoms. What is the impact of this response? This deals
3109.94,3114.92, with a large majority of their push on their side to say that a lack of money is the reason why
3114.92,3120.88, people can't fulfill their most basic and immediate needs. They needed to prove why land was the only
3120.88,3125.28," way to achieve that wealth, regardless of the status quo where individuals are doing it"
3125.28,3131.12," nonetheless. The difference then becomes that perhaps on our side, perhaps we're a bit more"
3131.12,3136.56," long-term and a bit slower, but that way up is important in order to not antagonize the rest of"
3136.56,3141.08, the world and to make sure that the way we do it isn't going to be unfair to the most vulnerable.
3141.82,3150.28," But furthermore, what do we say? We said it wasn't going to work on their side for four reasons. One, the scramble of Africa meant that the division of countries and the"
3150.28,3156.48, artificial borders meant that land is now no longer what it used to be and you can't operate properly.
3156.94,3162.44," Secondly, we said claims are impossible to settle given how much time has passed. Thirdly, we said"
3162.44,3165.12," it's not necessarily always arable land, therefore it can't"
3165.12,3169.36," always be economic. And then fourthly, we said these individuals don't always have the skills"
3169.36,3174.56," to reform that land. Those are convincing reasons, never responded to. The second thing we told you"
3174.56,3180.08, was that on IMF loans it's likely to be worse on their side. Here's some new responses. Their third
3180.08,3185.18, speaker tell us that they're going to be super quick. Why is that not true? Three reasons.
3185.46,3190.84, One is that land requires you to work on it. So you can't literally benefit from that land until
3190.84,3197.76, the next harvest season. You can't benefit from that land at the point at which those old land
3197.76,3202.74, owners out of spite might have burnt down its infrastructure or took everything from it.
3202.98,3205.34, Second response why it's untrue is that land
3205.34,3209.8," requires maintenance. So you can give somebody a piece of land to farm, it doesn't necessarily mean"
3209.8,3215.78," that the resources to work it. Thirdly, in order to benefit from growing crops, you need access"
3215.78,3221.38, to markets to sell those crops to. Colonial infrastructure was built in such a way that
3221.38,3230.0," went directly from the mines to the coast, to the harbour where you can export those minerals it does not pass any of the arable land in their best case scenario for"
3230.0,3234.64, individuals to benefit off that means they don't have access to markets it's not going to have the
3234.64,3239.44, super quick benefits that they want but even if they do i've already described to you why the most
3239.44,3245.26, extreme needs can be addressed to on our side what do do we tell you? We told you that given these are struggle
3245.26,3252.0," heroes, liberators, political freedom fighters, they are best positioned to give those political"
3252.0,3257.14," freedoms. So even in their best case, when they try to implement it, their economic policy is likely"
3257.14,3263.44, to be worse than our political policy. But then my second speaker went further and said we're
3263.44,3265.2, actually better for economics at the point
3265.2,3269.84, at which we have a fair economic system that attracts foreign investment. That is super
3269.84,3275.92," important for that lack of capital I just told you that proposition lacks. But secondly, the"
3275.92,3281.12, point of innovative thinking. Note that South proposition did not respond to this at all in
3281.12,3285.56," their third speech. They had ample opportunity, they chose to ignore it. This is"
3285.56,3290.84, us beating on their own metrics. This is us beating them on their own terms. Before I move
3290.84,3295.58," on to the second question, I want to provide political freedoms better than they do. I'll"
3295.58,3301.18, take a POI. The money for your social welfare programs come at the price of children working
3301.18,3305.88, on Western cocoa farms because the West is the one who gave you the money and the West gave you certain export conditions
3305.88,3306.52, you have to meet.
3307.26,3309.06," Okay, let's realize that the West"
3309.06,3310.68, really don't like child labor.
3311.08,3312.72," The IMF is a bad actor,"
3312.88,3313.84," but at the very least,"
3313.94,3315.5, they're not enforcing child slaves.
3315.5,3317.86," That's a very extreme version, right?"
3318.06,3319.56," We think we might have a little,"
3319.74,3321.7, like money is symmetric on either side
3321.7,3323.44, based on how much it requires.
3324.28,3325.6, Second question question who provides
3325.6,3330.32, political freedoms what did they tell us they tell us that well first before we go into what
3330.32,3334.72, they told us let's just acknowledge that all of their analysis on providing political freedoms
3334.72,3338.88, or at least the majority of it depends on them providing economic rights so given that i've
3338.88,3342.72, already proved to you why they don't give those economic rights in the previous clash they don't
3342.72,3348.6," get those political freedoms so what do they tell us they overcome inequality they don't give those economic rights in the previous clash, they don't get those political freedoms. So what did they tell us? They overcome inequality. They don't practice their rights. The middle"
3348.6,3352.2, class is empowered. All of that I've dealt with in the previous clash. But then they
3352.2,3357.6," told us, well, actually, poor people are quite easy to generalize. They don't have knowledge"
3357.6,3361.46, in order to engage with these systems. They don't have time to engage with these systems.
3361.46,3371.44, And they don't have money to care about politics. is that untrue one people out of a independence movement are very politically active because those are the same
3371.44,3377.52, people engaging in civil disobedience to overthrow that colonial power those are the same people
3377.52,3382.64, training in militias like in quanto with caesarean south africa in order to overthrow that power they
3382.64,3391.4," are very aware of the political situation in their country. But also, this is a novel, life-changing moment. It looks like your first"
3391.4,3396.92," democratic election. People are going to show up, people are going to care, they're going to take"
3396.92,3402.28," one day off of work, especially if we make it a public holiday. But then they told us, you're"
3402.28,3405.12, actually worse for ethnic minorities let's listen to the
3405.12,3410.88, logic of this argument panel why why in most cases are ethnic minorities abandoned it's a lack of
3410.88,3416.88, representation a lack of political structures to represent them on their side your your land
3416.88,3421.68, redistribution is not going to go to them on our side we give them an accountability mechanism to
3421.68,3429.36, deal with that note that all of our accountability analysis from first has not been directly engaged with to the end of this debate. We're winning on that front.
3429.72,3434.7," Last question then, how will foreign powers react? They tell us foreign powers will just bend to the"
3434.7,3440.16," wills of African states that they recently colonized. And understand the logic of that,"
3440.26,3444.26," right? The fact that you were able to colonize them, but now you beholden to them. They said,"
3444.26,3450.52," one, because they need access to minerals, and the cold war note in their best case you no longer"
3450.52,3455.38, these big these big powers no longer have the incentives because if your reparations work
3455.38,3460.92, you're literally taking away the ownership of these big states of the harbors of the mines of
3460.92,3465.04, the of the roads that's to say you're literally undermining yourself when you say
3465.04,3470.56, those things because you remove the incentives for them not to invade but we gave you reasons
3470.56,3477.12, as to when they did but then thirdly the methods of the cold war was never to stand by idly
3477.12,3484.72, through diplomacy was more commonly by proxy wars uh is a wording that means freedom
3484.72,3497.28, and the caged bird sang for freedom.
3500.64,3505.72," All right, I thank the speaker for that speech. Checking the panel is ready."
3507.92,3508.14," All right, to conclude this debate for side opposition,"
3510.5,3510.88, can we have the reply speaker of the opposition?
3562.68,3568.0," Here you go. you Is everyone good? You're honourable, but maybe could you speak up a little bit more?"
3568.0,3572.0," Oh okay, better? Perfect."
3572.0,3573.0," Yeah, much better."
3573.0,3582.0," Starting in 3, 2, 1."
3582.0,3588.14," Panel, here are three things I hate. Firstly, the IMF imf secondly neocolonialism and thirdly"
3588.14,3594.46, poverty the truth is half of these things are likely to exist under both sides the question
3594.46,3600.5, becomes which side deals with a nefarious actor like the west with malicious leaders like africa's
3600.5,3606.14, we think side proposition has presented a largely idealistic case that is really withdrawn
3606.14,3610.72, from the context of the reality. So here's what I'm going to do in my reply. I'm going to ask
3610.72,3615.52, four questions that help us walk through side propositions case. The first of which is can their
3615.52,3620.52, context really stand together on two levels specifically. They tell us at the top of their
3620.52,3630.34, framing that this is an incentive from Western governments to continue to align with these African nations. But they also tell us that the mechanism through which they want to
3630.34,3637.2," like uplift the African people is through economic and land reparations. The issue, however, is this"
3637.2,3642.66, is some of the most radical socialist communist policy. This is important because their incentive
3642.66,3649.0, is premised on the idea that the USSR is going to be quelled at the point at which the West continues to engage with Africa.
3649.0,3656.0," A strange contention. Secondly, the ideas of malicious leaders, because if both sides characterize these leaders as being malicious,"
3656.0,3668.98," and we have seen this militia in manifesting through corruption, what does corruption look like on either side? Corruption on the outside looks like accountability mechanisms through other political parties, through mobilization,"
3669.32,3674.12," through popular protest. On their side, it looks like, A, difficult to trace because who knows"
3674.12,3678.82," about economic policy anyway under their characterization. But secondly, it looks like"
3678.82,3686.16, the mother that you're trying to save not being able to get the cash transfer which he so direly relies on. We think that
3686.16,3692.0, characterization is unlikely to be legitimate and is unlikely to serve the individuals they try
3692.0,3697.2," and serve. Secondly, we need to ask ourselves is the alternative that they proposed really unique"
3697.2,3702.16, because if they tell us that the best thing they get is cash transfers and money in the immediate
3702.16,3705.44, term what then is the way up because under our side we're
3705.44,3710.48, happy to support the existing mechanisms that came after enshrining of political rights we think
3710.48,3716.56, welfare is able to serve the same bit the same benefit of like cash transfers with additional
3716.56,3721.2, benefits of being able to still invest in your education system to still invest in things like
3721.2,3729.1, upskilling why is this something they can't do under their side? Because they're going to need to fund like taking the land from these MNCs in their
3729.1,3734.32, best case. This means you funnel money away from other projects. This is then specifically
3734.32,3739.18," important when we ask ourselves, can reparations really happen in isolation? Because at the"
3739.18,3742.76," point at which they tell us that there's a cost to maintaining land, there's a skill"
3742.76,3745.84," required, but also these individuals don't have the skill."
3745.84,3747.82, How do they want to equip the population
3747.82,3749.86, to manage the issues they present them?
3749.86,3752.92," Thirdly, can the Western institutions really act"
3752.92,3754.88, in a manner that is not nefarious?
3754.88,3756.98, What did we give you and why was it important?
3756.98,3759.74," Here, I want to bring back my O-1s matter"
3759.74,3761.52, that has yet to be responded to.
3761.52,3763.72, We told you that there's a vested interest
3763.72,3766.94, from the colonists to continue
3766.94,3772.42, their economic presence within Africa. This is important because any attempt to undo that
3772.42,3777.5, economic presence is always going to result in a harm. This isn't just a harm on the economic
3777.5,3781.8," faction of this country, but it's a harm on the political faction, which means in the long term,"
3781.88,3788.0," you're likely to get an instability. That means you can both not do economic reparations, but also not do anything political."
3788.0,3791.0, We think on their side they haven't given us something to compare it to.
3791.0,3796.0, So let's take the best thing they tell us about individuals being able to get up with social mobility.
3796.0,3802.0, We think this is unlikely to happen given the characterization of the type of land these individuals are going to be getting.
3802.0,3809.16," Fourth thing we need to ask ourselves, is it really fair to model your case in third? Because majority of the mechanisms that they want to"
3809.16,3813.9, assert to us throughout their speeches comes only in third. They tell us that there's a level of
3813.9,3818.0," accountability that they get on their side, that the economic reparations is going to have a"
3818.0,3822.28," trickle-down effect, but at the same time they tell us that these individuals are unlikely to"
3822.28,3828.24," participate in the democracy. So how then should you weigh the debate at the end of the day? Firstly, who does better for"
3828.24,3832.96," long-term economic reparations? My argument. Secondly, who does better to deal with the"
3832.96,3854.18," nefarious ways? My old one's argument. Who does better for Africa opposition? All right, attend the speaker for that speech."
3854.18,3857.72, Checking if the panel is ready.
3857.72,3861.18," All right, to conclude this debate for site proposition and the round as a whole, can"
3861.18,3863.5, we have the reply speaker of the proposition?
3863.5,3872.88, Checking on my audible. audible yep yes you are great
3872.88,3877.1, in this reply there's going to be weighing firstly on the model of which is more likely
3877.1,3882.5, then on the urgency why do we win on magnitude and lastly on the logical order we so let's
3882.5,3885.84, first let's start with then on the model we first want to clarify
3885.84,3891.28, something we don't believe that opposition had the ability to come here and say yes our model
3891.28,3898.32, simply happened no analysis as to which how did it happen no actual context of what what did it cause
3898.32,3906.78, how the victims and everything that they had to go through and no actual reality check as to which that Africa today yes it could be a
3906.78,3912.38, bit better than it was you know during colonialism but it definitely isn't the perfect picture that
3912.38,3917.46, they want to proceed to that being said why is then our likelihood why the unlikelihood it's
3917.46,3921.76, unlikely they have the rights that they claim they do have firstly we tell you that their
3921.76,3925.0, characterization of malicious government doesn't work in their favor.
3925.0,3931.0," We thought that if we take their characterization of malicious government, we believe that if you go past their examples and all of these searches,"
3931.0,3935.0," oh, it just happened and it's just going to happen again. We believe that on their side of the house,"
3935.0,3942.0," this malicious government has all of the intent to simply scapegoat, to say this is exactly what Angola did, for instance, to scapegoat and say,"
3942.0,3946.04," oh, but your constitution simply says that you have the right to protest."
3946.04,3948.68, Maybe your constitution simply says
3948.68,3950.4, that you have all of these rights.
3950.4,3952.7, You do not have the right to protest again
3952.7,3954.54, because you already have it on paper.
3954.54,3956.34, And they have the incentive to do this
3956.34,3957.76, because it's so malicious.
3957.76,3960.86," But we told you that we can also have,"
3960.86,3962.36," then on the likelihood,"
3962.36,3964.16, we believe that a malicious government
3964.16,3965.36, is much more likely to
3965.36,3969.68, actually cater to us because first of all notice and this was something that was hugely told you
3969.68,3975.76, in our third about how also these governments do reply on do depend on their economy so they have
3975.76,3981.44, an incentive to for their own malicious uh ideas give this to people so they can have some stable
3981.44,3985.52, economy but moreover this malicious government wants to be
3989.92,3994.0, in good terms with the west etc specifically and the west has an incentive to give them back because it's at the time of the cold war but moreover i want you to recognize something
3994.0,3999.76, never did they tackle the point of active cash transfer all their analysis as was to which oh
3999.76,4004.16, but you know it's hard to have a distribution because you don't know how profitable some land
4004.16,4010.48, is and who was it before we tell you at their best fine you have a huge just huge amount of our model never
4010.48,4015.04, being responded to and still stands as something that is just as possible to happen because it was
4015.04,4020.4, untouched from our first speech so even if you claim that maybe redistribution is unlikely to
4020.4,4030.08, happen if we have active cash transfer that is still a huge huge benefit for us out of the house then let's move on to the point of urgency we told you that it is un that we cannot
4030.08,4035.68, wait until maybe people get their rights maybe until some of the uh at the time or moreover we
4035.68,4040.72, cannot wait until maybe some policy becomes implemented that perhaps has an ability to maybe
4040.72,4046.4," impact their lives if it's specifically targeted to them. We believe that on urgency, these people, because they were,"
4046.88,4048.78, this was a time of after colonialism.
4049.02,4053.9, So it was centuries and centuries of never having their own economic rights
4053.9,4055.86, or any cash to put in their pockets.
4055.86,4059.44," We believe that on urgency, they simply have to get it as fast as possible"
4059.44,4061.4, because it is a matter of life or death.
4061.88,4064.42," Therefore, on our side of the house, because these redistribution happen"
4064.42,4069.12," and because active cash transfers happen, they least get some money uh to their pockets"
4069.12,4073.2, second of all when you talk about the magnitude we tell you and i like to point this out they tell
4073.2,4078.08, you oh but poor people do not know how to farm their land oh but yes they can completely know
4078.08,4083.12, how to vote in your side of the house specifically they didn't have a touch of democracy but before
4083.12,4108.8," from ever from uh for never basically but now they simply know how to how to do all of these things we believe this is simply false, but moreover we side of the house this is going to be accessible to all and not just the rich white elite that has the ability to get"
4108.8,4112.72, educated and maybe to vote for them one party is going to give them benefits or the other one that
4112.72,4116.96, is also going to work in their benefit because they're the only important voters and lastly i
4116.96,4120.4, just like to point out i'm not going to repeat this because there was this was brought up in my
4120.4,4129.72, first speech on the logical order of the wing why is it unlikely that you give economic rights after you get after you have some political rights this was never once touched about the
4129.72,4134.46, lobbying about about the leverage and about how people actually cannot uh cannot protest
4134.46,4152.26," continuously for all these reasons so proud to propose All right, I thank the speaker for that speech and I thank all six speakers for this debate."
4152.26,4157.16," Before I ask everyone to cross their hands and shake hands, can we first show our appreciation"
4157.16,4159.62, to our volunteer Sarah for helping us to keep time.
4159.62,4165.42, I'd like to ask everyone to use the clapping hand emoji reaction uh to thank uh sarah for giving time
4165.42,4171.76, it's really not easy and um we offer our thanks to you for that uh second of all i'd like to invite
4171.76,4176.16, everyone to uh virtually cross over and shake hands the way i normally do it is either a clapping
4176.16,4181.92, hand emoji or a heart emoji up to you uh because you know you're in different places but nonetheless
4181.92,4189.7, uh you know in the spirit of debating let's what the friendship is okay what's going to happen now is that the judges are going to move
4189.7,4196.9, into a breakout room uh i'm going to say let's move to op prep room five sorry op prep room 8a
4196.9,4202.38, so op prep room 8a we'll go there we'll discuss for around 20 to 30 minutes we'll come back with
4202.38,4205.04, the oe and the call and and we'll be happy to give
4205.04,4208.48," feedback thereafter. All right, thanks everyone. I'm going to pause the recording."
4210.96,4215.08," Okay, first thing first, let me just say that the panel really enjoyed this debate"
4215.08,4220.28," and I will say that personally as a historian myself, I was actually very, very impressed"
4220.28,4225.94, by the scale of research that both teams did on a admittedly very difficult motion.
4225.94,4230.02, So I offer and the panel offers our heartiest congratulations to both teams.
4230.02,4233.52, This was for me at least the best one I've watched so far.
4233.52,4236.3, And I watched the top room in round eight of the Eastern Division.
4236.3,4239.76, So I think people should be quite happy with the speaker scores they got this round.
4239.76,4241.3," Okay, that's it."
4241.3,4246.88," The panel did come into a unanimous decision in favour of Team Opposition, so that is Team South Africa."
4247.36,4249.84, Congratulations and commiserations to Team Croatia.
4251.46,4257.52," I'm going to go through the areas of style, content and strategy, but I'll be very quick on style because it didn't really affect the decision much."
4258.02,4265.88," On style, we would note that both teams exuded a level of emotional maturity in discussing these issues. We will just note two things."
4265.88,4271.74," Firstly, we note that opposition concludes their speech with the same line, which is a good thing to have."
4271.88,4276.98," But we would say that sometimes it's a little bit not natural, like it doesn't quite flow."
4277.1,4281.26, So we would perhaps encourage you to try to find ways to make it flow a little bit better.
4281.46,4286.0," We will note that some speakers on proposition was perhaps a little bit faster than our liking,"
4286.38,4286.88," but nevertheless,"
4287.56,4289.58, style was not an issue
4289.58,4292.24, that really affected the call in either way.
4292.66,4294.16," So moving on to content,"
4294.26,4295.7," which is where this debate took place in,"
4295.78,4297.24, and as far as strategy will be amalgamated
4297.24,4297.94, in the middle as well.
4298.44,4299.2, There were two questions
4299.2,4300.8, that we thought this debate came down to.
4301.32,4303.28," The first question is the more important question,"
4303.62,4304.3, and the second question
4304.3,4309.6," is a bit less important in this debate. The first question, which is a big question, is does economic"
4309.6,4315.12, reparation lead to economic development and therefore economic upliftment? We will note that
4315.12,4319.94, this is the broad direction of the propositions case and what they needed to prove in order for
4319.94,4325.04," them to win the debate. Under this broad question, there were three sub three sub questions and i'm going to go to"
4325.04,4329.2, each of these sub questions slowly and also explain how we came to our conclusions in this debate
4329.84,4335.52, the first up question is how does this economic reparation thing actually work and to what extent
4335.52,4340.72, would it be successful in that like how like will you get the land essentially the proposition
4340.72,4351.36," begins this debate by suggesting that this is a case where we are taking the land back from the colonizers, we are giving the land to people in these new nascent countries,"
4351.36,4356.96, and that they will be able to use this land as a hope. We did think that there was a number of
4356.96,4361.92, challenges from the opposition that perhaps weren't very well responded to by the proposition.
4361.92,4368.98, The first challenge that the opposition offers is the question of how are you going to check for the land claims. They suggested that doing things
4368.98,4374.34," like the Scramble for Africa, there were arbitrary borders that were drawn by European colonizers,"
4374.34,4379.8, and these necessarily complicated the extent to which land claims can necessarily be legible.
4380.24,4385.92, And the conclusion that you will get therefore from that point is that lots of people have claims over land.
4386.16,4389.04, It's unclear how the land claims itself would be adjudicated.
4389.7,4400.62," The response that we then get from the proposition, and this is bad because the likely situation then is that minorities are not likely to get the land in as much as the claims are disputed."
4401.04,4409.2, The proposition does give a response to some extent they suggested that because these countries don't want to form tensions or don't want to cause disruptions the distribution of
4409.2,4415.28, the land is likely uh to be relatively equal that's it uh the question of how were these
4415.28,4420.32, multiple claims adjudicated we felt was a challenge that wasn't addressed adequately enough
4420.32,4424.0, by the claim that you can have relative distribution because even if it's relative
4424.0,4429.0, distribution it's not clear how you resolve the earlier challenge of people having claims to land.
4429.0,4434.0," So to that extent, then the panel generally felt that when it came to the question of how would this work,"
4434.0,4443.0," we were, I guess, to some extent, bought into the case that the opposition provides that there is some doubt as to how exactly would this model operate."
4443.0,4445.84, But let's assume that the land distribution
4445.84,4449.92, is successful and we are able to distribute the land properly which i would note this isn't a very
4449.92,4454.8, big claim uh it's not a very big issue in the round the question that we need to ask then is
4454.8,4461.52, will giving then necessarily result in development and upliftment propositions claim in this debate
4461.52,4466.92, is as such they suggest firstly that land means access to things like resources
4466.92,4472.36," and means that you have access to things like farms, like chickens and crops and whatnot."
4472.36,4475.96," This is good because this allows for individuals to work on the land,"
4475.96,4481.32," therefore earning them money and from there, economic development for the rest of the country."
4481.32,4484.44," I will note that just from my recap of the argument itself,"
4484.44,4485.96, I think people can really start to see
4485.96,4487.6, there's a little bit of a logical jump
4487.6,4490.96, between people individually earning money in farms
4490.96,4493.18," and then the connection from that, therefore,"
4493.26,4495.3, to economic development of the nation.
4495.72,4497.58, So we will note that there's kind of a bit
4497.58,4499.38, of a logical jump there as is.
4499.84,4501.22, What did we get from the opposition then?
4501.72,4503.34, The opposition suggests a couple of things.
4503.78,4504.76, The first thing that they suggest
4504.76,4508.38, is to suggest that the reparation process is likely to be slow. I think we hear
4508.38,4513.36," the example that it took about 50 years, I believe, in South Africa for these claims to be filed."
4514.24,4517.84, That was the first response they provided. The second response and the one they came back to
4517.84,4522.82," more often is two things. Firstly, they suggested that the land they are going to get is likely to"
4522.82,4525.28, be bad and not arable and because of
4525.28,4530.32, and second of all even if the land was arable these individuals have no training to use the land
4530.32,4535.28, and therefore are not able to sufficiently use the land as a result i think we did get some
4535.28,4541.04, challenges to this from the proposition so this suggested that but the land itself can be useful
4541.04,4549.92, in other ways as well but i think the more the challenge that crop comes back to a lot more however was this idea that but we have cash transfers as well and cash transfers
4549.92,4555.04, can also be useful in fulfilling basic substances needs like the access to food access to things
4555.04,4561.84, like uh water and whatnot but i think at the i think at this point uh we didn't think that the
4561.84,4569.6, cash transfers argument was sufficient as a rebuttal for two reasons. I think the first thing to say here is that it's not very clear what this cash transfer
4569.6,4574.2, would look like. So how would people use it beyond the point of subsistence? But the second point to
4574.2,4579.66," make here is that even if it is subsistence, it's not development, which is kind of what the"
4579.66,4584.06, proposition was trying to achieve in this debate. So there's again a missing link between how the
4584.06,4588.88, cash transfers will result in economic development as a result the last thing that we get there from the property
4588.88,4594.88, from the opposition is idea that having land is not sufficient you need to have access to markets
4594.88,4599.76, and it's not clear how the market access is possible because you're going to anger the west
4599.76,4604.32, in the world of the proposition i will discuss how you anger the west in the second issue afterwards
4604.32,4608.64, but i will note here that markets according to opposition is important because without access
4608.64,4613.44, to markets you have access to development as a result so at the conclusion of this issue
4613.44,4618.16, what we what the panel felt was that the opposition was able to demonstrate that the
4618.16,4623.36, proposition perhaps will get subsistence from they will get some degree of money but it's not clear
4623.36,4625.18, how this is equivalent
4625.18,4629.26, or would likely therefore lead to a fully functioning economy that is economically
4629.26,4635.52," developed as a result. So on this question of whether giving land means development,"
4635.66,4640.48, the panel generally felt that the proposition wasn't able to approve the burden that he set
4640.48,4644.76, up to approve in this debate. The last question under this issue then is the question of does
4644.76,4648.96," political enfranchisement and political rights lead to economic development, which is the"
4648.96,4654.32, counter mechanism provided by the opposition. Opposition material came out in 01 talking about
4654.32,4660.4," accountability. It wasn't particularly clear how the accountability mechanism worked well in 01,"
4660.4,4664.72, but we thought that this material was much better expanded and in fact fully expanded in 02.
4664.72,4665.08, They also talked to us about how in order for you to access things like investments from But we thought that this material was much better expanded and in fact fully expanded in 2002.
4665.08,4668.72, They also talked to us about how in order for you to access things like investments
4668.72,4673.66," from corporations, you need to have political stability, security, as well as degrees of"
4673.66,4677.42, accountability through things like a strong rule of law and a court system.
4677.42,4681.5, I think we heard examples of the Dutch BOC and how they succeeded because the Netherlands
4681.5,4682.5, had court systems.
4682.5,4685.12, I think the comparison here is that the
4685.12,4690.48, opposition was able to demonstrate that investments are needed in the long term for fuller development
4690.48,4696.72, and not just for immediate satisfaction of current needs. The response that we then get then from the
4696.72,4702.4," proposition is really this claim that investments from the West are exploitative, it's likely to be"
4702.4,4705.44, bad and therefore that's something that we needed to avoid but i think
4705.44,4710.8, what the opposition was able to demonstrate here was that even if the investments were exploitative
4710.8,4715.12, there were trickle-down effects that came to the people in a form of things like skills and
4715.12,4719.2, infrastructure and more importantly through things like political accountability which is
4719.2,4723.68, all one's material here which was impacted in 03 uh people are less likely to be exploited because
4723.68,4726.48, their rights are enshrined within the constitution.
4726.48,4731.56," We will note here, however, that we will have appreciated perhaps more analysis of what"
4731.56,4735.7, the political enfranchisement and the enshrining of these rights would look like.
4735.7,4739.58," We thought that that particular line was perhaps a little bit missing from the opposition,"
4739.58,4744.2," but nevertheless, we did think that the opposition at this point was able to demonstrate that"
4744.2,4745.36, they were able to
4745.36,4750.56, provide an alternative means to be able to access development compared to the proposition.
4751.84,4756.16, And also the last thing to say here is really that I think the opposition has a suggestion that
4756.16,4761.44," these leaders, because of the context of the time, they have more capacity to do things like rules"
4761.44,4769.92, of law as opposed to focus on economic development policies they point to the example of ghana talking about how uh individuals i think the president in ghana
4769.92,4774.32, uh was able to write really good court systems but was economically greedy and that resulted in
4774.32,4778.8, problems for the economy so at the conclusion of this first issue of thus economic reparation
4778.8,4783.36, into economic development the panel generally felt that the proposition wasn't able to prove
4783.36,4786.46, the link whereas we felt that the opposition was able to prove
4786.46,4789.62," an alternative means by which to achieve economic development,"
4790.0,4791.68, and therefore we felt this issue went to them.
4792.02,4794.22, The second issue that's a bit more slight here
4794.22,4797.04, is the question of how will the West react to this policy.
4797.42,4801.14, The proposition says that the West is likely to be good to African nations
4801.14,4803.74, because they have resources and because of the Cold War.
4804.16,4808.08," On resources, the OPP responds by suggesting that no,"
4808.26,4811.0," because in a world where you have reparation policies,"
4811.34,4813.62, you are taking the resources away from the West
4813.62,4817.0, and giving that to the people in the African nations.
4817.4,4820.14, And this is likely to anger the West and create things like
4820.14,4822.52," pools, sanctions, etc., which are worse."
4822.98,4826.24, We will note that perhaps there will have been a little bit more analysis here
4826.24,4828.96, to explain how exactly the West would react in this way.
4829.24,4831.42," But nevertheless, we did think that the point was made."
4831.7,4834.84, We don't think there was a particularly strong response to this coming up from Prop.
4835.52,4837.52," What we did get from Prop, however, was this idea that,"
4838.02,4841.36," okay, sure, but they will then turn to the USSR,"
4841.9,4843.3, and then that becomes an issue.
4843.7,4846.26," There is a response that stood until 2003,"
4846.48,4849.82," who told us that the Cold War was felt not only on diplomacy,"
4850.1,4851.92, but also through things like proxy wars.
4852.3,4854.84," So I think the conclusion of this issue therefore,"
4854.98,4860.04, we felt that it was likely that the West will have a negative reaction.
4860.44,4861.98," So even if we didn't buy the USSR,"
4861.98,4864.3," so even if not the USSR response,"
4864.38,4865.42, we did think that the
4865.42,4867.44, Coups and sanctions argument
4867.44,4869.48, Did have some staying effect in this debate
4869.48,4871.18, And was an adequately responded to
4871.18,4873.34, By the proposition
4873.34,4875.16, The last thing I would say in this way
4875.16,4877.26, Is the question of the logical framing
4877.26,4878.98, So I think the props framing
4878.98,4881.68, That it only makes sense for you to have access
4881.68,4882.98, It only makes sense for you to have
4882.98,4886.6, Political rights after you have economic capital in the first place.
4886.9,4888.68, We will note a couple of things on that framing.
4888.94,4890.58, The first is that this is a continued framing
4890.58,4892.92, on prop proving that they get the development.
4893.4,4894.76, We weren't clear how they got the development
4894.76,4896.18, and therefore we didn't think this framing
4896.18,4897.86, stood particularly well in this debate.
4898.7,4901.7," Comparatively, we also did think that"
4901.7,4903.34," some of the reasons given by the prop,"
4903.44,4907.56," that is, for example, that people are too busy working to fuse,"
4907.96,4912.1," to participate in the political process, were things that were engaged with by the opposition,"
4912.22,4917.84, who suggested that this was a transformative event that people would want to engage with in that sense.
4917.84,4924.78," But nevertheless, we did think that framing or dual strategic was not one that was won by the proposition for the reasons that I've explained."
4929.2,4934.0," So that's the reasoning for the decision. I don't want to just end by saying that both teams genuinely did a very good job. I understand that this is, you know, like it may disappoint me to"
4934.0,4938.72," some, but I just want to say that debating really is a journey and that I think both of"
4938.72,4945.92, teams will go quite far in debating in life as well. Thank you. And I'll stop the recording now.
