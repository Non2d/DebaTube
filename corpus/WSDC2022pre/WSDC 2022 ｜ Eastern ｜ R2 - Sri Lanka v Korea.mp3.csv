0.0,25.06, 2.3 trillion dollars that is the value of student debt in the United States of America as of 2022.
25.78,30.72," This is debt that cripples people, traps them for life in a cycle of having to pay,"
31.02,34.42, and ruins their ability to access other outcomes or opportunities
34.42,38.76, because of the inability to access loans as a result of bad credit.
39.0,45.36, All of this because people are sold a lie based on how much their degree is actually worth.
45.58,50.58, It is only in a world where you don't precondition people's ability to access an education
50.58,54.42, on their ability to pay upfront that you break this cycle.
54.72,55.66, That is why we propose.
56.28,59.96, Few key points of setup before counterfactual and argumentation.
60.64,63.28," Firstly, I want to make it clear in status quo,"
63.28,65.96, the necessity of university as a precursor
65.96,66.96, for accessing a job.
66.96,68.6, There are two reasons here.
68.6,73.68," Firstly, in terms of competition, because of a large degree of access to education in"
73.68,78.96," the status quo, a uni degree is no longer an outlier, but a necessity of the norm."
78.96,87.44," In the United States by 2030, it's estimated that 98% of the workforce will have a university degree the second reason why"
87.44,93.36, it's a necessity is that the types of jobs which people have now demand higher skill and require a
93.36,98.56, degree because people very rarely now work in lower skilled jobs because automation has phased
98.56,103.6, that out we're talking about jobs in the tertiary and quaternary sector that require a university
103.6,105.22, education the problem then in status quo is that evenaternary sector that require a university education. The problem then
105.22,110.42," in status quo is that even when people can't afford going to university, they have to go to"
110.42,115.34," university because it is a form of insurance for your life and ensuring that you are unemployed,"
115.72,120.78, and thus they are driven into debt. This is also in a world where scholarships will always be scarce
120.78,125.2, because of the funding of universities is often insufficient. What then
125.2,130.34, is our counterfactual? Our world is one where universities would charge you a fixed percentage
130.34,135.1, of your total earnings after you graduate. This would be the same for all university graduates
135.1,139.96," in all fields. Secondly, it would be a set period of time and the same time period for everyone."
140.26,145.16," For example, this could look like 5% of your income for 10 years after you graduate for everyone."
145.5,154.04," This will be paid annually. So as your income changes, the amount you pay changes, different people will thus pay different amounts based on how much they are earning."
154.52,172.68," Two arguments from Prop 1. Before that, I'll take a POI. You can't say that you will have a fixed amount of years after you graduate for you to pay this proportion of your income because this kind of system is already happening in the status quo where this payment is happening indefinitely, for example, Purdue."
173.58,186.04," But that's not one that I don't know if that's actually true. And that's how most or if not all universities work. And second, it's about the preference, right? So your world is one where you have to support people paying for"
186.04,190.74," their college upfront, either through loans or not. Our side is one where you pay based on the"
190.74,194.94," income you've already earned. Of course, we can have a system with a set number of years. That's"
194.94,199.48, not something that's excluded. First argument as to why we better the student debt crisis on our
199.48,204.68," side of the house. In status quo, the problem with universities is that the price of your degree"
204.68,205.54, doesn't reflect how much you are going to earn after graduation that the price of your degree doesn't reflect
205.54,210.12," how much you are going to earn after graduation, i.e. it doesn't reflect the market value of"
210.12,211.22, your degree.
211.22,215.6, This is because universities have an incentive to get you to pay more than your degree is
215.6,216.6, actually worth.
216.6,217.6, This is for three reasons.
217.6,224.96," One, they can bank on other things other than employment as a reason for you applying to"
224.96,225.14, that university. Prestige and how big their brand name is. other on things other than employment as a reason for you employing rather applying to that
225.14,230.72, university prestige and how big their brand name is important alumni that they're able to leverage
230.72,235.46, in advertising advertising the university life and experience is something that is important
235.46,240.48, advertising things like campus aesthetics all the things they're able to use to get people to join
240.48,245.76, the second reason is that they deliberately obscure data of degrees with pure job prospects.
245.76,251.04," Either they don't collect data from their graduates but even if they do, they are able to obscure it"
251.04,255.92," in advertising because in advertising you won't focus on that statistic, you'll do things like"
255.92,260.72, focus on an interview with a few rich alumni that you're able to use to convince people to join.
260.72,265.04, The third reason is that students are irrational. They're often young and impressionable
265.04,269.46," and even if they're going into a bad field, they are likely to believe that they will be the"
269.46,273.96," exception. If I am going into the field of philosophy, I believe that I will be the philosopher"
273.96,279.3, who makes a huge discovery and do better. We think of ourselves as better than we actually are.
279.58,285.68, What this means is that people are forced to pay a lot more money than they should be and most people likely
285.68,290.98, have to take loans and go into debt in order to afford university. The costs of this compound over
290.98,296.12, time and most people are unlikely to be able to pay it as a result of interest as well. This is a
296.12,301.32," horrible issue for the vast majority of people. In the United States, people have to pay thousands"
301.32,310.4, of dollars every month just to cover the interest on their loans it cripples their ability to have a good life and meet a solid standard of living and actualize
310.4,315.28, themselves we solve this on our side of the house because we are not forced to pay more than the
315.28,320.88, market value than the degree even if you that you never have to go into debt because it's taken out
320.88,328.08, of money that you already have rather than based on circulation. The second thing we do is that we change the incentives of universities because you can no
328.08,333.04, longer base advertising on other factors but rather based on how much people will earn post
333.04,338.56, graduation because that is now the main source of income for universities. We thus allow people to
338.56,343.2, make more informed choices because we give them the information that is the most important to them
343.2,349.74," making that choice and two universities are more likely to do things like improve post-graduation employment prospects to meet this,"
350.0,355.62," allowing things like internships, capstone programs, allowing for things like job fairs and connections into the market,"
355.88,359.78, doing things like CV distribution programs where you give the university your curriculum vitae
359.78,363.04, and they give it to as many job opportunities as possible.
363.26,367.94," The upshot of this argument is that we are able to solve the debt crisis on our side of the house,"
368.1,372.24, which harms the life of the vast majority of people in status quo.
373.48,377.58, Second argument as to why we improve access to universities on our side of the house.
377.98,383.92, The problem with status quo is that the high upfront cost makes university unaffordable for a lot of people
383.92,385.56, if they don't go into debt.
385.84,390.56," As a result, poor people are deterred from applying to university. If you have a bad credit"
390.56,395.32," score, for example, you can't access a loan in order to go to university. There's also often a"
395.32,399.48, lack of access to scholarships because of the high cost that most universities have in terms of
399.48,405.34," paying faculty, taking care of facilities, housing, food, etc. You are not deterred on our side of the house"
405.34,409.64, because you do not have to pay upfront and do it purely based on what you already have
409.64,414.24, once you graduate. The second problem on their side of the house is that many people have to
414.24,419.2, drop out of university even if they get in for a bunch of different scenarios and I'm going to
419.2,423.72, give you examples as to what this looks like. If you have a breadwinner who gets unemployed in the
423.72,429.2," middle of your university career, you have to drop out because they can no longer pay for you. If your family business shuts"
429.2,433.36," down because of the COVID pandemic, you need to drop out of university because your parents no"
433.36,438.0," longer have the money to pay for you. In countries like Sri Lanka, the economic shock and inflation"
438.0,443.4, crisis means that people can no longer afford university and are dropping out. This is the
443.4,445.66, status quo. How do we solve this on our side of the house? More people are able to afford university and are dropping out. This is the status quo. How do we solve this on
445.66,450.26, our side of the house? More people are able to afford university because it is paid off of what
450.26,455.36, you earn in the future. This is better for society because we get a more qualified workforce in terms
455.36,459.7, of giving more people access to university because they are not deterred and don't have to drop out.
460.0,464.92," Second, people can apply to better universities with better facilities rather than just cheaper"
464.92,465.56," universities. In status quo, you're forced to apply to better universities with better facilities rather than just cheaper universities."
465.96,470.9," In status quo, you're forced to apply to universities that you can only universities that you can afford."
471.18,473.12," But on our side, that is no longer a barrier."
473.12,476.42, And you can apply to universities that will actually take you.
476.68,484.18," As a skilled person from a poor background in status quo, you are forced to compromise on your potential university prospects because of the fact that you are poor."
484.42,488.62, We eliminate that on our side of the house. The third thing we do is prevent cyclical poverty.
489.06,493.14," This is because in status quo, if you are poor and can't go to university, you will have to take a"
493.14,497.66," lower paying job, your kids will also be poorer and they also cannot go to university. It is only"
497.66,502.44, on our side that we break that cycle. The conclusion of this argument is that more people get access to
502.44,508.28, university on our side of the house and university fulfills its goal because it provides access to education for
508.28,514.5, substantially more people bettering the lives of millions only on proposition proposed.
514.5,521.52, I thank the speaker for their fine speech and would now like to invite the Honourable
521.52,548.86," Leader of Opposition. like to invite the honorable leader of opposition here Hi. Just a reminder that I want POIs verbal, please. Thank you."
551.38,557.58," So if everyone's ready, I'll begin my speech in three, two, one."
558.24,562.44," $2.3 trillion might be the debt that exists, but that doesn't actually change in the proposition."
562.92,568.4, What does change is schools choosing upfront talent over potential. You don't allow individuals who are marginalized in society
568.4,572.76, to get in because colleges definitely don't want to take the risk of possibly not getting the money
572.76,576.86, that they wanted or the upfront cost they probably would have had to pay under status quo back
576.86,581.32," because they aren't able to succeed in the future. Unfortunately, they destroy the opportunities for"
581.32,587.18, the people to get in that they wish to get in in the first place. We say that is why we're proud to stand on opposition. And we're doing a couple of things.
587.34,590.78," First, a couple of points of rebuttals. Second, our team stands. Third, the burden for proposition."
591.22,594.62, And we're going to afford two arguments in my speech. First argument on why propositions model
594.62,598.62, drastically decreases the opportunities from 9-year-olds to get into colleges. Second argument
598.62,602.8," on how you deteriorate the quality of education. And third argument, which is going to be proposed"
602.8,607.64," by Justin, which is why the majority of the students are going to be pushed to pay a higher price for education."
608.0,612.2," Before all of that, though, let's go into a couple points of rebuttals. The six minutes that Ashwin"
612.2,617.24, mainly spends on his arguments is that the price of a degree doesn't reflect the market value.
617.74,621.8," Universities want you to pay more, right? We have three responses. First, I don't think that all the"
621.8,625.96, things they note are arbitrary factors that the universities just use to make you pay more.
625.96,629.46," Things like campus life is similar to a vacation or a hotel, where the environment is the price"
629.46,630.46, you pay.
630.46,633.22," Things like a brand name matters quite a lot when it comes to job employment, right?"
633.22,634.7, Because it's a proven standard.
634.7,637.1, More scientific facilities are really expensive.
637.1,640.44, You're paying to use the up-to-date tools to conduct your high-quality research.
640.44,642.38, We think all of this contributes to your success.
642.38,643.38, That's the price you pay upfront.
643.38,647.04," Second, you might not be forced to pay the market value, but you probably are going to"
647.04,648.92," be forced to pay a whole lot more, right?"
648.92,652.1, I just want to know how problematic props model is because you don't pay the upfront
652.1,653.1, cost.
653.1,657.22," You pay the full cost and possibly more if it's endless and it's continuous, like after"
657.22,661.02," you graduate and you continuously take away a percentage of your income, especially if"
661.02,664.76," you earn maybe like a hundred K per year, you probably have to pay quite a lot of percentages,"
664.76,668.08, right? If you don't get a high high income you still pay more and more over time
668.08,672.56, over the upfront cost because eventually colleges might are still going to be profit oriented they
672.56,676.72, want to make sure they're getting as much money out of you as possible but third we think career
676.72,680.56, oriented consulting already exists but if a university truly cares about profits like we
680.56,684.88, told you especially within private universities and the top universities i would say it's probably
684.88,688.08, easier for them to just pick people with a high chance of success who
688.08,692.56, apply to these universities rather than invest into like a ton of money into different consultants
692.56,696.96, and like hire all these consultants to come help their career oriented oriented students but at the
696.96,700.88, end of the day that's probably far more expensive than just picking students who have a high chance
700.88,704.24, of success with a proven record i'm not going to take that at this point i'll take you a little bit
704.24,707.18, later they tell you then that the cycle of poverty continues on the
707.18,711.14," R side and they're able to break this because more people go to college. What we tell you is that no,"
711.36,715.5," not as much people go to college under your set of house, because now the colleges are the ones"
715.5,719.02," who invest into students. They are the ones who take all the risks, which means they have much"
719.02,723.18," more of a higher incentive to not be taking risks, especially when picking students. They want to"
723.18,725.66," make sure they have a proven record. R stands to this debate is simple. Universities should not be taking risks, especially when picking students. They want to make sure they have a proven record. Our stance is this way, it's simple."
725.94,727.64, Universities should not be the ones who invest
727.64,729.02, looking at the prospects of their students.
729.28,731.42, We support the status quo where schools are much more diverse
731.42,733.22," and ambitious, allowing students a chance"
733.22,734.68," to actually get into the schools,"
734.8,735.54, no matter their background.
735.82,736.98, We have two versions for proposition.
737.4,739.4," First, they must justify fueling colleges"
739.4,740.8, of profit-based incentives
740.8,742.8, in terms of prioritizing accepting students
742.8,748.4," whom the colleges think will be able to earn the most in the future. Second, they must justify colleges not being able to predict their"
748.4,752.72, reserve of monetary resources as accurately as the status quo and therefore not being able to make
752.72,757.04, the most efficient use of the resources. Moving on to our first argument then on why props model
757.04,761.28, drastically decreases the opportunities for the marginalized. The premise of this argument is that
761.28,767.24, proposition forces colleges to focus on accepting students with the highest percentage of success and proven historical record.
767.24,768.24, Why is it hard?
768.24,771.5," Understand that most colleges, especially top ones, are profit oriented."
771.5,775.02," The more successful and bigger the college, the more prestigious also means the more money"
775.02,778.66, they have to spend on education means they also need to care about the possible success
778.66,781.92," of the students, especially since they probably don't want the amount of money they are able"
781.92,788.22, to use in terms of increasing quality of education to fluctuate year by year. This means that they need to make sure they're making the
788.22,792.62," absolute return on investment into the students they pick. However, if the tuition were to be free,"
792.8,796.64," what they need to focus on isn't the potential talent, but rather the proven records and guarantee"
796.64,800.72," of monetary return. Why is this? Two things to note. First, considering the fact that students"
800.72,804.18," who get scholarships will still get them and attend under both sides of the house, what's"
804.18,807.04, important to consider are the students who don't get a full ride and need to pay the
807.04,811.2, upfront cost the problem here is that while students invest in colleges under our side it's
811.2,815.84, flipped on prop where colleges invest in students under our side students invest in college pay the
815.84,820.0, upfront cost in order to gain a step up through college and possibly succeed in the future under
820.0,824.24, prop colleges invest in students to make sure they receive the absolute gains and profits off of the
824.24,827.68, students they select meaning they're unlikely to take the risks but second what
827.68,831.12, happens when colleges are the ones investing in students since they don't receive the upfront
831.12,835.44, profit of the tuition fee like in the status quo they are now less incentivized to take risk when
835.44,839.52, making acceptance decisions and are more likely to invest in a proven record this means if you come
839.52,843.44, from a rich family and your family has connections in the business world you're probably more likely
843.44,848.8, to succeed and have a good stable job so the college will probably accept you no matter what even if
848.8,852.96, you were talented though but didn't have the opportunity to sign shine due to financial issues
852.96,857.2, colleges are that much less likely to accept you because they don't want to take that risk of just
857.2,860.64, blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars away because you could have paid in the upfront cost
860.64,864.64, marginalized students are the ones who usually aren't able to access the opportunity to prove
864.64,868.84, a show to prove a record right they can't get access to things like backdoor internships at large
868.84,872.96," firms or extracurricular activities that display their wealth, like playing upload-level tennis"
872.96,876.9, or golf or playing an instrument for years. It's much harder with marginalized students to get in
876.9,880.34," when colleges are the ones with power, ones holding all the risk. What happens in the status"
880.34,887.76, quo then? Colleges will still take in marginalized students on our side. even if these students can't pay up all this tuition straight up these colleges just collect
887.76,891.68, the student loans from the right now so profit-based incentive colleges have no reason to
891.68,894.88, be worried about accepting marginalized students because they know that they will get the full
894.88,899.04, amount of tuition from them anyways why is this important there's a majorly stops marginalized
899.04,902.96, students from being even able to get into these universities in the first place effectively
902.96,908.64, cutting education from the roots and making it unavailable to these individuals to climb the social ladder the comparative is
908.64,912.24, at least giving these students education along with subsidizing measures such as student loans
912.24,916.0, or scholarships the weighing here is important even if some people do get a good job because
916.0,919.76, they pass the period of payment you restrict everyone else from the most vulnerable barge
919.76,923.44, like toll from getting an opportunity to get a stable income or good job to begin with because
923.44,926.72," colleges don't want to take this risk before i I move on to my second argument though, I'll take that."
929.14,933.34, Universities don't have to care as much about merit now because they don't depend on the
933.34,938.66," employability of students. Given that merit is something that bypasses racial and ethnic barriers,"
938.94,942.16, why is it such a bad thing if universities pick on the basis of merit?
943.12,945.2," The bad thing is that under your set of house,"
945.44,946.94, the merit is unable to be proven
946.94,948.68, by the marginalized groups within status quo.
948.94,949.58," Like presumably,"
949.78,951.44, if you don't have the amount of financial resources
951.44,952.88," to get into these top competitions,"
953.12,954.24," you can't have a proven record,"
954.32,955.26, even if you're that talented.
955.56,956.1," Under our side,"
956.26,957.94," if you have the proven record you're getting in,"
958.02,958.58, that's the difference.
958.82,960.62, Second argument on how this deteriorates
960.62,961.52, the quality of education.
961.9,964.14," First layer on the shaky status of university funds,"
964.32,968.56," because on their side, university capital inevitably heavily fluctuates depending on the income"
968.56,972.48, status of the students that year right this means that universities don't have an insured amount of
972.48,976.56, money to grow and invest in the long term this means two things first you might have no plans
976.56,980.32, for the future which means you end up saving quality of education average goes down for these
980.32,984.48, universities e.g universities are less likely to take on large-scale investments that really
984.48,988.08, benefits their own students things like infrastructure good professors but second they
988.08,991.68, might just like probably force graduates to pay more in terms of the portion of income or
991.68,995.52, longevity they're feeding the purpose of gov's policy because they might tell you that they're
995.52,998.72, just going to like make them pay five percent we think it's going to depend from school to school
998.72,1002.32, right that means that this is especially true for prestigious universities which means that they'll
1002.32,1007.14, exponentially increase scouting from the very top but second layer of analysis is how there's going to be excessive
1007.14,1011.82," focus on practical academias, right? We think in order to maximize profits and funds, university"
1011.82,1016.26, will try to maximize student employment at high income at all costs. This means drastic decreasing
1016.26,1020.72," of the diversity of education and will only pay attention to jobs that make money in status quo,"
1020.96,1027.6," e.g. things like liberal arts schools, art majors will not be focused upon majors like stem will probably be much more preferred this is enhanced due to the first"
1027.6,1031.92, analysis we gave you the moment the university starts cutting down on spending the first victims
1031.92,1035.68, will be within these fields why is this bad because you lose the quality of education in
1035.68,1039.68, general leading to the generations of less competent graduates who get less high-paying jobs
1039.68,1043.84, or students lose critical thinking skills and important thoughts of morality and ethics that
1043.84,1046.26, comes with studying the humanities and social sciences.
1046.26,1049.3," Even if you wanted to become a politician, you probably don't get the resources to go"
1049.3,1052.14, to top universities because they probably want to make sure that they're getting as
1052.14,1053.72, much money from STEM field.
1053.72,1056.82," For these reasons, extremely proud to stand on up."
1056.82,1064.7," Thanks, I'm the speaker for that fine speech and would now like to call upon the Honourable"
1064.7,1065.52, DPM.
1065.52,1066.36, Thank you.
1072.56,1075.82," Hi, just to clarify,"
1075.82,1079.12," for speaker of site proposition uses they, them pronouns."
1079.12,1080.7," We're not gonna make a big deal out of this,"
1080.7,1116.0," but just wanted to remind the house Hi, can everybody hear me?"
1116.0,1118.0," Yeah, you're perfectly audible."
1118.0,1163.74, Thank you. I'll let you guys in chat please. and jeff please Three things in this speech.
1163.74,1166.5," First on increasing access to university education. Second, on"
1166.5,1170.4," reducing student debt. Thirdly, on improving the academic culture within universities,"
1170.4,1175.12," which will also be my substantive. First, on increasing access to university education."
1175.12,1179.42," I want to make a big clarification about what our model was in first, because opposition"
1179.42,1184.84, seems to have misunderstood it. Our claim was never that tuition costs will remain fixed
1184.84,1185.84, and that people will be
1185.84,1191.68, forced to pay that tuition cost as debt once they have earned a job as a proportion of their income.
1192.08,1198.02, Our argument was rather that there will be no fixed cost within a degree for how much each
1198.02,1202.32, individual has to pay that the university says that you must pay within your lifetime.
1202.78,1205.26, It will be the case as they concede in their second
1205.26,1211.34," argument, and as is apparently clear in our first speech, that you set a fixed percentage within a"
1211.34,1216.48," fixed time, and that is all the university can ever charge you for your degree. Now, we can see"
1216.48,1221.28," that this may mean that across different degrees or within the same degree itself, different people"
1221.28,1226.9, end up paying different amounts. But we think that that is beneficial because it fixes the incentives of universities
1226.9,1229.78, to give better degrees and more employable degrees
1229.78,1231.5, to the most vulnerable students.
1231.5,1233.8," So to be clear, on our side of the house,"
1233.8,1235.4, there is no fixed tuition cost.
1235.4,1238.26, You only end up paying what you pay within that fixed time
1238.26,1240.76, period as a proportion of the income that you earn.
1240.76,1242.56, This leads me to direct responses.
1242.56,1249.56, The biggest push from the opposition in this clash is that we will not allow marginalized students into university because they aren't able to prove
1249.56,1254.54," that they will be successful and get higher paying jobs. Three areas of response. Firstly,"
1255.02,1259.02, I would argue that merit-based admissions are more likely on our side of the house.
1259.38,1264.3," This is because even students from marginalized backgrounds, such as racial minorities or poorer"
1264.3,1265.08," students,"
1270.18,1275.1, have the capacity to succeed once they enter prestigious or even well-established universities that give them a valuable degree that allows them to enter the workforce. So saying that you can't
1275.1,1280.4, prove that you are a qualified individual before you attend university isn't a barrier that prevents
1280.4,1289.36," universities from trying to determine, based on the available opportunities, whether you are likely to be successful in university so on the comparative we think that universities have"
1289.36,1294.88, a greater capacity to look beyond the limitations of money that poorer students might face and see
1294.88,1298.64, what they have managed to do with their limited opportunities which means that there is a greater
1298.64,1303.2, incentive to engage in merit-based admissions because you know once the student enters
1303.2,1308.48, university they have access to all of the opportunities for things like career advancement and the same degree as their
1309.36,1314.24, contemporaries and peers which means that they are more likely to be successful so you cut across
1314.24,1318.8, racial and poverty-based barriers secondly i would point out that on their side the house
1318.8,1323.12, merit-based admissions are less likely this is because you have an incentive to take in the
1323.12,1328.88, students not the students who are most likely to succeed after they leave university with their undergraduate degree and get a high
1328.88,1333.68, paying job but the students who are most capable of proving that they will be able to cover the
1333.68,1338.72, cost of tuition up front this means that rich children of alumni that are able to prove that
1338.72,1343.44, they can pay the entire cost of their tuition within a fixed period of time are more likely
1343.44,1348.66, to get into university in the world of the proposition because these are the students that can demonstrate that they can pay
1348.66,1354.0," the cost of university. Secondly, I want to weigh in between these two points because on their side"
1354.0,1358.9," of the house, the underlying assumption is that if you eliminate this model, marginalized students"
1358.9,1364.26, can get into university anyway. If what they say is true and marginalized students lack the money
1364.26,1365.26, to be able to demonstrate
1365.26,1369.62," that they have skills that will make them successful in the workplace, then surely they"
1369.62,1374.1, also lack the money to be able to prove that they will be able to pay for university. Most poorer
1374.1,1378.66," families have terrible credit scores, which means that they're not even able to get student loans"
1378.66,1384.5," unless they're at incredibly high interest rates. Comparatively, your ability to pay for things like"
1384.5,1385.12, extracurricular
1385.12,1389.44, activities or even to go to a slightly better school that gives you more opportunities to prove
1389.44,1394.48, your academic excellence is comparatively greater so if the way up is between on which side of the
1394.48,1398.96, house we give more opportunities to marginalize students a world in which they are able to control
1398.96,1404.24, their merit is far greater than their ability to pay for university upfront thirdly i would point
1404.24,1408.78," out that their counterfactual is morally perverse, because it is one in which we deliberately lure"
1408.78,1413.48," poorer students into degree programs where they are less likely to succeed, knowing that that is"
1413.48,1417.7," going to happen, but allowing them to make that choice anyway. Let's assume their best case."
1417.94,1422.38," Perhaps there are some degree programs for which things like connections, things like your family"
1422.38,1425.52," matter. For example, getting a job in the art world"
1425.52,1428.66," is probably largely a product of nepotism, unfortunately."
1428.66,1429.76," If this is the case,"
1429.76,1432.24," we are perfectly happy with universities saying,"
1432.24,1433.96, we are more likely to accept students
1433.96,1435.12, from richer backgrounds
1435.12,1437.24, because they are more likely to be successful.
1437.24,1439.5, That simply means that the poor students
1439.5,1441.72, are redirected into the kinds of fields
1441.72,1444.58, where merit is the greatest determinant of their success.
1444.58,1449.34," Things like the corporate world, things like STEM, where your family background and connections don't matter,"
1449.58,1452.38, but your ability to program and your mathematical skills do.
1452.64,1456.58," So comparatively, we think that even their worst case is something that we would prefer."
1456.98,1464.72," Finally, this actually shifts the incentives of universities because universities won't just be able to rely on the small number of students"
1464.72,1468.0, that will be able to prove that they will be successful in the job market anyway.
1468.0,1475.0, The fact that you are successful in your extracurricular activities and have good test scores isn't really an accurate determinant of success in the workplace.
1475.0,1490.0," In the vast majority of cases, the easier and more affordable way for universities to guarantee that they will be able to maintain their expenses is to just offer and aggressively market the best degree programs to students, which means that you get less obscure advertising"
1490.0,1494.6, and marketing that fools students into believing that they can go into the humanities and still
1494.6,1497.9," be highly employable. So comparatively, the word is better on our side of the house because"
1497.9,1501.64, the incentives of universities are better. Secondary of response on reducing student
1501.64,1503.3," debt. Before that, the point."
1503.3,1509.34, Why do students join business frats in college if connections in the corporate world didn't matter at all?
1510.64,1516.56," Well, I mean, that's actually a reason for us to write connections is something you can get once you are in university, which proves my previous point."
1516.56,1520.48," On student debt, they say that your brand name and your facilities contribute to your success."
1520.82,1528.96," If this is true, it will be reflected in student salaries and will be reflected in a greater proportion of income being charged so that's not a problem the problem is that universities have not"
1528.96,1534.64, kept up with the times they continue to rely on archaic notions of name brand recognition even
1534.64,1539.68, when the market is far has far outpaced them and relies on things like students performance within
1539.68,1544.08, university so we think that on our side of the house universities are less able to engage in
1544.08,1545.5, obscure advertising.
1545.5,1547.88," Secondly, they say that university capital will fluctuate."
1547.88,1551.58," First, there are incentives to weather against this fluctuation, which means that you keep"
1551.58,1552.58, pace with the job market.
1552.58,1556.0," It means that you are more likely to offer the degree programs with the best, latest"
1556.0,1557.0, degree of employability.
1557.0,1560.44," Secondly, there's an incentive to cut down on inflated expenses."
1560.44,1564.44," Why should universities like Oxford and Cambridge spend so much of their students' tuition,"
1564.44,1569.58, maintaining vast premises and maintenance of statues when in fact this doesn't contribute to the student experience?
1569.84,1578.5," Thirdly, there's an incentive to find alternative sources of funding, things like university investments into land or even businesses or even things like strengthening alumni networks."
1578.76,1589.52," Comparatively, even if we have lower salaries for university professors, that would be comparatively better because it also means lower tuition costs which we think means that we increase access to education"
1589.52,1593.76, finally my own argument about why you improve the academic culture within universities
1593.76,1599.12, in status quo universities employ a loose model of academic oversight because they know even if
1599.12,1604.8, students drop out or perform poorly in university you can always charge them the same tuition now
1604.8,1606.34," when poor when students perform poorly in university, you can always charge them the same tuition. Now, when students"
1606.34,1610.98," perform poorly in university, it directly hurts their profitability and increases the likelihood"
1610.98,1615.74," of fluctuation because poorly performing students will get lower paying jobs. Therefore, on our side"
1615.74,1619.44," of the house, there is far greater academic oversight. There is additional support for"
1619.44,1623.46," struggling students. There is greater student-professor interactions, which increases the"
1623.46,1628.62," likelihood that you get higher marks in university exams, that you are more successful in university"
1628.62,1632.56," as well. Notably, this means that for the most vulnerable students who are the most"
1632.56,1636.76," likely to not have additional support in university, who are the most likely to struggle with this"
1636.76,1641.36," loose academic oversight, are the most likely to succeed once they get into university."
1641.36,1645.52," Given then that we not only increase access to university education itself,"
1645.52,1647.9, but also increase the success of the poorest
1647.9,1649.26, and most vulnerable students
1649.26,1651.52," once they get into university, propose."
1654.84,1657.04, I thank the speaker for that fine speech
1657.04,1658.46, and would now like to call upon
1658.46,1704.38," the Honorable Deputy Leader of Opposition, Kher Kher. opposition. Am I clearly audible?"
1704.38,1706.68," Yes, you are. Am I clearly audible?"
1707.88,1708.66," Yes, yes, you are."
1709.76,1716.4, You are in the chat.
1719.56,1719.84, The incentives of universities don't magically change.
1721.8,1722.1," Just because proposition implements the motion,"
1724.18,1727.02, it doesn't mean that universities become benevolent and want to help struggling students with an angelic heart.
1727.02,1730.8, The reason why they say things like students have hard times pulling out loans because
1730.8,1735.68, of things like their credit scores is precisely because universities care about those returns
1735.68,1737.36, and want to maximize that.
1737.36,1743.48," Our claim was that on our side, students are unlikely to be able to give back the tuition"
1743.48,1744.48, of the school.
1744.48,1748.82, We're likely to be cut off entirely. They needed to prove why universities would take that risk
1748.82,1752.84," in the first place, where they would choose a marginalized student over one from a privileged"
1752.84,1757.26," background. That is precisely what the debate is about. Two areas of refutation. Number one,"
1757.34,1761.16," what happens to minority students? We told you, the moment at which this motion is implemented,"
1761.56,1769.12," colleges are forced to pick not potential talent that may blossom, take that risk, but rather the guarantee of money return. Since students, as we told you,"
1769.18,1773.08," are in the middle ground, like the middle ground are the consideration, those that get scholarships"
1773.08,1777.52," are probably out of the debate anyway. But the difference was that on our side, students invest"
1777.52,1782.42," in college, pay the cost upfront, whereas on proposition, colleges invest in students to make"
1782.42,1788.4, sure that they receive the absolute gains and profit off of students meaning that they're unlikely to be willing to take those risks
1788.4,1792.08, what are those risks we told you schools are likely to look into your family connections
1792.08,1796.16, in the business world where your background is so marginalized students consistently can't access
1796.16,1800.4, those same opportunities as privileged ones which is why from the perspective of colleges they're
1800.4,1804.8, less likely to succeed this isn't a comparison between marginalized students that is to say the
1804.8,1807.88," college isn't saying oh if we take in this marginalized student, maybe they"
1807.88,1811.98, have a chance to succeed in the future. This is a comparison between marginalized students from
1811.98,1816.26, poor backgrounds versus the background of a student with a massively developed and privileged
1816.26,1821.26," background that we're weighing up. On our side, this is okay. Insofar as colleges know, they're"
1821.26,1829.76, able to collect student loans in the future. And if their model is true like the thing about having a fixed percentage of income note that this still applies insofar as
1829.76,1835.12, if students don't have high salaries in the future the college gets less returns on money for example
1835.12,1840.24, if you struggle to find a job after you graduate if you earn minimum wage 10 over 10 years it
1840.24,1845.04," doesn't mean that much money for the college which which means that they actively miss out. They say,"
1849.66,1854.18," oh, this is okay because it's determined by merit now. But the definition of merit on their side is literally how much money a student can make or how much money a student is likely to make"
1854.18,1858.42," upon graduating, which means that you ultimately put marginalized and poor students at an ultimate"
1858.42,1862.54, disadvantage because they have no way to compete against the rich and privileged students that are
1862.54,1868.24," coming, not rich and privileged students that they're competing against on their side of the house recognize that this is also conceded"
1868.24,1872.56, by proposition in their second argument where they talk about why there's a lot of reasons as to why
1872.56,1876.96, people might not be able to afford university i would actually argue this is far worse on their
1876.96,1881.04, side since universities now have an active incentive to filter out those students who
1881.04,1884.8, they think have a risk of not being able to pay that money back so they're far more likely to
1884.8,1887.94," check things like your family background, how stable the"
1887.94,1891.48," income of your family is likely to be, the connections that you're likely to have established"
1891.48,1895.34," already, and ultimately what the chances of you succeeding in the future are."
1895.34,1898.74, Those are the reasons why marginalized students miss out on those at the house.
1898.74,1902.5," If they cannot get into the university in the first place, our point is that you block"
1902.5,1905.0, them from accessing that education at all.
1905.18,1910.3," Before I move on, I'll take that point. More so than your family connections, your ability to cope"
1910.3,1915.52, with the rigorous demands of university education are a greater determinant of whether you will
1915.52,1920.24, succeed after you complete your degree. Why then wouldn't universities overlook the fact that poorer
1920.24,1924.38, students have fewer opportunities and look at the limited opportunities that are available to them
1924.38,1928.3, to try to assess their merit on the basis that once you get to university you are the most
1928.3,1934.34, likely to succeed and therefore have a higher paid job. Firstly really long POI but secondly like
1934.34,1938.68, as we already told you again this is not a comparison between like marginalized students
1938.68,1943.3, as we told you so yes it is true we agree that marginalized students have the opportunity to
1943.3,1948.2," succeed in college if you give them the resources and and that is good. That is what happens on our side of the house,"
1948.32,1951.8, insofar as colleges know that they have a guaranteed return from those students. What
1951.8,1956.26," happens on your side is that, again, you are not weighing off like one marginalized student over"
1956.26,1959.58, another marginalized student. You're weighing off a marginalized student versus a privileged
1959.58,1964.04, background. Colleges are likely to not take that risk. You need to prove to me why colleges are
1964.04,1967.9, likely to make that trade-off and say they're willing to take the risk of letting this marginalized student
1967.9,1973.02," in, even if it means that they lose millions of dollars. Second area of the debate then on quality"
1973.02,1977.36," of education. Proposition asserts their model, which is that this is a fixed percentage regardless"
1977.36,1981.44," of income. First of all, I'm not sure if they can assert that this is how all universities will do"
1981.44,1988.72," it. I'll talk about this later as well, but let's assume this is true true if it is true that universities are taking in these poor students and you only pay a percentage"
1988.72,1992.64, of your income regardless of what your income is so it might be really low right that means the
1992.64,1997.28, college actively loses money so that means that colleges have less and less resources to invest
1997.28,2002.16, into a good quality education their model is a concession to our second argument but secondly
2002.16,2009.76," we told you the areas colleges invest resources into fundamentally changes. Insofar as colleges lose money, they'll try to maximize and capitalize"
2009.76,2014.84," on practical areas of academics. Since it is a set price for income, that means the main goal"
2014.84,2018.98," of colleges precisely becomes to increase the income of students as much as possible,"
2019.06,2023.32, no thanks to that POI. That means liberal arts schools actively lose funding and support because
2023.32,2031.16," it's hard for those schools to survive. So that means less funding, less tuition means less and less quality of education for those schools until they eventually die out."
2031.16,2036.98," If a student dreamed of majoring in Russian literature, they would struggle to find a school that finds that major to be marketable."
2036.98,2041.48, This is a direct response to the argument because their imaginary funding doesn't have anywhere to come from.
2041.48,2049.58," So that means you have to be deterred. The quality of education insofar as there's a massive cost at risking humanities and liberal arts majors, and you don't"
2049.58,2054.1, get a more diversified education on their side. So the goal of education isn't just for students to
2054.1,2058.64," find high-paying jobs, obviously. It's not fair to kill the dreams of those students. No response"
2058.64,2063.32, whatsoever from the speaker before me. Moving on to our third argument as to why students are punished
2063.32,2068.4," when it comes to paying tuition on proposition. First thing to note in this argument is that like, Proposition doesn't"
2068.4,2072.8, have the fiat to claim that this motion will be implemented perfectly in their fantasy land. What
2072.8,2076.8," do I mean? Like, they can't say that this is how the world works because we have proposition and"
2076.8,2081.2," set up the debate. That is, they can assume that in their world, universities collect a portion of"
2081.2,2087.0," their income from their graduates on graduation, but they can't arbitrarily decide what exactly it would look like."
2087.0,2092.0, They needed to logically prove to me why that method of collecting a portion of their income is likely to occur.
2092.0,2095.0, Note that this motion is being implemented currently in the status quo.
2095.0,2106.86," The percentage of the income that universities with this policy right now currently take is around 50 to 20% of salary, and for schools like Purdue, like we mentioned in a POI, where their income sharing agreement that has a loan system,"
2106.86,2109.48, it can end up charging students up to two to three times
2109.48,2110.78, the cost of their education.
2110.78,2112.96," So it's not a perfectly set time they want,"
2112.96,2114.58, where the universities are collecting
2114.58,2116.88, just the amount of tuition that students were trying to pay.
2116.88,2118.72, It's a world where universities are likely
2118.72,2120.28," to share the income of these students,"
2120.28,2122.5, even when that means that the income of universities
2122.5,2129.72," may oftentimes exceed the actual tuition of the school. And even if you buy a proposition model 100%, they literally concede"
2129.72,2134.08," this because if it is a set percent, if your income is super high, that means you end up paying"
2134.08,2138.72, far more tuition than what the original cost was. Why then is this version of the world likely?
2139.04,2143.16, Because colleges literally lose money on their side of the house. Instead of students paying
2143.16,2148.1," the full price of tuition, if they do not have enough money to pay, colleges lose that money, which means there's a"
2148.1,2152.58," huge money gap to fill. Colleges are likely to want to fill that gap, and the easiest way they"
2152.58,2156.62, can do that is by continuing to take away the income of successful students for a longer period
2156.62,2161.56," of time. This is predatory and almost equivalent to indentured servitude, insofar as universities"
2161.56,2172.92," are actively overcharging students and taking away their wealth. Even if you don't buy the entirety of my argument, the alternative of this argument is that proposition is forced to concede that universities have far less money in their world,"
2172.92,2180.68," which the previous speaker conveniently ignores, by the way, which precisely means that schools have less and less resources to teach students, attract better professors,"
2181.06,2188.04," and invest into majors that lose out on their side of the house and invest into the education of students, which is a huge harm that they needed to defend"
2188.04,2189.04, because they.
2189.04,2193.4," harm marginalized students, they do not improve the quality of education, but are more likely"
2193.4,2196.24, be predatory to strongly students were very happy to.
2196.24,2197.24, oppose.
2197.24,2206.92, speaker for that fine speech and would now like to call upon the Honourable
2206.92,2210.72, Government Whip to wrap up the substantive case for the government side.
2210.72,2211.72, They're here.
2211.72,2214.72," Hi, did you check if I'm audible?"
2214.72,2216.72," Yeah, you're perfectly audible."
2216.72,2241.04," I'll take PIs in the chat, please. Three clashes in my speech. First on minorities and the poor, second on the cost of"
2241.04,2245.02," education, and finally I'll talk about the culture within universities."
2246.66,2247.18," First, on opportunities for minorities."
2248.76,2251.8, I just want to make an observation about what opposition has given us in this debate.
2252.12,2255.32," That is, even though they were so quick to criticize us"
2255.32,2256.88," on our counterfactual,"
2256.88,2259.16, there is a lack of counterfactual analysis
2259.16,2260.38, on their side of the house
2260.38,2263.14, as to why minorities are able to afford
2263.14,2266.32, the cost of university education on their side given
2266.32,2270.96, that we have fleshed out you in the framing of first speech that many of these individuals find
2270.96,2276.4, it hard to have an access to capital or even take out loans due to things such as bad credit scores
2276.4,2282.4, so why minorities can afford university and attend on their side is still extremely unclear so what
2282.4,2285.4, they're doing in essence is running in negative case without
2285.4,2290.92, any positive impact. Let's be realistic and look at the barriers that minorities face to
2290.92,2296.9, entering universities in the status quo. First is racism and external biases that exist in society.
2297.4,2302.84," Second is monetary and financial capacity to enter university. And finally, it's on the ability to"
2302.84,2305.48, display merit and have qualifications all of
2305.48,2311.3, which we agree are barriers so let's deal with each and every single barrier first then on finance
2311.3,2316.68, i want to note that although minorities are unable to garner financial capital to attend
2316.68,2321.56, university on opposition because they are uncertain whether the job they take can pay
2321.56,2328.46," off the debt they accrue in the long term, you have a guaranteed way of paying for your university tuition costs on our side of the house."
2328.7,2333.84," Because it is a proportion of income you will definitely earn in the future once you get a job,"
2334.1,2337.38, regardless of whether you get a low paying or a high paying job.
2337.6,2340.34," So because it is a percentage of already earned income,"
2340.54,2343.5, you will always be able to afford the costs of university.
2343.86,2345.68," Second, I would note that"
2345.68,2350.5, opposition concedes that universities will pick on the basis of things such as merit and
2350.5,2354.7," exceptionality, given that they want the most exceptional students, given that they are the"
2354.7,2360.56, most employable. I quickly want to note here that the incentive for universities to favor
2360.56,2365.34, white rich people with connections to the business world is probably symmetric on both
2365.34,2370.98, sides of the house given that these are individuals who even on opposition's world can straight up pay
2370.98,2376.5, the cost of university tuition therefore there is an incentive to favor these individuals even on
2376.5,2381.74, their side of the house so i don't know why there is an exclusive harm on our side hasn't been fleshed
2381.74,2385.76, out but no but universities know that even if you are extremely
2385.76,2392.24, rich if you are unemployed if you don't do well in university you won't be employable even if you
2392.24,2397.12, have connections because companies want individuals who are brilliant who will turn them a profit
2397.12,2402.08, given that companies in and of themselves are profit motivated so universities have an incentive
2402.08,2410.38, to pick off the basis of merit i don't know then that merit is able to forego the biases minorities face within society
2410.38,2415.9, because universities recognize that even if the admissions process may be biased towards
2415.9,2421.18," Black individuals in opposition's world, that bias comes at a monetary cost to the university"
2421.18,2425.3, in our world because not picking members who have exceptional talents
2425.3,2430.54, within minorities means that you lose out on you lose out on your demographic of students
2430.54,2435.54, who are extremely employable who bring profits to the university so i would note that we are
2435.54,2440.8, also able to reduce the barrier of racial and social biases the final barrier i want to talk
2440.8,2445.42, about is on the ability to acquire and display merit and that is how I'm going to
2445.42,2450.7, break the tie in this clash. The first thing I want to note is that opposition says that minorities
2450.7,2457.2, cannot demonstrate merit in the world currently but that is also a reason as to why minorities
2457.2,2461.74, won't make it into universities on their side of the house because universities want individuals
2461.74,2470.26, who are extremely talented on either side given given that the results you can produce are the way you market yourself and your prestige as a university.
2470.26,2476.34," So if as a minority, you can't acquire things like a good SAT score or good sports extracurriculars,"
2476.6,2478.42, you likely aren't going to get in on their side.
2478.66,2485.12, But the important analysis I want to make is that minorities are better able to acquire merit on our side of the house
2485.12,2490.8, because the capital they save up for university can instead be invested into attaining merit.
2491.12,2496.56," What does this look like? On our side, the member of a disenfranchised community who needs to work"
2496.56,2502.38, a part-time job while in high school to finance his university education no longer has to save
2502.38,2506.14, that money up in order to pay for university or go to a lower
2506.14,2511.94, or lower quality university because that's all they can afford instead this individual can use
2511.94,2517.0, the capital that he or that they have acquired in order to afford things such as SAT tuition
2517.0,2522.54, in order to get better scores in order to afford the equipment for extracurricular activities so
2522.54,2526.92," I would note that minorities find it easier to display merit on our side of the house,"
2526.92,2529.28, as well as apply to better universities
2529.28,2531.7, because financial restraint isn't something
2531.7,2534.1, that occurs in our world in the short term.
2534.1,2536.16," That is not something they responded to,"
2536.16,2537.98, even though they fleshed out the analysis
2537.98,2539.22, in first and second.
2539.22,2541.96, So I clearly think that on all three of those constraints
2541.96,2543.96," that minorities have in the status quo,"
2543.96,2548.8, we are able to break those down. The second thing i want to talk about is on the cost to universities and
2548.8,2554.72, whether they will have profits and be able to fund their operational costs the first thing to note is
2554.72,2560.32, that a lot of people who have university degrees get employed and this is the framing ushering
2560.32,2565.04, gave you in their speech and when they explain the importance of university degrees
2565.04,2570.24, even if some people get low paying jobs some people get high paying jobs and some people get
2570.24,2577.12, mediocre jobs the aggregation of the income stream of your entire student body means that universities
2577.12,2582.32, get large amounts of revenue the second thing i want to note is this is a this house prefers
2582.32,2585.92, notion so you need to envision a separate world where from
2585.92,2590.96, the beginning of time universities pursue this policy this debate is not about the implementation
2590.96,2596.62, of this policy in the status quo we live in i don't know that in this ordinary imaginary world
2596.62,2601.7, universities who have taken the precautionary measures to ensure that they had large amounts
2601.7,2610.16, of excess capital what does this look like it looks like cutting down on luxury costs such as taking care of statues or luxury student housing that occurs
2610.16,2614.72, in universities like Oxford and Cambridge that opposition wanted to characterize. It looks like
2614.72,2620.06, investing in companies like they do to an extent in the status quo in order to garner returns but
2620.06,2625.56," they'll do it far more in our world in order to garner more capital. So I would note that in this world,"
2625.7,2626.94," even in our worst case,"
2627.22,2628.5, there are ways in which universities
2628.5,2629.9, shield themselves against the cost.
2630.22,2631.94," Finally, they give us this ludicrous claim."
2632.22,2634.32," Oh my God, universities are going to charge"
2634.32,2635.54, 50% of your income.
2635.9,2637.04," If universities do that,"
2637.2,2639.36, people probably aren't going to attend these universities
2639.36,2640.96, because they won't be able to afford
2640.96,2642.34, the cost of living in the future.
2642.8,2644.62, Universities are competing with one another
2644.62,2647.02, and they know that people will flock to the universities
2647.02,2648.38, that have the highest percentages.
2648.78,2649.76," So the perfect incentive,"
2649.9,2651.78, they wanted to characterize works against them.
2651.98,2653.26," Before I move on, I'll take that viewer."
2654.5,2656.3, You can get a loan for college education.
2656.52,2657.56, You're unlikely to get a loan
2657.56,2658.74, for paying for business tournaments.
2659.12,2660.56, Why is merit so easy to achieve then?
2661.24,2662.82, You can't get a loan for college education
2662.82,2664.5, and that's what we fleshed out in our first speech.
2669.92,2674.96," Okay, final cash then on opportunities within academic culture. I want to note that they have very little response to the argumentation that came from first and second which is that you"
2674.96,2680.0, improve academic counseling for individuals during the course of their degree because you know that
2680.0,2685.76, if students struggle they'll be disemployable that after people graduate you want to improve existing
2685.76,2690.72, postgraduate job opportunities and networks to find jobs for people it's not good enough to say
2690.72,2696.24, that this already happens when we told you that those structures will improve so no response there
2696.24,2701.12, and that is an independent path to victory however what i do want to respond to is this idea that you
2701.12,2709.52, just get rid of the liberal arts in the humanities. Chanito has already made new responses in his speech as to why some people can still attend these degrees
2709.52,2714.36, but even if some don't it is okay because you get higher paying jobs and that's better for your
2714.36,2720.06, quality of life. Note that what universities do now is that they mislead poorer students to believe
2720.06,2724.64, that they will be the ones who succeed within the liberal arts even though the employability
2724.64,2729.68, within these fields is low. Look I recognize that your passions are important but your ability to
2729.68,2734.24, put food on the table is more important because there's a tangible harm that arises from it
2734.24,2742.0, for all these reasons proposed i thank the speaker for that fine speech and now who i thought
2742.0,2745.92," the substantive case as a whole, I invite the Honourable Opposition"
2745.92,2749.88," Whip, here, here."
2749.88,2761.16," Yeah, again, restating that I prefer verbal POIs and my pronouns are she, her."
2761.16,2769.0," With that, I'll start the speech in 3, 2, 1, from the very end to until the very end of this debate."
2769.0,2775.0," The proposition has had no real engagement with their worst case scenario, let alone their realistic case that we gave them."
2775.0,2779.0, We gave them 2 clear burdens for them to defend from the very beginning.
2779.0,2789.86," That front one. They must justify fueling colleges profit-based incentives in terms of prioritizing accepting students who they think will be able to earn the most. And two, they must justify colleges not being"
2789.86,2793.58, able to make the most efficient use of their resources because they can't predict their
2793.58,2798.14, income as well as right now. They did not fulfill these burdens as they did not recognize one
2798.14,2803.36, crucial trade-off. They cannot have both the same quality of education and the sense of having
2803.36,2805.12, enough stable monetary resources
2805.12,2810.16, to invest as we do on our side and also say that the amount that graduates will end up paying will
2810.16,2815.28, not strain them but even if they bite one of the two bullets for the trade-off we still have two
2815.28,2820.56, round winning points that we say will be sacrificed on their side firstly opportunities for marginalized
2820.56,2829.84, students in general and secondly the quality of. Now moving on into our clashes. The first clash I have for you is the immediate impact on students and graduates. A few
2829.84,2834.16, points under this. The first thing the government prioritized heavily is that they're going to cut
2834.16,2838.18, down on student debt. They're going to enable students. And they said that people can apply
2838.18,2843.02," to better universities with better facilities. But why? If there are more prestigious universities,"
2843.02,2845.16, they're going to need more money to maintain their facilities.
2845.56,2848.22, They would request a greater proportion of income from their graduates.
2848.58,2856.64," If they don't, the government needs to defend all universities falling to the same level and losing out on the level of talent that these universities are able to hone for the good of society."
2856.96,2861.74," But then they talked about how in terms in times of economic shock, people can't afford uni and they're dropping out."
2861.8,2865.18," But on their side, they can. But the same analysis applies."
2865.52,2869.68," Even if they get the education and try to go into the job sector, economic shocks mean"
2869.68,2871.94, that jobs are scarce or low paying as well.
2872.44,2875.78, So they will either have to pay a greater proportion of their income or not be able
2875.78,2879.46," to get a job at all, meaning that colleges will again collapse, cutting off the ability"
2879.46,2881.3, for future generations to earn a livelihood.
2881.74,2889.68," But even if all of what they said is true, they can reduce student debt in the short term. The way off is losing opportunities to get an education at all. This"
2889.68,2893.5, is where we talk about marginalized students. We told you that these colleges will have less
2893.5,2897.56," incentive to take in marginalized students, and they support this argument themselves when they"
2897.56,2901.62," say, you change the incentives of universities so that they'll no longer focus on these other"
2901.62,2905.06," factors like prestige, but rather on the income that students will get."
2905.06,2907.0," So as profit oriented companies,"
2907.0,2908.82, if colleges think all you'll amount to
2908.82,2911.76," is a minimum wage job due to your lower class background,"
2911.76,2913.78, what's the point of accepting you
2913.78,2915.54, and then collecting a tiny amount of money
2915.54,2918.3, via the proportion of income every year after you graduate?
2918.3,2919.76, They wouldn't take in these students
2919.76,2921.48, because now the tuition they take in
2921.48,2922.92," will not be a set price,"
2922.92,2924.88," but rather a proportion of their income,"
2924.88,2928.98," which means that if they think their connections or background won't secure these students a well-paying job,"
2929.2,2932.94, they have much less of a profit incentive to accept these people in the first place.
2933.26,2937.08," Our counterfactual is that colleges will still take in marginalized students,"
2937.2,2939.72, even if these students can't pay all the tuition straight up.
2939.72,2941.8, These colleges will collect loans from them.
2942.06,2948.0," So especially given these situations, colleges take in these marginalized students because they know that they will get the full amount of tuition from them"
2948.0,2952.4, anyway so at least they have this like an equal chance of getting into college to begin with
2952.4,2956.64, the government then responded that this is fine poor students will be allocated into other jobs
2957.28,2961.44, or stem or connections don't matter and that connections are something you can make in college
2961.44,2968.34," this is again disregarding everything we said before and assuming that these students will automatically be accepted, they wouldn't accept you in the first"
2968.34,2972.36, place to make these connections because you didn't have them to begin with. The final thing the
2972.36,2976.06, government had to say was that merit is easy to achieve because you can get loans for college.
2976.26,2979.26," Again, sure, but how do you get loans for building up your merit so that you can"
2979.26,2984.06," get accepted into college in the first place, right? So what is the way off of this clash?"
2984.2,2990.12, We think we would rather have education and a better job and some student loans rather than not being able to
2990.12,2994.4," get into college in the first place, not having this opportunity in the first place. This argument"
2994.4,2998.38," is not about genius marginalized people, by the way, who are given scholarships to attend university"
2998.38,3002.76, because they have a high chance of success either way. This argument is about the average marginalized
3002.76,3007.94, student who works hard to go to college to get some kind of proficiency for a job that will raise them out of this marginalized
3007.94,3012.76, background. The government fundamentally gets rid of the singular important stepping stone for the
3012.76,3017.74, most important vulnerable stakeholders insofar as they remove any profit incentive for these
3017.74,3021.16," colleges to accept these kinds of students to begin with, which is why we win the debate from"
3021.16,3025.44," the first clash. Before I move on to the second class, I'll take a POI."
3029.88,3034.7," Aside from business connections, what other incentive does an employer have to prioritize giving a richer student with the same degree as a poorer student the job over that poorer student?"
3035.92,3041.44," That is literally the reason why they have this incentive, because they know that this is the"
3041.44,3045.04, only level of predictability they have in terms of how well off this graduate
3045.04,3049.44," will be, which directly correlates to their profit incentive because it directly correlates to how"
3049.44,3054.3," much money they can get from the proportion of their income. Second clash, the quality of education"
3054.3,3059.18, given in colleges. Let's talk about the government's third argument that colleges would focus more onto
3059.18,3064.38," lagging students, but why would they spend so many resources on these kinds of students? As profit"
3064.38,3087.6," oriented companies, universities would much rather spend that money to support the most talented or the richest students, even within the college itself, to ensure that they will reach even talented or rich students. The counterfactual in the status quo is that at least this kind of narrative"
3087.6,3092.04," doesn't set the precedent for what kinds of kids are outright prioritizing universities. So again,"
3092.16,3096.06, they lose in the fact that they do not prioritize the most vulnerable students. But then we also
3096.06,3101.82," told you that on their side, they don't have like a predictable set amount of money to use to invest"
3101.82,3108.8, in the school's education. So they cannot develop and grow in the long-term sense which means that these colleges might either force you to pay more in terms of
3108.8,3114.24, your proportional income or just deteriorate so especially if proposition says that all students
3114.24,3118.64, will save money in terms of income which is their entire case they are forced to concede that
3118.64,3122.48, universities will therefore have far less money in their world which means that schools will have
3122.48,3128.32," less resources to invest in their education but But even in the alternative, which is their model, they literally concede"
3128.32,3132.68," that certain students will pay much more than they should have originally. If it's a set percent,"
3132.84,3136.6," and if your income is super high, that means you will end up paying far more tuition than what the"
3136.6,3141.08," original cost was. So they either have to accept that their quality of education will decrease,"
3141.08,3146.3," or that even if it doesn't, the students will end up paying much more than their actual income is,"
3146.3,3148.4, which is also either a harm on their side
3148.4,3150.06, that they both need to take.
3150.06,3151.1," Then we also told you,"
3151.1,3153.9, how does the focus of university education change?
3153.9,3155.5, We told you that now they're going to focus
3155.5,3157.94, on what kind of employment will get them
3157.94,3160.22," the most amount of money for their graduates,"
3160.22,3161.88," because again, they're proper oriented"
3161.88,3163.92, and their graduates are literally directly
3163.92,3168.64," their source of income now, depending on what kind of job they get so the"
3168.64,3174.4, diversity of education would drastically decrease and only pay the jobs that make money like stem
3174.4,3178.64, the impacts is that you will lose the quality of education in general leading to generations
3178.64,3183.2, of less competent graduates who will get less high paying jobs due to the fact uh due to the
3183.2,3192.48," first point that we told you in this class, or two, students will lose critical thinking skills and important thoughts of morality and ethics that comes with studying the humanities and social sciences,"
3192.48,3209.48," and will lose the quality of education and school life that they deserve. So what is the weighing of this clash? On our side, at least we preserve the quality of education for most college students, and therefore quantifiably win in preserving the livelihoods of most individuals. So what is the conclusion overall of the entire debate? In the short term,"
3210.14,3214.46, the government further marginalizes the already marginalized students by changing the incentives
3214.46,3218.74, of colleges in terms of which kinds of students they are more willing to admit. So they lose in
3218.74,3222.98, that they couldn't protect the most vulnerable stakeholders of this debate. But even if in the
3222.98,3228.88," short term they do reduce student debt, they still lose in the long term because of the short-term win and that because of this,"
3228.88,3232.9, they jeopardize the steady predictable income of universities and therefore their quality
3232.9,3237.4," of education, thereby jeopardizing the competence and livelihoods of generations to come. So at the"
3237.4,3241.48," end of the day, they lose in terms of scale and the number of individuals they jeopardize as well."
3241.48,3248.52," For all of these reasons, so proud to oppose."
3251.22,3255.24," I thank the speaker for that fine speech. And now to wrap up the case for the opposition side,"
3255.24,3257.8," I invite the Honorable Opposition Applied Speaker,"
3257.8,3258.64," here, here."
3263.44,3264.6," Can I be heard, Bole?"
3265.78,3266.68," Yes, you can."
3266.68,3267.62, Thank you.
3273.4,3279.32," At the end of this debate, I would encourage propositions to ask themselves, why do social movements exist?"
3279.88,3285.1, Why do minorities pry out time and time again that the world is unfair and that opportunities are unequal?
3285.64,3290.3, Why are there massive gaps in payment between minorities and white privileged people?
3290.78,3295.34, Is it because minorities are innately unsuccessful? Is it because they don't have enough merit?
3295.82,3309.34," Our claim on proposition was that the system designed on proposition is designed to be unfair for minorities, not because minorities were less likely to succeed in college, not because they were less smart or academically inclined, but because they were the"
3309.34,3314.32, side that hoped colleges would take a risk by taking in students from backgrounds designed to
3314.32,3319.52, cast their ankles when they tried to succeed. This was never a question of do minorities have the
3319.52,3327.06, opportunity or chance to succeed when they enter college. This was a question of are minorities likely to enter college in the first place?
3327.36,3331.88, Are colleges likely to take that risk of choosing the marginalized minority
3331.88,3335.4, when there's a long list of privileged students from perfect backgrounds
3335.4,3337.74," ready to enter those universities as well,"
3337.86,3341.04, with little to no risk from universities getting their returns?
3341.28,3343.92," On our side, which is quite obviously status quo,"
3344.32,3345.3, colleges can take these
3345.3,3349.56, individuals in because of things like the image of the university and stuff like that. This
3349.56,3354.34," fundamentally changes on our side. By passing the motion, they make the primary issue colleges"
3354.34,3358.8," consider the fact that like when students enter universities, college investing in these students,"
3358.8,3363.96, which incentivizes them to reduce any chance of not receiving profits as opposed to students
3363.96,3365.58, investing in the universities.
3365.82,3370.4," So really, they never engaged in their worst case scenario, which we told you is fairly realistic"
3370.4,3373.9, due to the incentives of these private universities where marginalized students
3373.9,3378.36, aren't given the opportunity to have this education in the first place. But proposition
3378.36,3383.3, acts like the only argument we had in the debate was marginalized students. This is not true.
3383.62,3385.18," The quality of education offered at schools affects all students, debate was marginalized students. This is not true. The quality of education offered"
3385.18,3389.88," at schools affects all students, not just marginalized students. We told you, one,"
3390.3,3394.58," proposition literally has less funding, conceded by their line by the fact that they did not respond"
3394.58,3399.8," because of the model they gave you. Even if you believe their model 100%, if it is true that"
3399.8,3404.22," they have a set percentage on their side, that means for students whose income is low, you don't"
3404.22,3408.54," get the full cost of tuition, meaning the colleges lose out. Two, that incentivizes"
3408.54,3412.38, schools to lengthen the period of collecting students' incomes. They need to tell me why
3412.38,3415.98, it's 10 years. I don't think that's likely to happen in their world. So that means to get the
3415.98,3419.64," most money off of these successful students, which disproportionately harms the students"
3419.64,3424.38," if they pay like two to three times the original amount of the cost of the university, which is"
3424.38,3428.88," our third argument, by the way, unresponded to. Three, what does it mean if colleges have less"
3428.88,3433.32," money? That means you have far worse facilities, less opportunities or resources or infrastructure"
3433.32,3437.38," for students, less investment into the school, all of which harms the entire student body,"
3437.62,3441.72," not just marginalized students, no response to that. Moreover, we told you that means you"
3441.72,3446.46, directly incentivize colleges to capitalize on practical academia like STEM courses.
3446.74,3451.3, So liberal arts colleges don't exist on their side. Humanities majors die out on their side of the house.
3451.5,3456.42, They needed to tell us why those things don't matter. They literally don't respond to over half of our case.
3456.42,3464.34," I think it's a bit too late in reply. The only implicit response you might be able to credit is something we get from their whip, which is that this is a this house prefers debate."
3464.54,3467.54, So that means the motion was implemented from the beginning of time. So the world might
3467.54,3471.74," have adjusted. First of all, this is a non-response. At best, they're telling us that these majors"
3471.74,3475.9," didn't exist to begin with. So it's fine. I have no idea why this response applies. But number two,"
3475.9,3482.02, you just don't have the quality of education and the educational opportunity we provide to you on
3482.02,3485.28, our side. I have no idea why this is not an argument they wanted to engage
3485.28,3489.52, with at the end of the debate we've sufficiently proved down the line down the line why we are the
3489.52,3493.68, side that helps minority students why if you increase the quality of education for all students
3493.68,3497.52, that is something that helps the entirety of the student body and ultimately why universities are
3497.52,3506.5, better on our side of the house we're very happy to oppose i thank the speaker for that fine speech.
3506.5,3510.88," And now to wrap the debate up as a whole, I invite the Honourable Proposition Reply Speaker,"
3510.88,3511.88, Hirhir.
3511.88,3512.88," Yes, cool."
3512.88,3513.88, Can I be heard?
3513.88,3514.88," Yes, yes, you can."
3514.88,3515.88, Great.
3515.88,3529.62," At the top of this reply, I want to make here a strategic flaw in the opposition's case,"
3529.62,3532.7, which is a lack of evolution in response.
3532.7,3536.86, The responses we got to our argumentation in Op 3 and Op reply were the same responses
3536.86,3539.56, that we got in Op 1 that Chanidu and Pumet dealt with.
3539.56,3543.32, And I'll get into this through the clashes and point out exactly what this means for
3543.32,3548.64, our chances of being dis-debating those clashes in terms of my is in terms of minorities
3548.64,3553.6, and the poor i want to flag here the lack of counterfactual in terms of the proposition
3553.6,3558.56, because it is all well and good to say our side is unfair but if they do not prove why their side is
3558.56,3563.68, more fair they cannot hope to win this debate i can concede that both sides in this debate are
3563.68,3565.46, likely to be unfair to minorities
3565.46,3570.78, to some degree because the world isn't fair to minorities. Our analysis proved why our side was
3570.78,3576.8, comparatively more fair and the reasoning here was that maybe your access to things like merit is
3576.8,3582.42, hard and it is hard for minorities to get it but it is much harder for minorities to access money
3582.42,3585.64, which is the prerequisite to be able to access a university
3585.64,3590.32, at all. And this is where Pumet and Chanigoo's analysis on the barriers to access come into play.
3590.62,3595.22," In terms of financial capacity, our side is better because it is only our side that gives you a"
3595.22,3601.54," guaranteed means of pay, as well as the fact that opposition concedes that employers are already"
3601.54,3606.98," profit motivated, which is a reason as to why they're likely to overlook things like your race,"
3606.98,3608.38, because they want to make sure
3608.38,3611.16, that they get the best people employed as possible.
3611.16,3613.24," Therefore, we think it is more likely"
3613.24,3616.36, that universities would also overcome their racial biases.
3616.36,3619.38," But even if that is not true, here's the tie breaker."
3619.38,3620.78, We proved through our analysis
3620.78,3622.3," that on our side of the house,"
3622.3,3624.98," these people, minorities, have a better chance"
3624.98,3625.28, of being
3625.28,3629.92, able to display their merit because the money they would have otherwise saved towards going to
3629.92,3635.6, college is now reinvested into us the ability to make up that money you don't have to work an extra
3635.6,3640.0, job to save money for college you can spend that time studying and spend that money if you do earn
3640.0,3645.84, it on sat tuition what this proves then is in terms of comparative our side is better because
3645.84,3650.54, on our side when you have no debt you have a guarantee of being able to pay it even if it's
3650.54,3654.48, a larger amount of money down the line the guarantee is what's important and the fact that
3654.48,3658.84, you are not saddled with debt for the rest of your life is important. It is on our side of the house
3658.84,3662.3, that we provide security because people don't have to drop out to go to college. They aren't
3662.3,3669.92, deterred from going in the first place. We reduce cyclical poverty and this is why we are better to access university at all on our
3669.92,3675.2, side of the house so maybe it is true that people aren't able to get the best quality of university
3675.2,3680.48, but the biggest barrier to any university at all is money and we think that even if quality is
3680.48,3685.1," lower we get more people education on our side of the house, which is a unique good."
3685.52,3689.5, But second flash then is on opportunities within universities. And this is where our response
3689.5,3695.06," clearly didn't get a response back, which is where we said that universities, because this is the"
3695.06,3700.28," disenfranchised motion, are unlikely to cut this out of the quality of education. Because if you"
3700.28,3704.7," provide a lower quality of education, people are just going to go to your competitors. Rather,"
3704.82,3709.68, they're going to cut it out of frivolous things in status quo that they spent a large amount on
3709.68,3714.64, statues selling money for things like alumni funds making the university look pretty all of which are
3714.64,3719.28, things that they cut out on our side of the house in order to meet those costs but even if it is
3719.28,3724.08, true that you reduce the quality we're fine with that because we give more people access to an
3724.08,3729.04, opportunity at all so even if you don't have access to the best quality of college you have access to some quality
3729.04,3733.12, of college that means you're able to get a slightly higher paying job put food on the table
3733.12,3737.6, for your kids and have a higher quality of life the last question is debated is in terms of
3737.6,3742.24, academic culture and this is where they don't respond back to our response regarding the liberal
3742.24,3745.04, arts but we told you that even if it is true that
3745.04,3750.0, the liberal arts goes away we are fine with that in a lot of instances because the status quo is
3750.0,3754.88, one where the liberal arts misleads and causes the poorest of people forces them into a situation
3754.88,3759.52, that is absolutely unfair to force them into but even if that wasn't true the tie break here is in
3759.52,3769.52, terms of the incentive we create to do things like provide post-graduation services as well as chanagu's third argument that proved things to the similar effect that did not get a response
3769.52,3774.64, so even if it is true that you have to cut down on some costs it is unlikely you will do so by
3774.64,3779.12, cutting these out entirely you might just teach more employable aspects of it but even if it is
3779.12,3787.2," cut out entirely that's something we are fine for. For all of these reasons, proposition wins this debate."
3791.84,3795.12, I thank the speaker for that fine speech. Thank everyone for an excellent debate. I encourage all of you to cross the floor virtually shake hands.
