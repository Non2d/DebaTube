0.0,9.2," All right. Okay, so the recording is ongoing. Hello, everyone. Welcome to this sixth round"
9.2,16.16, of WSTC. Congrats for making it this far. My name is Sabina. I will be the chair of this round. I'm
16.16,28.52," from Romania. I prefer she, her pronouns, but please do address us as a panel together with me judging I have Rock, Shruti and Sena and I wish you all good"
28.52,36.5, luck I will try to be I see that we do have a volunteer Chen who will help us with the
36.5,46.48," time so we will have time signals in the chat for your preferred POIs, please let us know before the speech and during your"
46.48,53.58," introductions. I see that Team Latvia has already announced their speaking order in the chat, so if"
53.58,59.72," Team Mongolia could do the same, it would be wonderful. So we have Team Mongolia on prop,"
60.08,67.8," Team Latvia on op, and if my panelists would like to to say hi I warmly invite them to do so now"
69.3,73.98, hello my name is Rock Sabina already set good luck
82.32,85.88, good luck for the round.
91.64,93.12," Shruti, we only heard the last part, so if you could say... Oh, I'm so sorry. Is this better?"
93.98,97.76," Hi, everyone. I'm Shruti. My pronouns are she or her. Good luck for the round."
101.06,105.0," Hi, I'm Sinha. Good luck for the round."
105.0,115.0," Wonderful. So this is the moment to ask questions, clarifications, or to start the debate if there are none."
115.0,121.0," So the silence, I think, means that there are no clarifications needed."
121.0,125.84, So I invite the first speaker of team proposition to take the floor here here
140.24,149.28," all right um i'd like my pois verbally audibly, and I will start my speech in three, two, one."
150.1,154.56, Pessimistic political action is the main enemy to the progression of a society.
155.3,159.9," Panel, I'm the first speaker of side proposition in two points of setup before I move on to my constructive."
160.34,171.24," Firstly, on our characterization of political fiction. A, on positive and optimistic political fiction, we define this as works that communicate hopeful messages to readers"
171.24,176.68," and refrain from overly antagonizing one political ideology, but instead remains open to criticism."
177.6,180.92, And they would often have happy endings.
181.02,191.92," For example, this would look like Fahrenheit 451 or video games like Disco Elysium. B on negative and pessimistic political fictions we define this as fiction that incites"
191.92,198.08, fear and generally antagonizes one ideology and usually almost almost always have bad endings
198.08,204.32, this looks like 1984 or Animal Farm and Brave New World etc. Secondly on characterization of who
204.32,205.72, reads these works and why
205.72,211.92, this is important and to what extent are they influenced by them. So the most important
211.92,216.98, stakeholder in this debate would be the youth. Typically the youth are exposed to political
216.98,221.84, fiction as a part of their education curriculum and we believe many young adults are prone to
221.84,225.0," consuming political fiction prior to engaging in real life politics,"
225.0,234.0," which politics, whichever kind of political fiction is consumed more becomes prevalent in people's minds and prejudices surrounding political"
234.0,245.92, ideologies in the way they're portrayed are likely to become internalized by by the time these children or young adults start forming their own political opinions and participating in these kind of
247.28,254.16, things okay i'll take that isn't surveillance and overt authoritarianism just simply bad and we
254.16,265.0, should demonize the motion clearly states that we're um decreasing we prefer positive political fiction
265.88,269.42," over the negative ones that like you mentioned,"
269.42,273.24," like with a theme surrounding authoritarianism, et cetera,"
273.24,275.26, we're not exactly demonizing them.
275.26,278.56," So moving on, thirdly, the critical question in this debate"
278.56,281.18, is whether positive and optimistic political fiction
281.18,284.2, motivates people and incentivizes them to act.
284.2,288.0," And the moment we answer this question is the moment we win. We bring you two arguments in this case, we have a question about the political fiction. How does this pessimistic political fiction motivates people and incentivizes them to act?"
288.0,291.0, And the moment we answer this question is the moment we win.
291.0,298.0," We bring you 2 arguments in this debate today, firstly on positive political fiction, normalizing all political ideologies."
298.0,306.56," Secondly, on in on how in how it invigorates in individuals role in society. fiction normalizes all ideologies. So basically, people have become prone to defining themselves"
306.56,308.94," through the political ideology that they believe in,"
308.94,311.68, and people become characterized by their preferred ideology
311.68,313.74, instead of their individual qualities.
313.74,315.54," For example, if you're a conservative,"
315.54,317.74, you're seen as a gun-loving maniac.
317.74,320.38," If you are a liberal, you're seen as a baby murderer."
320.38,323.4, So the problem has become widespread to the degree
323.4,330.38," that 44% of Americans would not marry somebody with an opposing ideology, opposing political opinion than you."
330.52,333.78, So what does positive political fiction achieve here?
334.2,338.38," Firstly, positive political fiction affirms people that their ideologies are acceptable."
338.7,344.92," For example, Roadside Picnic covers aspects of an ideal pure democracy contrasted with autocratic values."
344.92,345.68, At the end
345.68,351.82, happiness is brought to everyone and the overall message of these political books are never about
351.82,356.64, whether a political opinion should be right or wrong it's more so about individuals in the main
356.64,364.28, characters deriving happiness in whatever form they can they can like uh like whatever they
364.28,367.44, believe in believe in so secondly on positive
367.44,372.08, political fiction like being likely to create respect among different groups so political
372.08,376.56, fiction teaches that everything is good people are more likely to accept the criticism from such
376.56,383.04, works if their belief is simultaneously affirmed so would a kid so would a kid be open to acknowledge
383.04,394.0, their mistakes if they're told they're trash or if they're told that they're fine and and it's okay to make mistakes right so people not by having this people are not only willing to acknowledge the
394.0,405.52," mistakes of their political ideology and the harms they have potentially but also notice the positives of other groups wearing their, falls short so the impact here is firstly there's more"
406.72,411.6, no thank you since positive political fiction normalizes all beliefs people are inclined to
411.6,416.48, talk to each other for the best of all worlds and they're unlikely to remain in its shell so
417.52,422.56, so weighing here a thousand people taught that every form of governance is fine versus a thousand
422.56,426.56," people taught that everything but their preferred form of governance is terrible,"
426.56,428.72, which would have healthier discourse
428.72,429.84, and a homogenous society.
429.84,432.26, So we would definitely prefer the thousand people
432.26,436.36," who grew up on like positive political fiction, right?"
436.36,439.54," So secondly, we believe this leads to self-love."
439.54,441.14, We say that positive political fiction
441.14,443.62, highlights positive human qualities versus-
443.62,444.56, What information?
444.56,445.2," Oh, thank you."
445.2,448.4, Constantly criticizing only a person's political ideology.
448.4,452.5," Now people are more willing to notice their best size and focus on it more,"
452.5,458.2," leading to people being less sad, less bullying based on political alignment or ideologies."
458.2,463.4," So moving on to my second argument, how it invigorates on individuals' role in the system."
463.4,467.08, The premise here is that any country with any political ideologies based on the people's
467.08,473.06," willingness to work towards achieving the best version of it right, so we believe pessimistic"
473.06,477.92, political fiction sends the message of hopelessness like brave new world's whole plot revolved
477.92,482.76," around banishing political dissenters right, so the pot, we believe the power of the system"
482.76,486.0, takes precedence over the willpower of individual information. Thank you.
486.0,493.0," This creates two issues. Firstly, apathetic individuals who do not care to find solutions to problems in their society."
493.0,499.0," So if conditioned to believe that resistance is futile through these books that side opposition would support,"
499.0,505.74," this would never be. These people would never take action to resist in the first place. Secondly, people are unlikely to call out problems"
505.74,508.34," within a government, leading them to believe"
508.34,511.02," that regardless of adopted political ideology,"
511.02,513.08, governments will always fail.
513.08,515.76," So positive political fiction gives people,"
515.76,518.72," firstly, the end of the tunnel by sending message"
518.72,520.32, of you can fight the system.
520.32,522.86," Secondly, we believe this encourages people"
522.86,524.84, that we can battle the injustice
524.84,527.32, or the flaws in our society and actually win.
527.58,529.48, I'll actually take that point before I move on.
531.14,551.0," Given that we don't live in the world of Brave New World, is it more or less likely that there is still some hope left and that pointing out these issues is important, but giving hope to kids who to the majority of the people audience, we consuming this media is giving hope to them is important."
551.0,567.12," And we're actually still keeping the, the, the pessimistic political fictions in this in the status quo so um it it works anyway so for example like america's decided"
567.12,573.04, to revolt and fight for their independence because they thought they're they they deserve better they
573.04,578.16, believe that they can do it and like here we believe people are more incentive incentivized
578.16,584.0, to act in desire of a better situation because for example in in the book 1984 winston the main
584.0,592.0, character decided to work against the government because he thought he can achieve a better world where he can be himself and not be under control of an autocratic regime.
592.0,597.0," But the problem here is at the end of 1984, his hope had no meaning."
597.0,605.0," This is why we reject the majority of political fictions being pessimistic, because we want hope in our children."
605.22,607.5," And we uniquely on our side,"
607.5,609.78, we have individuals as an impact.
609.78,612.1, We have individuals who fight against injustice
612.1,613.28, to create a better society.
613.28,615.32, We get people who do not get knocked down
615.32,618.42, by harsh reality realities and never get up
618.42,620.7, as opposed to side Latvia.
620.7,622.9, So I'm so proud to propose.
626.64,630.4," I thank the speaker for the fine speech and if my panel is ready,"
630.4,633.76," I give the floor to the first speaker of the opposition, Hirhir."
635.92,646.0," Mama, nama mong kai ga do. Okay. Hi. I'm going to turn it over to the"
646.0,648.0, next speaker.
648.0,650.0, Thank you.
650.0,652.0, Thank you.
652.0,654.0, Thank you.
654.0,656.0, Thank you.
656.0,658.0, Thank you.
658.0,660.0, Thank you.
660.0,662.0, Thank you.
662.0,664.0, Thank you.
664.0,672.0," Thank you. Thank you. Okay, hi, I'm just attack that I'm audible invisible."
672.0,686.22," Program. Okay, great. Yeah. she, her, and POIs, preferably in the chat. So just write POI and I'll take you when I can."
687.76,694.74," Starting in three, two, one."
695.26,699.92, A utopian fiction which preaches an ideal depiction of the world
699.92,703.08, at times when the reality is anything but that.
703.36,704.48," Panel, that's not beneficial."
704.84,705.74, That is dangerous.
706.12,711.14," Before I move on to a few points of rebuttal, I'll have like the framing that we hold in this debate."
711.7,716.0," So we think firstly, right, the role of political fiction in society, which wasn't pointed out by"
716.0,720.88," proposition, it's important, not in the way that you immediately go and vote by based off of like"
720.88,729.42," what you've read, but rather that you're able to draw parallels and that these books offer you like a key insight on the problems facing our world today, right? So you're able to"
729.42,734.58," identify key issues and then like vote to change them or like start action to change them, right?"
734.6,738.96, It gives you motivation to actually tackle these things and points out the problem in the first
738.96,744.46," place, right? Also note that most people read like these books so that they can understand and they"
744.46,745.4, can know more
745.4,749.64, right it's generally educational material now a few points of rebuttal firstly on their framing
749.64,754.1, right we think it's like unclear why we can't have good endings technically like it's about like
754.1,758.66, maybe the pest the book is pessimistic in its nature but it can end well that's not like exclusive
758.66,763.02, to their side right it's also like unclear why like for us we would have to have a prevalent
763.02,765.42," political ideology but they cannot I think that this is, we would have to have a prevalent political ideology, but they cannot."
765.42,766.7, I think that this is pretty...
766.7,769.48, Both teams can have a prevalent ideology in their books.
769.48,771.5, Both teams can also not have that.
771.5,774.5," And furthermore, it's also not just the youth that read these books."
774.5,777.12, I think it's generally anyone who wants to educate themselves.
777.12,779.96," Sure, okay, youth read this in their curriculums, et cetera."
779.96,783.04, I think a fair bit of adults also read it as well.
783.04,785.2, And then quickly two areas of rebuttal.
785.2,786.9," Firstly, they talk about like acceptance,"
786.9,789.24," oh, about like normalizing other political ideologies."
789.24,791.5," And secondly about like, oh, respecting more people."
791.5,793.34," And I think that this is based off of, I guess,"
793.34,795.84, like buying into other people's political ideology.
795.84,797.56," You read about it and you think, oh, this is not,"
797.56,799.12," you know, this is a pretty good thing, right?"
799.12,800.32, I think I have like two responses.
800.32,803.28," Firstly, you can probably buy into bad ideologies as well."
803.28,804.54, It's probably also harmful.
804.54,806.84," I don't want people reading like a utilitarian,"
806.84,809.7, I don't want people reading a book about like an ethno state
809.7,812.24, about like a perfect world in which there's only one race.
812.24,813.78, And I don't want people buying into that.
813.78,816.32," And secondly, it's not clear why this like acceptance thing"
816.32,818.02," is not like as exclusive, right?"
818.02,820.28," We can have on our side, how people read"
820.28,822.36, about like dystopian books about their own political
822.36,824.86, ideology and change those ideas based on that.
824.86,828.7, Second area of rebuttal then about hopelessness. I think this is like the better line of analysis
828.7,832.66," coming from them. They tell you like, oh, you know, people read this and they lose hope. I have"
832.66,836.88," two responses to this. Firstly, it's like, as called, as told you in that POI, which we didn't"
836.88,841.16," get a response to, people don't live in the state right now, right? They can see, like they can do"
841.16,849.84, things to change that in democratic societies. So that like motivates them. It's not like they can do things to change that in democratic societies so that like motivates them it's not like they live in like the dystopia right and secondly they tell you it's bad like you call
849.84,853.34, out the government no matter what panel i think it's very good to call up governments when you
853.34,857.04, think that there are key issues that they are not addressing we're like happy to have that on our
857.04,861.5, side of the house then two arguments my speech firstly why a negative outlook is a stronger
861.5,865.62, motivator and secondly why fiction why fiction with a positive outlook
865.62,870.38, feeds into propaganda. First argument about why a negative outlook is a stronger motivator. So the
870.38,874.58," question here is what motivates people more to take action, right? Proposition cannot just get"
874.58,878.76, away with proving supposedly that like people read their like positive outlook books and then take
878.76,882.86," action. This is the comparative or where they're more likely, they're more motivated to do so."
882.86,888.96, There are six points on why that happens on our side of the house i'll take your pois after this argument firstly it's because we buy into
888.96,893.68, people's shock and appall right if they are scared for their future if they feel like their children
893.68,898.16, might not grow up with the same like civil liberties that they do they're very scared right
898.16,902.64, that's pretty threatening it's a natural reaction to do anything to stop that from happening right
902.64,908.08, it's a quite selfish reaction but it's one that gets them to vote it's one that gets them to start action right secondly they are
908.08,912.8, more likely to recognize negative traits in their own government right because these government
912.8,917.36, because these books point out failures in the government or like more authoritarian governments
917.36,922.4, it's easier to notice like traits that your own government has that are also like paralleled with
922.4,926.9, like within these books right therefore you're able to more accurately attack
926.9,929.06, your own government and lobby for change within it.
929.06,932.28," And thirdly, once you are pretty complacent,"
932.28,934.0, because realistically this happens mostly
934.0,936.66, in Western countries where people have the free time
936.66,937.9," to read these books, right?"
937.9,940.3," These people are probably in a pretty comfortable situation,"
940.3,940.8, right?
940.8,943.7, And so it's more of a motivational factor
943.7,952.0," that some of these liberties and comforts might be taken away from them, right? So in a dystopia, they would be taken away from them, rather than have like more added on."
952.0,965.36," This is pretty important, right? Because in a utopia, you're saying, oh, you know, your life's going to be more comfortable. It's a better motivator for people who already live in comfortable situations to say rather, oh, in this dystopia this these comforts will be taken away this is literally"
965.36,971.44, like why politicians rely on fear-mongering because it's more impactful and um fourthly
971.44,975.6, right when you have this negative fiction it highlights problems that need to be solved right
975.6,980.4, it's a lot easier to think about specific problems and how to solve them rather than understanding
980.4,985.02," this like uh utopia right which doesn't really explain the steps to get there,"
985.06,988.72, right? It's just a lot easier to highlight the specific key issues within governments and the
988.72,994.56," status quo. And, and, and, and fifthly, right, utopias are often quite far fetched, right? For"
994.56,998.72," example, like living in painless societies where everyone feels a lot of happiness, compare that"
998.72,1002.66," to the dystopias we have on our side of the house, which is like, oh, big brother is watching. It's"
1002.66,1007.84, quite a realistic scenario. It's not something like something like oh everyone always feels happiness it's rather than the government is
1007.84,1012.8, always watching you which is like what we're moving closer to right and then um lastly you
1012.8,1017.28, can actually draw parallels with the real world you're able to see oh look at like the effects of
1017.28,1021.52, climate change our planet is literally burning up i read a book about what this will look like in
1021.52,1030.08, the next 50 years this like lets these people envision themselves in a more dramatic world than the one we live in today but one that is extended uh like
1030.08,1033.84, from the problems that we face today right so people can physically envision themselves in those
1033.84,1038.64, situations and they can draw parallels with the real world which motivates them much more to take
1038.64,1043.52, action and this is very important because this is like a stronger motivator that helps you invest
1043.52,1049.2, more in politics literally just based on your natural instinct you feel threatened you feel no i don't want to live
1049.2,1053.84, in that world right you're more likely to invest yourself more and and this helps because of the
1053.84,1057.52, drastic situation in our world we want people to invest themselves more before i move on to
1057.52,1066.94, the second argument i'll take that poi please note that both positive and negative or pessimistic political fiction are both
1066.94,1070.0, exposing all these all the government's showcomings.
1070.0,1075.82," However, on side of these positive fictions, the ending is where the character actually"
1075.82,1080.04, ends up overthrowing the government or actually ends up battling that.
1080.04,1082.8," This is what I talked about in my framing, like it's unclear why we can't have a positive"
1082.8,1083.8, ending.
1083.8,1087.2," But either way, in utopias, it's not usually that you like highlight the negative parts of that uh the"
1087.2,1090.64, government because that like that would buy into people's negative emotions and at that point they
1090.64,1094.32, are like stepping over the sides of the house second argument about why fiction with positive
1094.32,1099.04, outlook feeds into more propaganda so this is like buying that they actually have efficacy right i
1099.04,1102.64, told you in our first argument where we're more likely to have effects right i don't think they
1102.64,1105.22, are but if they are why is it more harmful?
1106.76,1107.98, So the thesis of this is that politicians genuinely have an incentive
1107.98,1109.82, to latch onto propositions fiction
1109.82,1112.28, because it has a very rosy and nice outcome
1112.28,1113.18, and they need votes.
1113.4,1113.92, Three points here.
1114.1,1115.78," Firstly, it's because it idealizes"
1115.78,1117.94," like a certain ideology as all do, right?"
1117.94,1120.36, But it's easier for them like politicians or parties
1120.36,1122.68," to, for example, like pay off authors"
1122.68,1124.8," to release some sort of book in which like,"
1124.96,1129.6," I don't know, the Republican neoliberal agenda like plummets into this like eco-state,"
1129.6,1133.68," ethno-state, which is like perfect and rosy and no one has any like problems because they're all"
1133.68,1137.68," white and perfect and something like that, right? It's like highly likely it's like it helps people,"
1138.4,1143.2," these politicians, to like further these like very harmful narratives. Secondly, it's just a"
1143.2,1148.96," lot easier to exploit because it like tends to people's cognitive wants. People want a good world, right? People want a"
1148.96,1154.24," rosy world where there is no problem, right? I.e. it's like easier for like authors and like"
1154.24,1158.4, politicians to like present this perfect alternative and not present the mechanisms
1158.4,1162.56, that are needed to get there. So it helps like further the narratives of different populists
1162.56,1169.44, who have no real like actual answers to get to these uh these perfect worlds right and lastly this is very important it often uh
1170.0,1174.64, like furthers the narrative that the ends justify the means because you see this perfect utopia
1174.64,1178.72, right for example the us wanting to like supposedly secure all of their people like
1178.72,1182.64, these liberties but you don't see the mechanisms on which they get there right you don't see the
1182.64,1187.16," fact that the us is also exploiting developing nations to get the money to do that, right? This is all hidden"
1187.16,1191.08," with this like narrative of, oh, we're living in a utopia. So panel, if proposition has"
1191.08,1195.12," any efficacy, it doesn't even play in their favor because letting people fall for a fairy"
1195.12,1201.1, tale and the urgency of the real world only brings false hope.
1201.1,1204.82," I thank the speaker for the fine speech. And if everyone is ready, I give the floor to"
1204.82,1228.56, the second speaker of the proposition. And I hope I'm visible.
1229.44,1230.72, Spreading real quick.
1235.76,1237.54," And double check he, him pronouns. I like my verbal POIs."
1238.0,1253.5, And names in the thing. I guess I'll start my speech.
1253.5,1261.5," Negative political fiction often promotes this world where everything is bad, where"
1261.5,1265.76, all these political systems are created to oppress the population and the population
1265.76,1271.52, itself is docile and and can't think of ever rising up or can't have anything to go against it
1271.52,1276.48, however when we have all this negative fiction all of this majority negative fiction telling us
1277.84,1286.24, all this about these political systems what ends up happening is we turn our readers into the very people inside these books all we do now
1287.52,1294.64, firstly to a few balls on side opposition speech their first argument has been all about how
1294.64,1299.84, we have these how political fiction is created to draw parallels between the fictional government
1299.84,1305.04, and the real government and identify key issues however we do not see how that positive does not
1305.04,1311.12, actually exist on our side of the house we we have these we instead of power instead of drawing
1311.12,1316.96, parallels to a bad system we can draw parallels to a good system and what we have what we don't have
1316.96,1322.24, yet or what problems we have and we can fix to actually get there side opposition only has this
1322.8,1326.62, terrible idea it's like when your mom tells you
1326.62,1327.76," to look at that drunk person and say,"
1327.76,1330.9, don't drink because that's what you'll end up as.
1330.9,1332.6, You don't actively see what you can do
1332.6,1333.44, to make yourself better.
1333.44,1336.24, You don't actually see what solutions you have.
1336.24,1339.4, You can only identify problems without actively giving us
1339.4,1343.6," any guidance on what to do, on what we should do further."
1343.6,1345.88," In addition, their entire framing of this debate on how they can have good ending to do, on what we should do further. In addition, their entire framing of this debate"
1345.88,1347.66," on how they can have good endings too,"
1347.66,1351.08, and that how fiction instead has to be on utopias
1351.08,1353.16," versus dystopias, we simply disagree."
1353.16,1356.52," First of all, the motion itself gives examples"
1356.52,1358.82," such as West Wing and Fahrenheit 451,"
1358.82,1360.64, where there are actively dystopias
1360.64,1363.8, and are actively showing these negative parts of society.
1363.8,1366.02," However, the delta between Fahrenheit 451"
1366.02,1368.16, and works like Brave New World in 1984
1368.16,1370.42, is exactly the ending where these systems
1370.42,1373.12, are actively toppled and we create a better system
1373.12,1375.34, where we can actually have this goalpost
1375.34,1377.36, be put into people's minds.
1377.36,1378.9," This is the delta here in this debate,"
1378.9,1381.32, whether we have a goalpost to move towards
1381.32,1383.94, or a bad example to move away from.
1383.94,1385.44, We believe that the goal post is better
1386.56,1393.44, now second of all on the idea of which side is has a better creates better activism in our
1393.44,1398.64, society now site opposition likes to think that they have the more efficient method but by having
1398.64,1404.08, these problems and by having this shock factor we can push people towards actively doing things
1404.08,1406.08, however this is simply not true i
1406.08,1412.48, will go over it more on my third argument but to address it very quickly the efficacy of the of
1412.48,1418.4, these negative nihilistic political fiction is that what it actually does is it shows problems
1418.4,1428.0, and it doesn't and all it does is promote people and pushes them against these problems. It doesn't actually show people what they can do against them.
1428.0,1434.0," Second of all, they actually do create this kind of slack."
1434.0,1438.0," It doesn't work when you see this problem, and you see it everywhere in your society."
1438.0,1443.0," You certainly think, wow, this is such a bad problem, and then I can't do anything to solve it, because in the book there was no way to solve it."
1443.0,1447.84, So how should a person like me ever be able to solve it it creates this negative mentality where you can't
1447.84,1455.84, change anything unless it's not very efficient at all now moving on to my third argument but before
1455.84,1463.12, I move on any pois yeah Fahrenheit 451 and westling also don't like show you how to fix society and
1463.12,1469.36, probably no author can really do that right so it's not actually up to the book to show you ways to solve society but actually to
1469.36,1476.48, like empower you and to like make you want to do that we completely agree and that's why we believe
1476.48,1482.08, that our side is better because instead because even if they don't have this kind of idea or exact
1482.08,1486.24," solutions they do show you what kind of future to strive towards,"
1486.24,1488.0," what kind of future to fight for,"
1488.0,1491.26, and actively push you to give you an incentive to get there
1491.26,1493.94," instead of just using a stick to show you,"
1493.94,1495.56," don't go that way, don't go that way."
1495.56,1497.48, It's better to use the carrot than the stick
1497.48,1500.24, is basically what we believe in this debate.
1500.24,1502.2," Now, finally, moving on to my third argument,"
1502.2,1504.06, which is how nihilistic political fiction
1504.06,1505.94, promotes polarization.
1511.32,1511.68," In a world where the majority of political fiction has a cynical message about the world, it becomes the majority of political fiction consumed."
1516.94,1524.64," As a result, the entire generation of people now hold a negative perception of the current political system in our world. Our population is then whipped up into a frenzy according to whatever message is chosen to be demonized, whether it be communism, fascism, or capitalism."
1525.04,1530.16, Two layers of analysis as to how this polarization actually manifests first of all how this negative
1530.16,1534.8, political fiction becomes populist propaganda it incites fear in people against a certain
1534.8,1550.24," political ideology i.e animal farm as to how eugenics works. It only shows people how these problems arise,"
1550.24,1555.42," and thus it incentivizes politicians to take advantage of it and say, this is the kind of"
1555.42,1560.54, thing we need to stay away from. This is why you should believe in our points as to how we can get
1560.54,1565.36," away from that. Now, opposition has stated has stated that for example we could have that however"
1565.36,1570.24, we believe that we have less of this kind of political use because when you have a positive
1570.24,1575.92, message instead of dividing people along whether you agree with that issue or not it actually shows
1575.92,1581.36, what kind of idea our society should be striving towards our side is trying to unite people in
1581.36,1590.48, creating a better society rather than trying to divide people on issues or or even just demonizing people on which solution to these issues is better and thus we
1590.48,1596.8, believe that we have the better solution to propaganda on our side however on second argument
1596.8,1601.52, however secondly it actively fuels this establishmentarianism and supports the idea
1601.52,1615.0," that a society as a whole has failed because when you're drawing all these parallels between this dystopian society and our current society, you begin to feel more and more about the fact that our society is a dystopian society, and we can do nothing to fix it."
1615.0,1622.0," With a sheer mass of negative political material in circulation, people get to see politics as a whole as the problem."
1622.0,1625.86," People see politicians, and no matter matter what politicians will always be corrupt."
1625.86,1627.96, No policies will ever create any change.
1627.96,1632.04, And it promotes this entire mindset of actively thinking
1632.04,1634.56, that society is a problem and that we shouldn't actually
1634.56,1635.94, participate in society at all.
1635.94,1638.22," And societal movements such as goth, punk,"
1638.22,1640.92, or postmodernist cultures have become more and more prevalent
1640.92,1644.14, to the point that it's almost the norm to think
1644.14,1645.52, that society has failed and that
1645.52,1650.4, what we have as a political system isn't good enough and that we should just keep our heads
1650.4,1654.56, down and do the best we can for ourselves rather than like anything however instead what we should
1654.56,1670.0, be doing is have positive political fiction to create a goal post as i've seen many times actually to move towards instead of instead of having this kind.
1670.0,1678.0, What we want to do instead is to have this goalpost and when we have this goalpost to move towards and we have this common goal that we want to strive towards.
1678.0,1687.76," We can then analyze exactly what we have against that, and what we see as problems and thus we can actively decrease the amount of populism"
1687.76,1691.84, and this establishmentarianism matter we have and actually make our society better
1692.96,1700.48, and so in conclusion we believe that negative pop is fiction only only serves to create a
1700.48,1706.24, worse society and make sure that our society reflects that and actively makes people
1706.24,1709.28, less incentivized to actually do anything and that's why i'm so proud to propose thank you
1712.0,1716.64, i thank the speaker for the fine speech and if the panel is ready i give the floor to the
1716.64,1747.5, second speaker of team opposition here here Am I audible?
1750.94,1754.54," Okay, I'm just going to quickly set up my timer."
1755.84,1756.82, I'm going to start.
1760.82,1769.54," On PIs in the chat, please."
1772.94,1773.26," Starting in three, two, one."
1774.68,1776.02, Before I move on to my two questions by which to adjudicate this debate
1776.02,1777.54," and my extension quickly,"
1777.9,1779.2," two points on framing, right?"
1779.54,1781.96," Firstly, what I want to talk about here"
1781.96,1783.5," is that positive fiction does not,"
1783.5,1790.08, is that positive fiction is not only dystopian works with good
1790.08,1791.08, endings.
1791.08,1794.68," I think to some extent, team proposition in this debate has also had to talk about that"
1794.68,1799.12," in their world, the norm would be some utopian works that describe a world that is overly"
1799.12,1802.7, positive and engage with the mechanisms that we provided to you in this debate.
1802.7,1807.2, They can't simply say that they're going to have the same same kind of you know dystopian pessimistic work simply with good
1807.2,1811.04, endings i don't think that necessarily is the case but also secondly about the positive endings i
1811.04,1814.8, think that to some extent we can also have positive endings as long as the book kind of describes a
1814.8,1819.52, world that's just negative or dystopian but even if even if that isn't the case we see no reasons
1819.52,1824.16, like for example you couldn't have authors commentary there's how this is a cautionary tale
1824.16,1830.0, to prevent something and simply say like this is like this work is provided to you to basically like kind of
1830.0,1845.24," create action in society, even if there is a bad ending right we think that's that still exists under our side of the house. But then moving on to the first question on the question of positive versus negative reinforcement, what we are able to prove here is that we have two things that are exclusive under our side of the house."
1845.24,1848.58," Firstly, we have urgency and how we have negative reinforcement, right?"
1848.58,1851.94," That makes you feel like more immediately threatened, thus more immediately like you"
1851.94,1857.6," want to do something about the society and like to prevent it from, for example, descending"
1857.6,1860.24, into authoritarianism or like preventing government overreach.
1860.24,1864.4," How also secondly, it's more easier to draw parallels with the real world under our side"
1864.4,1868.0," of the house, for example, in terms of things like, you know, when you have extreme government"
1868.0,1871.76," surveillance in 1984, that kind of reflects how today we have tons of security cameras,"
1871.76,1875.76," to some extent is less under their side of the house, because they have like more like simply"
1875.76,1879.84, utopian works than dystopian works with like good endings that they wanted to talk about.
1879.84,1883.84," And how this clash is basically how this class to win this clash is incredibly important,"
1883.84,1886.9," because what this actually means is that under our side of house,"
1886.9,1894.94," there is more likely that we have more political action, right, that people actually prevent like the prevent the rise of authoritarianism or prevent government overreach."
1895.02,1898.82," If we can prove this right, this is an incredibly important question. So what are their responses here?"
1899.02,1903.9," What they firstly want to basically talk about is how, like, basically draw this like alternate benefit."
1904.28,1906.06, They basically said that they make political views
1906.06,1907.82," more acceptable on their side of the house,"
1907.82,1910.24," because when you paint them in a positive manner, right?"
1910.24,1911.88," People are more likely to,"
1911.88,1914.14," people are more likely to simply agree with them, right?"
1914.14,1915.92, And thus you reduce polarization.
1915.92,1918.24," Firstly, I think that in terms of positive fiction, right?"
1918.24,1920.92," And the utopian positive fiction of some other ideology,"
1920.92,1923.04, I think it is right for the opposite ideology
1923.04,1928.96," to simply take this work and use it as a cartoon, as laughing stock of the opposing ideology because you at the point at which you"
1928.96,1933.52, are already against that ideology you're likely to see it as an idealized version and simply say look
1933.52,1937.76, how ridiculous is and look how unattainable it is and i don't think that that necessarily reduces
1937.76,1942.08, polarization or makes it more like acceptable from people for the opposite ideology so i don't think
1942.08,1945.74," that necessarily reduces polarization but then secondly secondly, even if it does,"
1945.74,1950.28, we have no reason for people to actually reach
1950.28,1951.58, across the aisle because at the point
1951.58,1953.68, at which a large majority of positive fiction is
1953.68,1955.48," for example, like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrug,"
1955.48,1957.02, which is basically like neoliberal kind
1957.02,1958.58," of like free market propaganda,"
1958.58,1960.06, which would never work for the majority of people
1960.06,1961.94," because you actually need some like government regulation,"
1961.94,1964.4, which that book is specifically against.
1964.4,1968.68, There's no reason why we need to make more people feed into that kind of ideology.
1968.68,1971.92," We'd much rather like, you know, not have many people become some kind of like, I don't know,"
1972.06,1975.68," right wing utopians, which probably is against what most people want. So I don't think this kind"
1975.68,1981.02," of, I think this argument has a lot of mechanization to prove that it actually works or is even"
1981.02,1989.44, necessary. But what is that their second and probably better claim they said that this kind of that this kind of policy would lead to copelessness and there would be no reason
1989.44,1994.0, for people to fight because at the point in which our works provide sad endings right in which like
1994.0,1998.4, the characters basically don't achieve anything people won't want to fight against this kind of
1998.4,2002.48, you know government overreach for example or authoritarianism because they see that nothing
2002.48,2009.2, can be done i already talked about how basically you know you still can't have authors commentary which says this is a cautionary tale you can
2009.2,2013.44, actually do something even if the book has a bad ending i don't think that this exists in a vacuum
2013.44,2017.76, where the author doesn't say anything right but then also secondly we think that this is actually
2017.76,2022.32, better if the book provides a worse ending because realize that this is what simply our mechanisms
2022.32,2030.8," are about right because i just think that most people realize that we are not currently in 1984. It is so much, it is a so much more powerful"
2030.8,2035.44," message to say, if you let it go that far, if you allow the government to basically instill"
2035.44,2040.3," overall surveillance and let authoritarianism get that far, you can't get out of that hole."
2040.3,2049.68," That creates an even bigger sense of urgency and makes people think, I can't simply allow to get that far i have to do something i have to uphold current democratic freedoms that's much"
2049.68,2053.76, more inspiring to people because it makes them feel even more threatened and creates an even
2053.76,2058.08, better bigger like sense of urgency something that we talked about with that kind of mechanization
2058.08,2063.28, they only reinforce our arguments we're thinking about by that we already win this clash right but
2063.28,2068.0, also then thirdly they talked about how we don't show ways how to solve the problem.
2068.0,2074.0," Firstly, I think that an author, it is simply unlikely that an author can show in a book how to definitively fix the society."
2074.0,2083.0," I think we already talked about how these books specifically insist to inspire people to do something, we have actual scholars in the real world that actually provide solutions to this."
2083.0,2086.64," I don't think any single author is going to do that for you, right?"
2086.92,2087.76," But also then secondly,"
2089.14,2091.78, I don't think that necessarily they can say
2091.78,2093.1, that every solution that they have
2093.1,2094.8, on their side of the house is good
2094.8,2096.94," because at the point at which it is a utopian work,"
2096.98,2098.72, it can be for many different ideologies.
2098.96,2100.34, At the point at which is a utopian work
2100.34,2101.62," for like a right-wing ideology,"
2101.8,2103.04, that solution may not work.
2103.12,2104.22, There is no reason for them to say
2104.22,2107.44, that all of the solutions on their side of the house are going to be good i'm going to
2107.44,2111.52, talk about more in my extension under our side of the house is more likely that these solutions are
2112.4,2118.48, like um associated with much more uh overall better issues such as for example anti-authoritarianism
2118.48,2122.8, or anti you know government surveillance but then secondly on the question of propaganda
2122.8,2134.0," what did we talk about here first i said I said that politicians are more likely to latch on to this kind of utopian books because they can use them as propaganda and saying, oh, my ideology will get you here, right?"
2134.0,2149.84, So this is such a great ideology. And you basically distribute propaganda books in which this kind of positive ideologies put into and now secondly even if we assume that exists under our side of house with like with um like negative pessimistic books that has
2149.84,2154.0, additional trickle-down benefits because at that point you're more likely to like have you know
2154.0,2158.32, actually recognize some harms like government surveillance or authoritarianism that are likely
2158.32,2162.56, to trickle down even if we assume that politicians use these books and this is the reason why in
2162.56,2165.02, propaganda their side is comparatively worse.
2165.02,2167.08," What they say here and what their response is,"
2167.08,2172.08," is that like, because these books have less of a,"
2173.5,2176.12," you know, a positive message that,"
2177.2,2179.7," because these books have less of a positive message,"
2182.44,2188.66, because these books have less of a positive message.
2188.66,2191.24," Moving on to my extension, oh wait, it is more unlikely."
2191.24,2194.88," Oh wait, it is more likely that like political movements."
2194.88,2199.34," Okay, yeah, moving on to my extension, where it is more likely that we would have united"
2199.34,2201.78, political movements under our side of the house.
2201.78,2206.24," And this is an incredibly important class, because if we assume they have marginally more efficacy"
2206.24,2207.2," in terms of like, you know,"
2207.26,2208.7, these like positive reinforcement
2208.7,2209.62," being more inspiring,"
2209.78,2211.28, we get a more united reaction
2211.28,2212.9, because everybody disagrees
2212.9,2214.16, with what like the perfect solution
2214.16,2215.82," for world problems currently is, right?"
2215.86,2217.46, We think that people have many different
2217.46,2219.44, like views on how to solve the world right now
2219.44,2220.9," in terms of like positive outlook, right?"
2221.06,2223.42, Like people disagree on what the ultimate utopia
2223.42,2224.94, is that could be like a right-wing utopia
2224.94,2228.32, or a left-wing utopia. Because of of that comparatively under their side of the house
2228.32,2232.08, you get simply a less united response on how to improve the world under our side of the house
2232.08,2236.56, we already see that most like pessimistic works are dominated by anti-authoritarianism anti like
2236.56,2242.24, you know um like having simply more ideological diversity or having like less government overreach
2242.24,2246.06, which kind of creates a more united response because many different people subscribe to that.
2246.06,2247.26," We think that because of that,"
2247.26,2249.38," because hey, I have that more common mindset,"
2249.38,2251.08, the things that we do under our side of the house
2251.08,2252.22, and the policy that we implement
2252.22,2253.38, under our side of the house
2253.38,2255.34," is more likely to be simply more united,"
2255.34,2257.56, even if we assume that like positive reinforcement
2257.56,2258.56, is marginally better.
2258.56,2261.06, And that is because that is why we win this debate.
2264.98,2269.28, I thank the speaker for the fine speech and if everyone is ready I give the floor to the
2269.28,2288.86," proposition for the third speech. Hear hear. Hello, am I audible?"
2288.86,2294.0," My pronouns are she, her, and I prefer my POIs verbally."
2294.0,2300.88," All right, I'll start."
2300.88,2329.58," I'll start in three21 side proposition to a side opposition throughout this whole debate has constantly crossed the bench, saying that all our positive political fiction can only be about all these utopias, and it does not matter that we keep telling you that all these positive political fiction, what they actually look like according to the examples given by the info slide, they"
2329.58,2336.72," look like Fahrenheit 451 or West Wing or Stranger in a Strange World, what are actually dystopian"
2336.72,2340.16," novels, but have good endings."
2340.16,2350.42, The point of positive political fiction and what sets it apart from this pessimistic political fiction is that this pessimistic fiction gives you only the problems.
2350.42,2358.46," It looks like Brave New World or Animal Farm, where they only show you all the problems with this political agenda or with this world."
2358.94,2366.24, But the main character never gets to actually fight it off and actually win. The main character never
2366.24,2371.7," sees hope at the end of the tunnel, and at the end of the day, they always get oppressed by the"
2371.7,2376.2, system. That's what these pessimistic political agendas are supposed to look like. On our side
2376.2,2383.1," of the house, positive political agendas have characters who actually are successful in some"
2383.1,2386.0, ways to actually bring their dystopian governments to a better light. They are the characters who actually are successful in some ways to actually bring their dystopian
2386.0,2391.5, governments to a better light. They are the characters who actively strive to make the
2391.5,2396.14, status quo in their world better and actually succeed in some way or another. This can be
2396.14,2408.72," seen from Fahrenheit 451 or West Winger or A Stranger in a strange world. Now even if, okay fine, let's say that whatever side opposition has been saying"
2408.72,2416.8," we accept it. Even then, every mechanism that side opposition has thrown at us about all this"
2416.8,2426.94, pessimistic and dystopian world fiction scaring the public into taking action. We believe that this is far worse because
2426.94,2437.36," at this point, when side opposition confirms to us that the populist rhetoric,"
2438.3,2443.14, that these people are going to feel actual shock and appall at the dystopian things they see in
2443.14,2449.42," these pessimistic novels, we believe that the populist rhetoric will actually worsen, and politicians will be taking advantage of this,"
2449.62,2454.5," of these fears, and actually make, make it during, when they're running for elections, they'll"
2454.5,2460.38," actually, what they'll actually say is, have you read this novel, right? We've seen the parallel,"
2460.58,2465.4," and they'll actually do an analysis for you, maybe. And then they'll go, if you do not want"
2465.4,2470.6," such a terrible and shocking world, vote for me because I can make it better for you."
2471.54,2477.92, By using the people's fear of this absolute appalling dystopian novel with no hope at the
2477.92,2483.22," end of the tunnel, these politicians are going to end up using the public sphere and actually"
2483.22,2486.0, exploit the people's fears. This is the
2486.0,2494.88," world side opposition is advocating for. Now, they also, first of all, a few bits of rebuttals"
2494.88,2501.36," on the urgency and then the people deriving parallels from this. Now, firstly, the urgency"
2501.36,2515.0," exists on both sides of the house, because we've told you, these positive positive political fiction is actually showing you about all the terrible, terrible problems in the, in the parliament or in the societies."
2515.0,2525.36," So, whatever. So, when people actually read these positive fictions, they'll actually also get another, they'll also feel a sense of urgency that there"
2525.36,2529.72, is a real problem. And this is completely symmetrical on both sides. What isn't is the
2529.72,2535.94," people while reading pessimistic fictions will think, oh, this problem that exists in the status"
2535.94,2541.5, quo that I can also see from this parallel can never be fixed. And they'll constantly have this
2541.5,2549.22, despair and lack of hope in their lives where they think that whatever all the misdoings of the government and the shortcomings of their own political
2549.22,2550.72, agendas are just the way it is.
2550.72,2552.72, And there's no way to stop it.
2552.72,2554.68, There's no hope at the end of the tunnel.
2554.68,2557.24," Yes, before I move on."
2557.24,2562.0," Winston in 1984 only couldn't achieve his goal because he allowed it to get that far,"
2562.0,2563.0, right?
2563.0,2564.0, We're not currently at that spot.
2564.0,2565.82," Isn't it more likely that people would simply react, oh, we can't let to get that far, right? We're not currently at that spot. Isn't it more likely that people would simply react,"
2565.82,2567.84," oh, we can't let it get that far at the point"
2567.84,2570.94, at which we can't fix the government or do anything about it?
2572.34,2575.1," My point still stands because when people,"
2575.1,2577.38," okay, let's think about the authoritarian states"
2577.38,2580.92, opposition brought to the table themselves.
2580.92,2587.12," They tell us that in these negative political fiction, when they're talking about"
2587.12,2591.68," authoritarian states, they only show us like all the terrible things and that's supposed to be a"
2591.68,2596.16, shock factor for the Western people. What about the people in these authoritarian regimes? What
2596.16,2602.32, would these people think when they read these pessimistic political fiction? What they'll see
2602.32,2606.16, is that the regime they're currently stuck under is actually never
2606.16,2611.16, going to be able to be overthrown. What they'll see is not the shock because they live through
2611.16,2615.94, that shock every day. What they'll see is that there's no hope for them. This is the world
2615.94,2622.9," opposition wants. Now, moving on to our rebuttals. Firstly, is positive information,"
2623.44,2627.0," no thank you, the better way to motivate individuals?"
2627.0,2634.0," Let's do this. From our side of the house, we've told you that because our individuals can act,"
2634.0,2638.0," who are all these children grow up reading this positive political fiction,"
2638.0,2643.0," they can actually have hope for the future, that when they grow up,"
2643.0,2645.52, they'll see all the shortcomings in the
2645.52,2652.48, in their own information actually be changed and there is they can constantly strive for change
2653.04,2660.4, this is what side proposition is advocating for but as i've already as i've already uh stated
2660.4,2687.28," often in opposition's world all these people will only be completely hopeless or they're going or either they're going to be completely exploited by the politicians who are going to be using their fears against them. actually gives these people the courage and the hope that they can go against the system and win,"
2687.5,2692.36, this is the moment that side proposition should be winning this debate. But we have more information.
2692.9,2699.34," Oh, thank you. Which side has more polarization? So because what does populist rhetoric do?"
2699.34,2710.24," And what does these negative political fictions do? Negative political fiction only tells you about the problems in these political regimes. For example, in Animal Farm, you can see all the"
2710.24,2715.84," shortcomings of communism, but at the end of the day, at the end of the novel, nothing gets solved."
2715.84,2731.0," There is no hope for everyone who is oppressed under that regime. This kind of novels, this kind of narrative is constantly used by politicians to polarize the community."
2731.0,2734.0, This looks like US politicians antagonizing communists.
2734.0,2746.92," This looks to the point where people actually fear, have this actual fear instilled in them that communism is a completely bad thing, when in fact,"
2747.4,2752.22," taken under a different light, taken under a more moderate light, there are so many benefits to it,"
2752.22,2755.96," and no one actually sees it, because all they see is the terrible things from it."
2756.6,2762.18, Side proposition advocates for a world where the positive light actually shows us all the
2762.18,2776.0," shortcomings of these political ideologies, but they also tell us that all these, even though they have their own flaws, because nothing is perfect, right, they can actually be solved, but the individuals in these societies can"
2776.0,2785.6, strive for a change and actually better their political ideologies. This is the world's I proposition is advocating for. I am so proud to propose. Thank you.
2789.12,2793.52, I thank the speaker for the fine speech and I now give the floor to the third speaker of team
2793.52,2871.0," opposition, Hhear Hhear. All right. Hi, just a second. Okay. Okay. Firstly, am I audible and visible and everything?"
2871.0,2874.24, Great.
2874.24,2879.48, Starting in 321 panel.
2879.48,2888.52, Notice that most of their case basically rests upon this sort of base assumption of how the books end or how the books go.
2888.52,2898.6, Notice that neither side has probably read most or even like a significant proportion of like political literature that's specifically fictional.
2898.6,2908.5," Right. Notice that we're giving you far more mechanisms that support this, as opposed to simply asserting like the endings, the specific way the books go."
2908.5,2914.16," You have to judge this debate on the mechanisms, not on the specific characterizations, but I will deal with those as well."
2914.16,2918.78," So the three main clashes I have in my speech are firstly about the incentives to act,"
2918.78,2925.84," secondly, about the narratives that are pushed by books, and lastly lastly about the impact on the readers specifically."
2926.4,2932.32, So on to the first clash about the incentives to act. There's sort of key claim here that like
2932.32,2937.84, crystallize in their second speech is that there's a carrot on their side and a stick on our side.
2937.84,2946.14," Two main responses to this. Firstly about this very very key characterization for them, that basically our books give them hope."
2947.22,2952.82," And, and so, well, for them, yes, the proposition, propositions books basically give people hope and"
2952.82,2958.8," oppositions books basically put people down. Three responses to this. A, this is simply not exclusive."
2958.8,2966.24," You can have like, you know, a book demonizing authoritarian states. And in the end, like they managed to fix this state."
2966.24,2967.94, Like Fahrenheit 451 is
2967.94,2970.6, a disputable book on which side it lands.
2970.6,2973.98," But B, notice how we've responded to this every time."
2973.98,2976.8, And they haven't given us a further response here about
2976.8,2979.6, the fact that we don't live in that society currently.
2979.6,2983.04, So it's more of a warning call about what could happen in
2983.04,2985.12, the future as opposed to actually
2985.12,2991.76, being like okay here's what the future looks like now let's um you know like i'll give up because
2991.76,2998.08, there's no hope left in the world but see we dispute this premise like in its entirety right
2998.08,3002.96, because we think that like under the capitalist system people are pushed down constantly when they
3002.96,3005.02, have constant failures in their lives.
3005.02,3010.84," But they continue kicking, in this case, like Winston does in 1984, simply because they are"
3010.84,3015.3, humans and want to continue on their lives and want to continue to strive for things.
3015.78,3020.38," I mean, don't think necessarily that even having a bad ending, even if this is true that all of"
3020.38,3026.08," our books have bad endings, necessarily means that it demoralizes people to the point"
3026.08,3030.96," at which they don't act. They want to prevent this in the first place, but even if the system still"
3030.96,3036.48," exists, they kick against it, they fight against it in whatever way they can because they are human"
3036.48,3043.84," and they want a better world. So secondly though, the sort of the impetus to act here. What we've"
3043.84,3045.62, said from the start is that
3045.62,3048.3," when you draw parallels with only the good stuff,"
3048.3,3051.78," you settle into this comfortable state of sort of,"
3051.78,3054.84," you know, the warmer water where you relax"
3054.84,3056.88," because you can often find like,"
3056.88,3060.1, you can cherry pick the good stuff in the books.
3060.1,3061.64," Whereas on our side of the house,"
3061.64,3064.54, we have far more sort of shocking revelations
3064.54,3067.0," and things when you draw these parallels,"
3067.0,3075.12, as opposed to the specific things like that you draw from the book end up being positive towards the way the world exists right now.
3075.12,3085.12, We would far rather have this specific punch of the shock so that we can ultimately gain some sort of action on our side of the house so the stick
3085.12,3090.64, is simply better than the carrot because people sort of get accustomed to having carrots all the
3090.64,3095.92, time and don't want to take any specific action but then the second layer under this and the
3095.92,3101.52, nuance the team proposition didn't notice in our case is that we offer more realism we've said this
3101.52,3114.0," from first that basically like global warming is going to destroy the planet in the coming, you know, hundred years at the current rate at which we're heading, right? Authoritarian states are only becoming worse."
3114.0,3128.24," We think that these are very specific, like things that are pointed out in these books that we need for people to understand these issues, because, and they're also just a lot closer to what exists under society more."
3128.24,3131.14, So they're more likely to buy into these ideas
3131.14,3132.68," and take action on them,"
3132.68,3134.24," whereas on their side of the house,"
3134.24,3136.3, there's a lot of pipe dreams.
3136.3,3139.96," So thirdly then, under this clash,"
3139.96,3141.1, about this claim that they have
3141.1,3143.58, for a common goal to strive towards.
3143.58,3145.28," Two main responses here. Firstly, the whole idea of a common goal to strive towards. Two main responses here."
3145.28,3149.5," Firstly, the whole idea of a common goal doesn't exist."
3149.5,3152.5, My second speaker talked about this in his extension
3152.5,3153.94, and there wasn't a reply to this.
3153.94,3156.1, So basically there isn't just one book
3156.1,3158.12," pointing out a common goal, right?"
3158.12,3162.08, There's like a plethora of books on different ideologies
3162.08,3163.94, that each pull to their own direction.
3163.94,3166.64, So ultimately you don't arrive at the common goal.
3166.64,3168.92, You actually have a less connected message
3168.92,3171.24," because in general, like authoritarian,"
3171.24,3173.1," like books point out, you know,"
3173.1,3176.26," all the examples are about authoritarian states,"
3176.26,3179.52," about surveillance and about the suppression of free speech,"
3179.52,3181.26," as opposed to on their side, you know,"
3181.26,3184.28," you have the people idealizing like conservatism,"
3184.28,3185.44, you have the people idealizing communism conservatism you have the people idealizing
3185.44,3190.88, communism they all can't agree and there isn't like a singular punch from the literature but
3190.88,3195.52, then secondly we also think to just sort of we get the better movements on our side of the house
3196.16,3202.24, when we talk about specifically like our ideas that we strive towards are just simply like in
3202.24,3205.74," the vast majority of cases likely likely to be better ideas,"
3205.74,3208.72, because they talk about issues that we care about.
3208.72,3211.26," We've characterized this already about free speech,"
3211.26,3215.24, about freedom of movement of expression
3215.24,3216.92, and liberties that people have.
3216.92,3219.72," Before I move on to the second flash, I'll take that POI."
3230.0,3241.0," You're muted. Sorry, I cannot waste any more of my time. Sorry. Secondly, then, about the narratives that are pushed. Three main points on this. Firstly, about this idea that basically that fears ruin politics, right?"
3241.0,3245.04, That they basically said that politicians will exploit fears to push their
3245.04,3250.88, own narratives to things so firstly uh first response to this is basically so what are these
3250.88,3257.04, fears in the first place because this is important like um if it's if it's a fear of something
3257.04,3261.68, reasonable we would rather the public have this fear than not have this fear i think we've
3261.68,3265.12, characterized this enough uh about what these fears are like.
3265.12,3267.8, They're likely to be against authoritarianism
3267.8,3270.68," for more liberties and so on, especially"
3270.68,3272.48, in the Western world.
3272.48,3274.82," So secondly, the fears specifically"
3274.82,3279.26, motivate somebody to take action as opposed to setting out
3279.26,3281.9," this utopia, because often politicians exploit"
3281.9,3284.24," the utopias, as we described in our first,"
3284.24,3285.52, to basically claim that
3285.52,3291.28, like the current system we're working towards is this utopia and so we should just continue on this
3291.28,3295.28, path and basically make marginal improvements whereas on our side of the house we at least
3295.28,3300.96, have some sort of like impetus to specifically like do something about it get more political
3300.96,3305.28, action more political action is simply better they had a quick claim here about
3305.28,3310.16, authoritarian states thing is like authoritarian states if they don't read political fiction and
3310.16,3315.68, if they do it basically only glorifies the state that they're already in then third question about
3315.68,3322.4, the impact on readers they had like a small claim here about polarization right that people are
3322.4,3325.64, simplified down to the to the very core of
3325.64,3330.18," their idea when you only read like literature that fears them, right?"
3330.18,3335.44, But they needed to find like the actual delta that happens from their side of the house.
3335.44,3339.36," Because when you like read books of the opposing side,"
3339.36,3343.88," and it just idealizes that specific ideology or whatever,"
3343.88,3346.0, you think of those books as cartoons because you
3346.0,3351.4," have already like, you know, built up some sort of fundamental political beliefs. You won't suddenly"
3351.4,3357.12," flip to understand it more because it's built, it's written for the people who already buy into"
3357.12,3363.34," the idea in the first place. So as an outsider, it's very hard to suddenly gain some sort of buy-in"
3363.34,3370.0, from this book. So you're unlikely to actually change your opinion to another side by reading this idea.
3370.0,3378.0, You're far less likely than that to normalize that other side.
3378.0,3411.72," I thank the speaker for the fine speech and I now give the floor to team opposition for their reply. Okay, I have an audible and visible, start in just a second."
3411.72,3421.92," Okay, three, two, one. Panel, let's imagine this random guy. Let's call him like, okay,"
3421.92,3426.1," Winston, some sort of British surname, Winston Smith, okay? Winston kind of"
3426.1,3431.82," engages in politics, but he also kind of doesn't. He's really confused. He doesn't really know what's"
3431.82,3437.98," urgent, what really needs his attention. But then Winston starts reading more dystopian books."
3437.98,3446.7," Winston realizes that the current rise of authoritarianism, of polarization, if extended into the future, if extended more"
3446.7,3452.68," dramatically, will mean that he will lose most of what he calls important in his life. Now Winston"
3452.68,3457.58, realizes he needs to act. On which side is Winston more likely to act? I'll have two clashes about
3457.58,3461.82," this. Firstly, about what these books actually look like, what they portray, and secondly, about"
3461.82,3470.46," real world change. So the first clash is logically prior to everything else. We prove that they portray people, you know, they incentivize people"
3470.46,3475.16," to act because of the way they portray the world. And then we take also, like, then we move on to"
3475.16,3479.5," the second clash. So we told you, right, that, okay, a large portion of this debate has been"
3479.5,3484.22," talking about the endings in these, like, of these books, right? We told you from the very first"
3484.22,3489.12," speech, I remember I was there, right? From the the very first speech we told you it's not clear why this is exclusive to"
3489.12,3493.92, one side or the other what prop had to defend was a book or like i don't know some sort of like you
3493.92,3498.72, know form of literature in which there's a general positive takeaway and we defend one which there's
3498.72,3505.1," a negative takeaway i.e utopia versus dystop But sure, even if we do not have these good endings"
3505.1,3506.62," on our side of the house,"
3506.92,3508.56," if I think if you have a bad ending,"
3508.64,3510.76," if you see literally the status quo,"
3510.84,3511.8, but a little more dramatic
3511.8,3514.42," and you see people fight and not succeed against it,"
3514.42,3517.38," you realize that you're not in a big brother state, right?"
3517.44,3519.62, You realize that your country has not progressed
3519.62,3521.44," to that extent, or at least I hope it hasn't, right?"
3521.48,3522.56," Probably hasn't, right?"
3522.68,3530.08," So you see, and you are actually motivated even more because you don't want that to happen to you even on the metric that they have"
3530.08,3534.96, been defending the most rigorously we still win right but furthermore i think that they've like
3534.96,3539.2, mischaracterized a lot of these books as we've told you right it's not that animal farm is like
3539.2,3544.24, inherently against communism it's rather against state surveillance rather against like authoritarian
3544.24,3545.56, authoritarianism.
3545.56,3550.12," We're not talking exclusively about specific ideologies, we're more talking about these"
3550.12,3554.84," general rhetorics that everyone agrees are bad, such as authoritarianism, surveillance,"
3554.84,3555.84, things like that.
3555.84,3559.78," But then onto the second clash, which is the most important one about which side, on which"
3559.78,3562.52," side are people more incentivized to actually change the thing, right?"
3562.52,3563.84, So real world change.
3563.84,3569.44, They have probably like two like layers here firstly they tell you oh you know good feelings uh evoked by these books
3569.44,3574.32, are better because when you have a bad rhetoric it leads to hopelessness we think that this like
3574.32,3579.36, is not the case right i mean okay if you look up uh if you read a book in which um uh there's some
3579.36,3584.56, sort of uprising in the capital and now you've got like racist uh supremacists in power right
3584.56,3585.1, you might think hmm where have iacists in power right you might
3585.1,3590.74, think hmm where have I seen this one before right you like when you link those parallels you see huh
3590.74,3595.3, had that insurrection gone a little differently we would be living in a very different country had
3595.3,3600.1, this like polarization been more extended we would be living in a different country had we voted in
3600.1,3605.28, another populace or if we will in the future we can live in a very authoritarian state i think in
3605.28,3610.24, these instances people are more likely because of the fear that we have outlined in our first speech
3610.24,3615.44, right down the bench because of this people are more likely to take action because they want to
3615.44,3620.96, like they want that not to be the case right then their second like line of reasoning is that oh you
3620.96,3629.0, know this increases populism and polarization we told you no right based on like what I told you in the first clash this is likely to generally be against like like
3629.0,3633.74, uh like things that everyone you know agrees with things like authoritarianism and surveillance and
3633.74,3638.84, honestly honestly if that like the narrative now is that oh climate change extended into a future
3638.84,3644.18, and it's into a dystopia is very very bad and populists can actually like like uh like actually
3644.18,3645.44, change this to an extent.
3645.44,3647.44, I'm fine as long as like they start actually
3647.44,3648.82, having climate action.
3648.82,3650.88, I think that when these issues are highlighted
3650.88,3652.64," and someone's doing something about them,"
3652.64,3654.52, this greatly impacts the world we live in.
3654.52,3656.68, And that is something we're worth like trading away.
3656.68,3659.86," Panel, I think that Winston Smith deserves a better future"
3659.86,3662.06, and he needs to be motivated to get there.
3665.68,3667.64, I thank the speaker for the fine speech
3667.64,3669.56, and I now give the floor to the proposition
3669.56,3670.4, for their reply.
3670.4,3671.22," Hear, hear."
3677.7,3679.82," All right, just wanna double check for the last time"
3679.82,3681.78, if I'm visible and audible.
3682.68,3684.62, It would be very embarrassing to speak for four minutes
3684.62,3685.62, and have and audible. It would be very embarrassing to speak for four minutes and have no mic on.
3687.96,3692.96," Anyway, I will begin my reply speech in three, two, one."
3694.06,3697.16," Now, not to sugarcoat this debate,"
3697.16,3699.98, both sides had two different forms of framing
3699.98,3703.04, and it's been a bit of a two ships passing in the night.
3704.5,3706.94," However, both sides have been able to engage with each other"
3706.94,3709.86, and it's based on which arguments actively work
3709.86,3713.52, on both framings is the side that wins this debate.
3713.52,3717.76," Now, side opposition has constantly given us examples"
3717.76,3720.78," of how both in their framing and on our framing,"
3720.78,3723.6, negative political fiction works as a motivator
3723.6,3725.28, in order to create change through shock
3725.28,3731.12, value and through dystopia now first of all we've rejected their framing by telling everyone that
3731.12,3735.6, most positive fiction is dystopia no one wants to read a book more than 20 pages on a utopia
3735.6,3740.56, and thus we believe that our side framing does work better however even if we accept their
3740.56,3745.52, framing our arguments still hold water on both sides of this debate where we take both
3745.52,3750.08, the utopian dystopian framing and the positive and the negative framing our first argument was about
3750.08,3759.2, how our first argument was about how sorry first time was how political fiction normalized all
3759.2,3765.04, ideologies to make sure that all sides are able to be represented and creates this idea to strive towards.
3766.56,3774.16, Our side has consistently shown the benefits of showing how these positive effects happen and
3774.16,3779.12, the incentives that can bring people to work towards them. And our second argument has
3779.12,3784.0," expanded on this, on how the individual's role in the system works and how we can create both"
3784.0,3789.28, a societal and an individual's movement towards a better society. Side opposition's case however has constantly
3790.16,3794.88, focused on the efficacy of negative fiction in creating a movement that's based on shock value.
3794.88,3803.44, Side opposition's main tactical flaw was on this shock value because this shock value idea on which
3803.44,3806.48, they based how we can move people towards this by
3806.48,3812.48, showing parallels between them by showing that how we can create better solutions by identifying
3812.48,3817.52, these problems we believe that side opposition most of their arguments actually exist on both
3817.52,3821.44, sides of the bench and work for both side proposition and opposition their main unique
3821.44,3825.92, benefits on having this negative fiction is to create this kind of
3825.92,3831.84, descent towards the pot towards the current system and even then we believe that we have to take this
3831.84,3838.08, debate because their benefit actively has the harm of this establishmentarianism and populist
3838.08,3846.0," propaganda against these kinds of issues and as we believe that their side does not, it is not able to exist outside of their own framing."
3846.0,3865.7," Now finally on to address on to addressing the case extension that side opposition gave on exactly how they have different kinds of fiction for different kinds of things, and how side proposition somehow has millions of different ideas that we need to strive towards, and thus this loses solvency."
3865.7,3867.34," However, we do not see how this rebuttal"
3867.34,3870.42, has any less value on our side of the debate
3870.42,3873.48, as negative ideas and negative representations of things
3873.48,3876.0, are just as countless as positive representations
3876.0,3877.68, and positive ideas of things.
3877.68,3878.86," Thus, we believe that once again,"
3878.86,3881.04, outside opposition has consistently existed
3881.04,3884.8, on both sides of the bench without giving any actual benefits
3884.8,3885.18, as to how
3885.18,3891.26, specifically negative endings and or dystopian fiction actually benefits them specifically.
3891.68,3896.28," On their own framing, they fight for both sides and actively show that in general political"
3896.28,3903.44," fiction is good. On our framing, they show that their negative endings only create this kind of"
3903.44,3907.8," discouragement towards the current system,"
3907.8,3912.26," and they don't actively show how people are going to be incentivized more towards actual activism,"
3912.52,3917.22, rather than just general counterculture and creating this idea of being complacent.
3917.46,3926.48," We believe that in conclusion, our side is creating a utopia in the minds of people in order to create into in order to"
3926.48,3932.32, motivate people towards it whereas their side is only creating dissent and only reinforcing
3932.32,3935.84, the very ideas that their own fiction creates and that's why we believe we win thank you
3938.08,3943.6, i thank the speaker for the fine speech and everyone for this fine debate cross floor virtually
3943.6,3948.24, shake hands and talk to each other while we go to deliberate i will stop the recording
