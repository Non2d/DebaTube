0.0,5.84, the recording all right uh on the motion this house will implement fairness doctrines on
5.84,10.32, broadcast news media with significant audience reach i would like to welcome the first speaker
10.32,28.76," of the proposition here here okay am i audible yes you are okay i'll take my PR. I believe. Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry."
28.76,33.44," I'm going to start my speech in three, two, one."
33.44,41.0," I know they determine, select, shape, control and restrict content in order to serve interests of dominant elites."
41.0,45.76, We affirm this motion. what is the fairness structure right three cases under this
45.76,51.04, yes one the doctrine requires broadcasters to devote time to discussing controversial issues
51.04,56.5, of public importance i.e the federal communications commission in America requiring all broadcast
56.5,62.02, media to provide coverage for all candidates equally secondly when an individual or a person
62.02,69.04, is opposed on media the station is cut to get this person or a representative for this person to come and speak up for this person
69.04,70.44, and present their views.
70.44,72.76," Thirdly, where does this debate actually take place?"
72.76,77.88," This debate takes place in a liberal democracy, that is to say, US, Japan and France, right?"
77.88,78.88, Why is this particularly true?
78.88,83.44," A, these are the countries that actually have the big broadcast media in this debate today."
83.44,88.0," Secondly, media companies are more free to express their views due to the idea of liberalism"
88.0,91.0, and freedom of speech that these countries actually built upon that.
91.0,96.0," But even if that wasn't the case, it only happens here because A, governments like autocracies"
96.0,100.0, do not allow media houses with alternative views to actually thrive because they oppose them.
100.0,103.0," Secondly, they do not actually have big media stations in this instance."
103.0,108.08," And thirdly, majority of the assets are owned by the state in these countries,"
108.08,113.44," i.e. China, who manipulate news in their favor and do not have private ownership of these kinds"
113.44,118.96," of companies. Now, what is the fairness doctrine? A, fairness doctrine does not apply to giving"
118.96,124.48," space, autocracy, or to actually promote harmful views, which are like the liberal democracies"
124.48,125.28, already infusing
125.28,130.88, their agenda but alternative users do not lead to like the harm of people i.e military expenditure
130.88,136.96, and policy making b it is not about policing hate speech and deformation because there are laws
136.96,141.76, already refused those that actually have a negative concept right now what is broadcast
141.76,147.72, media in this debate today a news media are elements of mass media that focus on delivering news to the general public.
147.96,153.34," In this particular debate, we focus on broadcaster's news through television, radio, or any live"
153.34,158.2," podcast, but not Twitter, Facebook, or newspapers because they are non-broadcast media."
158.46,161.88," But secondly, broadcast media has presence on these different non-broadcast media."
162.16,168.88," Now, basically, broadcast media with significant outreach in this debate today is going to be referred to as big media now what do you mean"
168.88,176.32, by significant outreach right a many people actually the cnn with over 87 houses 87 houses
176.32,181.6, are united i'll take you later secondly crosses many boundaries from one country to another ie
181.6,186.16, aljazeera which has over 270 million views in 140 countries right why are
186.16,191.76, we applying the fairness doctrine to this media five issues a due to the high viewers it actually
191.76,196.48, has the power to create narratives that influence personal decisions b the greater places in the
196.48,200.96, system which gives them the power to suppress other smaller companies or other smaller media
200.96,205.36, houses thirdly the power to influence public opinion and how we actually perceive other
205.36,209.92, groups in our societies firstly the ability to suppress alternative voices when they actually
209.92,214.72, come to speak and finally as a fifth arm of the government it is failing to hold the government
214.72,219.2, accountable on what they actually do and it prevents bad news to like the different people
219.2,227.36," right now how will our model actually work to work work in three major ways, four major ways, right? A, each issue must be given equal air and time"
227.36,229.0, to another controversial issue.
229.0,231.4," I think Biden wants to invade Taiwan, right?"
231.4,233.48, We'll give alternative views or different views
233.48,234.76, that actually meet against this one.
234.76,236.94," Secondly, issues where certain individuals"
236.94,238.76," have actually been accused,"
238.76,241.9, and we will cry them to actually call this person
241.9,243.84, or like get a representative for this person
243.84,249.04, to actually come and express the person's views badly media houses should have different people of different
249.04,253.84, ideologies to come and sit down and express their views and finally they'll be held accountable by
253.84,258.64, the state's agency of communication i.e by taking their license right now p or i take it
261.2,265.46, a third of france are vaccine skeptics with reasons ranging from not believing in the
265.46,267.76, science to thinking it will change their DNA.
267.76,271.56, Could you clarify for us how you want that perspective given airtime with this doctor?
271.56,276.4," In this debate today, we look out for giving good information to everyone, right?"
276.4,280.92," We will encourage you to come and express your views as you are, right?"
280.92,285.2, We want you to come and express your views all of you and that individual comes and
285.2,290.0, decide what best suits them because we believe individuals are better at actually discussing
290.0,294.8, what actually better maximizes their happiness and like their better well-being right now moving on
294.8,298.64, to the case with a why governments need to actually intervene in media induced social
298.64,303.36, polarization secondly the effect of capitalism on big media funding what trade-offs are we willing
303.36,308.64, to make and partly why are media houses governments and societies engaged actually or incentivized actually do so
308.64,314.64, as a consequence way to handle how our world our world would actually look like with an
314.64,319.68, implemented virus doctrine and secondly how our model is actually more effective in dealing with
319.68,324.88, that issue right now i know why governments actually need to intervene in media into social
324.88,325.44, polarization right social polarization
325.44,329.78, right social polarization is when people leave the middle ground and are pushed further into like
329.78,335.9, their business right now the extreme ie like the extreme side of their positions like the liberalist
335.9,340.46, right becoming like radicalist right but now how does this come about this is basically because
340.46,345.26, continuously feeding people of the same information about the same topic with the same
345.26,350.92, narrative right now these people are being told the same thing at the same time every single time
350.92,356.4, now you tell them how abortion is bad over and over again so it makes some things in their heads
356.4,361.14, and makes them like believe how it is bad now how is this particularly harmful because it leads to
361.14,370.56, extreme actions on people with views that actually oppose those views i is since 1977 there have been 42 bombings on abortion clinics and on june 7th recently anti
370.56,375.84, abortion extremism burned down the plant parental clinic in tennessee right this particularly harms
375.84,380.48, people but secondly people lose trust in media like when you present one side of the story it
380.48,390.48, implies that you're influenced by others because we as a public expect other sides of stories right i.e like you you now start to start now start having narratives in our heads
390.48,394.56, you know trying to actually give us the good information right now this pushes us actually
394.56,399.6, lose trust in you i.e in the us 30 percent of the conservatives and more than 45 percent of people
399.6,403.92, actually do not trust their media right now what does this actually lead to right this is harmful
403.92,408.96, because people look for alternative sources of like information like social media which cannot
408.96,414.0, actually be regulated by the government and most of these action media sources actually have fake
414.0,418.0, news conspiracy theories and hate speech which actually leads to people actually hating each
418.0,422.24, other and like killing each other like people turn into extremist youth like the capitalist
422.24,425.12, capital hill actually revolve basically right now panel
425.12,429.04, secondly the effect of capitalism on big media right kind of two things under this media ownership
429.04,433.12, we have to understand the majority of bda is actually owned by like big companies and like
433.12,436.64, these big companies are like capitalistic in nature which want to actually maximize their
436.64,440.8, abilities and like for what their views right they will actually influence these different
440.8,445.12, media companies to put their views of capitalism is good than actually giving
445.12,449.68, a media balance now we need something to actually hold these companies into like check and like make
449.68,455.2, them whatever right we have examples of back home owning like paramount comedy central and mtv bed
455.2,459.28, all those actually owned by these companies but secondly how does media actually get funds this
459.28,463.36, big media right it gets funds from like donations right because you only give them only 20 percent
463.36,468.32, like as a viewer so they'll get funds from like donations and advertisements and basically when they get these
468.32,472.32, funds from like these big organizations they'll be incentivized to like do what these organizations
472.32,476.72, right actually want to do like they have used which is actually very helpful right now our
476.72,481.28, trade-offs are a donations or incomes from charities that were sponsoring specific projects
481.28,489.96, because we have a role as governments and media to take effective balance of information to people secondly chilling free speech right people who went to only express
489.96,494.22, their views like on standards where they aren't opposed right these people will actually run out
494.22,498.46, but we believe that it is justified because us as the media and the government we have a role
498.46,503.84, to give these people information that is both sides right to enable them to actually make good
503.84,505.04, decisions for themselves
505.04,509.04, sadly risk of politicians are busy it doesn't happen because governments have checks and
509.04,513.2, balances right due to like the social contracts and like they want to be voted back into power
513.2,518.24, so they are pushed right to actually work for the people and give them like this good information
518.24,524.16, other than a segue we only have media right media has no checks and balances because it has nothing
524.16,525.1, holding it accountable it has no citizens right balances because it has nothing holding it accountable
525.1,530.1, it has no citizens right so panel we affirm this motion given the fact that we want to give people
530.1,547.4," both sides of the story to maximize their choices i rest my case All right, I thank the speaker for that speech."
547.96,555.32," So I'm just making a note that WSCC rules technically require that the cameras of the speakers be switched on at all times,"
555.36,556.56, not just when the speaker is speaking.
557.22,559.8," So if Tim Uganda could switch on the cameras, that would be great."
560.68,562.56, Just making a note that that's what the rules say.
562.88,565.24," Unless you guys have internet difficulties, then we'll make adjustments."
565.24,567.26," All right, checking my panel is ready."
567.26,570.22, Just give a thumbs up when you are.
570.22,576.24," All right, to open this debate for the opposition, can we have the first speaker of the opposition?"
576.24,577.24," Here, here."
577.24,580.44, Checking that I'm audible?
580.44,584.24," Yup, yes, you are."
584.24,626.44," Perfect. Speaker, in the name of balance, we are extremely worried that what you do is reduce the diversity"
626.44,627.44, of news.
627.44,631.88, That marginalized groups are the first thing that is cut from broadcast media.
631.88,637.12, The effect of this policy entrenches existing power structures and creates a chilling effect
637.12,642.36, on what news is considered of national importance and gets airtime in the first place.
642.36,646.04," Panel, our contention is not that the news media right now is perfect."
646.3,651.04, Our contention is merely that their policy exacerbates the problem and creates new ones.
651.34,654.52, You can't have a fair media without a free media.
655.0,656.24, What's our stance on this debate?
656.76,660.06, We support the status quo where regulations on broadcast news media
660.06,664.66," are centered around regulations that uphold existing laws, such as on defamation,"
664.66,665.32, which can
665.32,670.86," result in the issuing of corrections, preventing anti-competitive practices, or illegal methods of"
670.86,676.22," information gathering. In short, those which are required to prevent overreach, but keeping in mind"
676.22,681.76," the need to guarantee the independence of media. Two arguments at LO. First, this doctrine violates"
681.76,687.04," the right to the freedom of press. Second, this reduces the quality, depth, and variety of content people receive."
687.46,692.84," Lastly, that this doctrine increases the likelihood of dangerous content being given additional airtime."
693.12,695.0," Before that, let's engage with our case."
695.4,696.58," Firstly, on their stance."
696.92,699.64," Speaker, this debate isn't just about WLBs."
699.8,700.86, There's nonsense framing.
701.36,706.34," India, Rwanda, Mexico all still have the private ownership of media. They're not"
706.34,712.0," complete autocracies as they characterize. Rather, we still have existent freedom of press. Sure,"
712.3,717.04," it's not perfect, but it still exists and this debate is still about them. The reason Team"
717.04,721.86, Uganda does this framing in this debate is to run away from the round because they are scared.
722.22,730.04," They're scared of how Viktor Orban, Reynard Modi, and AMLO misused this to increase their clutches over the media. From Prime Minister's speech"
730.04,735.46," itself, they're already losing out on 80% of the world. We think that that already puts us over"
735.46,741.06," them. Let's then engage with our case. First, they argue social polarization happens because of echo"
741.06,749.96," chambers. Like, sure, but you're already telling conservative people conservative news but that means the trust still exists on our side of the house because the most"
749.96,755.18, extreme rednecks go to the most extreme platforms whereas a lot of moderates are still existing with
755.18,759.74, the platforms that we want to engage with that means trust is preserved but also you have
759.74,765.2, incentives to platform moderates because you want to expand and boost legitimacy. But here's the very important
765.2,770.8," flip. They show conservatives, Bernie Sanders and AOC on their side of the house. That's when these"
770.8,775.32, people think liberals are taking over your safe space. That's when you think this is an overreach
775.32,780.14, on the regulation of the media. That's when they move to egregious alternatives. That's when they
780.14,784.32, move to Alex Jones who denies the Sandy Hook school shootings. This was the problem that
784.32,789.9," Prime Minister sets up. They create that problem. They exacerbate it. But second, on lobbying by"
789.9,795.4," private actors. Look, this exists on either side of the house. No side will perfectly regulate it"
795.4,800.12, away. But the important thing to note is that it will continue to exist on their side of the house.
800.36,805.4," And what that means is, sure, in name you are fair, but you end up with what Fox does right now,"
805.6,810.06," where you bring in people from the other side who you can strawman, who are incompetent at doing"
810.06,814.36," things like pushing their point forward, and therefore you can easily delegitimize and shut"
814.36,819.78," down. That is appalling. On the first argument, the institution of this doctrine erodes press"
819.78,826.0, freedoms. Free press is critical to democratic functioning because they are the primary check and balance on state power.
826.0,834.0," GOP themselves agree to this. Then, we believe that states should have absolute control over it as necessary for broadcast news media to operate."
834.0,841.0," This newly expanded role of a state body will make two important determinations for broadcast news, according to PROP themselves."
841.0,845.76," First, what's the news item of public importance and therefore should we expect"
845.76,850.32, to see coverage second was the coverage sufficiently balanced through methods such as
850.32,855.76, equal air time being given to opposing viewpoints this interferes with the independence of broadcast
855.76,860.64, media necessary for the functioning of a good democracy because rather than a multiplicity
860.64,865.26, of stations making determinations on what is in the public interest of that journalism.
870.38,874.92," Pulling, being on the ground, it shifts the Sith overlord power to determine that news agencies should be covering certain issues. These are literal editorial content decisions,"
875.32,880.46," something that we go out of our way to keep away from state bodies. Further, once news is covered,"
880.46,889.68, the state and its representatives can insist that there isn't enough airtime being given to their point of view. This increases political interference and particularly fevers
889.68,893.8," incumbent governments. Between the 40s and 80s in the US, when the fairness doctrine"
893.8,899.4," existed, Nixon held up the Washington Post for publishing about Watergate. Yes, Watergate"
899.4,904.46, by arguing that other issues were of greater public interest. JFK literally used it to
904.46,905.32, demand airtime to counter criticism on the Bay of. JFK literally used it to demand airtime
905.32,907.48, to counter criticism on the Bay of Pigs.
907.48,910.12, Roosevelt used it to shut down conservative critique
910.12,911.12, of the New Deal.
911.12,913.16, And can you imagine if it still existed
913.16,914.46, under the Trump era?
914.46,917.12, His administration demanding a right of response
917.12,919.6, to every single negative news story.
919.6,922.28, This only worsens in weak democratic states
922.28,924.38," that this round is also about, as I've proven,"
924.38,928.82, where states can use challenges around airtime to shut down critiques of the government.
929.12,931.06, That is something we were never willing to stand for.
931.52,936.86," On the second argument, this doctrine reduces the quality, depth, and variety of content people receive."
937.28,949.72," Some news organizations, sure, already put up diverse viewpoints and controversial issues because it increases viewership or because it makes their content more engaging this is in direct contrast what first prop tells you about echo Chambers to"
949.72,955.06, be clear we're not against broadcast media making these editorial decisions what team India oppose
955.06,960.4, is States forcing news organizations to apply this doctrine that creates unintentional consequences
960.4,970.26," which erode the quality of news there are three ways the erosion of editorial freedom reduces the depth and variety of content people receive. First, news organizations"
970.26,974.9, are compelled to reduce the complexity of the stories they present. With only half the
974.9,980.14," time to explore a piece on, say, vaccine effectiveness, you also now need to give airtime to vaccine"
980.14,985.76," skepticism. Second, it forces stations to deprioritize types of minority content because"
985.76,990.5, you have to trade off the equal airtime somewhere. Equal airtime given the issues of national
990.5,995.44," interest and you have to cut them down elsewhere. Third, investigative journalistic pieces become"
995.44,1000.82," even more rare. In the current climate, these pieces face intense barriers. Now, with the added"
1000.82,1005.58," burden of equal airtime to opposing viewpoints, say, in investigating the added burden of equal our time to oppose and investigating the child abuse"
1005.58,1009.92," of the Catholic Church, this is likely to reduce the number of editors willing to invest"
1009.92,1012.28, in long-form investigative journalism.
1012.28,1015.12," For the average viewer, this needs more superficial content."
1015.12,1020.38," You're less likely to see local, regional, or minority content, as this is the news that"
1020.38,1021.88, gets cut first.
1021.88,1024.84, Increased established voices being heard instead of new ones.
1024.84,1029.04, This in turn reduces political choice and agency before i move on to the next argument yeah
1033.36,1038.96, seeing the poi on the second argument this doctrine increases the likelihood of dangerous
1038.96,1046.36, content being given additional airtime first the use of the fairness doctrine to demand a right of response is going to
1046.36,1051.22," produce a series of challenges, is going to produce a series of challenges where their voice needs to"
1051.22,1057.24," be heard. This elevates previously fringe to mainstream, where toxic racism and sexism begin"
1057.24,1063.16," to be perceived as equally legitimate, increasing their reach and popularity. Second, or if you don't"
1063.16,1065.4, platform but you face the continuous threat of
1065.4,1070.18, legal challenge from litigious well-funded fringe groups and entrenched dominant yeah i'm gonna
1070.18,1075.48, cut you off here i think team uganda just dropped off the call um so i've started time at 7 minutes
1075.48,1082.22, 26 my suspicion is that they may have been frozen from when uh you say okay to the poi which is like
1082.22,1085.2, slightly before seven so i think we'll wait for them to come back first.
1087.6,1088.06, And then we'll see what happens from there.
1088.24,1088.86, Yeah.
1090.44,1094.16, I'm going to start the timer in the meantime and let the outcome know that they dropped from the call.
1095.08,1095.24, Yep.
1100.14,1101.14," Wait, don't, don't."
1102.22,1102.62, Yep.
1108.58,1109.5," All right, I thinkem Mugana,"
1109.58,1111.42, can I confirm that you're back on the call?
1117.28,1118.32," Yeah, can I check,"
1118.5,1119.6, what was the last thing that you had?
1119.92,1121.82," So we had a problem with May 12th,"
1121.82,1123.3, so we didn't hear the last speech.
1124.84,1126.4," Sorry, can I ask you to repeat that a bit?"
1126.66,1127.52, The last part got cut off.
1129.28,1131.54, It stopped at 6.20 minutes.
1131.58,1132.66, That's where we were cut off.
1132.88,1134.58, We were still speaking about diversity.
1135.16,1136.12," Okay, got it."
1136.24,1139.16, So you got cut off at around 6 minutes 20 seconds.
1140.68,1141.88," So based on my tracking,"
1141.98,1147.5, that seems to be somewhere in the middle of the second argument that was given by LO.
1147.5,1156.5," So we only got you completely off the call at 7.26, so there is a bit of a one-minute difference."
1156.5,1170.02," I'm not particularly sure on what the rules say on this, so I'm going to ask a member of the CAP to come in to clarify the rules because what we traditionally do is that we follow what the judges say. But in this case,"
1170.02,1174.82, I don't think it's completely fair because we did get an extra minute that you guys didn't.
1175.24,1179.44, So I'm going to ask the CAP to come in and hopefully we can clarify what the procedure
1179.44,1226.16," is going forward. Would that be all right? Okay okay give me one second In the meantime, I am going to pause the recording."
1230.68,1235.5," Second, we believe that this forces stations to deprioritize the types of minority content because you have to trade off the equal airtime given to issues of national interest and just"
1235.5,1240.58," cut down elsewhere. But third, investigative journalistic pieces become even more rare"
1240.58,1245.44," because in the current climate, these pieces face intense barriers now with the added"
1245.44,1250.08, burden of equal our time to opposing viewpoints say in investigating child abuse within the
1250.08,1255.12, catholic church this is likely to reduce the number of editors willing to invest in long-term
1255.12,1259.92, investigative journalism pieces here's what this means for the average viewer this means more
1259.92,1269.34," superficial content we are less likely to see, regional or minority content as this is the news that gets cut first, increasing established voices being heard instead of"
1269.34,1274.38," new ones and reducing political choice and agency. Before I move on to my next argument,"
1274.38,1275.38, POI.
1275.38,1282.18, Perfect. Seeing no engagement on the third argument. We think that this doctrine increases
1282.18,1289.94," the likelihood. Okay, so it's basically how do you actually have the adversity to say to the house when"
1289.94,1294.6, actually one type of news is being preached over and over again because that's a dominant
1294.6,1295.6, approach.
1295.6,1299.88," Speaker, we already explained this at the start of the first argument with nuanced incentive"
1299.88,1304.44," analysis. That is to say you want to appear legitimate, you want to expand your audience,"
1304.44,1308.22," therefore you are more likely to be diverse in your representation. On the third argument,"
1308.64,1312.9, this doctrine increases the likelihood of dangerous content being given additional airtime.
1313.1,1318.24," Why? First, the use of a fairness doctrine to demand a right of response is going to produce"
1318.24,1323.08, a series of challenges that their voice needs to be heard. This elevates previously fringe ideas
1323.08,1325.58," to the mainstream, where toxic racism and"
1325.58,1332.0," sexism begin to be perceived as equally legitimate, increasing their reach and popularity, or you don't"
1332.0,1337.12," platform them, but you face the continuous threat of legal challenge from litigious, well-founded"
1337.12,1342.68," fringe groups and entrenched dominant interests. Note, it is not marginalized women from Muslim"
1342.68,1345.36, communities in India challenging Hindu majoritarian news
1345.36,1346.36, channels.
1346.36,1352.0," Rather, it is US megachurches suing CNN when they feel criticized or their power is threatened."
1352.0,1356.5," This solidifies their standing, amplifies the loudest, and creates a chilling effect"
1356.5,1358.44, on these stations in the future.
1358.44,1362.34, This policy at its worst empowers the privilege to spread information.
1362.34,1365.22, You can't have a fair media without a free media of both.
1380.22,1381.94," All right, I thank the speaker for that speech."
1381.94,1387.34," Before we begin, I noticed that there's an individual court council in the call."
1387.34,1395.94, Could I ask you to please rename yourself so that we know which nation you're affiliated with and in what position you are coming to this tournament from?
1396.5,1397.9, Can I check that my judges are ready?
1400.54,1407.0," Alright, to continue this debate for the proposition, can we have the second speaker of the proposition?"
1407.0,1408.0," Here, here."
1416.0,1427.08," Okay, my name is Nenambarak and I'm going to start my speech in 3, 2, okay, okay, yep. Okay, I'm gonna start my speech in three, two, one."
1427.08,1431.0," Fano, creating a world where people hate antagonists, right?"
1431.0,1433.86," From the famous words of Karl Popper,"
1433.86,1437.62," where he says that you may be right, I may be wrong,"
1437.62,1439.02," but when we come together,"
1439.02,1441.24," we might come closer to the truth, right?"
1441.24,1444.5, You don't really understand an antagonist
1444.5,1445.98, until you understand why he's
1445.98,1452.02, a protagonist in his own world. What you get from self-proposition is the basic ideology
1452.02,1459.92, that you know allowing equal views from popular news media sites is going to promote a kind
1459.92,1466.62," of justice, racism from the opposition. But as my first speaker came, she talked about how we learned that in first speech"
1466.62,1468.8," about liberal democracy laws, right?"
1468.8,1470.56," Things like hate speech, secondly,"
1470.56,1473.58," things like hate speech, defamation or racism"
1473.58,1475.84," cannot be allowed by government, right?"
1475.84,1478.38," In liberal democracies, and there are mechanisms"
1478.38,1481.08, existing in society that stop these kinds of ideas.
1481.08,1483.42," What we are promoting are alternative views,"
1483.42,1485.84, things like economic policies
1485.84,1491.28, political ideas military exchange and things like that that allow people to engage in matters you
1491.28,1496.72, know controversial issues that allow business to have an informed decision finally what do we get
1496.72,1505.0, from cyber position right their second argument right was around forcing states to depopulate minorities.
1510.8,1513.72, But why do you find this more on their side of the case?
1513.72,1518.36," First of all, when you deny people to have"
1518.36,1520.18," a kind of a famous stock news,"
1520.18,1524.56," in other words, a barrage of opinion"
1524.56,1528.56," for news media outlets, you find that there's only going to be one"
1528.56,1534.16, narrative promoted right for example if i'm going to promote a kind of idea that africans are poor
1534.16,1538.16, then there is no it's it's going to create a kind of stereotype in a certain case which
1538.16,1544.96, has a narrative but no listen that what in in that event right minorities yes are going to be
1544.96,1546.32, suppressed but let's understand
1546.32,1551.84, that problem the problem may not okay like the problem is that is not that they are aren't true
1551.84,1557.44, but they are all incomplete being that they are also africans who are rich which makes the story
1558.24,1564.88, incomplete right which which is why we need to have all the alternatives for a particular idea
1564.88,1567.08, to allow people to make a decision.
1567.08,1571.32," We are looking out for individuals, for the audience."
1571.32,1576.32," And Pando, let me talk about how you can have a fair media"
1578.18,1580.04, without fairness.
1582.0,1584.56, Let's understand how these news media works.
1584.56,1593.76," So when you have a news media that's actually 59% of its income comes from advertisement,"
1593.76,1594.76, right?
1594.76,1599.44," You find that they are going to, and 20% comes from the audience, you find that news media"
1599.44,1602.64," are going to look for the best interest for themselves, right?"
1602.64,1605.52, And that is looking for the advertisers right so
1605.52,1610.24, in other words people are going to look towards profit maximization which then promotes the
1610.24,1615.36, narratives of advertisers not the people and not of the best interest of the state you find that
1615.36,1620.08, people are actually going to be harmed here because as in the lights here we find that if
1620.08,1626.38," if individuals are promote promote only one kind of, it's going to lead to polarization, right?"
1626.38,1629.76, This is the consumption of only one kind of similar content.
1629.76,1631.28, And that's how does this look like?
1631.28,1633.76," This looks like, this looks like,"
1634.9,1638.44," this looks like, like, okay."
1638.44,1640.44," This looks like kind of media, right?"
1641.62,1643.84, Individuals becoming extremists
1643.84,1646.4, because they believe that their ideas are being suppressed
1646.4,1652.48, right as we analyze the kind of trust that people have in in media right if under 73 percent are
1652.48,1657.04, democrats and liberals they trust the media but 10 percent are the conservatives and there are
1658.0,1661.28, conservatives and they don't really trust the media because of the ideologies that have been
1661.28,1668.16, promoted in liberal democracies right so you find you find that people's ideas are being suppressed
1668.54,1671.3, because of wanting to promote one kind of narrative.
1671.3,1672.46, So what does this lead to?
1672.46,1674.66," It's going to lead to a kind of backlash, right?"
1674.66,1676.32," That affects people, right?"
1676.32,1678.76," Because individuals are like,"
1678.76,1681.26," now you have the same thing for a long time,"
1681.26,1682.88," it becomes kind of right, right?"
1682.88,1684.06," When you are influenced,"
1684.06,1688.18," when you are exposed to only one particular idea for a long period of time, you start to believe"
1688.18,1692.0," that it's the right. So individuals who feel like a difference, this kind of narrative,"
1692.0,1698.5, are going to be suppressed. But let's also analyze their third point. They talk about
1698.5,1704.54, politicians using it to push particular narrative. But why do we see this actually harmful on
1704.54,1705.2, their side of the case
1705.2,1709.84, where uh companies actually lobby these media companies you find that in our side of the case
1709.84,1716.32, we give you uh government right governments who have an obligation to their citizens right to
1716.32,1722.24, ensure that the media promoted in this is actually you know balanced because it promotes a kind of uh
1722.24,1727.76, uh it promotes a kind of uh more like views that enables people to
1727.76,1732.56, uh to uh make informed decisions right so what happens when you only have one particular narrative
1732.56,1737.92, you are indirectly persuaded towards that idea right that is what it looks like so what in
1737.92,1742.72, heart and kind of informed decision it lets you go to make decisions that are in their best interest
1742.72,1745.44, this looks like uh voting you know
1750.0,1753.84, democracies right people making decisions voting for the right people besting on all the various information that they've received from people but if someone comes and promotes only one kind of
1753.84,1758.16, narrative you're going to find a lot of people right are going to are going to actually need
1758.72,1763.92, you know very little decisions in our case we analyze the children's debate they come and talk
1763.92,1775.0," so deeply about free speech and as much as as we accept free speech, we are willing to shield it, like promote our acceptance, right?"
1775.0,1785.0," That in some point in time, that finance documents shield free speech. But Pando, it is not an absolute right to have free speech in our country."
1785.0,1792.0," There are limitations to free speech. This looks like when it comes to public morality,"
1792.0,1797.0," public order, where people are being influenced to a certain decision."
1797.0,1809.16," Now, you can't talk about individuals burning down plant-powered food clinics in Tennessee. You find that individuals cannot, that actually leads to people who don't believe that certain"
1809.16,1811.76," things are, should be changed, right?"
1811.76,1815.38, So they act out of aggressiveness because their ideas are being changed.
1815.38,1827.0," So next of all, so you find that if this thing affects groups of people, you find that people need to change the way, you find that"
1827.0,1833.0," it is an obligation of the government in the social contract theory to protect these individuals,"
1833.0,1839.0, right? So free speech in our side of the case looks like individuals not wanting to share
1839.0,1843.0," as certain individuals who discuss alternatives. But, Fano, we see that this is a necessary"
1843.0,1845.44, trade-off in order to promote all
1845.44,1850.4, attendees to be provided so that you can reduce the stereotype and you can also reduce on that
1850.4,1856.08, on that on that on that on the lack of knowledge basically of individuals and that's a contract
1859.04,1866.82, so we find that on the outside of the case that people actually like like people have a kind
1866.82,1869.76, of checks and balances when it comes to this democratic country.
1869.76,1875.0," Sorry, this government right whereby individuals are held accountable right which you don't"
1875.0,1876.82, find in private sectors.
1876.82,1882.58, So you find that it is a need for balance of opinions which by even in the event that
1882.58,1885.0," these individuals are being,"
1885.48,1886.68," what's your kind of narrative,"
1886.68,1889.44, it does not stop opposition of those politicians
1889.44,1891.44, to actually spread their own ideas
1891.44,1893.0, so that they can enable individuals
1893.0,1894.88, to make some kind of informed decisions.
1894.88,1896.76," So what I conclude my debate,"
1896.76,1899.82," I would like to analyze a few things, right?"
1899.82,1902.46," One, we come and show you the importance of balance"
1902.46,1904.26," of views, right?"
1904.26,1905.92," But media, because of the kind of"
1905.92,1912.64, influence they have outwardly which then which may shows the kind of influence we show you how
1912.64,1918.56, promoting one kind of narrative lead to polarization right people are driven towards
1918.56,1925.58," extreme ideas because they feel oppressed and then thirdly we, we show you that in the event that, okay, we"
1925.58,1929.9, show you that the importance of like that these media houses are also being held
1929.94,1932.36," accountable for what you know, they are."
1938.04,1942.8," Alright, can the speaker for that speech? So I think at various points in that"
1942.8,1950.0," speech, earlier, I think there was a bit of like lag here and there so i think uh can i just confirm that you ever get a like internet"
1950.0,1956.8, connection is unstable message from zoom earlier uh do you see a message like that from intimaganda
1961.44,1965.68," all right so i'm going to suggest in that case, maybe it might be helpful for Tim Oganda to"
1965.68,1970.04, switch off the camera because I think that the video bandwidth may be picking up a bit
1970.04,1975.2, more bandwidth than necessary.
1975.2,1979.16, This is something that the rules do allow me to do as chair if I access that the internet
1979.16,1982.28, connectivity may become a problem for the debate.
1982.28,1988.56," So I think in that case, if you think Timuganda, I would say that just switch on your camera during the speech and then outside of the debate,"
1988.56,1990.62, feel free to keep the cameras off.
1990.62,1993.96, Just so that we don't have any dropouts thereafter.
1993.96,1996.64," Alright, checking if my panel is ready."
1997.34,1999.66," Alright, I'd like to welcome"
1999.66,2001.98, the second speaker of the opposition to continue this debate.
2001.98,2008.0, Thank you.
2011.0,2013.0," We have an inquiry. Yes, go for it."
2013.0,2018.0, Did you hear our second speaker speak because of that problem?
2018.0,2023.0," Oh no, so we heard the second speaker's..."
2023.0,2027.62," Oh sorry, we did hear the second prop speech I think there was"
2027.62,2033.86, just like one or two moments when there was a bit of a gap and then after that the speech came back
2033.86,2038.5, and then it came back a little bit faster than the speaker was actually speaking which normally
2038.5,2043.28, means that the internet connectivity dropped for a little bit but didn't drop too much to the point
2043.28,2048.0, that you were kicked off the call and thus you were able to pick up quickly enough after that.
2048.0,2053.0, So I think that is the reason why I'm suggesting maybe we can switch off the cameras.
2053.0,2056.0, We can maybe observe and see how better this is better this time around.
2056.0,2065.52," And then if it seems like it's not improving much, then I may request that maybe the third proposition gives a speech without the camera on but we'll"
2065.52,2074.0, do that when we get there yeah I hope that answers the question okay yeah opt to whenever you're ready
2079.44,2093.22," hi can you hear me? Yep, that I feel."
2096.26,2100.0, Team Uganda says that the reason the political system is harmed is because media organizations push one narrative
2100.0,2101.84, over and over again.
2101.84,2103.76, But for any of their impacts in this debate
2103.76,2106.58," to actually matter, what they have to realize"
2106.58,2108.88, is that this debate doesn't only happen
2108.88,2111.5, on broadcast news networks.
2111.5,2113.64, What happens fundamentally on their side
2113.64,2117.78," is that people move away from news broadcast network,"
2117.78,2121.5," move away from Fox News, move away from places like CNN"
2121.5,2124.98," to far worse alternatives, amplifying all of their harm."
2124.98,2125.6, So they cared about
2125.6,2130.96, that one narrative being pushed. It's much worse in those places. I want to at the top of my speech
2130.96,2136.24," give two reasons for why media organizations in general are better. One, they cater to more people,"
2136.24,2141.12," which means they have to moderate their narrative and not just push one extreme one. But second,"
2141.12,2145.04, other news organizations can call out that other organization because there's more
2145.04,2149.52, scrutiny which means that we don't think that the harms are as bad as they actually claim
2149.52,2155.12, that they are panel you can't have a fair media without a free uh you can't have a fair media
2155.12,2159.92, without a free media my substantive will be elaborating more upon this but before that i
2159.92,2163.84, want to look at two questions firstly i want to answer what the role of the state is secondly i
2163.84,2166.36," want to look at what news actually is like in answer what the role of the state is. Secondly, I want to look at what news actually is like."
2166.6,2167.74," In terms of the role of the state,"
2168.06,2170.56, they say that the role of the state is to prevent extremism
2170.56,2172.38, because it's not okay for the media
2172.38,2174.72, to keep repeating the same information over and over again.
2175.1,2177.56, But I think that their side is really un-nuanced
2177.56,2178.84, in terms of the types of people
2178.84,2180.48, who are actually engaging with this news.
2180.76,2182.44, We think that there are two types of people
2182.44,2188.56," that engage with news, with broadcasted news. The first are those who are already aligned politically right i mean people"
2188.56,2193.28, aren't just flocking to fox news for no reason the people who are going to fox news are already
2193.28,2198.8, conservative and go into the and pick their news platform because they're already that way they
2198.8,2203.36, don't change these people right because these people will still remain conservative the reason
2203.36,2208.26, they're watching fox news over other news organizations is because they're conservative. So it's not like they're
2208.26,2212.28, changing because of the narratives the media is pushing. They're already this way. We think that
2212.28,2216.48," these people, when they see these organizations changing and they see that these organizations"
2216.48,2221.32," are no longer talking about what they want, that is when they move away from it. But secondly,"
2221.48,2234.28," we think that there are moderates, right? There are moderates who also consume broadcast media news. What happens for these people is that in the status quo, they switch between CNN, Fox News, Sky News to hear different viewpoints already."
2234.28,2245.68," The difference on your side is that when they watch one news organization and they're under the impression that they're getting all the information from one, when in reality, these news organizations are still funded by the same"
2245.68,2250.96, people no thank you that their side was afraid of big corporations they're tricked they're fooled
2250.96,2255.92, we think it's much better on our side of the house for these individuals the takeaway from this is
2255.92,2260.08, that we don't actually think that extremism is due to the media it's not the role of the state
2260.08,2266.28," to intervene in these specific cases but so what is actually the role of the state? We think the role of the state is to prevent,"
2266.62,2269.72, the role of the state is not necessarily to do this.
2269.82,2271.3, Because when they say that the role of the state
2271.3,2272.3," is to prevent extremism,"
2272.38,2273.86, they concede to our principle
2273.86,2276.38, that the state should not interfere in these cases.
2276.52,2278.42, Because fundamentally what their side supports
2278.42,2281.66, is the BJP can say that a Muslim news network
2281.66,2282.94, is too extreme
2282.94,2285.68, because it's always talking about Islam and never
2285.68,2290.58, talking about Hindu politicians being bad. And you can't have a Muslim audience take
2290.58,2297.02, solace in that. It's also crazy leftists being like this Rust Belt news organization is too
2297.02,2301.46, extreme because it only talks about these people. The reason this is particularly important
2301.46,2305.36, is because it's always the minority that is harmed because the minority
2305.36,2310.56, can't sue on their side of the house they can't sue a majoritarian news network the majority and
2310.56,2315.52, fringe nra backed groups are the ones who have the money and the ability to sue someone if they
2315.52,2319.76, do not meet this fairness doctrine which means you'll fundamentally harm minorities structurally
2319.76,2324.56, this is the framing the debate happens under note that this debate isn't about things like hate
2324.56,2329.04," speech and defamation because there's a clear distinction right the reason the debate happens under. Note that this debate isn't about things like hate speech and defamation because there's a clear distinction, right? The reason the state has things like hate"
2329.04,2333.92, speech and defamation interference is because it's the bare minimum requirement that we have
2333.92,2339.36, the state interfering. It is to prevent deliberate harm that is the threat to someone's life. This is
2339.36,2344.0, nothing like that and their side hasn't shown that to us yet in this debate. So we don't think that
2344.0,2348.96, this is the role of the state. So I want to move on to the second clash here right on news organizations
2348.96,2352.8, their big push is that you should be able to make a decision with the information that's given to
2352.8,2357.36, you now i'll respond more closely in my own substantive about why you won't be able to make
2357.36,2362.32, this decision in a fairness doctrine world but i think what they have to realize with realize is
2362.32,2369.04," that just leading it up for people to make decisions is always not the best, especially when it comes to things like vaccine denialism and climate"
2369.04,2373.52," denialism. And I think this is really important, right? Because for things like vaccine denialism,"
2373.52,2377.52," on our side, you can still do things like talk about the fact that they're anti-vaxxers,"
2377.52,2381.76," but you can portray them as a very small group of people that are wrong. On their side,"
2381.76,2385.12, they have to give them more airtime because they need to be fair.
2385.24,2386.56, You need to give them a platform.
2386.56,2390.32," You need to give them 50% of the airtime, which means that you come in"
2390.32,2392.48, and you're legitimizing these people's viewpoint.
2392.48,2393.76," You're thinking that they're right,"
2393.76,2396.24, even though they might not necessarily be that way.
2396.56,2398.92," We think it's really difficult for you to, for example, say,"
2399.88,2400.56," no, thank you."
2400.56,2402.88, You constantly platform climate denialism.
2403.0,2404.92, So the decisions are fundamentally wrong
2404.92,2409.1," because they're not the right decisions ultimately, because you're basically portraying"
2409.1,2414.06, sides that are not necessarily great. The way here is that even if we can't change extreme
2414.06,2418.26," people on either side of the house, at least moderates aren't confused about whether or not"
2418.26,2423.18, to deny vaccines or whether or not climate change is something that is real. That is the way their
2423.18,2425.22, side does not get. I want to now push
2425.22,2429.14, our case a little further and explain why we think that the quality of information is lower.
2429.48,2433.56," Because in a world where you impose this fairness doctrine on every news organization, what"
2433.56,2438.08, fundamentally happens is that these news organizations cannot exist or cannot profit
2438.08,2443.44," or sustain themselves that much. Because one, they'll get a drop in engagement, right? If all"
2443.44,2447.04," news organizations in their best case are just throwing out facts about both sides,"
2447.3,2450.16, we think that no one will want to watch these news organizations anymore.
2450.36,2453.24," So you have a dip in engagement and as a result, a dip in the funding."
2453.24,2458.02," But secondly, we think that in a world where they can't differentiate one news organization"
2458.02,2462.12," with another, that is when you'll narrow down the news organizations to just two or three."
2462.34,2469.04," The only reason the BBC is able to exist is because it's state funded. There's no other example that we can actually name, which means"
2469.04,2473.36," that on your side, you have a smaller number of news organizations. So the problem with that is"
2473.36,2477.62, that you don't get the amount of information that we can have because you rely on a singular news
2477.62,2481.94, organization. That's a harmful world. That's not the world in which the media actually does good
2481.94,2486.4, in the world. I'll take your POI.
2491.12,2496.32," Okay, since this one of the fairness joke in a long time ago there was a decline in broadcast viewers right, don't you think it's particularly harmful since you viewers look for alternative"
2496.32,2501.28, measures of accessing information like social media which actually promotes conspiracy theories?
2501.84,2509.92," Yeah exactly, we think that's worse on your side as I'll explain. There are two parts to this argument. The first is that what happens is that either news organizations"
2509.92,2515.12," on your side are forced to comply to do this, but they're forced to do so, which means that the way"
2515.12,2519.06, they go out against the other side is they find opposing speakers who are weak and extreme
2519.06,2523.96," representations of the other side, which means that on your side of the house, Fox News, for example,"
2524.22,2525.12, can call Doreen
2525.12,2530.16, Ford the moderator of subrebit to speak about workers rights and exploitation and say that and
2530.16,2534.08, pick the types of people who've never been in front of a camera make her feel bad even though
2534.08,2537.68, she's from the other side so fundamentally even though you're bringing people from the other side
2537.68,2541.84, you can villainize them you can make people believe that those individuals are not actual
2541.84,2545.2, representations of the movement or let's take your absolute best
2545.2,2550.24, case scenario these news organizations genuinely do comply let's just assume that these news
2550.24,2555.68, organizations find perfectly rational neutral clinical representations of both sides of the
2555.68,2560.96, house what happens is that you as an individual feel like your news organizations have been taken
2560.96,2570.64, that the state is after you that means that you're more likely to shift to places like alex jones lauren southern or miguel serrano because you feel like you're not getting this from
2570.64,2576.16, a broad stream news organizations to answer your poi it makes it much much worse on your side of
2576.16,2580.56, the house than ours which means you have more distrust in platforms that means that these
2580.56,2590.02," alternative sources are significantly worse more people go to non-mainstream news that increases the power and the reach of conspiratorial, extreme and radicalizing news sources."
2590.14,2592.92, The exact thing Proposition was trying to avoid.
2593.1,2664.46," We're incredibly proud to oppose. Thank you. Okay, can I repeat that we're like three people speaking at the same time earlier sorry okay so am i audible yes yes Yeah, I think we need to wait for Team Uganda to confirm their internet and whether it's"
2664.46,2667.12, working well. Can i check that the
2667.12,2692.08," panel is ready yeah okay then we'll just wait for timo ganda to confirm the internet Okay, I think we are good now. Let me start my speech, right?"
2693.12,2697.24," Okay, so one of the panel just went to the restroom."
2697.46,2701.12," So we'll give them, well, until they come back onto the camera, essentially."
2701.5,2701.6, Yes.
2703.22,2705.84," Yeah, but could we maybe, okay, maybe what we could do is a bit of a test is"
2705.84,2711.84, can i ask you to switch on the camera and maybe uh try saying like three sentences so like your name
2711.84,2715.84, um your pro like yeah your name where you are that kind of stuff yeah
2717.92,2727.84," okay my name is babazina alupo side speaker from Proposition Side, making a motion about broadcast media."
2727.84,2731.04," Awesome, internet works perfectly well."
2731.04,2733.92," Yes, okay, can, all right."
2733.92,2735.92, Can we use the phone?
2735.92,2744.16," Okay, can, in that case, oh no, one of, oh no, now one of the judges is frozen."
2744.16,2749.0," Uheidi, confirming that you can hear us?"
2758.0,2761.0, I think Uganda is frozen too.
2761.0,2767.32," Oh yeah, okay. Uganda is not frozen now which is good uh really confirm that"
2767.32,2774.7, confirming that you can hear us are you are you around yeah we can hear you just okay yeah I'm
2774.7,2779.26, sorry just one of the judges um was frozen for a moment so we just wanted to confirm that they were
2779.26,2789.04, okay all right in the case internet looks like it's going well um all right uh the proposition whenever they are ready here here
2797.28,2806.86," okay my speech will begin in three two one panelano, side opposition fails to understand"
2806.86,2810.96, why we concentrated on broadcast media in this debate.
2810.96,2812.68, Why did we feel that broadcast media
2812.68,2817.06, is the most important one to focus on in this debate?
2817.06,2819.46, We gave you a characterization of broadcast media
2819.46,2821.24, and why it's important in our debate
2821.24,2824.68," and why we centered it in liberal democracies, right?"
2824.68,2826.0, But side opposition fails
2826.0,2831.36, to understand that we talked about broadcast media as having one of the highest views right
2831.36,2838.32, we characterize cnn to have 362 million viewers worldwide fox news to have 87 million viewers
2838.32,2847.1," and al jazeera to have 270 million viewers in 140 countries so So why we are best on broadcast media is one,"
2847.1,2849.9, because it has the power to influence people.
2849.9,2850.82," We talked about that,"
2850.82,2853.98, that we see it as the fifth arm of government
2853.98,2858.06, and that it's failing to hold up other arms accountable.
2858.06,2860.38, We also talked about how this broadcast media
2860.38,2863.0," has the power to suppress alternative views, right?"
2863.0,2869.6, And we also talked about that other media houses actually get information from broadcast media to talk about in that in their part of
2869.6,2874.88, the house so we see that this is the main uh main source of information where people actually gather
2874.88,2879.12, their information from right now in my speech i'm going to start with a few rebuttals then i'll head
2879.12,2884.16, on to the clash points right they come and talk about how there's going to be a drop in engagement
2884.16,2885.44," on our side right how people who have who have a drop in engagement on our side, right?"
2885.44,2889.42, How people who have views that are aligned on one side will be...
2889.42,2890.94," But we talked about a trade-off, right?"
2890.94,2895.04, We talked about how we are willing to trade off these people who want only one view or
2895.04,2899.72, one side to be heard in order to make sure that people have equal opportunity to listen
2899.72,2901.32, to both sides of views.
2901.32,2905.44, And they completely ignore the fact that we talked about how free speech is not
2905.44,2911.28, completely uh uh is not completely free right we talked about how there are scenarios where free
2911.28,2917.84, speech has to be uh cut off scenarios like when they're giving wrong information to children
2917.84,2923.2, right when when when this information is going to be uh removing order in the country when this
2923.2,2925.68, information is dealing is dealing with privacy
2925.68,2930.0, of individuals or is harming individuals. We talked about all those scenarios where this
2930.0,2936.72, speech has to be limited and we talked about how the government already has in place policies that
2936.72,2941.28," reduce this free speech in order of protecting other people or protecting the minorities,"
2942.72,2946.78," protecting people's privacy and removing cruelty or hate speech, right?"
2946.78,2948.14," We talked about all this, right?"
2948.14,2949.62," Then we talked about, then they talked about,"
2949.62,2951.98, so the drop in engagement would be more on their side
2951.98,2954.66," because we analyze like, for example, on YouTube,"
2954.66,2958.74, there is a debate on flat earth and round earth.
2958.74,2961.3," So we see that flat earth had like 1 million views,"
2961.3,2962.8," round earth had like 2 million views,"
2962.8,2965.04," but when we see flat earth versus round earth,"
2965.04,2967.3, it had 20 million views.
2967.3,2968.64, So we said that engagement goes more
2968.64,2971.82, if people are able to listen to both sides of a story.
2971.82,2974.38," People like a debate, people like engagement, right?"
2974.38,2976.42, And they're talking about how weaker speakers
2976.42,2977.7, will be brought out on our side.
2977.7,2978.92," But we said on both sides,"
2978.92,2982.62," we know people who have the best view on these topics, right?"
2982.62,2984.82, We know people who have substantial information.
2984.82,2989.24," So we shall be able to see if you bring up a weaker speaker on the other side, it will"
2989.24,2994.98, be easily known or easily seen because we know people who have the substantial views
2994.98,3000.62, or the substantial information on these particular topics. So the point of weaker speakers coming
3000.62,3004.84, on on our side and still views being suppressed completely falls out of this debate. So they
3004.84,3009.52," talked about how the state should not intervene, right? Should not intervene in this."
3009.52,3014.08," But we talked about on our side from the first speech to the second speech, how the state has"
3014.08,3020.96, an obligation to make sure that people get equal information. The state has that obligation. And
3020.96,3029.68," if the state is not carrying this out, this is where the fairness talking actually comes in they talked about how um uh giving people to make a decision is not always"
3029.68,3034.64, the best for example in terms of seeds right but we see that people we talked about how people
3034.64,3041.2, have the best uh the uh have the best uh best position to make a decision which is affecting
3041.2,3045.04, their personal lives because i know what i want i know what i i what
3045.04,3050.64, what uh affects me positively or negatively right we see that if you give equal information even in
3050.64,3054.72, terms of the vaccine let's get them to the best side of the case where they talk about the vaccine
3054.72,3060.32, and how vaccine intake will be versus you know vaccine uh conspiracy theories and stuff we see
3060.32,3067.0, that people will be even more inclined to take on this vaccine because they're showing us how vaccines are more important.
3067.0,3075.0," Equal information, equal views, right? Then we completely narrowed out the things of, for example, bringing in like hate speech,"
3075.0,3079.0, because they talked about how we are going to be bringing in controversial issues like terrorism.
3079.0,3086.6, But we completely narrowed that. We put that out on our first speech and our second speech so um on their
3086.6,3091.28, side we see that there is little intervention which we feel is very important in terms of
3091.28,3096.38, making a decision for example in terms of democracy right to hold up democracy people
3096.38,3101.84, need enough information in order to have that democracy applying their lives so this is what
3101.84,3107.06, we are talking about the reason why we ruled out Twitter and Facebook and newspapers is because we see
3107.06,3108.44," that they are not broadcast media,"
3108.44,3110.04," which is what we're concentrating on,"
3110.04,3112.42, but also that they get information from broadcast media
3112.42,3114.92, and apply it in those forms of media.
3114.92,3116.26, So we see that it's the same thing.
3116.26,3119.26," We have to go to the root of the problem and solve it there,"
3119.26,3122.18," which will solve the problem in other places, right?"
3122.18,3126.64," We talk, so on our side, we talk about first of all what a"
3126.64,3132.72, broadcast media is why it is important to have them right in order to solve the problem of one
3132.72,3138.48, polarization media induced social polarization which we see has adverse effects right people
3138.48,3143.6, having an extreme uh reaching an extreme point of their views because they have not been able to
3143.6,3148.46, hear on one side you can talk about al jazeera right like how al jazeera would have to come and
3148.46,3155.4, would have to come and put views on how muslims and hindus are the same or something like that
3155.4,3161.06, but we see that uh that this is not going to be possible on their side right because first of all
3161.06,3166.88, if al jazeera put up views containing hindu people right al jazeera will bring on uh
3166.88,3171.84, which we will see it's already happening in status quo where there are debates right but al jazeera
3171.84,3178.0, is going to suppress the views of a person who has uh alternative views on muslims and this is
3178.0,3182.4, already happening status quo and that's what we are trying to to reduce how because the government
3182.4,3185.04," is going to be obligated to make sure that this happens,"
3185.04,3189.36," because the government has a role to the citizens. Two, the other problem we are trying to solve on"
3189.36,3195.52, our side is journalism at the age of capitalism. We see that these journalists are making this
3195.52,3200.88," about the money, right? They're making this about the profits that they are getting. And they come"
3200.88,3212.88," and talk about how the media houses will not be able to stand, right? But we see that, yes, media houses are not able to stand up particularly."
3212.88,3217.9, But we see that we are willing to take because we need to have a balance between profit and
3217.9,3218.9, impact.
3218.9,3220.9, One cannot be more than the other on this side.
3220.9,3224.6," And we see that on their side, they're advocating for impact to be more than profit."
3224.6,3227.92, But here we are advocating for balance the other trade-off that we give up is regulating
3227.92,3234.8, broadcasting companies will on their side will have checks and balances well even if the risk
3234.8,3238.8, of politicians abusing medias we see that the government has an obligation to make sure that
3238.8,3242.88, this doesn't happen the government is the main body that's standing on this side to make sure
3242.88,3247.62," that this does not happen next we have have people who do not want to engage,"
3247.62,3250.18," not likely, yeah, we think that this is a trade-off"
3250.18,3251.64, that we are willing to take for people
3251.64,3254.58," who only want one view to be put forward, right?"
3254.58,3258.78," Yes, they are going to get off these media houses"
3258.78,3260.42," and they will stop listening to them, yes."
3260.42,3262.52, But we see that the vast majority of people
3262.52,3268.8," who would really want to listen to two sides of the story and to help them make a good decision will be still engaged, right?"
3268.8,3285.28," We see that the media houses get 20% of their income from us and then 80% not from the advertisers, which means that there is a very high chance of these advertisers being influencers on their opinions that are going to be said on these media houses."
3285.28,3292.64," So on our side, we completely propose on the fact that we need the fairness doctrine to be able to"
3295.12,3313.2," make sure that people's rights and people's choices are being respected. Thank you very much. All right, I thank the speaker for that speech."
3313.2,3316.0, Can I check that the panel is ready?
3316.0,3321.62," All right, to conclude the substantive portion of this debate, can we have the third speaker"
3321.62,3353.0," of the opposition here Just checking that Hibisha is audible and visible, can you say something?"
3353.0,3355.0," Hi, am I audible?"
3355.0,3361.0," Yup, she's audible and she's visible but the light behind her is obscuring her face, but that's about it."
3361.0,3363.0, Better?
3363.0,3367.6, Perfect.
3369.06,3369.46," POIs, all of you, please."
3374.58,3375.66," I'm starting my speech in three, two, one."
3377.22,3379.24," Every time side proposition wants to talk about climate change,"
3379.62,3380.88, they have to bring someone
3380.88,3382.16, who's a climate denier
3382.16,3384.06, because that's just the true balance
3384.06,3385.04, of perspectives
3385.04,3390.24, on news every time they want to talk about vaccines they also have to represent people
3390.24,3395.68, who think vaccines are actually just causing autism every time they want to talk about women's
3395.68,3401.04, right and their ability to access abortion they also have to show people screaming murder on those
3401.04,3405.04, women saying that that is not what is something they should be doing.
3409.84,3410.2," I'm so proud to oppose. I have three clashes in this speech done. Firstly, on the principle,"
3414.62,3419.72," setting on which side increases polarization. Thirdly, on which side covers much more information and issues in journalism. Firstly, then, on the principle, what did we tell you right from our"
3419.72,3424.8, first speech? We told you that the state is able to influence what is shown in media on their side
3424.8,3425.0, of the
3425.0,3426.0, house.
3426.0,3428.0, A couple of responses that we heard from them and let's deal with that.
3428.0,3433.0," Firstly, on this idea that it is only in Western liberal democracies, we told you right from"
3433.0,3435.0, the beginning it doesn't have to be.
3435.0,3437.0, It's also about weak democracies like India.
3437.0,3443.0," But second, even if it is about Western liberal democracies, this is also about, for instance,"
3443.0,3445.12, Nixon being able to shift away the focus from
3445.12,3450.4," Watergate because recognize any state would be able, would love to jump at this opportunity to"
3450.4,3455.36, shut down criticism against them and that also includes Western liberal democracies. Just imagine
3455.36,3460.0, what Trump would have done with this. But secondly on this idea that we already have regulations in
3460.0,3464.8, the status quo and so it's not total prestige. There are two differences between existing
3464.8,3469.08, regulations on hate speech and misinformation and what they're doing for a couple of weeks
3469.08,3475.0, first notice that the bar for the regulations that we set right now is extremely extremely high that
3475.0,3480.1, is to say you literally have to use slurs or weaponize someone's identity against them for
3480.1,3484.2, the state to be able to ban that sort of information that means you're causing direct
3484.2,3485.46, harm on individuals.
3485.46,3487.9, That is not a bar that they have yet proved to us.
3487.9,3490.94," But secondly, notice, recognize the fairness doctrine"
3490.94,3494.16, is considerably much more subjective than hate speech.
3494.16,3497.38, And that's when you get scope for government intervention.
3497.38,3500.52," Because now the government is telling media organizations,"
3500.52,3502.32, you should talk about these topics
3502.32,3503.8, and not talk about those topics
3503.8,3505.3, because they're not important enough. And this is the way you should talk about them because and not talk about those topics because they're not important enough.
3505.3,3509.24," And this is the way you should talk about them because you have to represent this side,"
3509.24,3510.24, also represent this side.
3510.24,3512.24, This is the amount of time you should give them.
3512.24,3516.24, That's when you actually take away the freedom of speech on their side of the house.
3516.24,3521.06," But lastly, in this clash, notice any argument that they gave you about state obligation"
3521.06,3529.12," to protect individuals, that's completely hung on the practical because you cannot protect individuals if not for instance if you aren't able to prove the fact that there's"
3529.12,3533.68, harm being caused to them that means that that's hung on the practical it is our principle that
3533.68,3538.48, is an independent path to victory for us on weighing wise is enough for us to win this debate
3538.48,3542.48, first because the role of media by their own characterization is to be the fourth pillar of
3542.48,3549.92, democracy to hold the state to account and that's not something it's able to do unless at the house but second notice because the practical
3549.92,3554.48, on-ground impacts of this that is to say you can't call out governments now because you just don't
3554.48,3559.04, know what they're doing wrong because every time you call out a policy the government is given a
3559.04,3563.44, lot of time to respond back to it that's when you can't vote them out and that's when you can't
3563.44,3568.76, actually think that they're doing something wrong so So moving on to a second clash then on polarization.
3568.76,3575.2," Before I move on, is there any POI? Seeing none. At the top of this clash, I just want"
3575.2,3579.9," to make it very clear, they cannot just argue that all controversial issues are hate speech"
3579.9,3583.0, and they're not going to be talking about that on their side of the house. There's a
3583.0,3588.7, difference between calling women violence slurs and telling them that they just aren't sure that the gender pay gap really exists.
3588.96,3590.62, There's an opinion and there's a hate speech.
3590.86,3592.0," There's a massive, massive difference."
3592.12,3594.66, They have to contend with the opinions on their side of the house.
3594.94,3596.58, Let's then deal with what they told us.
3596.8,3600.22," Firstly, on this idea that you espouse the same information again and again."
3600.38,3603.46, This is the only source of information that individuals have.
3603.46,3605.12, I have three responses to this.
3605.36,3611.78," First, recognize we no longer live in the 1950s, right? Individuals have a number of accesses to"
3611.78,3615.98, information right now just through broadcast networks as well because there's not just one
3615.98,3620.4, TV channel that exists but multiple of them that exist. They have to prove to us why individuals
3620.4,3625.2, would never be able to access them on either side but secondly notice every channel has
3625.2,3630.4, an incentive to already be not extreme too extreme on us on either side of the house because that
3630.4,3636.16, means that you get large numbers of viewers only on uh but lastly notice you often have views that
3636.16,3639.92, are already shared there's two things like communities etc it's just untrue that these
3639.92,3645.42," for instance are the sole way that you're sure is shaping people's views shaping people's information then they can see this right when they when they tell you in their third speaker that for instance, are the sole way that you're shaping people's views, shaping people's information."
3649.64,3649.72," And they can see this, right? When they tell you in their third speaker that, for instance,"
3653.44,3653.54," you would recognize who the weakest speaker is, you'd recognize when they're strawmanning,"
3657.92,3658.12," for instance, then you can't recognize the point which only one source of information exists,"
3662.84,3687.9," that's something that they can see. But let's then deal with what we also told you. We told you that it is much more likely to show mainstream entrench of fringe but powerful perspectives because these are the people who have the most power, who can afford their side of the house, corporations can simply litigate the most because the money they have."
3687.94,3688.66, That means two things.
3688.82,3690.78," One, they can get their views represented the most."
3690.78,3701.48," But secondly, to prevent a situation where you lose thousands of money, media companies end up self-selecting into the sorts of information they're giving because they don't want to be, for instance, in the future, be sued by them."
3701.8,3707.84," That means that on our side of the house, sure, there's one media channel that was controlled by the corporation on their side of the house all"
3707.84,3711.84, media channels are literally platforming for instance the fact that fossil fuels are not
3711.84,3716.32, actually causing climate change but lastly notice it means that what this means is that you can't
3716.32,3720.08, get the most vulnerable able to get that information because minorities like social
3720.08,3724.96, justice movements don't have the power to litigate don't have the power to sue and don't get that
3724.96,3726.32, represented on their side of the house.
3726.32,3731.06, But let's then deal with this argument that you lose trust from social media.
3731.06,3733.06, I have a couple of responses to this.
3733.06,3736.94," Because if they thought that viewers care just about being neutral, care about watching"
3736.94,3738.94," debates, why do we have news for them?"
3738.94,3739.94, A three response.
3739.94,3744.36," Firstly, notice that if this was true, they can just move to any other channel, like for"
3744.36,3748.62," instance, CNN, if they wanted, if they were so scared of Fox News, because there are channels that"
3748.62,3749.66, are moderate right now.
3749.9,3754.48," But secondly, notice, social media isn't really the very neutral platform that these people"
3754.48,3755.72," would be moving to, right?"
3755.92,3758.26, Everyone recognizes that social media is pretty radical.
3758.58,3759.84, That's not where individuals would move.
3760.04,3763.36," But lastly, notice, these are the people that are very, very less in number, because you're"
3763.36,3767.22, not often watching and analyzing news and making sure every side is well represented.
3767.5,3771.9, You're just listening for often confirming the all views that you already have.
3771.9,3782.8," But let's then compare this to the argument that we gave you from Karthik's second speech when we told you that you much more likely push individuals into social media on their side of the house because the fact that they don't feel represented,"
3783.02,3788.64," because they feel disengaged, because they want the information that you stopped them from having on their side of the house because the fact they don't feel represented because they feel disengaged because they want the information that you stopped them from having on their side that means one you"
3788.64,3794.24, create much more radicalization but second you strengthen echo chambers and here's when they
3794.24,3798.16, want when they wanted to talk to you about other family you literally reinforce information again
3798.16,3802.4, and again that's when you do it again because your for you page will only show you the stuff
3802.4,3807.0, that you've already liked in the past you've've worsened that to a large extent on their side of the house.
3807.0,3813.0," But lastly, notice you end up having to platform extreme ideologies even on much more mainstream channels now."
3813.0,3815.0," And that is really, really bad because of two reasons."
3815.0,3820.0," One, recognize that extreme ideologies are much more easier to explain because it's just easier, for instance,"
3820.0,3828.36," an abortion activist to come up and yell, oh, no, this is murder, rather than having to explain the history of, for instance, what years, what weeks is abortion legal at, what,"
3828.52,3831.78," for instance, the black market for abortion looks like. But secondly, the less entrenched,"
3831.86,3835.66," that means it takes less, it takes them much more time to, for instance, argue against"
3835.66,3839.6, that. That means you just get and spread much more extreme views on their side of the house.
3839.84,3843.84, Last clash then on less information. They give you three reasons why you get crucially
3843.84,3849.04," less information from their side of the house. We still haven't heard any response to this. On being wise, it's"
3849.04,3853.52," enough for us to win this debate independently. One, you crowd out information about the most"
3853.52,3857.76," vulnerable about minorities and that's when you worsen interactions with them. That's when you,"
3857.76,3862.96," for instance, on the ground are not likely to vote for their rights, etc. But secondly,"
3862.96,3865.78," you don't get information about the biggest atrocities in the world,"
3865.98,3868.12," then you're not likely to, for instance, get investigated"
3868.12,3869.96, in journalism and talk about the Catholic
3869.96,3871.86, Church's abuses. That's when you hurt
3871.86,3874.16, victims more. Don't give them the justice you need.
3874.36,3876.22," For all of these reasons, I have never"
3876.22,3892.6," been prouder to oppose. All right, attend the speaker for that speech, checking if my panel is ready."
3894.68,3900.44," Yep, all right. To conclude this debate for site opposition, can we have the reply speaker of the opposition?"
3900.8,3904.96," Yeah, just checking that I'm both audible and visible."
3907.68,3909.6," Yep, yes, you are amazing perfect just give me a second"
3910.2,3916.32, setting up
3916.32,3934.02," speaker third proposition says and quote, people like a debate. Blathered debatings featuring both sides of the house get more engagement and views."
3934.02,3938.92," But if you read your notes panel, you realize that this is what we've been saying since first off."
3939.9,3946.78," In our second argument, we literally told you that some news organizations already put out diverse news points to boost engagement."
3946.94,3951.42," This is very, very important because third proposition knifes their prime minister and deputy,"
3951.7,3957.28," who repeatedly tell you that the media right now only shows one side, only is hyper-polarized."
3957.28,3964.28," At the end of this round, Uganda runs far too close to our case and knifes their first and second in the process."
3964.48,3965.8," But even if that's true,"
3966.2,3970.5, let's make one thing exceptionally clear. The comparative indifference between both sides of
3970.5,3976.78," the house is this. First, on both, yes, we agree. Diverse viewpoints probably exist to some extent,"
3976.96,3981.44, but here's what they do on their side of the house. Proposition makes viewers feel like the
3981.44,3985.42, state is perverting and corrupting the media. That's the point at
3985.42,3990.14," which the terrible alternatives that they talk to you about, people like Alex Jones, are flooded to."
3990.48,3994.78," We think that on their side of the house, sure, they try to co-opt some of our benefits, but they"
3994.78,4000.2, really don't. What they open themselves up to is the myriad of harms that we push down the line.
4000.62,4005.38," Two questions in this speech. First, on which side has a greater quality of news? Second,"
4005.52,4010.92," on polarization and the influence over news that different actors exercise. On the first question,"
4011.22,4015.3, we told you that this drastically goes down on their side of the house for a lot of reasons
4015.3,4020.48," down the line, but here's the two most important ones. First, it drastically goes down because news"
4020.48,4024.98," organizations are forced to reduce complexity of their stories. This is true because, as we've"
4024.98,4027.46," explained, they have less time to go in depth"
4027.46,4030.46, because they have to show both sides and time is limited.
4030.84,4036.28," But second, as we've told you, when governments are determining what is nationally important,"
4036.5,4039.86," things that are inevitably deprioritized are things like minority stories,"
4039.86,4043.52, are things like tailor-made news to your regional and local communities.
4043.98,4045.36, Why is this so important
4045.36,4051.2," in this debate? By proposition's metric itself, the purpose of media is to inform you such that"
4051.2,4056.48," you can maximize agency. Fundamentally, at the point at which they drastically reduce the quality"
4056.48,4061.76," of news, they lose by virtue of their own metric and they reduce the capability for that. But on"
4061.76,4065.02," the second clash, I want to note that winning the first plash in and"
4065.02,4069.94, of itself offers us a massive independent path to victory. But I'm going to prove this plash
4069.94,4075.18," for the fun of it. First, polarization and influence over the news. Let's make one thing"
4075.18,4079.7," clear. As we've told you down the line and goes completely unengaged with, they force sexism,"
4079.7,4090.1," they force racism, and they force transphobia into the mainstream, where people like Ben Shapiro and the most fringe elements in society are now put on national TV and given platforms."
4090.1,4095.0, That is terrible because it allows them to spread their messaging and further indoctrinate people.
4095.3,4102.76," But second, as we've told you since first itself, and Karthik makes a very big deal out of in his argument, proposition hates Alex Jones."
4103.02,4105.28, They literally in first proposition tell you that
4105.28,4110.28, this is the worst impact in this round however they force people into it because of the point
4110.28,4115.18, at which you think your media is no longer a safe space for you because as a very conservative
4115.18,4121.24, redneck person in rural texas all you see now on cnn are sure the people you like but are also
4121.24,4125.28, bernie sanders and aoc that's when you move away from fox news that's
4125.28,4131.38, when you move into worse unregulated alternatives that both sides agree are terrible but third we
4131.38,4137.6, think that we think that governments are now able to shut down criticism even in the western liberal
4137.6,4142.92, democracies that uganda likes to make this debate about we saw what nixon did we saw what jfk did
4142.92,4145.02," this is so much worse for developing nations,"
4145.12,4149.38, and what this creates on their side of the house is a chilling effect that is crucially just
4149.38,4153.96," terrible. At the end of this round, Speaker, we won both important clashes in this round."
4154.34,4158.8," They narrowed their impact down to only WLBs, 5% of the international population,"
4158.98,4162.66, and literally the most privileged people. Our case accounted for the most vulnerable.
4163.16,4169.52," But second, they spent so much time rebut everybody that freedom of press needs to have a limit. But from first, we never disagreed. We"
4169.52,4174.1, supported those limits as well. What we didn't support was their overreach. You can't have a
4174.1,4179.2," fair media without a free media. But if you'd like to tip the scales, tip them in favor of Team India,"
4179.52,4191.64, oppose. all right thank the speaker for that speech checking if the panel is ready
4191.64,4196.88, all right to conclude this debate for site proposition and the run as a whole
4196.88,4218.0, can we have the reply speaker of the proposition I have a small communication.
4218.0,4220.0, I'm going to do reply.
4220.0,4226.08," Yes, first I'm going to reply to Rima Muhammad."
4228.16,4228.94, So is it okay to start my speech now?
4234.78,4234.96," Sorry, can I refrain? Are you switching the speakers as giving the reply or no?"
4237.76,4239.26," Okay, yeah. Feel free to contact us. You can start with a bit of video."
4246.0,4254.0," Okay, so my name is Rima Muhammad. I'm going to start my speech in 321 panel. If you continue to preach one narrative in a society over and over again, it creates a cult of people who oppose the other views that come about."
4254.0,4259.0, We affirm this motion panel. We believe that televisions have an incentive to get viewership right.
4259.0,4263.0, So basically we still have equality of representation on our side of the house.
4263.0,4269.68," Well, we tell you that television will actually implement people right they'll bring people of opposing views who"
4269.68,4275.44, actually are liked by people to actually increase their viewership so any points of side negative on
4275.44,4280.32, this view actually fall out on this debate today as came in the first speech right panel secondly
4280.32,4284.56, let's move on to diversity which side of the house has more diversity it's actually more on our side
4284.56,4309.28," because we accept and we make people actually bring both views on that table, right? We bring both views, other than the negative side, which actually is current status quo, which actually brings one side of the view and preaches it over and over again. But for us, we'd rather actually bring more, as it's preached on our side of the house right panel on the issue of minorities right panel we tell you that this has actually been preached from past speech where you actually only preach one view"
4309.28,4314.64, right minorities only come about when people are extremists and extremely extremism comes about
4314.64,4318.8, when like you preach only one view to people right and those people buy into that view right
4318.8,4323.44, we hate abortion right we buy into that view right we continue buying into that so we start making
4323.44,4328.88, those people are both minorities right it only comes about in those particular instances that's what we may
4328.88,4333.6, get on our side of the house right panel moving on right now they come and tell us that well no one
4333.6,4337.84, wants to watch the news again but when we come and tell you that people have already lost trust in
4337.84,4342.96, youth currently right on status quo in their world over on their side of the house right trust was
4342.96,4348.72, lost because people do not have accountability right and when the fairness doctrine was there first in the us that's when
4348.72,4352.96, people actually had the most trust in the media right so panel we're looking for a way to actually
4352.96,4357.6, get more trust in this media when we implement this kind of fairness doctrine right kind of
4357.6,4362.72, moving on right i know we have to understand that majority of the people actually find this media a
4362.72,4367.0," capitalist right that people from outside which is preached from first speech, right?"
4367.0,4374.0," So Pano, when they fund this media, right? If I'm an old company and I fund this media, they are more inclined to preach more on oil, right?"
4374.0,4379.0," Oil is good than bringing out the bad things of oil, which actually leads to lack of information to people,"
4379.0,4383.0, which is a world that we don't want aside of humanity as it's preached from our first speech.
4383.0,4385.5," Moving on Pano, we come and tell you"
4385.5,4388.58, that we frame out ideas of toxic racism.
4388.58,4390.98," Pano, I come and frame to you that these things actually"
4390.98,4393.98," being worked upon on status quo, the things that we want"
4393.98,4396.08, to actually have in our society debated
4396.08,4397.98," upon, alternative views that do not"
4397.98,4400.46," lead to harm of people, which is not terrorism."
4400.46,4401.54, We do not want terrorism.
4401.54,4403.76, This is framed out from our first speech.
4403.76,4408.56," Pano, we come and tell you that we want military expenditure right policy making those are the kinds of things you"
4408.56,4414.24, want to have controversial views upon right panel moving on to what we actually bring to you in our
4414.24,4418.24, side of the house right panel we come and tell you why governments need to intervene in media in this
4418.24,4422.8, social polarization right why we show you why we actually focus on broadcast media right and like
4422.8,4428.24, how social media actually gets news from broadcast media so when you tackle broadcast media this big broadcast media
4428.24,4434.8, can actually solve the whole issue of socially of media induced social polarization right which is
4434.8,4439.92, then tackled by side negative panel let me tell you that we focus this debate on liberal democracy
4439.92,4444.96, but not necessarily western liberal democracies which was a clear misinterpretation that was
4444.96,4446.9, brought about by side negative.
4446.9,4452.9," But finally, moving on, we tell you the effects of capitalism on big media, whether they finance and they preach their views to this big media."
4452.9,4456.6, We come and tell you our trade off strike. I know I will tell you free speech.
4456.6,4460.94, We come and tell you things about how government actually might actually come and intervene.
4460.94,4467.84," Well, we show you that the government's role, right, they have a role to actually look out for their citizens due to their social contract secondly we show you how they"
4467.84,4472.16, would want to actually be voted in too far which i say is better because there are more push actually
4472.16,4476.64, carry out this policy help the citizens on the side or say negative we actually just leave the
4476.64,4481.36, media to do whatever they want and they are like held accountable at this particular case scenario
4481.36,4485.28, right panel we like debate that's why we are debating here right
4485.28,4490.0, debate is a very healthy thing in society and we wouldn't be seated here right now if we actually
4490.0,4494.64, oppose debate that's why we are from this motion because we come and bring to you both youth and
4494.64,4500.56, you decide that the way to judge for us today thank you very much all right i thank the speaker
4500.56,4506.34," for that speech and i thank all six speakers for this debate uh, I'll ask everyone to cross the floor and shake hands,"
4506.4,4507.68, but we are all in different parts of the world.
4508.08,4511.6, So I'm going to ask everyone to use the clapping hand emoji reaction on Zoom
4511.6,4514.68, to give everyone a round of applause for a good job well done.
4515.14,4518.92," It was an enjoyable debate, and I'm sure we'll have a good time discussing it."
4518.92,4519.92, So I'm going to...
4521.9,4522.76, Okay.
4523.18,4523.44, All right.
4523.54,4526.64," So firstly, let me just say on behalf of the panel that we thank everyone"
4526.64,4531.54, for this debate. This was a very rich motion. We saw examples from a range of different
4531.54,4535.96," countries across different time periods, and we're very impressed and also quite happy"
4535.96,4540.64," actually that teams did do their research for a prepared motion in what was, I think,"
4540.64,4545.12," not a very easy motion to deal with, and we offer a heartiest congratulations to teams"
4545.12,4550.72, for that in that sense uh we did like this debate and ultimately after confro we did come into a
4550.72,4556.88, unanimous decision in favor for the opposition so that's a 3-0 win to india congratulations and
4556.88,4561.76, commiserations to team uganda the way i'm going to explain this call is through the categories of
4561.76,4568.08," style content and strategy i'll spend less time on style, although I will make one very important point on style and we'll talk"
4568.08,4572.2," about that, perhaps more in personal feedback afterwards. More time will be spent on content"
4572.2,4576.6," and strategy because that's where the debate primarily took place. So on style, there's"
4576.6,4581.74," really only one point and I will note that for some judges, style was a point that really"
4581.74,4587.4, mattered for the margin in the debate. we will note that there is a difference between an aggressive style
4587.4,4590.66, and a style that comes across as rude and dismissive.
4591.0,4593.16," So saying things like, for example, and here I'm quoting,"
4593.6,4598.74," prove for the fun of it, or claiming that a certain team is scared of certain things"
4598.74,4601.72, can come across as rude and at times dismissive.
4601.94,4609.84, So we would urge speakers to be a little bit more careful with their choice of diction as well as their word choice because uh we want to it perfectly fine
4609.84,4614.64, to be aggressive but we want to make sure that we are doing so in a polite manner that doesn't
4614.64,4620.96, cause you know other speakers perhaps to feel a little bit um hurt or offended by certain uh
4620.96,4624.4, matters we can talk about this in personal feedback afterwards i believe the speakers
4624.4,4629.04, know who they are and we can talk about that in personal feedback afterwards. The way in which
4629.04,4634.04, this debate came down to primarily was in three questions and here I'm going to combine a content
4634.04,4638.58, and strategy together. The first question that we needed to ask as a panel was the question of
4638.58,4644.16, should the government intervene in this matter? So is there a principal necessity for the government
4644.16,4646.1, to step in to regulate the media
4646.1,4648.24, in a way through the mechanism of
4648.24,4650.02, a fairness doctrine? We will note
4650.02,4651.96, at the onset that both teams in this debate
4651.96,4654.08, agree that hate speech laws do
4654.08,4656.02, exist. We will also note as well
4656.02,4658.34, that the opposition's call-out
4658.34,4660.04, of the proposition set up of this
4660.04,4661.68, being only in Western liberal democracies
4661.68,4664.02, isn't necessarily true in as much as the
4664.02,4668.74, P1 set up was in liberal democracies but we will note that the context didn't really matter
4668.74,4673.26," in as much as both teams were using examples from the US to a large extent, so we don't"
4673.26,4676.64, think that the context battle really mattered much in the debate as they hoped.
4676.64,4678.36, How do we look at this issue then?
4678.36,4681.8, The proposition in this debate we felt sets up a fair principle.
4681.8,4685.64, They suggest that governments owe an obligation to people to protect
4685.64,4687.4, them from the harms of extremism
4687.4,4688.46, and radicalization.
4688.94,4690.14, They have a principle...
4690.14,4693.18," Yes, Tim Uganda, sorry."
4696.48,4696.82, Sorry.
4700.4,4701.5," Okay, in that case,"
4701.54,4702.66, I'm just going to continue because
4702.66,4704.22, that might have been a misclick.
4704.72,4709.04," As I was saying, we felt that the propositions does set up a very fair principle in this debate,"
4709.18,4715.5," arguing that governments owe obligations to protect the citizens from things like extremism, radicalization,"
4715.96,4718.18," as well as to make things fair, generally speaking."
4718.88,4730.08," The main issue that the panel felt, however, was that there was quite little mechanism provided for this so things that we were looking for for instance were things like why through the specific mechanism of a fairness"
4730.08,4736.72, doctrine i think what the proposition was able to prove was the suggestion that says that a fairness
4736.72,4743.36, doctrine allows for us to achieve certain outcomes like for example um get more news coming into the
4743.36,4746.0, picture and we will discuss this in a second issue afterwards.
4746.0,4753.0," But I think at least at this onset, it's not particularly clear why through this specific mechanism of defender's doctrine."
4753.0,4757.0, And this is something that needs to be considered in comparison to the opposition.
4757.0,4763.0," The opposition, we thought, gave us broadly two lines of material here that we did credit as responses."
4763.0,4765.84, The first thing that the opposition does was to
4765.84,4770.64, kind of challenge the problem setup of the proposition so the proposition's problem set
4770.64,4776.08, up here was really that people are only looking at one piece of news and this creates echo chambers
4776.08,4780.96, and then therefore that becomes a problem because that creates extremism and radicalization the
4780.96,4785.0, opposition challenges this by suggesting that there are existing status quo incentives.
4785.0,4794.0," One, for example, if you're a large news corporation, you have an incentive to moderate towards the moderate because that's how you catch the most amount of viewers."
4794.0,4805.56," We also felt they were able to demonstrate that there was a variety of people or spectrum of people that watch the news and that the people who were already aligned to a certain political view may not change necessarily,"
4806.0,4811.44, whereas the individuals who are not aligned to the view are the ones that are likely to change in this debate.
4811.44,4815.76, So we did think that there was an added spectrum of analysis here provided by the opposition
4815.76,4820.24, that we didn't feel that the proposition was able to address adequately in this debate.
4820.64,4830.42, There was a second line as well that came from the opposition. There's this idea that this is an overreach of government autonomy that infringes upon the editorial agency of news
4830.42,4835.28, networks because this gives governments too much power in making the news. They can define what is
4835.28,4839.72, newsworthy and what isn't newsworthy and therefore you can use that to do things like avoid
4839.72,4845.0, accountability and here they gave us three examples to the US for doing this. I think at the overall
4845.0,4849.5," evaluation of this question of should the government intervene, the panel felt unanimously"
4849.5,4856.48, that the proposition managed to demonstrate that there was perhaps a reason for us to believe that
4856.48,4861.6, the governments maybe should intervene but we felt that the proposition wasn't able to prove
4861.6,4865.5, the reason for that in as much as we felt that the material
4865.5,4866.76, itself wasn't fully mechanized.
4866.76,4871.72," Comparatively, we felt that the opposition was able to cast enough doubt on the principle"
4871.72,4875.18, and therefore we felt this issue went to the proposition.
4875.18,4879.22," The second issue which was, I think, where again most of the debate took place in, was"
4879.22,4882.32, an equation of quality of information and informed decision making.
4882.32,4889.68," We will note that from Prop 2 onwards, a lot of the debate then became a question about which side of the House is able to achieve better decision-making"
4889.68,4894.76, because both teams in this debate wanted to get more news out to the people and the argument
4894.76,4900.34," coming from Proposition was that with more news, you will be able to get more informed decision-making"
4900.34,4904.64," and that therefore was a benefit. Over here, we will note that the Proposition does aid,"
4905.08,4909.62," we would say, a setup of the status quo. It suggests that in the status quo, there is only"
4909.62,4914.34, one narrative that's being set up by the news. This is bad because this means that individuals
4914.34,4918.92," feel that they are not addressed and they will go to alternative media, which is worse because"
4918.92,4924.48," these have fake news and conspiracy theories and that leads to radicalization, which results"
4924.48,4926.12, therefore in less informed
4926.12,4926.78, decision-making.
4927.24,4931.52," The comparative that we get on proposition, then, is that in as much as there's a fairness"
4931.52,4935.88," doctrine, you are now able to have both sides of the story that's presented in the news."
4936.2,4940.86, This is comparatively better because this allows for things like debates between individuals
4940.86,4945.04, that allows for more people to see the news that is there.
4949.2,4951.34, The main challenge that we get from this coming up from the opposition was really on two levels.
4951.78,4954.82, The first level of response that we get from them is this idea that
4954.82,4958.66," but now you will need to force individuals like anti-vaxxers,"
4958.8,4960.7, climate change deniers to also get onto the news.
4960.7,4965.68, We have this quibble over whether you will get the character like what is
4965.68,4971.34, essentially the caricature of the individuals or will you get like say other or will you get the
4971.34,4975.46, experts to do this the prop suggests that is the experts the ops says as caricatures is not very
4975.46,4980.7, clear which characterization is stronger here but what we did get from this particular challenge
4980.7,4988.66, however was a challenge that suggested that maybe the debates that the proposition wanted may not necessarily be the debates that lead to better informed
4988.66,4989.66, decision making.
4989.66,4994.76," And therefore, we felt that in that sense, we weren't quite clear how much credit we"
4994.76,4999.12, have given to the argument that more news equals more informed decision making.
4999.12,5010.08," There was a second challenge as well, which suggests that the proposition will lose access to minority stories and lose access to investigative journalism these came"
5010.08,5015.52, out in the old one as well as in as well as in the o2 we generally felt that these materials were
5015.52,5021.04, very well mechanized and perhaps weren't adequately addressed by the proposition in that sense so at
5021.04,5029.82," the conclusion of the second issue of quality of information and informed decision making, the panel felt that the proposition was able to demonstrate that they were able to get"
5029.82,5035.44, more news in general. But it's not particularly clear whether more news would necessarily lead
5035.44,5041.18," therefore to more informed decision making, which is an added logical step that needed to be done"
5041.18,5048.28," for the impact of the argument to be derived as a result. We felt comparatively that the opposition was able to challenge that missing link,"
5048.56,5052.42," and in as much as that was done, we didn't think that the proposition was therefore able to claim"
5052.42,5057.1, the benefit they wanted to get. The last point is a point about capitalism at the news. We would
5057.1,5061.6, say this is a smaller point because this is a point that came up in first proposition. It didn't
5061.6,5069.2," come up very clearly in the second speech, came up a lot more clearly in the third speech, and then didn't come up very much in the reply speech. So we found at this"
5069.2,5074.4," point, generally speaking, was a point that the proposition wins quite handily in as much as the"
5074.4,5078.28," opposition doesn't do a particularly good job of responding to the argument, which is really this"
5078.28,5083.46, idea that corporate incentives guide the news and therefore the news reduce narratives in a certain
5083.46,5088.72," particular way. But in as much as this material wasn't given enough attention in the debate by the team,"
5088.8,5092.76," so for example, it wasn't brought up repeatedly in the round to remind us of its importance,"
5093.06,5097.94, the panel didn't really know to what extent we can give this argument full credit and full weightage.
5098.32,5102.86," And therefore, we felt that this particular issue wasn't one that determined the result as a whole."
5103.24,5106.28," So that's why in the areas of content and strategy,"
5106.42,5107.86," because I talked a little bit here about responses,"
5108.18,5109.26," external responses as well,"
5109.52,5112.04, we felt that the opposition was also a hit as a whole.
5112.48,5115.2, I see messages from the Org.com that the Zoom may be reset.
5115.52,5117.12," So maybe what I would suggest is,"
5117.5,5120.12," given that we cannot do feedback in two minutes,"
5120.12,5124.02," that maybe we can address urgent questions now,"
5124.42,5126.16, and if we can do personal feedback via Discord
5126.16,5127.94, and the coaches can feel free to text us
5127.94,5129.3, via whatever means possible.
5129.76,5131.46," Yeah, so if there are any questions about the call,"
5131.82,5132.9, please feel free to ask them now
5132.9,5133.86, before they shut down the Zoom.
5136.14,5138.28," Yeah, also just before questions,"
5138.36,5140.48, I'd just like to say I'm super sorry to ping you again.
