0.0,2.0," Okay, let's begin with introductions."
2.0,4.0," Yeah, let's begin with introductions."
4.0,6.0," Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek. I'll be your chair for this round."
6.0,10.0," Preferred to pronounce he, they'll prefer if you refer the panel as a collective."
10.0,16.0, I'll now ask my panelists to introduce themselves and order listed in tab.
16.0,22.0," Hi, I'm Alexander. They, them."
22.0,37.16," Yep. Hi everyone. I am Dilla. Samuel Kudusi, I'm the panelist for this round."
37.16,42.24," My personal preference is he, him, they, them, but I prefer to refer to the panel as a whole."
42.24,44.16," That's it, good luck for the round."
44.16,46.32," Sure, that's it good luck for the round sure uh that's wonderful uh"
46.32,50.32, i now i now invite the teams to introduce themselves and state the speaker orders
50.32,51.44, sudden side proposition
55.92,67.24," might as well first he may my speaking second number five next speaking third, he, him, please."
68.1,70.36, And team up.
75.56,78.24," Hello, my name is Vinayak Menon. Pronouns are he, him. I'm going to be giving the one and the reply."
80.08,81.18," Hi, I'm Abby. I'm the two."
94.0,134.8," Hi everyone, I'm Miles. PronounsE-M. I'll be doing the three. It's wonderful. Some housekeeping before we begin. Please time yourself. Okay, we have a volunteer here. So volunteer, you're also maintaining time. No notice beyond 8.15. B, I heavily request all teams to take POIs. They're highly encouraged. And please set your POI preference before beginning your speech. That being said and on my prime minister When Neil Parrish, an MP in England, was exposed for watching pornography in the House of Commons"
134.8,139.52," a couple of months ago, he refused to resign and vowed to stay in Parliament. If it hadn't been"
139.52,147.04," for the existence of this policy, he would have remained in power for years upon years. Democracy without this policy is hypocrisy."
147.04,148.48, Proud to propose.
148.48,149.52, How does this work?
149.52,152.64, We believe this is going to work the same way it does in the UK right now.
152.64,155.28, A recall petition can be signed by constituents.
155.28,159.12," If this petition meets a minimum significant threshold, probably around 20%,"
159.12,162.0," if it's a figure we're willing to adjust, an election is held."
162.0,165.26," The politician is allowed to stand again if they wish, and if they"
165.26,169.68," win this election, they're secure for a reasonable period of time so that the opposition party cannot"
169.68,175.0," gain this system. To be clear, we will set this rate as we currently do in the United Kingdom."
175.42,180.94," That is to say, we will achieve a good trade-off between stability and accountability. We're not"
180.94,184.8," going to replace them every single day, but we will give voters a reasonable chance to might"
184.8,186.38," push people out. When will these recalls, but we will give voters a reasonable chance to unite to push people out."
186.38,188.28, When will these recalls take place?
188.28,190.08, We think voters are reasonable people.
190.08,193.38, It's unlikely going to be when politicians legitimately change their stance because of
193.38,194.38, new situations.
194.38,196.52, We think it's going to happen in two cases.
196.52,200.74," One when new relevant information comes out about politicians, maybe for example, large"
200.74,204.3, scandals that large numbers of people in the constituency can unite against.
204.3,208.4, But also when elected officials start putting their personal interests in front of everyone else
208.4,212.88, we need to come to lobbying instead of protecting the interests for example over fulfilling
212.88,217.12, promises i want to bring two arguments first principal claim as to why we need this so thank
217.12,221.04, you for democracy second of all as to why politicians make better decisions and my partner
221.04,227.04," is going to explain to you why ultimately we hugely increase engagement in democracy, a way for us to win on its own."
227.04,232.32," First on democracy, the first sub-point here is that there are principled non-utilitarian"
232.32,235.88, reasons why we have democracy in as many cases as possible.
235.88,236.88, They're twofold.
236.88,239.7," One, there's no inherently good political decision."
239.7,243.92," All policies are based off subjective priorities, which means people should be able to pick"
243.92,248.96, a representative who aligns with those priorities. Opposition cannot win this debate by saying
248.96,252.96," people might vote in these elections for bad or short-term reasons, because individuals"
252.96,257.76," are legitimate in choosing the reasons for which they vote. Second of all, more broadly,"
257.76,261.28," no thank you, individuals are coerced by the state. In the short term and long run, we"
261.28,264.8, are at the whims of politicians. We cannot replace them for years and years. They can
264.8,266.98," take our money, they can imprison us or conscript us."
267.2,271.86, The consequence of this monopoly of power means that individuals have the right to the
271.86,276.8, greatest possible input to the decisions of the state because the state has absolute power
276.8,277.3, over us.
277.58,278.16, That's important.
278.44,279.44, Greatest possible input.
279.94,284.78," Second subplash, when do we restrict democracy and why is this not one of those cases?"
285.24,286.3," Two things here. First of all, we restrict democracy and why is this not one of those cases? Two things here."
286.3,287.9," First of all, we restrict democracy"
287.9,289.84, when there's insufficient accessible information
289.84,290.68, to the public.
290.68,293.6," So for example, central banks, but that's not true here."
293.6,295.28, We think there's likely going to be a large amount
295.28,297.64," of local news coverage, given this represents"
297.64,300.48, a potential local political shift that is quite relevant.
300.48,302.76, We also think there's gonna be local campaigning
302.76,304.8, who's like the ruling politician wants to win.
304.8,307.08," So there's gonna to be local campaigning, campaigning, he's like the ruling politician wants to win. So there's going to be available accessible information."
307.08,312.78, The second reason why we might restrict democracy is when democracy is either completely practically
312.78,317.82, impossible or when it is overwhelmingly likely to destroy the functioning of government.
317.82,321.82, So this is why we don't have people vote on every single issue whenever they come up.
321.82,324.38, This is why we don't have a general election every day.
324.38,326.2, So it might result in like a complete shift
326.2,327.2," of overall policies,"
327.2,329.3, which might destabilize the whole country.
329.3,331.9, This is not true here for two reasons.
331.9,334.8," One, there's a reasonably high burden to be fulfilled"
334.8,336.4, before an election is triggered.
336.4,339.1," That is to say, you have to make a significant proportion"
339.1,341.82, of your electorate angry enough to get off the couch
341.82,343.32, and petition for you to leave.
343.32,348.0," Second of all, we aren't supporting a complete change and destabilization of the entire system."
348.0,352.0," We are supporting throwing away taxes, foreign relations, criminal justice and placing it overnight."
352.0,357.0, We are supporting in certain cases changing individual components.
357.0,366.0," So thank you, the system. Next up, why is there a active obligation to implement this policy to let local constituents update their preferences?"
366.0,375.0," One, the greatest priority of the politician should be towards their local constituent, because these were the people who elected them, not the party and not the rest of the country."
375.0,386.02," Two, representation should take into account the possibility that information, priorities, or the behavior of politicians changes, because expression and representation is not"
386.02,387.04, a static concept.
387.04,390.08, It's something they do for you differently every single day.
390.08,392.88, This principle is the most important thing in the debate.
392.88,396.08, Democracy comes before utilitarian outcomes.
396.08,398.3," We don't let people above a certain IQ vote,"
398.3,399.6, and no one else can vote.
399.6,401.6, Even that means everyone is helped.
401.6,403.52, What we have proven here is that voters
403.52,405.82," can make an informed, justified decision that"
405.82,409.2," does not actively cripple the functioning of government, which means we should give"
409.2,410.2, them this choice.
410.2,414.22, Take a few more if there is one.
414.22,419.02," Many policies are exceedingly unpopular in the short term, like COVID walk downs, but"
419.02,421.02, have good results in the long term.
421.02,424.46," Because of your first characteristics, where if it's too technical that you should have"
424.46,428.48," restrictions on democracies, why do you support the revoking of politicians on these"
428.48,432.08, how on earth is there insufficient information here the politician goes to people and says
432.08,436.24, this is bad in the short term but by the way it helps us in the long term voters can understand
436.24,440.24, that this is going to help them in the long term if you have a quarantine right also if people want
440.24,444.8, to vote on short-term decisions if like i need money i need a job in the short term that's a
444.8,446.6, legitimate reason to vote.
446.6,447.68," Okay, second of all,"
447.68,449.92, why do politicians make better decisions?
449.92,452.0, The problem with status quo is that increasingly
452.0,454.32, politicians are failing to represent people
454.32,456.44, and fulfill the promises they have made.
456.44,458.36," First, the rise of populism means"
458.36,459.8, there has been a race to the bottom
459.8,462.72, where both sides make extravagant promises that aren't kept
462.72,464.52, so that they can gain the high ground.
464.52,468.58," Second, throughout history, the lobbying and influence of backdoor party negotiations"
468.58,474.22," gives politicians incentives to be unrepresented. To be clear, the reason for this lack of"
474.22,479.08," accountability is the system of general elections, which ought must support, for three reasons."
479.44,484.24," One, the fact that once the general election is reached, so much time has passed since the"
484.24,485.18, relevant scandal
485.18,486.08, with the bad decision.
486.08,488.76, The media cycle is much shorter than the election cycle.
488.76,491.68," And often individuals do have short attention spans,"
491.68,494.58, which means politicians can brush things under the rug.
494.58,496.34," Second of all, during a general election,"
496.34,497.94, there's always less attention to them
497.94,499.32, on individual candidates.
499.32,501.26, There's a focus on national candidates
501.26,503.4, because there's a perception it has higher stakes.
503.4,504.76," During a general election,"
504.76,509.76, the white noise draws people's attention away from the merits of their particular candidate
509.76,514.64," and towards the entire country. Finally, in national elections, often they're overshadowed"
514.64,519.28," by short-term recent events that consume huge amounts of media time. Look at how, for example,"
519.28,524.16," Macron got a massive boost at the last election with his response to Ukraine, which dominated all"
524.16,526.44, the other scandals that might have happened before.
526.72,529.72, Why do we massively solve this lack of accountability?
529.92,533.36, Politicians now have to worry that they will be voted out during the period.
533.52,535.28, They can't ride on the back of their party.
535.28,539.12, They can't rely on politicians on the memory not being entirely fresh.
539.24,541.6, They can't rely on the information being poor.
541.8,544.88," Therefore, we believe individuals have far better incentives."
546.08,550.56," Why? Finally, why does this change the way politicians act much for the better? First of all,"
550.56,554.64, they're far less likely to engage in the worst kind of scandals and corruption. We change the
554.64,559.28," mental calculus of politicians. On both sides, there are contentations to do bad things. Sex"
559.28,563.52," scandals, being involved in lobbying, taking dirty money. Now the risk of getting involved"
563.52,569.52," with a potential scandal becomes infinitely higher. If you accept some bad money or meet private donors in a dodgy way,"
569.52,574.16," on the upside, your constituency might be annoyed in the long, in the short run, but you know in the"
574.16,579.36, long run you're exceedingly unlikely to be removed for the three reasons we gave you. But we think
579.36,583.84," these scandals are absolutely crucial. They damage trust in politics, but they skew politics towards"
583.84,587.84," the richest people in the world, and we think ultimately that is enough for us to win."
587.84,592.32," But additionally, we think politicians' promises become far better. Their promises are far more"
592.32,597.52," likely to be rooted in reality during campaigning, as opposed to policies that they might not put in."
597.52,601.84," For example, a local MP will no longer attract voters simply by saying, oh, we're going to build"
601.84,605.48," all these schools, even when he knows he might not be able to do so."
605.48,609.52, He might either make a more realistic promise or actually more aggressively try and get
609.52,610.52, that promise fulfilled.
610.52,615.48, This is crucial because it gives the voters a realistic view of what the politician will
615.48,616.48, offer them.
616.48,619.04," And if voters don't know what their politicians are going to offer them, which they don't"
619.04,630.48," on op side, then ultimately democracy without the policy is hypocrisy, what Kautu would propose."
632.16,657.44," I'll thank the speaker for the fine remarks, and I perfectly audible?"
659.02,659.58, Awesome.
659.58,662.74," And I prefer my POIs verbally, so please just unmute yourself."
664.46,667.94," Unfortunately for them, the burden on side proposition was quite high."
668.22,672.38," What they had to prove to you was not only that we needed representation and we needed democracy,"
672.8,680.28," they had to prove to you why we uniquely needed another election on top of the election that happens every four to six years,"
680.28,685.0, and why existing mechanisms were deficient to allow the level of accountability to hold
685.0,689.52, politicians accountable and prevent them from doing the worst kinds of abuses. I listened to
689.52,694.42," their entire speech, and I have no idea why current elections can't solve back for the same problems"
694.42,698.6," they talk about, the scandals, the political mismanagement. I think that politicians want"
698.6,702.8," power, and they want to retain their power. So there's no reasons why the normal election"
702.8,705.18, does not solve. They did not fulfill that
705.18,709.56," burden. Therefore, they lose this round. I'm going to respond to my opponent's arguments and forward"
709.56,714.74," two substantive arguments. Before that, some clarifications. I want to note that even though"
714.74,719.7," elections do happen in four to six years, that two things are critical. Number one, that recall"
719.7,724.04, elections occur in times that are less than a normal election. So they take several months as
724.04,728.82, opposed to the very long duration that occurs prior to an election. But I also want to note that in the
728.82,734.0," interim between elections, there are checkbacks against elected officials. In the best case,"
734.06,738.6, this looks like midterm elections or provincial and state elections that restrict the executive
738.6,743.32," power of major politicians. But secondly, in the worst case that corruption, black money,"
743.32,749.0," and scandals occurs, there were impeachment proceedings that occurred where the legislature or like certain lawyers"
749.0,752.68, could litigate against politicians and prevent them from doing these kind of high crimes.
752.98,757.44," And finally, we felt like if politicians internally felt like the entire country was against them,"
757.64,762.12," they were more likely to resign, which is what Boris Johnson did and what Nixon did. So I want"
762.12,767.92," to note that even if there are elections in four to six years, there are internal mechanisms that exist that solve back for these kinds of problems."
768.34,771.76, Moving on to their material. The first thing that they gave us was a principle. They gave us two
771.76,776.0," lines of analysis. First, they told you that things are subjective and therefore people need"
776.0,780.3," to have their interests being met. Again, people can already vote in normal elections and have"
780.3,787.04," their preferences being heard. Next, they tell you that people are held at the whims of politicians and they can be imprisoned"
787.04,788.62, and there's a monopoly over power.
788.62,791.54," First of all, I argue that people have other forms of input"
791.54,793.76," that they can use, such as protests, petitions,"
793.76,796.04," and lobbying, so there are mechanisms for voters"
796.04,797.5, to leverage over the government.
797.5,799.88," And second of all, we don't live in an autocratic country"
799.88,801.3," where there's no civil liberties,"
801.3,803.18, where executives and elected officials
803.18,805.16, have absolute power over individuals.
805.74,810.98," Next, they tell you that right now there has to be a high burden in order for their principle to occur."
810.98,817.0," But in their framing, they don't give us a high burden. They tell you it's just 20 percent of the population that has to agree for a petition."
817.34,832.0," So I'll explain why it's actually very easy for fringe and extremist groups to get small subsections of the population to rally around for these kind of recall elections. Next they claim the next claim they give to you is about how they get better, like, like policies right first of all they tell you that there's white"
832.0,849.66," noise and there's distractions. I don't think there actually is white noise, because politics politics is always a competition. So even if politicians want to distract people there are opposing groups that remind the populace of the failures of the existing government. Competition salts back. Second of all, I would argue that, again, people"
849.66,854.32, are unlikely to do things like scandals and corruption insofar as they want to get reelected.
854.6,858.64, First substantive then is how they actually get worse policy. The problem on their side of the
858.64,863.98, house is that politicians will pass very flashy short-term policy in order to keep their approval
863.98,865.34, ratings high instead of rallying for long-term gains. order to keep their approval ratings high instead of
865.34,870.48," rallying for long-term gains. This is bad for two reasons. First of all, short-term policies tend to"
870.48,875.58, be very detrimental. They tend to look things like tax cuts or things like the demonetization policy
875.58,881.12, that Modi passed in 2014. These have short-term gains. They're very flashy and people generally
881.12,889.62," support them, but in the long-term, they tend to have much larger effects on the economy. Second, I want to note that the important ambitious policies like land"
889.62,895.46," redistribution, like major levels of healthcare reform are unlikely to happen on their side of"
895.46,899.86, the house because politicians realize that they need short-term popularity. They are not going
899.86,905.24," to push for these long-term gains that may not be successful in two years, but may be successful"
905.24,909.58," in four to six years. I think this is very critical because on our side of the house,"
909.68,913.18," we get long-term policies being passed that occur within the four to six times,"
913.46,918.32, four to six timeframe of an actual election. These end up getting neglected on their side
918.32,922.52, of the house. Also what happens on their side of the house is that politicians don't do things
922.52,925.04, that are unpopular but incredibly
925.04,930.14," important. As Miles points out to you, politicians are unlikely to do things like COVID-19 lockdowns"
930.14,933.58," that in the short term will cause people to lose their jobs, will restrict their movement"
933.58,938.02," and their liberties, but in the long term will reduce things like COVID-19 and healthcare"
938.02,942.38," problems. I want to note that on their side of the house, recall elections are very likely"
942.38,946.82, because opposition groups are likely to call for a recall whenever things go down.
946.82,952.06," So anytime there's a downturn in popularity, anytime there's a disadvantage, opposition"
952.06,956.02, groups are likely to seize on this opportunity and turn it against the incumbent.
956.02,958.08, That's the reason why they push worse policies.
958.08,961.24," Before I move on to my second substantive argument, I can take a point if there is one."
961.24,969.12, Who are the better group to determine whether someone should be replaced? Your other friends in the party who have known you since college or the people who truly
969.12,973.56," voted you in in the first place? Okay, the people who still voted you in still matter because in"
973.56,977.62, four years you need to get re-elected. Those people also matter because there's other forms
977.62,982.0," of check back that exist. So for example, if I'm like a really crazy president but I ended up losing"
982.0,989.52," my senate in my house because I'm passing terrible policies, that still restricts my power. I want to note that the other checkbacks that we noted"
989.52,992.98, to you in our counter model still create positive incentives for people to do good things.
993.36,998.18, Second substantive argument is how we get a worse campaigning process. I want to note that constant
998.18,1002.42," election cycles lead to worse, more radical candidates that are even worse than the current"
1002.42,1005.44, officials. The first layer is how we get worse electoral outcomes.
1005.78,1009.0," In the status quo, there's a cyclical nature of elections,"
1009.08,1011.1, which ensures broad voter participation.
1011.58,1013.42," So because of the way the media cycle works,"
1013.68,1016.56," people know that on November 4th or on January 1st,"
1016.56,1018.66," every four years, there's going to be an election."
1018.66,1020.76, And there's a natural buildup that occurs.
1021.06,1023.32, So people are very aware of when elections happen.
1023.64,1028.78," The problem with recall elections is that they're very sudden and irregular, meaning that people don't expect"
1028.78,1033.84," the election. That was bad for three main reasons. First of all, there's limited campaigning time and"
1033.84,1038.4, windows of elections. So people were less prepared to be ready to vote. They're probably less aware
1038.4,1043.32," of the election itself. Second of all, there's less information about the candidates. There's"
1043.32,1049.52, less likely to be things like major debates and media coverage about every single candidate that's running within the
1049.52,1053.52, timeframe of the recall election. So people are less informed when they go to the ballot box
1053.52,1058.0," and vote for someone else. Finally, there's less voter mobilization. So there's less time to do"
1058.0,1062.64, fundraising and galvanize resources so that low-income people and minorities are actually
1062.64,1069.22," coming to the polls. This is problematic because what you got on their side of the house was a tyranny of the majority, where extremist or"
1069.22,1073.96, populist group force a recall election happening because they're interested enough to sign petitions
1073.96,1079.22," and they come out to vote, while the majority of people do not come out to vote and the elections"
1079.22,1084.4, become far less representative. I want to note that representation is a critical tenant of democracy.
1084.6,1088.26, It does not matter how many elections you have if those elections do not represent
1088.26,1092.72, people's opinion. So this was a principal implication of the argument. So what kind
1092.72,1096.88, of candidates do you get on their side of the house? You get very populist candidates that run
1096.88,1101.64, on vague messages of tearing down the political establishment and tearing down this politician
1101.64,1107.0," that is so elitist that is ruining your life. That is the type of candidates that you're going to get on their side of the house,"
1107.28,1110.2, candidates that are much more populist and much more volatile.
1110.72,1114.24, Second layer is how you get a neglection of policy on their side of the house.
1114.44,1117.22," Because when you have these spontaneous recall elections happening,"
1117.44,1119.9," it's an incredible waste of time and resources,"
1119.9,1123.82, where people like Gavin Newsom during the California recall election
1123.82,1133.38, had to spend months of time during the coronavirus pandemic going out and campaigning and doing rallies instead of focusing on critical legislation that could have helped people out.
1133.58,1138.46, So there's a massive reduction in the time that people are able to spend when they have to worry about recalls.
1138.54,1141.28, And it's not just during the election. It's before the election.
1141.4,1146.0, They want to get ahead of the recall. So they're more likely to do things like campaign rallies.
1146.0,1153.0," Daniel X. Additionally, this also causes parties to do things like change priorities. So rather than focusing on legislation, they think about winning the election."
1153.0,1165.62," Daniel X. This was very problematic. It reduced the number of laws that are being passed, reforms that are being passed, so overall they get a worse government and worse representation on their side of the house. Thank you."
1166.94,1168.02," Hi, sorry to interrupt. Daniel, are you here?"
1168.02,1168.86, Can you hear me?
1177.44,1180.02," Okay, who's Daniel?"
1180.02,1181.12, Okay.
1181.12,1183.1," Yeah, you can see that Daniel is in this room."
1183.1,1184.68, That's what I wanted to check.
1184.68,1192.0," Daniel, please, if you can hear me, check out the messages I sent you here in zoom and please move to the main session."
1196.0,1203.0," Sorry about that i'd ask both judge it both the coaches if I was able to observe, but I will do that."
1203.0,1205.12, Sorry about that it's okay. Thank you.
1209.44,1211.28," Okay, I thank the speaker for the fine remarks,"
1211.28,1213.92, and I'll invite the second speaker from Said Proposition.
1219.52,1231.08," Hi, just checking everyone can hear me if I speak like this."
1234.06,1236.18, Side opposition lays out a very specific burden that we need to meet to win this debate.
1236.18,1239.36, They say we have to prove why we need this specific measure
1239.36,1241.68, and why the status quo is insufficient
1241.68,1243.8, to grant people full democracy.
1243.8,1245.5, We answered both those questions
1245.5,1250.82," pretty conclusively at first, but let me spell it out to you, Team USA. The fundamental problem"
1250.82,1256.28, with the democracies of today is that humans with an average attention span of eight seconds
1256.28,1261.34, are only allowed to choose who represents them once every four or five years. That's
1261.34,1266.56, why democracy without this policy is pure hypocrisy and we're so proud to
1266.56,1270.32, propose. I'm going to do a couple of things in this speech. First of all some responses to their
1270.32,1275.28, arguments and some rebuilding of the case they responded to completely insufficiently and finally
1275.28,1280.24, a new point as flagged in first on political engagement and why that's so important. First
1280.24,1284.96, of all some areas of rebuttal and rebuilding. What we got out of side opposition was essentially a
1284.96,1292.36, jumble of mitigation so I'm going to be very clear in laying out why we believe we've already won this debate from the outset. Five areas here.
1292.7,1308.08," First of all, on the principle, I think we laid this out pretty clearly. We explained why we need to have as much democracy as is feasible, why we only restrict it when we have insufficient information for people to make good decisions or when it's practically impossible for the running of government to do so, we explain"
1308.08,1309.56, why specifically we need it here.
1309.56,1313.16," Maxwell tells you that it's because politicians have failed at the duty, they've failed at"
1313.16,1317.88," representing their constituents of what they're elected to do, and therefore we ought to prioritise"
1317.88,1322.68, this against whatever utilitarian metric side opposition implicitly supports.
1322.68,1323.68, What's their response to this?
1323.68,1329.12," They tell us, well, we already have elections and we don't live in authoritarian states, so people are allowed to"
1329.12,1333.46," protest and petition. Frankly, I think this is completely insufficient, because the framing"
1333.46,1338.7," that Maxwell gives to you for this principle is very explicitly, we want to have as much democracy"
1338.7,1343.04, as is possible. That's why we want to have elections as frequently as possible. That's
1343.04,1348.48, why we want people to be informed all year round instead of just election funds because we think democracy is a good thing and
1348.48,1353.12, the more autonomy you can give people over their lives the better decisions they're going to make
1353.12,1357.44, the better they're able to serve their own interests no thank you so we explained to you
1357.44,1362.24, why this principle is not just about having democracy in some shape or form it's about having
1362.24,1365.2," as much democracy as we possibly can. And therefore,"
1365.2,1369.52, their mitigatory responses about how we already have elections and we already have mechanisms
1369.52,1374.64, to protect democracy were insufficient. We think we win that on this alone based on Maxwell's way
1374.64,1378.96," of the principle. But second, they tried to tell us that there were internal mechanisms that stop"
1378.96,1383.36," corruption. They say, first of all, we can have midterms, and second, we can have impeachments."
1383.36,1387.5," Again, we think these are completely insufficient because as Maxwell lays out for you, there"
1387.5,1390.72, are three clear reasons why we don't think these are sufficient.
1390.72,1394.6," First, because often by the time you reach one of these elections, a long time has passed"
1394.6,1396.6, since the relevant scandal or bad decision.
1396.6,1398.6," Second, because there's less attention on individual candidates."
1398.6,1403.64," And third, because in the short-term national elections, they're often overshadowed by recent"
1403.64,1404.64, events.
1404.64,1405.24, We'd like to point out that
1405.24,1410.08," in the US, your own president wasn't convicted despite nominally being impeached. We think"
1410.08,1414.66, it's clear and should be very clear to you that these aren't always sufficient. I think
1414.66,1418.96, people regularly don't show up to midterms. People aren't engaged enough for these internal
1418.96,1422.64," mechanisms to be sufficient. But again, we bring you back to our principle because we"
1422.64,1427.76," weren't on this alone because if you want to introduce another mechanism to have more democracy, unless you're going to"
1427.76,1430.76," prove to us why that's a bad idea, you can't win this debate."
1430.76,1435.76, But then they try to tell us that what we get under our side is flashy short-term policy.
1435.76,1439.56," I think this is a pretty generic argument, it's not remotely specific to this motion,"
1439.56,1443.62, because note that here we're talking about local members of parliament being appalled
1443.62,1444.62, by their own constituents.
1444.62,1449.52," It's unclear why my local MP, who hasn't been a member of the cabinet for about 10 years is"
1449.52,1454.48, single-handedly capable of tanking the economy if he ends up appalled in a local election the
1454.48,1459.04, second line of response is that we're just not sure why people don't vote for long-term policies
1459.04,1463.68, well i think sign opposition has a pretty low estimation of the general population i'd like
1463.68,1468.96," to point out that people in the united Kingdom, where we already have the system, literally voted for a government"
1468.96,1474.88," that implemented lockdown, a short-term harm with massive long-term benefits. Side opposition think"
1474.88,1478.8," people don't understand politics when it's explained to them, we think that's wrong,"
1478.8,1482.88, but thirdly we just think these policies are managed by national government instead of local
1482.88,1488.32," members of parliament, therefore it's far more likely that we're able to get that equally under our side but then we're told that"
1488.32,1492.0, we're going to get bad campaigns because these politicians are going to be short-termists and
1492.0,1496.4, opposition parties are going to gain the system a couple of responses here first of all it's just a
1496.4,1500.32, complete assertion that these campaigns are going to be very short-term just because the us has
1500.32,1504.08, ridiculously long election cycles doesn't mean that's the norm in the rest of the world but also
1504.08,1508.4, we're totally happy you can say you have a long time to educate people to read the news but
1508.4,1513.36, second line of response is that we think in these circumstances you have far more emphasis on local
1513.36,1518.08, news and that occurs in the national news but it seems a reflection on the ruling party so your
1518.08,1523.2, specific constituency is covered in the national media that means you have greater access to
1523.2,1528.72, information that you would in a general election but finally as we pointed out in our stance we have safeguards against
1528.72,1533.44, opposition gaming system we have this one-year period but also we think it looks bad for them
1533.44,1537.84, politically if they're going to try to introduce another election if they end up failing and it
1537.84,1543.2, looks like they're playing political games and that's the argument their fifth point here is
1543.2,1549.4," that they say well this is going to distract politicians from focusing on campaigns, from focusing on actual politics."
1549.4,1556.76," They focus on their campaigns instead. And that's about, we don't think focusing on campaigns is necessarily about, know that this is happening at a local level."
1557.02,1562.28, So it probably doesn't look like putting your face on a bustle promising £350 million for the NHS.
1562.4,1565.76, It probably looks like going out and talking to your constituents
1565.76,1570.16, and engaging in their priorities on what they want. We think frankly that's no bad thing. We
1570.16,1574.48," think politicians should do more rather than less of that, more engaging for the local community."
1574.48,1578.72," We think that's actually a point for our side. But finally, would you just suspend democracy"
1578.72,1582.88," in a situation where it could be potentially harmful? Would you say a pandemic, to use your"
1582.88,1589.68," own example, is a good reason to no longer have democracy, which is absolutely vital? Again, I remind you of the principle"
1589.68,1593.58," we brought in first, we've got nothing but mitigation, no sufficient response. We think"
1593.58,1597.44," that brings us this debate out of the park. But even if you don't believe that, the new"
1597.44,1601.12, point of extension on political engagement. Why do we think there is currently a lack
1601.12,1608.32," of political engagement between election cycles? Four reasons. First, because people have other priorities. The vast majority of people aren't hugely politically"
1608.32,1612.8," engaged. At the best of times, they have other priorities. They have lives, jobs, families."
1612.8,1617.04, US voters could only just about motivate themselves to show up and vote out Donald Trump
1617.04,1622.16, in 2020. This is an incredibly extreme case with huge effort around getting out of office. We don't
1622.16,1627.76, think this exists in the vast majority of cases second many people hate the culture of corruption that exists under opposition
1627.76,1631.76, they're often actively disinterested in politics because they see these new stories of scandal and
1631.76,1636.16, corruption they ask today and they're used to a 24-hour news cycle so they have incredibly short
1636.16,1640.96, attention span and even if they can vote that elected mp out in three years that might as well
1640.96,1644.56, be 30 to them there's no feeling of community around politics because you don't have the
1644.56,1647.04," national media talking about the selection, you don't have friends"
1647.04,1649.52," sat in the end of the poll talking about it. Sure, I'll take that point."
1649.52,1654.48," If voters have like an 80 second attention span, don't you think you increase"
1654.48,1657.68, voter apathy if you increase the vast number of elections and campaign?
1657.68,1661.52," No, we don't think so. Because what we're capable of doing is we are saying there is"
1661.52,1668.4, a course in the short term. You don't have to wait three years and let this play on your mind you don't have to remember it in three years time the government
1668.4,1672.64, is going to take action today and you are going to be able to vote this person out of office that's
1672.64,1677.2, why people with short attention spans under our side of the house are able to vote out corrupt
1677.2,1682.72, politicians or if you have no control so frankly it's useless to stay engaged anyway it's honestly
1682.72,1687.86," understandable if people don't care about politics between elections, because they have virtually no ability to change anything,"
1688.16,1691.82, even if a politician does something terrible. There's no logical reason to follow local news
1691.82,1695.98," because you can't change anything. This is incredibly damaging, because in opposition"
1695.98,1701.38," world, you don't follow the news between election cycles because you feel so powerless. But under"
1701.38,1708.56," us, individuals feel like they do have power to change the government, to change person who represents them so they read the news they discuss with each other and the media"
1708.56,1713.04, is more likely to focus on these things the impact of this argument is that now people are able to
1713.04,1718.16, make good political decisions even if these before elections are unsuccessful and politicians remain
1718.16,1722.48, in office now people are far more informed i think frankly that's an incredibly good thing
1722.48,1728.06," it means people can make better decisions for their lives, better decisions for their families and for that reason democracy"
1728.06,1735.5, without this policy is pure hypocrisy. We're so proud of what it is.
1735.5,1785.0, Thank you Speaker for the fine remarks and I invite the second speaker from side opposition. you Hello. Can everyone hear me? Thank you. POIs audibly please. So just unmute. Okay.
1785.0,1805.02," More elections and more voting does not mean more democracy. Trump lost the election and Boris Johnson resigned accountability exists on ours to the house, and this policy only defeats the purpose of, we're proud to be on side opposition. In this"
1805.02,1809.5," speech, a number of things. Firstly, going through the two clashes of today's debate and proving to"
1809.5,1813.7, you why side opposition is far ahead before presenting a third stand of argument on why
1813.7,1818.64," this increases instability in vulnerable regions. So first, let's talk about the principled clash"
1818.64,1824.36," and whether or not democracy truly requires this policy to pass. A number of things. First,"
1824.42,1825.16, I want to respond to their two reasons why this is principally to pass a number of things first I want to respond
1825.16,1829.72, to their two reasons why this is principally just under a democracy and one of the reasons why they
1829.72,1833.98, cited this is because people have information and if they have information in this election then
1833.98,1838.12, they should go on but we have proven to in our case that people do not have information and that
1838.12,1842.62, means it is not a legitimate choice to make in this election we told you that with crises there
1842.62,1848.72, are many technical problems that they do not understand their own example of that supports that covet is a great example of this too i'm not sure
1848.72,1853.92, why people understand the intricacies of medical technology and like pandemic response either right
1853.92,1858.88, but secondly i think you also decrease information on this house because there are far more elections
1858.88,1869.0, but also shorter election cycles this means that news hour is not going to be on as long. People don't get as much information during the time being because it is a irregular election.
1869.0,1881.0," So I think people will be unlikely to know as much about these specific issues that are being discussed because the election is coming up so soon, as opposed to every four years where there are literally two years of campaigning in between and things like that."
1881.0,1885.46," But furthermore, you also decrease voter participation"
1885.46,1886.94, and you increase apathy.
1886.94,1889.26, We told you that with the increase of elections
1889.26,1890.76, and people seeing that each election
1890.76,1892.32, doesn't really matter that much
1892.32,1894.26," because recalls are able to happen,"
1894.26,1897.94, people are far more unlikely to show up
1897.94,1900.14, and given existing barriers for voter suppression
1900.14,1902.52," and things like that, it only makes it far, far worse"
1902.52,1904.42, and makes people more unwilling.
1904.42,1910.56," But secondly, I think during crises situations, people are not able to act because in situations like covid or"
1910.56,1915.2, if the country is going to war people are far more susceptible to campaigning and rhetoric that is
1915.2,1921.92, very harmful like we told you so the emotional vulnerability also takes an aspect obviously
1921.92,1927.48," there's a spectrum there's going to be a degree of vulnerability at all times. But we think especially with irregular elections, this is true."
1927.6,1931.5, That is why this is not principally necessary. But second thing I'd like to note is that this
1931.5,1936.3," argument is entirely hung, right? It doesn't matter if this is good for democracy on a principled"
1936.3,1940.82," level, if it truly erodes the democratic process and increases backsliding, like we said in our"
1940.82,1948.8," case, so they cannot win the debate on this alone. Even if we are margin less democratic because we don't have as many elections it's still far more important that"
1948.8,1953.6, politicians are actually doing their jobs and passing policy that is the priority of today's
1953.6,1959.36, debate the second clash then on improving policy so i want to first start up by uh responding to
1959.36,1963.6, the two arguments they brought up first they talk about corruption i think this is roughly symmetric
1963.6,1969.04," on both sides no politician wants to be caught as a result of this. They have other interests such as re-election,"
1969.04,1973.52," but furthermore, nobody wants a bad legacy or to be known as a politician who is caught for"
1973.52,1977.6," corruption and doing bad things. And they probably need to find jobs after their election cycles,"
1977.6,1981.44, even if they don't look to get re-elected. They probably want to find jobs in government or in
1981.44,1984.72," finance and things like that. And if their reputation is tarnished, that is not going to"
1984.72,1987.14, help. I think those interests are symmetric on both sides.
1987.24,1991.16," Therefore, this argument is out of the debate. Secondly, let's talk about making smaller promises."
1991.54,1996.28," Two responses to this. First, I think this only applies when there are scandals or very extreme"
1996.28,2000.64," things, right? In their examples, they talk about extreme scandals and they say that this is not"
2000.64,2009.92, going to be everyday occurrence. This means that nobody is going to try to dethrone a president or a leader just because they didn't build as many schools as they promised to do so.
2009.92,2013.84, So I think this is not the correct scenario in this situation and it's unlikely going to stop
2013.84,2018.48," them from making large promises since that backlash isn't going to happen. But secondly,"
2018.48,2023.36," I think you probably increase that problem on your side of the house because when people are worried,"
2023.36,2026.28," people are scared, there is a recall election,"
2026.28,2028.36, people are these all right groups
2028.36,2029.86, and other fringe organizations
2029.86,2031.08, who are trying to stay power
2031.08,2034.88," or the opposition will likely take advantage of that,"
2034.88,2037.4, bring up these big ideas and these big statements
2037.4,2038.96, about how they're gonna turn the country around
2038.96,2041.18," and you only increase that problem on their side of house,"
2041.18,2042.88, information in this case decreases
2042.88,2044.26, because they're focused on getting people out
2044.26,2046.86, into the polls to vote and not actually why they should vote for them.
2046.94,2051.7, They're probably going to capitalize off of things like fear and vulnerability. And this also
2051.7,2056.34, increases apathy in this case because people do not know what is going on. There are so many
2056.34,2060.9," elections. They have daily lives, jobs, priorities that take them away from this. Note that their"
2060.9,2064.98," speaker actually conceded it by saying that people are not very politically interested,"
2064.98,2069.24, which only feeds into our argument about lower voter turnout and lower representation.
2069.7,2073.82, What did we tell you under this clash about improving policy? We crucially told you about
2073.82,2078.26, why voter turnout is important and know that they cannot win on principle or practical of democracy
2078.26,2083.9, if they decrease political engagement. We told you why information will be less quality because
2083.9,2090.02, of these groups and what the type of slogans that will likely attract individuals and just because the time of the
2090.02,2094.66, election is so much smaller in and of itself. So information cannot be disseminated in the large
2094.66,2098.88," quantities over a large amount of time for people to be absorbing. But secondly, there are less"
2098.88,2102.5, resources from grassroots groups and things like that. And these elections are at the end of the
2102.5,2108.32," day, irregular, which means that people do not plan for these things and they often come out of nowhere i think all of this"
2108.32,2112.4, leads to apathy when people don't understand politics people don't think that elections or
2112.4,2116.4, even general elections are important anymore because they'll just be a recall anyway and it's
2116.4,2121.28, a realm that they do not understand this means less of a voter turnout and tyranny of the minority
2121.28,2130.48," who originally signed the petition because the majority is disengaged, the majority is disillusioned. Given that, policy gets much, much worse. I think we've proven to"
2130.48,2134.08, that and they have not responded to this argument in their second speech about voter turnout.
2134.08,2138.56," Instead, they conceded it. But now in terms of policy, we told you about long-term policies"
2138.56,2142.4," that require short-term pains. That's not going to happen on your side of the house. Also,"
2142.4,2146.96, perfectly good politicians can be pushed out of office because opposition groups can construe
2146.96,2150.48," Obama to be the culprit of the recession when in reality,"
2150.48,2153.52, it is decades of bad economic policy that led to that point.
2153.52,2155.84, That is not just and I don't think people are able to make
2155.84,2157.54, that choice if there are other forces of
2157.54,2159.84, opposition's group convincing them otherwise.
2159.84,2163.16," Given that I think we've successfully nullified their principle,"
2163.16,2164.6, prove to you why we increase
2164.6,2168.56," democratic participation and why policy gets better. Given that then, there's a stand-up"
2168.56,2172.68, argument on instability. This argument is especially true with less developed economies
2172.68,2178.58," with fragile and nascent democracies. This looks like Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, etc."
2178.8,2182.4," And what characterizes these countries? I think a lot of the times they are post-colonial,"
2182.4,2188.88," a lot of the times there's a big wealth disparities, ethnic tensions, a lot of extremism, and at the end of the day, weak"
2188.88,2194.68, institutions as well. All of these warrants and characterizations about developing states and
2194.68,2199.16, nascent democracies makes all of the arguments on ours to the House far more likely and severe
2199.16,2203.46," because they do not have the structures to check back against this. What this leads to is first,"
2203.6,2209.36," we get this revolving door, right? Let's assume that these recall elections do happen, presidents do bad things. This means"
2209.36,2214.24," instability and change in standards and policy and things like that. Secondly, it also probably"
2214.24,2219.68, looks like a social instability because opposition groups often weaponize existing political and
2219.68,2224.4, ethnic divides that exacerbate existing trends of violence and instability and things like that.
2224.4,2228.24," What does this all mean for these countries though? First, it means less domestic and"
2228.24,2232.4, international investor confidence. This means that they're unlikely to going to receive companies
2232.4,2236.8, coming to their company or countries or any type of aid because no company wants to invest in
2236.8,2240.88," countries and economies that are incredibly volatile. But secondly, you're also not going"
2240.88,2244.88," to get as much trade and global cooperation, which is crucial for these countries because"
2244.88,2265.04," changing administrations means different policy approaches and countries want to build ties with stable and trustworthy allies, you're not going to build ties with somebody and give them a lot of money, if the next president that is coming along, or they're going to get recalled is going to be entirely different and potentially even antagonize your own nation all of this means less economic growth for these vulnerable people"
2265.04,2270.56, fewer jobs and companies coming and for these already struggling places so given that we've
2270.56,2275.2, proven to you why we increase democracy why policy gets better on our side but why we most importantly
2275.2,2279.52, also secure the economic growth for these countries that currently need it and don't
2279.52,2287.36, have political stability proud to stand on that opposition
2290.08,2307.0, i thank the speaker for the fine remarks and i invite the government hi am I audible and visible?
2307.0,2335.0," Cool, thank you very much. I'll take your words verbally. Thank you."
2335.0,2339.0, Democracy is not just going to a ballot box once every five years.
2339.0,2345.4, Democracy is the knowledge that your views are represented by those who you trust to make decisions for you.
2345.62,2351.46, The belief that those who represent you have your interests at heart and will do the right thing.
2351.74,2356.44," Now, Team USA don't believe that people are smart enough to understand the idea of a long-term,"
2356.58,2361.6," short-term trade-off. We think that is not only insulting, it is demonstrably false when they"
2361.6,2369.84, recognise that we are willing to give these people democracy in the first place. So panel that's why team England says democracy without this policy is hypocrisy. Three
2369.84,2373.68," points of clash in this speech firstly on the principle, secondly on political engagement,"
2373.68,2378.64, thirdly on accountability and who makes the best decisions. What did we tell you on our principle?
2378.64,2382.32, We said that there is our that there are principled reasons to implement democracy in as
2382.32,2389.68, many reasonable cases as possible. We said that there is inherently no good political decision and that individuals are coerced by the state's power
2389.68,2395.36, so ought to have a say over how that power is exerted. We told you that there are two criteria
2395.36,2399.76, for where we restrict democracy under the status quo. That is where there is insufficient
2399.76,2403.84, accessible information and when it is practically impossible or destroys the functioning of the
2403.84,2405.0, functioning of government to do so.
2405.0,2410.0," How do they engage with this? Because despite Maxwell delivering this point for four minutes,"
2410.0,2415.0, Prop 1 decides to tell us that we only had two lines of analysis.
2415.0,2420.0, Their first response is wholly mitigation. They say that other accountability exists.
2420.0,2425.2, So therefore there is democracy. And I want to flag clearly here that this is not engaging with
2425.2,2429.84," Maxwell's analysis on this principle, because we explained why we want more democracy, provided it"
2429.84,2433.52, fits with that criteria. But I'm going to go through the three alternatives that they give
2433.52,2438.88," and explain why those are not enough. Firstly, the first one they give is midterm elections."
2438.88,2443.04," Just to point out how midterm elections work, they are only for some representatives."
2443.04,2449.62," Every representative serves a full term. That is how terms work. But secondly, to give you the example of impeachment, I think"
2449.62,2453.88, Maxwell already pointed out why having your college friends who work alongside and who know
2453.88,2458.06," you incredibly well, deciding whether or not you should stay in your job is obviously less"
2458.06,2461.68, democratic than putting it to the people who you're supposed to be representing. But then they
2461.68,2470.24, tell us internal mechanisms. And this is why boris johnson resigned look i really appreciate team usa trying to use an english example but to be clear part of
2470.24,2475.52, the reason boris eventually resigned after refusing for so long was because there was an attempt to
2475.52,2479.52, get a recall petition in his constituency of oxbridge and south riceland and that would have
2479.52,2484.24, been incredibly politically embarrassing for him and recognized on this panel they can see here
2484.24,2490.0," that people can be unrepresented for four to six years, provided that these other mechanisms, that their"
2490.0,2494.46, friends have decided that they're okay. We think that is not democratic. We think that is abhorrent.
2494.76,2498.58," The second thing they say that they pivot to in their second speech is that, well, during a crisis,"
2498.58,2502.28," you don't have enough information to make this decision. First of all, we just think this is"
2502.28,2508.4," simply untrue. We think during a crisis, there is likely to be access to more information, see all of the information that was available"
2508.4,2513.6," during Covid. But crucially, if a crisis is bad enough to not have elections, I don't know if"
2513.6,2517.76," there's a nuclear war or something, then yeah we'd probably be happy to have a temporary ban on"
2517.76,2522.32, recall elections and general elections because that meets the criteria that Maxwell set up. That
2522.32,2528.64," is entirely consistent with what we told you and this is not a response to our case. So let me weigh this principle for you then,"
2528.64,2533.28, because we told you that democracy is not about getting utilitarian benefits. It is about
2533.28,2537.76," representing people's wishes, and we ought to maximise the amount of democracy that we have."
2537.76,2541.92, That mitigation is never enough to engage with that. So we think we went on this principle alone
2541.92,2547.6," and show why this is something that we ought to do. But let's talk about the practical side of this debate because it comes down to two clashes,"
2547.6,2552.88," political engagement and accountability. On political engagement, Maya gave you four clear"
2552.88,2557.2, reasons why there is a lack of engagement under the status quo and why when people are given a
2557.2,2561.84," sense of power, when the media is incentivized to focus on these individuals, that engagement"
2561.84,2565.28, is improved. They give three claims which directly respond to
2565.28,2570.28," this, all of which we think are wholly insufficient to take out Maia's compelling analysis. First of"
2570.28,2573.86," all, they say that people are less prepared for these elections because there is not time to be"
2573.86,2578.38," ready to vote and inform yourself. As we pointed out, and to which we got no rebuilding, I'm not"
2578.38,2582.94, sure why this is necessarily true. We are perfectly happy within this policy to give these elections
2582.94,2585.06, the same amount of time as other elections.
2585.18,2588.32, And note that we pointed out that the whole world is not the USA.
2588.72,2591.38, Not everyone has crazy long two year election cycles.
2591.48,2593.16, You should probably contend with that.
2593.34,2601.24, But we think any lack of information is counteracted by the increased media attentions that these elections have compared to a national election.
2601.44,2605.04," Because recognizing a national election, you have to share that information,"
2605.04,2607.92," that media coverage between 650 constituencies,"
2607.92,2610.74," or to put it in American language, between the 50 states."
2610.74,2612.22, We think that makes it a lot harder
2612.22,2613.86, to access the information that you need
2613.86,2615.08, at a general election.
2615.08,2618.0," Secondly, they tell us the opposition parties can gain this"
2618.0,2619.72, because extremist or populist groups
2619.72,2621.14," can force a recall election,"
2621.14,2622.84, and then they're the ones who vote.
2622.84,2624.48, We were very clear in our model
2624.48,2629.28, that we think this is something that is not feasible or likely to happen because if an extreme party is
2629.28,2635.2," able to get 20% of your constituents to get up out of their room and sign a petition, we don't think"
2635.2,2640.72," they are that extreme or fringe in the first place. But secondly, we especially said in our model this"
2640.72,2644.48, is only something that can happen once a year so it's not like we're going to be having these every
2644.48,2648.24, week in a sense that it is going to completely disrupt government but second thing to
2648.24,2653.2, know here is that elections are expensive i don't know what kind of extremist populist group is able
2653.2,2658.08, to fund having these recall elections on everyone as soon as they can all of the time we just think
2658.08,2663.04, this is unfeasible but importantly even if you accept that they are able to get away with having
2663.04,2668.46, an election we think there is still massive media attention that comes to that constituency when that by-election is called.
2668.64,2674.8," I mean, that means that more people are likely to vote and you're not just going to have the extremists voting these people out without anyone else voting against them."
2675.0,2682.06," That means then that their impact, which are a sudden wave of populism, are clearly woefully under-analysed and do not stand in this debate."
2682.42,2686.0," The final thing they claim is voter apathy. They say that if you have a short attention span,"
2686.0,2687.64, you'll be annoyed if there are loads of elections.
2687.64,2690.48," Let's be clear, panel, and this is similar to my response to the last thing."
2690.48,2693.32, We do not concede this because this does not mean
2693.32,2696.36, that people have to vote every few weeks or every few months.
2696.36,2700.04, The majority of politicians will get through their term without a recall election.
2700.04,2701.32, That's how it works in the US.
2701.32,2702.92, That's how it works in the UK.
2702.92,2708.24, So do not let opposition give you an unrealistic view of this happening in every constituency every week.
2708.24,2711.56," That's not what's likely to happen. But let me flag this now, panel."
2711.56,2719.92, This rebuttal also takes out that under-analysed new argument in OCTO about how this is going to have a massive lack of investment because there's political instability.
2719.92,2725.08," And note, panel, that the UK and US, despite having recall elections, are not developing countries"
2725.08,2728.72, that lack investment because of their massive instability. They are incredibly prosperous.
2728.92,2732.66," Once again, their claim is vocally under-analyzed and does not stand. So we win on their most"
2732.66,2735.92," important clash of engagement. Before I go on to accountability, I'll take the pill."
2739.62,2743.82," Voters are already feeling apathy because of the number of elections, the number of local"
2743.82,2747.6," elections. What happens if you increase the amount of campaigning, the amount of polarizations, the amount of"
2747.6,2753.4," sensationalizations? In a couple of constituencies, you have one more election per cycle. I do not"
2753.4,2757.24," think this is the tipping point that makes people stop engaging with politics. And in fact, when"
2757.24,2761.42," these elections happen, it's because the people wanted them. What do opposition tell us then on"
2761.42,2765.82, accountability? They say that politicians will not do policies which are unpopular.
2765.82,2767.2, Three layers of response to this.
2767.2,2769.96," Firstly, if they are doing something which is so unpopular"
2769.96,2772.56," and cannot be justified understandably to the electorate,"
2772.56,2775.02, we do not think that is something that they should do.
2775.02,2776.96, We think it is legitimate to vote on your short-term
2776.96,2778.66, interests if that is what matters to you.
2778.66,2781.34, And they never engage with that part of Maxwell's principle.
2781.34,2783.56," But secondly, the response to your constituents"
2783.56,2788.94," is not necessarily not to do that policy, it is to justify that policy to them so that they understand the short-term,"
2789.04,2793.22, long-term trade-off. Because we do think voters are able to understand this. They want long-term
2793.22,2797.4, things as well as short-term things. And we think that is something that is incredibly valuable.
2797.96,2801.88," Secondly, they say that candidates are going to be too focused on elections. Let's be clear on"
2801.88,2809.54," what this apparent harm actually looks like, right? Because what they mean is that candidates now have to wait for it, go into their constituencies and speak to their"
2809.54,2813.34," constituents, and they might even have to justify their decisions to them. We think that is"
2813.34,2817.5, unambiguously a good thing if they are focusing on the people that they are responsible to.
2817.8,2822.3," Note what we told you then here. We told you there is a lack of accountability, that this policy is"
2822.3,2828.64, going to make politicians act better because we shift the decision-making calculus in their head and give them a massive added incentive not to do
2828.64,2833.44, the terrible things they do under under opposition side of the cows trust the people because democracy
2833.44,2836.0, without this policy is hypocrisy proud to propose
2842.16,2885.88," thank the speaker for the fine remarks and I now invite the speaker from Saira opposition. Hi, am I audible?"
2885.88,2911.34," Great, I'll be taking verbal POIs, please. Behind Teams England's very sophisticated accent lied a bunch of simple characterizations that made no sense when you compared them to each other."
2911.72,2918.0," Proposition 1 said that they, in the entire second sub, is that people lack information and are susceptible to populist causes."
2918.4,2921.5, Proposition 2 said that people have an 80-second attention span.
2921.5,2929.64, Then Proposition 3 tells you that people are able to evaluate long-term policies when politicians campaign for them. This made absolutely zero sense when you
2929.64,2934.02, validate them in the whole of their strategy and their arguments and case. What we gave you was a
2934.02,2939.0," more realistic, nuanced view of how voters and people work. We told you that there's very likely"
2939.0,2943.36," to be short-term incentives, right? You cared about the impacts that happen to you in the real world,"
2943.48,2948.24, how gas taxes were right now. That's why it tracks so closely with presidential approval ratings.
2948.52,2952.54," We told you that you're able to consume information, but to an extent, that there's a lot"
2952.54,2956.58," of voter apathy when there's over-media attention, where there's too many campaigns. That's why"
2956.58,2960.92," people didn't even care about local races in the first place. And we also told you that overall,"
2961.02,2969.6, it is very hard to evaluate policies based off a theoretical theoretical concept that they can't paint you because you wanted to see the result of it in the long term
2969.6,2973.92, whereas if you had recall elections and avenues to do so then the men who are voting necessarily
2973.92,2978.56, based on insufficient analysis this is all the characterization we gave you that's a lot more
2978.56,2983.76, realistic and underpinned every issue of this debate that's why we won three things i'm going
2983.76,2988.68, to talk about one on the principle on why spending three or four minutes in the Proposition 3 wasn't a really good
2988.68,2992.02," strategy. Number two, I'm going to talk about the quality of policy. Finally, I'm going to talk"
2992.02,2995.8," about voter turnout and polarization. On the principle, they told you that you wanted the"
2995.8,3001.16," greatest political input, and the two restrictions of this were for very technical policies and if"
3001.16,3009.28," it destroyed the foundations of democracy itself. We told you a couple things. We told you first that in terms of technical information, that this is likely going to be true"
3009.28,3011.32, because it gave you an example of the central bank.
3011.32,3014.84," We told you people were unlikely able to evaluate the results of say,"
3014.84,3019.56," like plunging your country into debt for white elephant BRI project, i.e. in Malaysia."
3019.56,3023.76, And it took actually seeing the results for people to better express their preferences.
3023.76,3026.86," Thus, that's why we wanted four year election cycles."
3026.86,3029.44, We told you destroy the foundations of democracies.
3029.44,3033.0," If you wet special interest groups, proposition three says, I don't know how popular scripts"
3033.0,3036.46, have so money precisely because the fact is that we are able to exploit it the most when
3036.46,3039.36, you have voter apathy and a lot of campaign periods.
3039.36,3043.28," And the fact of the matter is to get lower voter turnout, then you decrease representation."
3043.28,3049.84," So this was hung on a practical, but most most importantly they never told you why this mattered they told you quote democracy is not"
3049.84,3054.32, about utilitarian outcomes the best analysis probably in proposition three in which they said
3054.32,3059.84, we want representations of people's wishes but again this was a very simplistic analysis because
3059.84,3063.92, you tell you we care about democracy because it's an aggregation of people preferences they never
3063.92,3067.6," told you why it wasn't a utilitarian outcome. We told you that people knew what best they want,"
3067.6,3071.68, but there are obviously some limitations we had to make. So if you get the best aggregation to
3071.68,3076.48," people's preferences and the policies that result, you actually fulfill this far better."
3076.48,3081.2," Two questions then. One on the quality policy, second on turnout. On the quality of policy,"
3081.2,3089.48," we gave you a very simple characterization that they never responded to, that many policies have a lot of long-term impacts that are very hard to evaluate."
3089.96,3091.2, Why? Three reasons.
3091.52,3096.76," One, there's a lot of external factors out of control, i.e., like how the gas and oil market is with prices."
3096.9,3098.2, It's very hard to control domestically.
3098.54,3107.14," Second, there's a lot of technical work with these policies, even if it isn't in the central bank. There's a lot of very detailed economic analysis or like people to understand about international"
3107.14,3111.06, relations that you necessarily had to see the results of to understand whether or not
3111.06,3114.24, it was effective or not to make the best decisions for the people.
3114.24,3118.06," Third, we told you just overall, even from a debater perspective, even if it's someone"
3118.06,3122.68," who is very expert, it's very hard to analyze policies based on after a month of it being"
3122.68,3123.68, in place.
3123.68,3128.56, We also told you then that you got a lot worse policies on their side. They talked to you about accountability and scandals.
3128.8,3132.44," Number one, we told you that we would love to have impeachment in the court system. This isn't"
3132.44,3136.88," perfect, but it's a good incentive because if you want to try like high crimes or the sex scandals"
3136.88,3140.56," that they paint in the proposition one, this was generally a good thing to work through. Second,"
3140.66,3144.06, we told you people remembered it if actually mattered for them. They told you people have
3144.06,3145.0, 80 second attention spans.
3145.0,3154.0," We think this is a vast, like gross exaggeration of what happens in elections because at the end of a four year campaign period, opposition parties, the media brings this up."
3154.0,3161.0," If voters truly cared about it and they think it outweighed all the other policies that a politician did, then we think it's great that they vote them out."
3161.0,3164.0, So we tell you people do remember about this. What does this mean?
3164.0,3168.64," We told you, Proposition 1 told you that voters lack information and you have populist outcomes"
3168.64,3172.88, we tell you then there's four reasons why you get worse policy outcomes on their side
3172.88,3178.0, number one you increase the incentives for very bad policies that may provide short-term
3178.0,3183.44, war wars are hugely detrimental to the economy proposition told you that people can evaluate
3183.44,3185.14, long-term policies. And the best
3185.14,3189.16, version of this is that like the politicians are forced to justify them to the people through
3189.16,3194.14," campaigning within their periods. There's a few reasons why this is wrong. Number one, people care"
3194.14,3198.86, far more about the impacts hitting them the most. This is because most people are not political
3198.86,3203.12," junkies. They work a job, they have friends, they care about the impacts of society. We told you it's"
3203.12,3208.64, a lot better to evaluate the long-term impact of policy if you're still in a short-termist mindset if you're valuing the
3208.64,3213.92, short-term impacts on you a year after a policy is passed rather than the month after a policy
3213.92,3218.88, is passed this was the analysis that they didn't respond to second we told you all media polarization
3218.88,3223.2, cross-apply that analysis here where even if you had politicians justifying the long-term impacts
3223.2,3228.72," you had the media focusing on the shorter impacts like how Fox News is doing in the status quo, meant then there's a"
3228.72,3232.84," countervailing narrative to that. Finally, told you voter apathy meant they weren't going to focus"
3232.84,3237.82, on the information. What did this mean? It meant you were going to have huge impacts. It meant that
3237.82,3243.08," you're going to focus on a larger tax cuts for a short-term economic boost, but resulted in a lot"
3243.08,3245.32, worse economic detriment. It meant you
3245.32,3249.72, were going to go for that white elephant investment project that plunged your country into debt
3249.72,3254.44, because you cared about not getting a recall in that particular election. You cared about getting
3254.44,3258.4, the short-term incentives because you didn't want to go up for long-term ones that are actually good.
3258.64,3263.22," Before I move on, I'm happy to let Bob disagree. If you're smart enough to understand long-term"
3263.22,3274.0," trade-offs and you trust people to vote in general elections every five years where people are going to be discussing long term issues, why can they not go in elections during the time of their choosing."
3274.0,3289.66," We think people are more likely if they validate the short term impacts, they would be able to better value long term impact the policies if it happened a year after policy was passed overall. That's an entire reason we gave you. If it was true that populist groups were able to take advantage of short-term"
3289.66,3294.3," interests, it meant they could take advantage of all these recall elections. As Proposition 3 tells"
3294.3,3297.92," you, it's far more likely to happen when people have more money. That meant elites were able to"
3297.92,3301.3, exploit it when there was voter apathy. The second thing to note here is that we're able to have
3301.3,3308.48," impeachments. We're able to have long-term evaluations. They never explained to you why, given a concise summary within debates within the media after four"
3308.48,3313.18," years, why they couldn't evaluate the overall impact on their lives. We told you that when you"
3313.18,3318.18," have a recall election, the media imposes an insufficient information on them in order to"
3318.18,3323.3," vote against a particular politician. Finally, I'm going to talk about voter turnout. Their analysis"
3323.3,3325.0, was extraordinarily simplistic.
3325.0,3331.0, We told you that not everybody are like nerds in this debate room who love politics and willing to do it for all the time.
3331.0,3334.0," We told you once, one, that people were likely to be dissatisfied."
3334.0,3337.0," They told you, like, at least voters feel like they have power over the elections."
3337.0,3341.0," This doesn't make sense because, again, as we told you, policies have long term implications."
3341.0,3348.48," So even if they vote in a new person, it's a long time to see that come into fruition more than that they are oftentimes dissatisfied with their opposing"
3348.48,3352.56, parties because of large promises i.e with trump voted out because of the scandals people are still
3352.56,3355.84, dissatisfied with biden so they never had a sophisticated analysis that happened at the
3355.84,3359.44, other end were they going to feel actually good about their power all of this meant it was going
3359.44,3363.12, to create voter apathy because we had a far better analysis the fact of the matter is people were
3363.12,3365.44," able to consume information to an extent,"
3365.44,3368.32," but what also meant is that after we reached that extent,"
3368.32,3369.94, people didn't want to become engaged
3369.94,3371.76, in the political process overall.
3371.76,3373.4," Let me tell you, their model was about one year"
3373.4,3374.66, of campaigning time.
3374.66,3377.02," If campaigning time for a normal election is one year,"
3377.02,3379.06, that means nearly half of the election time
3379.06,3380.92, of like an election period
3380.92,3382.76, is with campaigning by the politicians.
3382.76,3385.08," Meaning not only do you have less time to focus on policies,"
3385.08,3387.08, but you also have increased polarization
3387.08,3389.22, because people want to take advantage of that.
3389.22,3390.78," More than that, like the only analysis we got"
3390.78,3392.36," to our third argument was that,"
3392.36,3395.08," oh, the UK and the US don't have bad democracies."
3395.08,3396.88, This is particularly about nascent democracies
3396.88,3400.0," who needed stability right now, not in the long-term."
3400.0,3401.46," It meant even at their best ground,"
3401.46,3403.32, given no response from the proposition
3403.32,3405.26," that we've got their stability, we've got their investment,"
3405.26,3406.8, we've got their economic accounts.
3406.8,3407.64," For all these reasons,"
3407.64,3409.84, we're incredibly proud to stand in opposition.
3414.46,3416.06, I thank the speaker for the fine remarks
3416.06,3440.94," and I invite Dr. Platt. All right, am I still audible?"
3442.2,3445.36, Awesome.
3445.36,3448.08, The thesis of side proposition's entire case
3448.08,3449.92, is that we should maximize input
3449.92,3453.12, and we should maximize the number of voting and election.
3453.12,3455.32," But our analysis down the line was this,"
3455.32,3458.66, that input did not matter if it was not representative.
3458.66,3461.3, The only reason why we have democracy in place
3461.3,3464.32," is for an aggregation of the voters' interests,"
3464.32,3465.12," so that there's accountability that occurs and the wishes of the voters' interests, so that there's accountability"
3465.12,3470.42, that occurs and the wishes of the voters are represented in a government. And our argument was
3470.42,3475.12," that recall elections did not accomplish this goal, that they were too short-term, they were"
3475.12,3480.14," too irregular, and the actual wishes of the people would never be represented. That is why we won"
3480.14,3484.1," this debate. I want to talk about two things. First of all, which side best protects democracy,"
3484.1,3487.84," and second of all, which side gets the best policy. I want to talk about two things. First of all, which side best protects democracy, and second of all, which side gets the best policy. I want to talk about which side best"
3487.84,3493.28," protects democracy, because as the Proposition 3 tells you, the reason why democracy is important"
3493.28,3497.84, is about representation. We gave you three structural reasons down the line why they did
3497.84,3502.4, not get participation and thus did not get representation on their side of the house.
3502.4,3505.14," Number one, it was because people lacked information,"
3509.1,3512.84," that they did not get the coverage, the debates, and the discussions that normally happen within general elections. And I want to know from the beginning of the debate, we told you that these"
3512.84,3517.06," recall elections would be occurring in much less time, that the time it took for the governor"
3517.06,3521.08, election to happen in California was not the months and the weeks that the recall election
3521.08,3530.04," happened to recall the governor. That was not our only analysis though, because what Miles told you was very clear, that you could not evaluate policies in the short term,"
3530.04,3535.64," that within a matter of two years, you could not evaluate the impacts of massive policies like"
3535.64,3540.46," healthcare, like budget cuts, like land redistribution. These were policies that could"
3540.46,3549.94, only be evaluated within a four to six year time period. So trying to recall someone based on the implications of two years also fed into their burden about insufficient information.
3550.2,3553.76," We gave you two other reasons that were also critical. Secondly, that you got less voter"
3553.76,3558.2, mobilization because you got less grassroots fundraising efforts or less low-income people
3558.2,3562.98," would vote. And third of all, that we told you that these elections are very spontaneous and"
3562.98,3568.66," irregular. And as they tell you themselves, people have other opportunities and other things to care about in their life. So they"
3568.66,3572.9," wouldn't be as politically apt as we are right now, which means they were less likely to participate"
3572.9,3577.98," in elections. This outweighed their principle for two reasons. First of all, even if they got more"
3577.98,3583.06," elections, if turnout was less, representation did not matter. What they got on their side of the"
3583.06,3585.72, house was a very energized 20% that would prop up populist politicians and vote.. What they got on their side of the house was a very energized 20%
3585.72,3588.42, that would prop up populist politicians and vote.
3588.42,3590.72, But what they got was that the rest of the 80%
3590.72,3593.02," was not as informed, was not as engaged,"
3593.02,3595.72, and therefore was not able to express their will.
3595.72,3597.64, But that was just the short-term impact.
3597.64,3599.44, They ignore the long-term outcome
3599.44,3601.16," that Miles and Abby tells you,"
3601.16,3602.98, that if there's constantly recall elections
3602.98,3603.84," that are happening,"
3603.84,3615.2," people feel that their vote matters less, that it does not matter if they vote in the mayoral election or the general election, because there's a risk that their candidate is going to get recalled, which means that in the long term, people are going to go vote a lot less."
3615.2,3626.16, They're going to become far more apathetic. But the second thing I want to talk about is governance. And I don't think democracy actually matters if it's not serve the interests of the people. And that's why governance was so important.
3626.46,3630.84, We gave you a bunch of analysis why governance went down on their side of the house.
3631.1,3634.06," First of all, it's because people focused on short-term priorities."
3634.42,3639.04," As England tells you themselves, people have an 80-second attention span, which means they"
3639.04,3640.64, weren't able to look into the long-term.
3640.64,3644.52," They looked into the short-term, such as what was hitting their pockets, the gas prices,"
3644.78,3646.22," the inflation that was happening,"
3646.22,3647.92, which means that people were not able to make
3647.92,3650.78, a rational decision about the long-term implications
3650.78,3651.7, of policies.
3651.7,3654.32, Why did that change the incentives of politicians?
3654.32,3656.94, Because they realized that the key was not to pass
3656.94,3660.02," long-term policies that could benefit people in six years,"
3660.02,3662.56, it was passing the quick tax cut
3662.56,3664.62, that could increase their approval rating.
3664.62,3668.16," We told you short-term policies were bad because in the long-term, they would lead to detrimental"
3668.16,3668.74, effects.
3669.0,3672.6," And second of all, that they would lead to a scrapping of the beneficial long-term structural"
3672.6,3674.48, policies that improve government.
3674.72,3678.42, The only analysis that they gave us is they get better scrutiny on their side of the house
3678.42,3682.46, so that people don't do scandals and people are more receptive to the needs of the public.
3682.7,3684.76, We still get that on our side of the house.
3684.76,3688.88," As we told you from the second speech, there's always an incentive for people to not"
3688.88,3693.28," commit gross actions that are against the public interest, that if people lose popularity, that"
3693.28,3696.72," they'll lose the midterm elections, they'll lose their power, they'll lose their re-elections,"
3696.72,3700.72, which means politicians always have an incentive to pass beneficial policies.
3700.72,3704.16, The difference on their side of the House is that those policies would be short-term.
3704.16,3712.0," For those reasons, we clearly take the debate. Thank you."
3712.0,3731.08," Thanks, Speaker, for the fine remarks, and I'll invite the government to conclude this debate. Everyone hear me?"
3741.94,3745.34," According to Team USA, implementing this policy leads to the collapse of the economy, the withdrawal of all foreign investment, widespread voter apathy, and a revolving door leading to chronic instability. For all their rhetoric, Pam, all about running a very nuanced"
3745.34,3747.06," and very believable case, I think"
3747.06,3749.1, this is unbelievably extreme.
3749.1,3750.82," Maybe I'm missing something, but I"
3750.82,3753.74," do know politics in the UK isn't ideal right now,"
3753.74,3756.12, but I'm just not sure it's quite that bad.
3756.12,3758.88," On side proposition, we tell you to trust the people."
3758.88,3761.56, We tell you that democracy without this policy
3761.56,3762.56, is hypocrisy.
3762.56,3763.52, We're proud to propose.
3763.52,3769.08," I'm going to talk about two questions in this speech. First of all, which side is principally justified? And second, on the"
3769.08,3772.98," practical flash. First of all, on the principle, we brought this to you in first. We gave you a"
3772.98,3776.88," principle claim from strengthening democracy, where we want as much democracy as we can,"
3777.16,3781.36," where this isn't a situation where it's justified to restrict democracy, why we need it here"
3781.36,3785.2, specifically. How does side opposition engage with this? Their first response
3785.2,3790.16," is mitigation. We don't live in an authoritarian state, so we have general elections, we have midterms,"
3790.16,3795.92," we have impeachments, we can protest. This never engaged with the crux of our principle. Note that we"
3795.92,3801.04, gave clear mechanisms why these aren't sufficient to ensure that politicians that break promises or
3801.04,3808.88, fail to meet the standards we expect of them in public life are removed from office. So let's go over those again because we gave you three reasons at first and they were never engaged
3808.88,3813.36, with for us we tell you often voters see that a long time has passed since the relevant scandal
3813.36,3817.28, or bad decision that might impact where they choose to vote second because there's far less
3817.28,3822.0, attention on individual candidates during national elections and third because national elections are
3822.0,3826.46, generally overshadowed by recent events instead of focused on local politics.
3826.46,3830.56," But even if you don't believe these clear responses that, by the way, they never engaged"
3830.56,3834.56," with, our principle was never a simple assertion that democracy is good."
3834.56,3837.5, Our principle was the state should be as democratic as possible.
3837.5,3841.4," So even if you have plenty of other mechanisms protecting democracy, we should introduce"
3841.4,3845.0, as many more as we feasibly can to protect the health of our democratic systems.
3845.0,3848.0, Then they say people are insufficiently informed to make these decisions because there's very
3848.0,3849.0, little media coverage surrounding his bi-election.
3849.0,3854.0," The best of them, this isn't a search and it's also just an actual lie."
3854.0,3859.0," Neil Parish's behaviour dominated, factor pun intended, the news cycle for weeks afterwards"
3859.0,3863.0, because of the threatened electoral election and potential disastrous consequences for
3863.0,3864.0, the national government.
3864.0,3869.1," We train from first that these elections occur in contentious and controversial situations,"
3869.1,3871.1, situations that get lots of coverage.
3871.1,3874.76," But even if people aren't as informed as they possibly could be, this is even more true"
3874.76,3878.76, for a general election when no one scrutinises their representative because they only care
3878.76,3882.56, about who wins the majority and media coverage is spread across the whole nation.
3882.56,3888.16," So unless you just want to ban elections, we don't think this stands. But finally they attempt to claim practical contingency and say"
3888.16,3892.56," if democracy is harmed practically, we can't win on principle. I think they've misunderstood what"
3892.56,3896.72," democracy actually means because it's about offering choice. We don't force people to vote,"
3896.72,3900.72, even if that would make democracy more representative. We accept that choosing not
3900.72,3904.48, to vote is a valid decision and itself an expression of a practice. If you don't want to
3904.48,3908.96," sign this petition or vote, you don't have to to but that should never infringe on someone else's"
3908.96,3914.08," right to remove someone who doesn't represent them. And second on the practical, just to make a strategic"
3914.08,3918.8," observation, cyber positions characterisation is not what the status quo looks like in the UK."
3918.8,3922.72," These cases are rare, they get lots of media coverage, they don't happen every day so that"
3922.72,3928.48, completely takes out that under-analysed argument at second on chronic instability but what do they tell us in this
3928.48,3932.72, class they say first of all you get bad policies that short term is not long term we were very
3932.72,3936.96, clear for us that often it's fine to vote in the short term because that helps your interest you
3936.96,3941.04, need money in the short term because you've lost your job that's fine but second that politicians
3941.04,3950.72, have incentives to appeal to their voters i note that their characterization that voters are stupid doesn't con that doesn't contradict our analysis or why they have short
3950.72,3955.6, attention spans attention spans about forgetting this is about whether people can understand trade
3955.6,3960.8, ops but finally we think frankly even if you think these policies are bad we support them
3960.8,3965.0," democratically we think you should as well unless you want to ban German elections, land of the free and all that."
3965.0,3966.0," But second, they talk about voter apathy."
3966.0,3971.0, This is a problem for their side because they never engage with our extension on why we
3971.0,3972.0, get less voter apathy on our side.
3972.0,3976.5, And then they tell us that you're going to get excessive focus on campaigning.
