0.0,3.72," Yeah, apologies, apologies for this."
4.46,7.64," Vidya, that being said, I now invite the first speaker from side opposition."
20.84,21.78, Am I audible?
23.5,24.02, Amazing.
24.02,24.94, I like POIs.
24.94,28.02," Okay, so via the audio."
32.14,39.18," Panel, don't buy into their characterization of scientists just somehow saving public discourse."
39.3,43.68, We believe that public issues are inherently controversial. We believe that even in the
43.68,53.0," proposition's best case, where they only get well informed, like, like people to be on these public discussions, which we believe is unlikely as I'm going to analyze in the following."
53.0,69.6, And we believe that it's unlikely that people one are going to listen to scientists because they're just not charismatic enough and therefore their ability to shape public discourse is incredibly limited and secondly even if so we believe that even public we believe that even scientists can have a political bias even biologists can believe that trans women aren't
69.6,74.32, real that trans men aren't real we believe that with uh with that in mind let's move to the uh
74.32,79.84, rebuttal on uh decades okay firstly unlike um our counter model if they want to talk about parties
79.84,84.16, funding these uh channels we oppose that as well we believe that on uh that we have the fear to
84.16,89.0, assume that they can't fund this uh on our side as well but moving on to then their first argument on
89.0,93.74, polarization where they uh bring to you like the characterization of like three kinds of people I
93.74,98.36, want to tackle these right three kinds of people exactly they took you one about ignorant viewers
98.36,102.74, and how they are not going to change on either side in my substantive I'm going to talk about
102.74,108.7, why on their side it's actually going to be worse and these people are going to be radicalized secondly on like the well-informed
108.7,112.5, people believe it's likely that people these people engage with like different kinds of media
112.5,116.86, on their side of the house maybe that it's limited to like the silent middle what's the impact on the
116.86,120.02, silent middle like the third group the passive people that they like to talk about and really
120.02,124.5, it's likely to be three things either believe that the information that they that they get
124.5,128.4, doesn't change their views this is because people are largely value driven really that the extent
128.4,132.32, that people are open to content like to have different views considered in their own decision
132.32,137.04, making is limited because they're shaped by like family and because of their surrounding because
137.04,141.12, of all of these things believe that it's likely that people uh just will still lean to like the
141.12,144.96, bias of one side it's likely that they're not going to uh like get out of the echo chamber
144.96,145.0, second thing then believe that if you hit going to like get out of the echo chamber.
145.0,147.1," Second thing then, believe that if you hit people"
147.1,149.26," with this massive amounts of different information,"
149.26,150.66, like if you want to claim an impact
150.66,152.96," of like having massive expansion of public debate,"
152.96,155.66," a lot of people having like really nuanced stances on things,"
155.66,157.66, it's just too much for a lot of people to digest.
157.66,159.38, The impact here is that people get confused
159.38,160.9," and it's more likely that on proposition,"
160.9,162.36, they disengage from watching the news
162.36,163.76, and from politics completely.
163.76,169.12," Thirdly then, the most important mechanism here is that at besties people buy into populism. Why is this?"
169.12,174.96, Because we believe that if you portray different people and like different kinds of people like one
174.96,179.28, like moderate people or like liberal people and then populists like it's way less way more likely
179.28,183.52, that on the same display in airtime people are going to buy into populist narratives because
183.52,189.74," they're easier to understand and because that's what they want to buy into. Okay, then lastly, why is the fairness"
189.74,195.02," doctrine not likely to be well enforced on their side of the house? We believe that one, it's like"
195.02,198.6," if they want to claim some kind of committee that can like have an overview on this, it's likely"
198.6,201.68, that a committee can never be neutral because it's a government agency and that's controlled
201.68,210.24," by politicians. At best, it's like indirectly like fcc in the 70s where they crack down more on like um more on like certain types of the political"
210.24,215.12, spectrum and like more these radio broadcast uh things yeah then secondly on why their band
215.12,218.96, their panel can be biased too is that one it's likely to be mostly old white men is like with
218.96,222.8, every other field of society why should they suddenly get more representation than that
222.8,228.0, anywhere else it matters crucially for our second argument on marginalized groups then second reason why they can't have a
228.0,232.4, good implementation is because definitely the definition of fairness is really blurry note
232.4,236.96, that something can be hurtful but not hate speech so for example when jordan peterson says that if
236.96,240.88, a successful woman wants to not be harassed in the workplace it could it's a critical decision
240.88,244.48, to wear makeup these kinds of things can't be regulated on the other side of the house second
244.48,248.48, thing is that candidates can be unrepresentative of a party but there's no clear
248.48,253.84, line if they want to claim that you get adequate representation no clear line on this no thank you
254.4,259.2, this means that there are loopholes for abuse and that this means that tv broadcasters are unlikely
259.2,262.8, to be harshly controlled and even if they're controlled this is likely to be in favor of the
262.8,272.0," current government what government uh parties and over represent groups in society. Why is this important? This is important because proposition is unlikely to get any of the benefits they're claiming, because they have to explain"
272.0,287.44," whether fairness doctrine will work perfectly. And secondly, there's an additional harm because you get a veil of credibility, where broadcasters and claim to be like this case, assuming the best case of proposition where they have a perfect implementation."
287.88,294.0, First argument then on radicalization on the most extreme parts of the spectrum that they claim to not change under their separate house.
294.5,299.12, We believe that these people have an incentive to watch the news and status quo because they get some information but in their frame.
299.24,308.24," So this looks like from a pro-life perspective, people, people wanting to know when abortion rights change, but from a perspective of of why this is bad this means that people only stick to a channel if it's convenient"
308.24,312.24, enough for them to do so this only means that this also means that there's an influence for people
312.24,316.08, who dictate whether the frame is still extreme enough for people like donald trump to shape these
316.08,321.04, things what happens in a proposition is that they claim exposure to the other side of the spectrum
321.04,324.64, like people questioning their views in their best case we believe that's what it's what's more
324.64,328.84," likely is that people don't want to listen to them, listen to this for two reasons."
328.96,332.36," One, people are scared of having their opinion challenged because if human psychology does,"
332.5,336.74, it's more convenient to stick to your own opinion. And it means like people are unlikely to take the
336.74,341.2," active decision to go against their default and to be open to this. Secondly, even if you don't"
341.2,349.6," buy this, especially for people who are at the extremes of the spectrum, they have lost the perception that other viewpoints have a legitimacy. So this looks like"
349.6,353.92," current news outlets, like their current news outlets, framing news in a way that they have"
354.48,358.16, an interest to appeal to people who already question the system. This looks like claims
358.16,362.56, that the other sides are just fake news. This looks like playing into conspiracy theories and
362.56,366.9," like taking a defensive position against like liberals, for example, with Fox News."
366.9,370.46, This means that portraying the other side is seen as an active attack on the value of
370.46,372.62, these people on proposition.
372.62,377.52," So for example, like portraying AOC on Fox News defending abortion rights is viewed as"
377.52,379.62, publicly defending murder.
379.62,384.24," What happens then as an impact is that people move away from news channels to alternative,"
384.24,388.68, more extreme news sources where they feel themselves confirmed. This is likely to be networks like the True
388.68,392.58," Social or Telegram because it's an assembly of people who, like you, agree that other"
392.58,396.96, news become too soft or infiltrated. This looks like the more liberal people are portrayed
396.96,401.38," as legitimate on proposition and the more equity regulations they want to claim, the"
401.38,409.52," more this is true. What does this look like then? One, this looks like Fox News already having lost a significant number of viewers only by moving from the election was"
409.52,414.38, stolen to spending airtime on the election was lost. This looks like Trump calling people to
414.38,418.42, boycott Twitter and moving to truth social because it's the only place where freedom of speech is
418.42,423.34," left. Noted as a significant number of people who already buy into this, this is even more so"
423.34,429.5," on proposition. Why is this incredibly bad? One, because of less accountability that other media outlets and in this status quo"
429.5,433.8, still call out outlets like Fox News and show their ridicule or danger some statements. And
433.8,437.58," secondly, because of more actionability. Before I move on, I'll take a quick POI."
439.92,444.3," Yeah, on your point about people losing interest in news because it's no longer understandable,"
444.46,448.64, it's in the best interest of these broadcast companies to make news digestible so that they
448.64,452.92, keep viewership up. Isn't that going to essentially guarantee that people are still engaged and now
452.92,458.0, just getting more information? If you want to claim your best case that debates are going to
458.0,462.98," be simplified, this plays more into the fact that populism is going to be more responded to on your"
462.98,469.76, side of the house because they are the most likely ones to be simple and to appeal to people moving on then on why actionability in these news outlets
469.76,475.76, is so bad because alternative networks like through social or like telegram have more
475.76,478.96, possibility to organize things which means that it's more likely that we get things like
478.96,484.08, a new january 6th under their side why does this group and this argument win this debate one
484.08,493.2," because the likelihood of harm that occurs like and like the scope of harm that might occur under new January 6 is incredibly big. Secondly, because it's irreversible because you can never get these people back."
493.2,505.68," And thirdly, because we prove that it's unlikely to change for the better on opposition. Then lastly, shortly, on marginalized groups, because we see that this motion also applies to topics that discuss marginalized groups, things like women's rights, police violence against people of color, etc."
505.84,510.78," In the status quo, broadcasters have a right to treat systemic issues as an objective problem."
511.04,517.84," On proposition, broadcasters are forced to portray them as issues of public discussion because you have to include an opposition."
518.0,530.32, This is extremely harmful because marginalized groups now have to put up with people like Jordan Peterson telling them that like trans women are not real women on this this looks like them having to put up with Ben Shapiro telling
530.32,534.1, them that women can't be this we believe that people deserve a safe space underneath and this
534.1,535.36, is why you vote opposition
538.9,553.14, thanks speaker for the fine remarks and I'll invite the second speaker from side proposition.
554.6,558.52, Okay. Am I audible?
565.0,567.48, Yeah. Great. And my time starts now.
570.7,572.32," Look, judge, the minute Team Germany lost this debate was the minute that they conceded"
572.32,574.76, to all the numerous harms that we give you
574.76,577.46, as a direct result of political polarization
577.46,579.52," and radicalization, yet do nothing"
579.52,581.4, on their side of the house to combat it.
581.4,582.58, I'm gonna do a few things in this speech.
582.58,584.26," Firstly, a few extraneous rebuttals,"
584.26,587.2, then I'm gonna talk about their main substantive on like radicalization and people
587.2,591.36, leaving these broadcast media for like worse forms of media and then give a piece of substantive so
591.36,595.68, firstly a few extraneous rebuttals the essentially only reason they say as to why people are no longer
595.68,600.32, going to watch the news on our side of the house is one because scientists are like not very like
600.32,604.64, telegenic and aren't very like you know passionate people don't want to watch them and secondly because
604.64,607.52, scientists have differing opinions so a few reasons why this falls
607.52,611.92, firstly it's simply not true that scientists can't be like fun engaging personalities i mean look at
611.92,617.28, like bill nye the science guy children adults all love him love watching him they can be charismatic
617.28,620.88, but also like what we bring up at the point of information is that news sources are really really
620.88,627.7, good at making things that might seem boring on certain levels very engaging and fun to watch watch. We think that news sources do this all the time. They'll be able to
627.7,631.02," continue doing it on our side of the house. Secondly, this point here on there being like"
631.02,635.76," very different opinions from scientists. So yes, this is the point. We understand that some science"
635.76,640.3, based issues and some political issues do have a variety of opinions. This is why we prefer a world
640.3,644.7, in which those opinions are published and like mandatorily published so that everyone is forced
644.7,648.72," to engage with them. So yes, we are like like i think it's important that we present equal views give"
648.72,652.08, different voices to different scientists or different politicians who believe different
652.08,655.84, things and i would also point out that on the issue of scientists we would much prefer scientists
655.84,659.84, taking the charge on science-based issues than politicians being mouthpieces for things that
659.84,664.4, they really don't have any credit like credit like credits to be talking about on this level
664.96,665.44, uh that
665.44,670.08, falls then this next like weird point now on populism so first of all populism is symmetrical
670.08,674.16, i mean populism exists in the status quo and they have like mouthpieces through existing new sources
674.16,678.32, in the status quo to exist so at our worst that's absolutely symmetrical but i would argue that
678.32,683.12, populism is more likely on their side of the house because nothing breathes client breathes populism
683.12,685.36, more than a climate of hatred and more than a climate
685.36,689.92," of like a majority of people hating the minority of people in different places. At worst, populism"
689.92,693.84," is like symmetrical. At best, it falls much more heavily on their side of the house. And finally,"
693.84,698.16," now on the model. So like, look, we're doing our absolute best to prevent bias. They set an"
698.16,703.76," unreasonably high bar when they say we need to be perfect and like deciding what is news, what is"
703.76,707.52," like going to be like falling into the fairness doctrine, what isn't. Look, we just need to be perfect and admit like being like deciding what is news what is like going to be like falling to the fairness doctrine what isn't look we just need to be able to show that compared"
707.52,711.76, to the terrible status quo there is going to be an improvement look we tell you that there are going
711.76,715.76, to be three like people like from across the political spectrum represented we're gonna have
715.76,719.12, three republicans three democrats three independents we tell you this worked in arizona
719.12,722.32, and we tell you that things like making sure that trump is going to be allowed to say whatever he
722.32,726.6," wants isn't going to happen when you have people from the other side of the political spectrum saying, no,"
726.6,729.86, this is fake news. We're not going to allow this to be broadcast to people and everyday
729.86,733.6," civilians. Realistically, our model still stands. They need to help push them much harder"
733.6,737.5," for it to topple. But now, more importantly, on these ideas of radicalization. So the first"
737.5,741.4," claim that they make here is that people have different views. Yes, we do concede that people"
741.4,745.38, have different views. That's human nature. But I would point out there's a big difference
745.38,746.88, between having different views
746.88,749.32, and only ever having access to those views
749.32,750.92, and only ever seeing those views
750.92,752.52, represented on news sources.
752.52,753.9, That is the status quo.
753.9,755.22, And that is the mechanism we give you
755.22,756.6," on our side of the house as to why,"
756.6,758.86, when you only have access to one type of news
758.86,761.2, and one like left wing or right wing of news
761.2,762.76, is when you get radicalization.
762.76,764.18," We tell you that with social media,"
764.18,768.58," through things like the algorithm, once you watch one article on Fox News, that algorithm will only"
768.58,772.3, ever recommend you articles from Fox News. That forces you to not engage with the other side.
772.58,776.64, We tell you that there is an economic incentive from political parties for these news sources to
776.64,780.82, only publish one side of the information. This is the moment when you get radicalization and you get
780.82,785.0, people demonizing the other side. Note that it's very ironic that they talk about things
785.0,786.62, like the January 6th riots
786.62,789.28, when this is a direct result of the political polarization
789.28,792.64, which exists in a status quo and they do nothing to stop.
792.86,793.94, This is the point where you believe
793.94,795.36, that the opposite side is spreading lies.
795.62,796.96, This is the point where you do not want to engage.
797.16,798.8, We make it happen on our side of the house
798.8,800.98, and Germany essentially does nothing to make it stop.
801.42,802.5, And lastly now on this idea
802.5,804.02, of people leaving social media.
804.38,808.78," So I'd say a few things to this. Firstly, social media is heavily regulated as to misinformation"
808.78,812.4," and disinformation. So I would argue that to an increasing extent and over time, there's"
812.4,816.18, going to be less of an ability for people to leave mainstream broadcast news sources
816.18,820.98, and access misinformation and alt-right or alt-left news on social media. I'd argue that
820.98,824.84, that is generally speaking going in a positive direction in terms of not even having access
824.84,828.1," to it in the first place. If that's not having something they have access to, on our"
828.1,831.58," side of the house, they're at least forced to engage with multiple sides of the spectrum. But"
831.58,836.12," secondly, they concede to our characterization of a majority of viewers being what we call"
836.12,840.08," passive viewers, people who are not like actively seeking, like actively not engaging with the other"
840.08,850.0, side. Note that going to radical news sources on like underground social media sites takes a large amount of initiative initiative which your everyday average viewer does not have.
850.0,868.4," So therefore, even if we can see that a small number of people who are openly ignorant are seeking out misinformation as a result of this, that is not enough to sway things like elections, that is not enough to cause the riots we saw on January 6, That is not enough to have the radicalization that we see in our everyday life pervade politics. We still support it on our side of the house. I'll take the point before"
868.4,874.88," moving on. The more liberals you claim to be on Fox News to be able to moderate these people,"
874.88,879.44, the more people are going to move to true social. How are they going to moderate if they just move
879.44,884.94," away completely without any way for regulation? Okay, look, I just touched on this. I'll add a"
884.94,886.0, little bit just like in case you want it.
886.0,890.0," The majority of broadcast news networks have started moving towards social media,"
890.0,894.0," which means that now in the status quo, people can access Fox News on social media."
894.0,897.0, People can access CNN on social media.
897.0,900.0," Therefore, once we fix this problem on Fox News, on CNN,"
900.0,903.0," from the broadcasting perspective, that simultaneously solves the problem"
903.0,907.84," on the social media perspective, even if we buy that people are getting the majority of their news from social"
907.84,912.4, media so thirdly now how we strengthen through all like all three branches of government firstly
912.4,916.88, democratic institutions in and of themselves so in the status quo politics has converted from an
916.88,920.96, institution which is meant to discuss policy and solutions to our most pressing issues to one in
920.96,925.18, which politicians focus most of their time attacking other people for being immoral bigots.
925.18,931.22," And note that the reason that they do this is because, in part, of partisan news sources looking to gather soundbites,"
931.26,935.98, which will be published on news sources and gain attention both for the company and for the politician.
936.28,939.96," Therefore, we have people like Bolsonaro in Brazil attacking the Supreme Court to end up on Veja,"
940.2,945.12," or AOC going on a diatribe against Kevin McCarthy to get on MSNBC, and together they feed the media"
945.12,949.48," beast. And more so than that, we exist in a political climate where party lines cannot ever"
949.48,953.94," be crossed, which is to say if a Republican votes out of the party, like when Liz Cheney did when"
953.94,957.84, she spoke out against Trump's role in the Capitol riots and was removed as the leader of the House
957.84,961.8," of Representatives, they will immediately be outcast from the party, even if that piece of"
961.8,965.56, policy or what they were saying is not something that their voting constituents would support.
965.56,968.34," So in essence, bipartisan policy and consensus"
968.34,969.98, is becoming increasingly rare.
969.98,971.58," Therefore, on our side of the house,"
971.58,973.04, by lessening the echo chamber
973.04,975.4," and stopping right and left wing radicalization,"
975.4,977.0, but also by forcing opposing views
977.0,978.68," to be humanized and respected,"
978.68,980.36, the fairness doctrine increases the likelihood
980.36,981.2, of two things.
981.2,983.8," Firstly, better policy, because politics is now focused"
983.8,986.6, on policy as opposed to politicians' personalities.
986.6,988.64," And secondly, more bipartisan policy"
988.64,990.7, is now opposing viewpoints are not demonized
990.7,992.06, to the extent that they are now.
992.06,994.38," Secondly, we strengthen the judicial branch."
994.38,995.78," So over time, judicial branches"
995.78,996.82, and especially the Supreme Court
996.82,998.78, have become a pawn for political zealots.
998.78,1000.48, So as opposed to interpreting the constitution
1000.48,1003.98," and upholding established law as is its purpose,"
1003.98,1006.28, judges now have essentially become political activists.
1006.28,1008.84, So judicial nominations are now political pawns
1008.84,1012.68, because the nomination process has been so politicized
1012.68,1014.66, that qualifications are now less important
1014.66,1017.06, than political belief and political affiliation.
1017.06,1018.9," So now, once on our side of the house,"
1018.9,1021.98, we make issues less polarized and less radicalized
1021.98,1024.52," and are able to add some nuance to political discussions,"
1024.52,1029.44, we are able to look at court cases in the context of the law and not in the context of party lines or political
1029.44,1034.32, affiliation as well as instilling respect for the institution as a whole which largely lacks in the
1034.32,1038.48, status quo and finally we improve the news note that for most of history the news was meant to
1038.48,1042.72, be the fourth branch of government which informed the population justly and kept a check on the
1042.72,1047.52," government now we do this because of everything we tell you in FIRST. By solving for the echo chamber and political polarization,"
1047.52,1051.36, we allow for new systems to do their job as opposed to being one-sided political pawns
1051.36,1056.16," which spout the views of whoever wants to fund them. For all of these reasons, I'm very proud to propose."
1062.16,1086.18," I thank the speaker for the fine remarks and I'll invite the second speaker from side opposition. Oh, a few eyes in chat, please. Perfect."
1089.62,1089.86," Petal, I'm unsure in what worlds the proposition lives in."
1096.1,1096.5," Because last time I checked, 30% of the US population doesn't believe that trans people are real."
1107.64,1113.08," 50% of the US population believes that the election was stolen. This means under a fairness doctrine, you necessarily have to give 50% of your airtime to people who claim that the election system is fraudulent. I think they're going to end up with"
1113.08,1118.04, a world where populism becomes worse because people are unlikely to understand the nuance
1118.04,1123.32," in the argument behind why the election system works rather than Trump saying, well, it just"
1123.32,1125.2," doesn't. Populism panel, and I think"
1125.2,1129.94," this is incredibly important, is effective because it's simple and this means people will always buy"
1129.94,1135.92," into that rather than some complicated metric. I think proposition thus loses this debate on that,"
1136.14,1140.52, based on that. I want to talk about four things in the speech broadly. I just want to first make
1140.52,1144.78, some notes on model and strategic push that was completely ignored in Clara's speech. Then I want
1144.78,1148.0," to talk about the three groups that are important in this debate, the silent middle,"
1148.0,1152.08," radicals and marginalized groups, and lastly I want to talk about why they decrease the quality"
1152.08,1156.24, of journalism and we'll clash that with the second speaker argument. Let's firstly talk about the
1156.24,1161.36, model because panel I'm just incredibly confused. They talk about wanting to have scientists on that
1161.36,1166.88," show but also somehow republicans and democrats will be on there. I think if Republicans and Democrats are on there,"
1166.88,1168.86," they can't claim all the benefits of,"
1168.86,1170.56," well, this speech is so great, right?"
1170.56,1172.84," Panel, look at how Trump and Hillary Clinton,"
1172.84,1174.78, look at how Trump and Joe Biden talk to each other
1174.78,1177.28," in the presidential debates even then, right?"
1177.28,1178.9," Even when the pressure was so high,"
1178.9,1180.9, they couldn't say one nice thing about each other.
1180.9,1183.06," Donald Trump called Joe Biden sleepy Joe,"
1183.06,1184.46, insulted him about being old.
1184.46,1188.88," I think it's unlikely that they ever regulate this because how would you make that hate speech, right? There's"
1188.88,1193.48," no clear line on that, right? I think this means that likely they end up with a situation where"
1193.48,1197.48, they have to give a platform to transphobe sexist people who believe the election was stolen.
1198.06,1202.44," I secondly think that their push on like, oh, broadcasters are paid off, they only radicalize"
1202.44,1210.14," on your side isn't true, right? I think one, it's largely untrue that like even like channels like Fox News are like sponsored bipartisan donors"
1210.14,1214.5, because they still have an incentive as the editorial board to stay independent from large
1214.5,1218.86," people, large financial people. But second, even if that were true, I think these channels largely"
1218.86,1223.32," don't radicalize because I think one, that deters moderates. Even Fox News has more moderate"
1223.32,1225.98, Republican viewers. I think they're unlikely to want to cater
1225.98,1227.6," to the extreme fringes,"
1227.6,1230.7, especially because they can already watch things like NRA TV.
1230.7,1233.24, This is why we see that Fox News largely shied away
1233.24,1235.76," from the statement, well, the election was stolen, right?"
1235.76,1238.0, I think this is largely done something that we already see
1238.0,1239.56," like not the extreme radicalization,"
1239.56,1241.56," but rather a move to the middle,"
1241.56,1243.48, like somewhat we're just staying in that sector.
1243.48,1244.72," I think even if that were true,"
1244.72,1248.0, I think that's better because people can more easily engage with that and that's largely
1248.0,1254.56, what they want to talk to about the silent middle panel i just want to make here because before i
1254.56,1258.64, come to clash and like responding to proposition because what clara talked to you about from one
1258.64,1263.36, minute was the idea that it's unlikely that because like the past precedent has never worked
1263.36,1265.58, this would work in propositions model.
1265.58,1266.94, She tells you about how the government is
1266.94,1268.4," likely to control that agency, and you're"
1268.4,1270.4, likely to end up with a partisan institution that
1270.4,1271.7, controls democratic discourse.
1271.7,1273.56, This is just horrible in and of itself.
1273.56,1276.48," Second, that panel is likely to be not represented."
1276.48,1278.72," One, has a panel ever been represented"
1278.72,1281.48, in any kind of political institution before?
1281.48,1283.28, I think it's unlikely that they can claim this.
1283.28,1292.54," And even if the definition of fairness is so blurry that they need to prove why this will be good and effective, because otherwise they end up with a world where right wing moderates, like right wing"
1292.54,1306.08," extremists are likely to control speech on their side of the house. This is a strategic push they have to respond to. Otherwise, they automatically lose. Because they give the stamp of approval, the veil of credibility to select them two channels who are still likely"
1306.08,1310.56, to not be like neutral as they claim on their side of the house i think to claim any benefit they
1310.56,1315.52, need to respond to that in second op in a third proposition but even if they are untrue let's
1315.52,1319.84, engage with what they tell me no thank you i think the silent middle is unlikely to ever change and
1319.84,1324.08, right that's what we tell you about populism how if you're presented with a large amount of
1324.08,1326.76," viewpoints that are likely to be like very different,"
1326.76,1331.04, there is a cognitive dissonance in me understanding that information and processing it.
1331.04,1335.22, I think that means likely that I buy into the most populist claim that is on there.
1335.22,1340.1, I think this already happens in the status quo. And don't let like don't let yourself get confused by second proposition.
1340.1,1344.36," I do well, but like at best, this is symmetric. No, it isn't panel at best."
1344.36,1345.6, This becomes worse on their
1345.6,1350.4, side of the house right i think the problem becomes that because they now have to air transphobes and
1350.4,1355.36, such more people buy into these harmful things more people buy into populism and the problem is
1355.36,1360.0, that it will be always advantageous for politicians to push populist rhetoric on either side of the
1360.0,1363.76, house this becomes worse on their side of the house because you give these populists more of
1363.76,1368.44," a platform to engage i think thus for people who aren't populist, it becomes incredibly harder to"
1368.44,1373.46, convince anyone because you always need to talk to populists. You can never explain the intricacies
1373.46,1378.52, of your argument and convince real Democrats what's bullshit to close the border panel. I think
1378.52,1383.4, this is incredibly important because it means that there's a bigger harm to the silent middle than a
1383.4,1385.12, benefit to them actually de-radicalizing.
1385.44,1388.28," By that, we're already taking down second speaker's argument, right?"
1388.28,1393.14," But let's engage with radicals then, because the only push here is, well, social media is regulated."
1393.5,1396.74, Is it really? Does it work with Twitter? I'm unsure this is even true.
1397.08,1402.72," But even if it were true, what we're pushing is the idea that you move to channels that aren't regulated, like Truth Social,"
1402.96,1408.88," and that's incredibly different to Twitter, because it's a channel that is so far right that most people don't know about it and"
1408.88,1413.76, most journalists can never get in and even join and like uncover this idea right i think the
1413.76,1418.4, problem is that the alt-right knows about this channel moves there and you completely disappear
1418.4,1423.68, until things like january 6th happen because of the immense actionability where you now know people
1423.68,1429.22," that want to storm the capital with you and even if you don't believe that the impact of this is so big, I think the problem is"
1429.22,1434.18, that you get an intense radicalized group that can now interact and push each other up about
1434.18,1439.38," attacking trans people, attacking minorities on the streets. This is incredibly bad. And I don't"
1439.38,1442.98, think it's fair for them to push that this is minority. Why panel? Because I think the more
1442.98,1445.04," they want to claim a neutralization of the middle, like Fox because i think the more they want to claim a neutralization"
1445.04,1450.16, of the middle the like of fox news essentially the more people want to move away from fox news
1450.16,1454.88, because you're suddenly being like like regulated by the middle you're being regulated by the weird
1454.88,1459.84, democrats by the evil other side and thus you want to move away to better platforms i think thus this
1459.84,1464.16, is the big winning because of the immediate actionability of that even if they want to
1464.16,1469.04, claim that they moderate the neutral like the the silent middle essentially you have to get these people to
1469.04,1473.44, vote you have to get them out on the streets and this is way harder than like literally like um
1474.08,1479.44, getting like like then like having these people smash streets smash stones at your car before i
1479.44,1484.32, move on to marginalized groups in my own argument yes please yeah so doesn't the speaker agree that
1484.32,1488.24, there are at least some people in the world who don't believe that trans people are real as a direct
1488.24,1494.0, result of them not accessing valid and moderate news sources no i don't think that i think that's
1494.0,1498.08, the case right because i think the difficulty with the most like emoting with these statements is
1498.08,1502.56, that you have to change your whole girl you right where these things like oh but biology is real you
1502.56,1507.4, can't change biology are so deeply ingrained in you that it's unlikely to ever change on either side of the house.
1507.48,1511.1," I think at best, they're more likely to bind to biology. Let's quickly address marginalized groups."
1511.2,1518.92, I think they never respond to this as incredibly harmful and debate winning for us because you harm them on either side of the house because you need to platform views that actively harm them.
1518.92,1522.1," With that, why do we decrease the quality of journalism uniquely on proposition?"
1522.64,1525.48," Because I think journalism is good because of critical questions, right?"
1525.48,1527.04, It makes news accessible to people
1527.04,1528.3, because you can now deal with it
1528.3,1530.4, when scenarios are broken down to you.
1530.4,1532.34, This doesn't happen anymore for two reasons.
1532.34,1534.4," One, because self-censorship means that journalists"
1534.4,1536.58, avoid critical and controversial questions
1536.58,1538.92, where they're incredibly scared of being fired or fined
1538.92,1540.9, when they write reports or articles.
1540.9,1542.92, An example of this is a BBC journalist
1542.92,1545.2, that covered Black Lives Matter protests in London
1545.2,1549.84, and was fired because her coverage was deemed too biased just because she reported on one person
1549.84,1554.48, more that was a part of the protesters. I think you miss out on crucial coverage with that because
1554.48,1558.88," of self-censorship. Then second, you're less able to take a side on scandals, right? Because the"
1558.88,1562.5," problem becomes that because you want to get to this neutrality so much, especially if you're"
1562.5,1568.24," literally imprisoned if you break that, I think the problem becomes that you soften your wording and rather say like,"
1568.24,1571.76," oh, like maybe President Trump broke his constitutional mandate,"
1571.76,1576.24," rather than saying that was illegal panel, that was an insurrection and people were killed."
1576.24,1580.56," This is extremely important because proposition loses out by their own metric, because everyone"
1580.56,1584.32," loses out on high quality journalism on either side of the house. And second,"
1584.32,1588.26, you end up with less accountability where scandals are less likely to be covered.
1588.26,1590.44, So proud to oppose.
1590.44,1598.56, I thank the speaker for the fine remarks and I invite the third speaker from side proposition.
1598.56,1601.16," Okay, am I audible?"
1601.16,1602.96," Yes, you are."
1602.96,1606.04," Okay, and I prefer my POS in the chat, by the way."
1606.04,1608.14, Just give me one second to set up my timer.
1613.16,1614.0, Okay.
1614.84,1618.54," If everyone's ready, then my time starts now."
1618.54,1622.48," Panel, side opposition seems to be against radical politics"
1622.48,1626.56, and populism so long as it's only right wing they tell us it's
1626.56,1632.16, okay to use radical rhetoric as long as it's pro-trans and anti-Donald Trump if it's on the
1632.16,1637.12, other side then it's incorrect this is something that side proposition exclusively protects panel
1637.76,1643.92, fairness for absolutely every single political opinion this debate is not one about judging like
1643.92,1645.08," placing a value on any given political opinion this debate debate is not one about judging, like placing a value on"
1645.08,1649.7, any given political opinion. This debate is about ensuring that every single political
1649.7,1654.4," opinion can be heard by every single individual, and therefore all those individuals are able"
1654.4,1659.26," to make better, well-informed decisions and are therefore better voters. This is something"
1659.26,1663.62," that side proposition exclusively provides, and that's why we're going to win this debate."
1663.62,1669.6," Two main points of class in my speech today, one on where we actually decrease polarization and radicalism and one on"
1669.6,1673.84, who gets better policy and therefore a better function of democracy. But at the top of my speech
1673.84,1678.24, I just want to do a bit of extraneous rebuttal on some minor points brought up by Team Germany.
1678.24,1682.56," So first on this idea of whether news is complicated and difficult to digest. Look,"
1682.56,1690.04," they tell us that particularly for the silent middle, who are not super, super engaged in politics, yet make up the majority of citizens"
1690.04,1695.02," around the world, news is an extremely difficult thing for them to understand. Look, yet somehow,"
1695.34,1699.42," this is only the case in our world where news has to be shared on both sides, right?"
1699.84,1705.26," Look, the reality is that if news is complicated in our world, it's also extremely complicated"
1705.26,1706.96," inside Germany's world, right?"
1706.96,1711.94, We in fact think that news is likely going to be more digestible in our side of the house
1711.94,1715.9, where politicians have to like improve the quality of their writing and speeches if they
1715.9,1720.66, want to actually gain support by virtue of the fact that individuals are not only hearing
1720.66,1724.26," their opinions, but rather the opinions of essentially every other politician who has"
1724.26,1728.18," a stance on a given issue, right? This is why we're also going to see the quality of"
1728.18,1732.92," journalism increase on our side of the house, contrary to what Germany was telling you. Again,"
1732.98,1737.64, because journalism for a given opinion needs to be of a higher quality that's going to convince
1737.64,1741.6," individuals who are no longer convinced simply by the fact that it's the only thing they're hearing,"
1741.6,1748.24, but because of the fact that they are like forced to choose between a number of opinions right now this idea of just like briefly clarifying our
1748.24,1753.92, moral i'm like just a kind of an overall point on like the purpose of this debate right the point is
1753.92,1758.16, that we're introducing a model that's meant to improve the status quo because germany never
1758.16,1762.8, provided us with a counter model that's going to do better they're by virtue like defending the
1762.8,1765.04, status quo right so they need to show that our
1765.04,1770.0, world is going to be significantly worse or even marginally worse than the status quo so long as we
1770.0,1774.96, can prove that even one person is less radicalized in our world we've won this debate because germany
1774.96,1778.8, never gave us a counter model that's supposed to be better right look i try to clarify what that
1778.8,1782.72, model is again we told you and it's like it's going to deal with the point about scientists
1782.72,1790.0, being like uncharismatic or whatever we told you we're going to have a panel of experts both scientists and politicians
1790.0,1794.08, to like agree with the fact that some people do have bias regardless of whether how hard they try
1794.08,1798.16, to fight it or not right we're going to have people from every single side of like the political
1798.16,1801.76, spectrum they tell us this is impossible we literally told you from first that it literally
1801.76,1808.72, happened in arizona to prevent gerrymandering we had three democrats three republicans and three independents the world in which those kind of
1808.72,1813.6, people can never agree judges is inside opposition's world right the world in which those
1813.6,1817.6, people only hear their own opinions so long as we're furthering political discourse which is
1817.6,1822.48, exactly what our model seeks to do we're actually going to get a more efficient panel over time in
1822.48,1825.12," our world right so now this idea about like briefly,"
1825.26,1828.72, I just want to touch on whether we're like protecting marginalized groups and doing enough
1828.72,1833.92," for minorities. Look, a couple things here. They tell us that they want minorities to have a safe"
1833.92,1837.38, space. They don't want them to get on the internet and feel like they're being bullied by Jordan
1837.38,1841.92," Patterson and Ben Shapiro. Look, I also want every individual in the world to feel comfortable."
1842.32,1849.02," The reality is that that's literally not what the world looks like, panel. The purpose of news is not to make you feel safe, cushioned, and comfortable."
1849.36,1854.02," The purpose of news, when it's at its best, is to challenge what you know about the world that you"
1854.02,1858.78," live in, right? That's exactly why we're okay with having some people have to hear other opinions,"
1858.86,1862.96," right? Because you may disagree with one thing Jordan Peterson says, but if that blocks you from"
1862.96,1868.98," listening to the rest of his platform, you may miss out on something that you actually do agree with, right? We support safe"
1868.98,1873.38, spaces and all that. We just don't think that news has that responsibility and they've never shown
1873.38,1878.44," us why it necessarily does, right? Now to move on to this point about polarization and public"
1878.44,1882.62, discourse and populism here. So first I'm going to address this point about people moving to like
1882.62,1890.78," Trulie and Parler and all that. A couple things here. One, no part of our model is exclusive with the regulation of Parler and Truly."
1890.94,1898.24," We can get up here and tell you that we support these apps being disbanded and destroyed while simultaneously supporting the Fairness Doctrine, right?"
1898.24,1909.6," They never told us why these are suddenly exclusive. Therefore, it has literally nothing to do with breaking down our model right but additionally even if this isn't the case and we have to support a world in which parlor and truly"
1909.6,1913.76, still exists i'm going to tell you why that's like not necessarily a case or winning point for
1913.76,1919.28, germany right they conceded it in their speech just now most people don't even know about truly
1919.28,1924.16, this is exactly why this is not as dangerous of a point as side opposition thinks it is the reality
1924.16,1928.68, is that the only individuals who are going to shift towards Trulia and Parler are people who are probably
1928.68,1934.1," already on there or already considering getting on there, i.e. people who are already highly"
1934.1,1939.3, radicalized and we've already told you are likely not going to be shifted towards centrism on either
1939.3,1944.14, side of the house. This brings me to the most important and the most heaviest piece of our case
1944.14,1946.76," today, which is on what Germany calls the silent middle."
1947.0,1953.96," We told you from first, this is the most important winning point in this debate because it's the largest group in society."
1954.38,1958.98, And also because they're the ones who are going to be likely shifted by either side of the house.
1959.22,1968.64, So they're the ones in Germany's world without media regulation are more likely to fall further and further into echo chamber just because one day they picked CNN or one day they picked Fox or one day they picked
1968.64,1974.88, whatever it is they like to read right the reality is that in our world we accept like we do a little
1974.88,1979.68, bit more to change them right so they told us in first that these people are kind of scared to take
1979.68,1983.84, active decisions about the news that they read this is exactly the characterization that we've
1983.84,1985.0, been telling you look the reality is that in the status quo the world that they read. This is exactly the characterization that we've been telling you.
1985.0,1994.0," Look, the reality is that in the status quo, the world that Germany supports, we put the responsibility on individuals to ensure that they are reading enough of different points of views."
1994.0,2006.0," When in reality, the people that are kind of poisoning them and pushing them towards radicalization are these politicians and are these news companies? We put the responsibility on them. Not only are we principally making politics more fair"
2006.0,2008.26, by putting like the blame on the actual people
2008.26,2010.44," who are pushing radicalism and populism,"
2010.44,2012.04, but also because we allow people
2012.04,2014.42," to not have to fight really, really hard"
2014.42,2016.82, to not be radicalized by the nature of algorithms
2016.82,2019.0," and the nature of news in Germany's world, right?"
2019.0,2021.94, So we're putting our responsibility in the right place
2021.94,2024.78, and we're allowing people to not have to fight so hard.
2024.78,2025.34, Every time they
2025.34,2030.66," open an article, be it CNN or Fox, they're going to get as many sides as possible on that given"
2030.66,2035.46, issue. That is going to allow them to fight those unconscious biases and get people who have much
2035.46,2040.32, more nuanced knowledge of politics and a variety of opinions. I'll take a point before a projected
2040.32,2044.82, time. Can a Black trans woman ever watch news on your side of the house without being harmed
2044.82,2049.32," because there are literal identities being questioned by everyone? Look, the reality is that"
2049.32,2055.94," Black trans women, her identity is being criticized by people in your side of the house just as often."
2056.26,2060.6, Her choosing to not engage with that set of opinions doesn't necessarily mean that she's
2060.6,2065.12, any safer or any better off. What it does mean is that the people who feel that way
2065.12,2070.64," about her do not ever have to listen to her or people like her, right? If you support like the"
2070.64,2074.56," protection of these women, they're actually significantly better off on our side of the house"
2074.56,2079.44, where Fox News cannot exclusively push anti-trans but also need to give platforms to those trans
2079.44,2087.86," people. If we can convince even one anti-trans person to become like pro-trans side, like opposition's own standards, we've already won this debate, right?"
2087.86,2091.28," And this is the same narrative that I need for populism, right?"
2091.28,2095.62, The idea that every single opinion is going to be simplified so
2095.62,2098.9, that people still want to engage with news because that's how these companies make money.
2098.9,2101.4, This is why populism is not suddenly taking over.
2101.4,2104.48," Trump was a populist leader in opposition status quo, right?"
2104.48,2109.36, We think he would have gotten less popularity in our set of the house where fox news couldn't only push pro-trump stuff
2109.36,2114.96, right so because we're actively commenting polarization and allowing politicians to take
2114.96,2130.44, non-partisan viewpoints without being attacked by their own party very proud to propose I thank the speaker for the fine remarks I now invite the third speaker from side opposition
2154.64,2156.68, so Can everyone hear me?
2156.98,2158.2, Okay.
2161.22,2161.98," Pronouns, Shia, PYs, order blue, please."
2162.12,2170.06," Yeah. I'll start my speech in three, two, one. Panel, from the very start of today's debate,"
2170.14,2174.92, we have given you multiple mechanisms on why we believe implementation and proposition won't be
2174.92,2178.62," as rosy as they have talked to you about, right? I've told you about the blurry fairness that"
2178.62,2182.74," exists, the biases of the panel, and how that would likely mean that because of all of the"
2182.74,2189.54," bureaucracy, et cetera, it's going to be incredibly hard to actually enforce it the way proposition uh wants to have it the reason that"
2189.54,2195.06, this matters is because we tell you there's people with a very intrinsic motivation to not do it as
2195.06,2199.68, well as proposition likes to paint people as right this then means a proposition just to come here
2199.68,2203.82, and tell us oh you know because there's different viewpoints just between everyone and everything
2203.82,2208.04, that's just going to be the best option is not enough to engage with a scenario and characterization
2208.04,2213.3, that we have provided you from the very first speech. This then means that we can tell you
2213.3,2217.4," about, oh, you know, like, there's going to be so many discussions about the criteria, it's"
2217.4,2222.36," incredibly hard for people to know whether or not they should portray, they should platform an"
2222.36,2225.46," opinion, because they're scared of being put in prison under"
2225.46,2230.86," proposition, but also because they are just going to listen to the loudest voices that are out there"
2230.86,2235.06, and therefore probably platform someone that is incredibly hurtful because they're so passionate
2235.06,2240.26," about that topic. This then means under proposition, they have to prove to us why their model will be"
2240.26,2243.84," implemented well, right? Because if they're not able to prove that, we tell you one, they do not"
2243.84,2248.72," have any impact, but two, they actively make the entire situation worse by getting people the veil"
2248.72,2252.48, of credibility and people now thinking that they're valid in their own opinion therefore
2252.48,2257.28, meaning all of the harms that they themselves talk about about polarization in society etc
2257.28,2263.28, just gets exponentially worse under proposition now let me move on to the uh to the clashes which
2263.28,2265.56, were like there was more discussion in the actual debate.
2265.78,2272.04," Firstly, about the discussion that we're likely to have in the political middle ground, afterwards on radicals and then on the marginalized groups in society."
2272.5,2279.38," Okay, on this idea of the moderate or like on the middle ground proposition presents us this idea of like preventing more polarization."
2280.16,2283.26," The idea is telling us that they're mainly affecting passive viewers, right?"
2283.34,2284.16, We agree with this.
2284.22,2286.2," However, we would like to add to that characterization."
2286.76,2289.26," We tell you these people are most likely not the most open-minded,"
2289.38,2291.54," but already have preconceived notions, right?"
2291.82,2295.04," This is because one, otherwise they would already switch channels in the status quo,"
2295.3,2297.82," but two, otherwise they would not be affected under any side"
2297.82,2300.56," because they were probably either knowledgeable, informed, and opinionated"
2300.56,2303.0," because they're so open-minded and willing to do research,"
2303.0,2308.42, or they're just so open that they have no opinion at all this then means that we believe it's incredibly important to think
2308.42,2312.58, about how these preconceived notions are going to affect people right we give you three detailed
2312.58,2317.26, scenarios and people either being valued but being able to know thank you to engage with any other
2317.26,2321.42, things because they do not understand how that works or them just being confused and disengaging
2321.42,2328.1, because they have no information they don't have the critical like skills to analyze anything yet because they're just so overwhelmed that the amount of
2328.1,2332.3, information proposition is forcing on them but also because people could just like judge case
2332.3,2336.64, by case and not really have an information right and thirdly we tell it's incredibly harmful and
2336.64,2340.4, proposition wants to platform so many different opinions talking about three democrats three
2340.4,2348.66," republicans etc the opinions are going to be so simple that people would just choose the one that speaks to them more, which is going to be populism, right?"
2348.96,2353.0," This looks like it's easier to believe, oh, you know, inflation is simply just because of Biden."
2353.12,2353.92, There's no other reason.
2354.18,2356.02," This looks like, you know, the gender is just a binary."
2356.2,2357.44, There's no reason to believe otherwise.
2357.44,2362.44," Or it just means, oh, the jobs are gone because the immigrants are coming and you see them around you."
2363.24,2364.1, So that's the reason.
2364.32,2369.44, These are the simpler ways to live your life. and this is what is going to happen under proposition
2370.08,2375.12, proposition just tells us oh this is a metric we tell it explicitly this is not symmetric because
2375.12,2379.76, proposition gives them a bigger platform right this analysis is more believable than the echo
2379.76,2383.92, chamber analysis proposition gives you because of because if echo chambers really are just
2384.88,2385.68, based purely on
2385.68,2390.4, randomness and not on preconceived notions this randomness is going to play out the same under
2390.4,2394.16, either side of the house right this just means even under proposition they're probably just
2394.16,2398.32, randomly going to believe the first channel and the first person on that channel they come around
2398.32,2402.0, we don't see an impact on their side of the house when they tell you oh you know scientists and
2402.0,2405.12, politicians will guide them which how tell you scientists are not charismatic.
2406.96,2407.2," This is what we're seeing in the COVID pandemic, right?"
2411.52,2411.62," We tell you about like inflation, how there's so many different like reasons why this is happening."
2414.82,2415.04," No one believes it. We tell you about politicians, they have no incentive to do so."
2417.56,2417.88, We don't think proposition can claim the benefits under this.
2422.32,2422.5, The second argument on political institutions is completely dependent on the first argument working out.
2428.48,2432.56, And it's actually getting more nuanced debate. believe that completely falls out of this debate but thirdly we're telling even if information is actually what matters in the debate and about changing people's opinion we are the side that
2432.56,2436.32, achieves that better right especially in the long term we're telling you about the quality of
2436.32,2442.48, journalism that is not under proposition no thank you because of self-censorship because people are
2442.48,2449.62, not able to take a side they can't accurately portray things when things actually like go into incredibly bad direction especially because
2449.62,2453.7, proposition talks about imprisonment in the long term we're the only side that can give like
2453.7,2459.9, proper quality journalism onto the next slash then onto radicals what do we tell you here
2459.9,2464.12, proposition doesn't engage with any of this like nuanced analysis right because we tell you the
2464.12,2469.44, reason why people are getting more radical is not is not simply oh you know like they have the
2469.44,2474.4, option but much rather because they now do not feel represented under proposition they do not
2474.4,2479.68, see themselves having the option of going to fox news which is still has still has some kind of
2479.68,2483.84, accountability and still is in the public discussion right because they do not see their
2483.84,2488.48, opinions being valued to the same degree on those platforms they have to move away before i move on
2488.48,2493.82, yes please please engage with our point about bipartisanship in the government in your world
2493.82,2498.14, we saw roe v wade overturned by republicans who were forced to stick to their most extreme party
2498.14,2502.24, line whereas previously republicans protected it because it was of their personal opinion
2502.24,2508.74, this would be combated in our world please engage we tell you that that is not true right we believe polarization is only going to
2508.74,2512.64, get worse under your side of her house especially if you need to convince so many people like
2512.64,2516.48, there's a much larger group for you it's just so much more likely that you're just going to stick
2516.48,2520.04, to the easy line and just make sure that that is easy to understand we don't believe you're
2520.04,2524.82, going to get any nuance and any discussion under proposition okay then we tell you that radical
2524.82,2528.82, people are extremely scared of being like challenged it's comfort etc proposition just
2528.82,2532.76, tells you oh we're either just going to ban these platforms or you know like it's just not going to
2532.76,2536.86, be mattering we believe that that's not true right we have told you so many more times that just
2536.86,2542.76, saying social media is regulated is not enough to deal with this we point to you like true uh trump's
2542.76,2546.92," like true social twitter we tell you reddit it tell you Reddit, it's hard. It's already enough"
2546.92,2550.58, if on one of these platforms it's hateful. We think that is already enough to prove our point
2550.58,2554.72," of them being more radical. When you lose this accountability, when you lose the actionability,"
2554.88,2559.56," when you're not able to do anything, we believe that's harmful. Why radicalization is so important"
2559.56,2563.18," in today's debate though is one because it's the most immediate danger, right? They already have"
2563.18,2567.44," these platforms, they already know what to say, but also because it's such a low barrier for them to now"
2567.44,2572.16, jump to the next point because radicals moving to be even more radical is a lot more harmful than
2572.16,2577.04, moderates now maybe going on to some rallies etc but also because it poses a direct threat they
2577.04,2581.84, are going to attack people if we don't stop them it's on such a large scale when you see radicals
2581.84,2589.28, just like being so passionate being so invested in this issue but also because we believe it's just harmful when these people are there to actively
2589.28,2593.68, hurt people we think that's the worst harm and that's the thing that we need to prevent the most
2593.68,2599.2, in today's event onto the last clash about the marginalized groups where we tell you um an
2599.2,2604.64, incredibly nuanced analysis right we tell you in the status quo they can just choose to not engage
2604.64,2609.0," and they can choose then to not be hurt by all of these things. Under proposition, they're either"
2609.0,2612.88," hurt when they try to inform themselves, or they just disengage because they can't deal with all"
2612.88,2617.26," of this. Proposition just tells us, oh, you know, it's not our goal. It's not our obligation to make"
2617.26,2621.14, sure they have a safe space. You could just like accept the fact that you're being challenged the
2621.14,2627.52," entirety. Firstly, it's a fact to what's being on these news platforms, right? We've already explained to you why that is incredibly likely that it's just going"
2627.52,2632.54," to be attacked. Two, in the status quo, they can actually choose to remove themselves from her."
2632.92,2636.56, Proposition needs to tell us why they think it's okay that a person is now just going to be
2636.56,2641.12, attacked in their own identity every single day and how that harm is not incredibly important.
2641.58,2645.4," Thirdly, we believe they don't engage with a scenario of them on their"
2645.4,2649.96, news channels now actively worsening real life interactions right this is not something that
2649.96,2653.98, is only in the media this is something that translates into microaggressions into attacks
2653.98,2657.82, in real life proposition has to justify why they believe that is something they're willing to give
2657.82,2662.32, up actively harming these people than being the sacrifice in today's debate we're incredibly proud
2662.32,2670.24, to oppose. Thank you.
2713.74,2718.38, I thank the speaker for the fine remarks. I now invite the opposition to play. panel. panel at the point where we proved to you that the harm of a group of people moving to an uncontrollable field where they're radicalized and it's more likely that we get things like
2718.38,2723.04, terrorist attacks and things like literally trying to overthrow the constitution on proper
2723.04,2731.5, on on proposition any harm that they can push that they can push on minor change in bias on the silent middle is out of the debate.
2731.5,2737.46, We believe that proposition has not been engaging strategically enough in this debate.
2737.46,2740.34," They already lose, but still further on that in clashes."
2740.34,2746.1," But now, firstly, on the strategy, we believe that firstly, largely the impact of government"
2746.1,2750.78, policy and less radicalization in politics have been largely dependent on the polarization
2750.78,2755.48," argument because if we prove to you that we would take the first one down, it completely"
2755.48,2756.48, falls out of the debate.
2756.48,2760.6," But secondly, just note strategically how opposition has done a lot more in terms of"
2760.6,2765.44," engaging with one, incredibly why this model is less is not likely to work which"
2765.44,2771.28, they never really um like are able to reconstruct but secondly we've done so much on like engaging
2771.28,2777.68, with the best case scenario um my case still falls presented to you now in two clashes firstly on
2777.68,2784.48, radicalization opposition brings the idea that like extreme ends of like the spectrum of viewers
2784.48,2787.04, can't be changed anymore and like one
2787.04,2791.52, they want to be confirmed in their views and secondly they want like this frame of the news
2791.52,2797.02, that they currently have under like a partisan use then we tell you what's likely is that if
2797.02,2801.5, they see their bubble infiltrated by liberals or like some kind of equity censorship as they want
2801.5,2809.84, to claim on the outside of the house and if the impact is that literally you go to prison if in their opinion you violate like free speed we believe that um they're
2809.84,2813.92, likely to move to these extreme means like telegram Etc the only push that you get in this
2813.92,2818.36, whole debate for proposition is that they're able to regulate this they say that you know it's like
2818.36,2821.96, that they regulate like telegram that it's likely that they take down all of this we believe that
2821.96,2826.58," they just can't out frame themselves at the point where the, like it's incredibly unlikely"
2826.58,2827.76, that they're successful in doing this.
2827.82,2829.58," And secondly, even if we believe that this,"
2829.92,2834.26, even like the harm that's likely to occur on this
2834.26,2835.62, is so incredibly bad
2835.62,2838.2, that you have to give us the bin based on this.
2838.34,2839.02," Believe that secondly,"
2839.34,2840.58," on the clash of the silent middle,"
2840.7,2842.18, which is much less important
2842.18,2843.94," than like the radical clash that we talked to you about,"
2844.22,2848.08, but still on this. Proposition tells you that there's a large portion of you is that's
2848.08,2853.12, likely to be uh like swayed by like misinformation on like these partisan channels and that you want
2853.12,2857.92, to have like balanced views to be presented to these we give you four pushes on that on the
2857.92,2861.76, opposition opposition tells you firstly there's a veil of credibility at the point where you get
2862.4,2865.12, put like a government stamp on an imperfect system that
2865.12,2869.12, isn't uh like that isn't this is still going to be biased which means that these people are still
2869.12,2872.96, going to um like be pushed into bias on either side of the house secondly we tell you that their
2872.96,2877.92, bias won't change even if it's perfect because they still stick to like pre notions um of their
2877.92,2882.24, social environment and of their values etc then thirdly we tell you that like the information
2882.24,2889.04," that you give them is just so much to digest, because you have to fully engage with the notions of both sides and the intricacies of this."
2889.04,2893.28, And it gets even more if they want to have five different people on this panel.
2893.28,2897.52," And then lastly, we tell you it's most likely that these people are going to buy into populism,"
2897.52,2902.72, because they're just fear-mongering and because the emotional route is still what most people go
2903.36,2905.56, down when they watch what's the difference
2905.56,2910.14, then in the characterization and why should you buy the opposition one the difference is that the
2910.14,2915.32, only proposition notion that like the reason for swaying is based on exposure right because they
2915.32,2919.78, claim that people are like just fully informed and like fully able to digest all of this and this is
2919.78,2923.66, why the only thing that happens is like when they get exposed to these different things opposition
2923.66,2928.88, on the other hand tells you that there's like three different things that like uh that factors that
2928.88,2934.88, people um take into account when decision making um beyond that one it's pre-existing paradigms
2934.88,2939.84, secondly it's the amount of info and second and thirdly it's emotion and based on this this is
2939.84,2944.16, more likely that you buy into our characterization we take this question furthermore of an independent
2944.16,2946.96, reason of johanna's argument that's never been responded to
2946.96,2948.5, that even in the case where these people
2948.5,2950.86," are informed on both sides,"
2950.86,2952.6, like you get more coverage of scandals
2952.6,2953.62, on the outside of the house.
2953.62,2954.78, These people are less relevant
2954.78,2956.56, because you don't change their behavior too much.
2956.56,2958.4," In the best case of proposition,"
2958.4,2961.14, you get a minor change in like their polarization
2961.14,2964.04, and like really the harm that has occurred
2964.04,2966.08, under extremism is just so incredibly
2966.08,2987.0, that that you vote opposition i'm a speaker for the front remarks and i invite the government Am I audible?
2987.0,2989.0," Yes, you are."
2989.0,2997.0, Great.
2997.0,3006.0," Panel, I want to be very, very clear as to what Germany did and did not need to prove to win this debate. Germany did not need to show"
3006.0,3012.48," that radicalism was bad, that populism was bad, that polarization exists. They instead needed to"
3012.48,3018.24," show that upon implementing our policy, there would be active and substantial harm that is"
3018.24,3023.28, tangible in everyone's everyday lives. And that is what at the end of this debate they have failed
3023.28,3027.0," to do, because they can come up here and talk all they want about terrorism and rioting."
3027.0,3038.0," It's ironic, though, that in a status quo that they defend in which this exists, and I would argue that any chance that we have to improve this status quo is grounds on which Team Spain wins this debate."
3038.0,3049.14," Now what I want to do is give like respond to the only three pushes they give in this debate as to why we make situations substantially worse. If I disprove these, they have lost this debate. There are three. The first"
3049.14,3055.3," is populism. Look, a few responses. Populism arises as a direct result of discontent with"
3055.3,3060.16," the political establishment. This looks like things like viewing other people as bigots,"
3060.48,3067.62," like hatred to people across the other side of the political aisle. Look, we don't think it's a coincidence that over the same span of time"
3067.62,3069.7," that political polarization was at its worst,"
3069.98,3074.26, that we saw the rise of right-wing populist parties in Europe and the United States.
3074.26,3077.6, We think that it is far more likely to have populism on their side of the house.
3077.88,3080.18," But secondly, on our side of the house,"
3080.46,3084.16, populists are now given equal voices compared to everyone else in the political sphere.
3084.48,3088.36," Look, Trump was only able to be elected as a populist leader because he essentially had"
3088.36,3094.16, a monopoly over what Fox published on him. Now he is forced to share the stage with a bunch of other
3094.16,3098.98," well-informed Democrats and well-informed independents. Look, people support populist"
3098.98,3103.46, leaders because of the vague promises they give them. Now we give you a mechanism whereby
3103.46,3105.52, politicians must deliver better
3105.52,3110.16, policy because they are on the same stage and actively competing with politicians who are trying
3110.16,3115.84, to gain votes. That is the mechanism whereby we do not allow populism to happen that falls. The
3115.84,3119.44, second thing they tell us is that their people are going to move towards right-wing sources. We tell
3119.44,3124.08," you two things they say we don't respond like we did. One, the majority of people that they"
3124.08,3129.04, themselves can see to are passive viewers. This means they lack initiative to go out and seek news sources
3129.04,3134.48, which germany literally concedes the vast majority of people have not even heard of so look if the
3134.48,3138.4, price for lessening political polarization for the majority on our side of the house is having
3138.4,3143.36, a tiny majority minority of people who are likely already polarized and radicalized and looking at
3143.36,3147.78," fake news then we're willing to take that exchange. But secondly, we tell you it's not even mutually"
3147.78,3151.96," exclusive. We're willing to defend regulation of social media. We think that generally speaking,"
3152.04,3156.52, it is becoming more and more well-regulated. This is a non-point. And thirdly now on harm
3156.52,3159.9," to minorities. Look, they barely even delivered this substantive point. So realistically,"
3160.02,3164.7," it's not that important. But look at how the harm here is symmetrical, which is to say Black trans"
3164.7,3169.36, women already face a very hard time in the status quo. The difference is that people who never
3169.36,3174.26," considered that trans people are real now have access to that information, and that change is"
3174.26,3178.92," exclusive to our side of the house. Now look, those are the only three reasons they gave us as to why"
3178.92,3183.5, we gave substantial harms. The fact that all three of those fall means that they have lost this debate.
3183.72,3188.24, But look at everything that we tell you now. I want to point out two very important things the first is that
3188.24,3193.92, we improve all three democratic institutions they don't respond to this once with centrist policy
3193.92,3198.4, with better policy by humanizing political opposition by having judges do their job the
3198.4,3204.24, extent of the rebuttal to this is it won't happen look it will judges if fixing a political sorry a
3204.24,3205.52," broken political system,"
3205.88,3209.48," even if you like buy one or two of their harms, if we're able to fix this political system,"
3209.8,3213.76," that alone should win us this debate, because the political system we live in affects literally"
3213.76,3217.54," everyone, not just minorities. The second thing we tell you is that we're going to lesser"
3217.54,3221.8," polarization. The extent of their rebuttal here is that, oh, Ben Shapiro and populists are going"
3221.8,3227.66," to be the only one on news sources, essentially mischaracterizing what we tell you. Look, we're willing to concede the fact that maybe we don't"
3227.66,3232.44," convince the small minority of radicals, but largely those exist on both sides. Where do we"
3232.44,3237.12, win? The silent majority of viewers who Germany concedes are the most important. The people who
3237.12,3242.36," are open to new ideas just haven't had the ability to access them yet. Look, maybe they don't change"
3242.36,3247.2," their mind, but at least they have a reason to believe what they believe. I am very proud to propose."
