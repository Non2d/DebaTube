0.0,7.0," Cool, sorry for the delay."
7.0,15.0," Panel, the issue in post-colonial states is a vastly unequal distribution of property,"
15.0,21.0," where the majority of land and economic resources is held by a small elite. An example of this is in Egypt,"
21.0,26.06, where 6% of the population owned 65% of the overall land in the
26.06,30.94," 1950s. This came to be during colonialism, where land was stolen from the indigenous population"
30.94,36.82," and given to white colonists or local elites that supported them. These theft, the theft and"
36.82,41.82, centuries of exploitation deserve redress. Getting your land back is getting your country back. How
41.82,50.18, do we do this? We implement a model similar to Egypt's immensely successful one in the 1950s. What land do we redistribute? We want to have a cap on how
50.18,55.88," much land individuals can own. If people own more, we expropriate them. And if land that is owned by"
55.88,60.0, the former colonial government will also be redistributed. Where does this land then go?
60.14,64.02, We want to have this proportional according to ethnicity to restore the original balance. If
64.02,67.92," your group makes up 10% of the population, you will get 10% of the land."
67.92,71.52," Additionally, poor farmers can apply for land and agricultural support,"
71.52,76.32, for example fertilizers and seeds. This will be done well because there is an immense desire
76.32,80.32, for land redistribution from the population. What else will we then do? We want to have other
80.32,89.12," redistributive policies such as the social aid system, cash transfer programs, and heavy taxation for beneficiaries from colonialism. We lobby for reparations from former"
89.12,94.0, colonial powers. Precedents to this include the UK paying 50 million pounds to Kenya as a redress
94.0,99.52, for the Mau Mau massacre or supporting agricultural programs in the 1980s. What then does the short
99.52,104.0, term on both sides look like? We're willing to bite the bullet. We're most likely ending up with
104.0,108.16," authoritarian governments in the short term on our side of the house. However, the rule of law still"
108.16,112.88," is possible. Look at Egypt or Namibia, where we have independent ports, and this is likely because"
112.88,117.84, countries are easier to rule if there's an order in some institutions and force their power. On
117.84,122.56," opposition, what you're likely to get is an incredibly unequal society where most people"
122.56,125.7, are too poor to access their political rights.
125.7,129.5," With that, two arguments in the speech. Firstly, on the quality of life."
129.5,133.52, The problem for the large majority of people in post-colonial states is that they
133.52,139.52, lack a baseline of survival. They can't put bread on the table for your family. That is
139.52,143.44, because they're exploited in large farms and work under slave-like conditions with very
143.44,149.46," little pay. Opposition is unlikely to change this meaningfully for two reasons. One, because large landowners are"
149.46,153.54, likely to lobby the government to prevent any kind of legislation that would end exploitative
153.54,158.26, labor. They can uniquely do this because of their economic importance. We expropriate them
158.26,162.9," at their weakest right after independence. Second, because there are fluctuations in how much you can"
162.9,169.64," actually buy with your wage. That is, your money can decrease in its value, especially in a semi-stable economic system,"
169.64,171.34, whereas land you can always use.
171.34,173.96, This means land is always better as a form of redress.
173.96,175.24, How do we then help people?
175.24,177.64, You can grow crops on the land that you receive.
177.64,179.82, You're likely to do this very well for three reasons.
179.82,183.62," One, because of the agricultural program, you receive seeds and fertilizers."
183.62,189.44," Second, because you already worked as a farmer prior to you receiving that land most people were in agriculture and thirdly"
189.44,194.72, because generally not that hard i can grow crops in my own garden there's no reasons why african
194.72,198.96, farmers wouldn't be able to do this we then tell you that you're they're likely to use the land
198.96,203.44, even better than large farms because one you're likely to work harder when you reap the benefits
203.44,208.38, of your own work and second because there's more sustainable agriculture because you depend on that land
208.38,213.1," more than the large land owner does. But panel, even if baseline survival would be ensured on"
213.1,217.8," either side of the house, owning land gives you collateral. That is, you can take out loans and"
217.8,222.98," use them to invest in economic opportunities like starting your own business, sending your children"
222.98,226.8, to school. This gives you the option of meaningful economic participation and a higher
227.0,229.32, quality of life. Why is this so important panel?
229.52,233.56, Because we give enslaved people redress from centuries of exploitation where they
233.76,237.16, can now meaningfully decide for themselves how they want to participate
237.36,241.16," in economic activity. Second, because to access political rights,"
241.36,245.22," you need a good economic situation. I need spare time, spare capacity,"
245.22,250.68," and spare resources to make use of that, right? What does it matter if I have a right to education"
250.68,254.72, but my children need to work to get food on the table and I don't have the money to pay
254.72,259.72, for tuition and buy them books and paper? I can't organize a protest if I need to work
259.72,266.88," to feed my family, panel, where we want economic baseline baseline survival but even if you don't but but onto the"
266.88,272.88, second argument on stability then three layers to this firstly we satisfy equality demands panel
272.88,278.08, people have a massive desire for material and for material equality because they feel and see this
278.08,282.96, every day there's a generational heart of your land being taken away it's often also symbolic
282.96,290.24, to have a government take land away from your exploiter that killed your family and often the independence campaigns promised redistribution
290.24,295.28, and largely ran on this. This means you need to meet this need for redistribution otherwise you
295.28,301.04, end up with an unstable system because populists and radical forces can use the discontent and
301.04,310.02," rile up people against the government. you generally get uprisings and strikes against the situation. This is incredibly bad in an already weak system. Second layer then,"
310.18,314.86, on why our government is likely better and more stable. Because our authoritarian leader has
314.86,319.72, massive incentives to improve people's lives tangibly. People are okay with having less
319.72,323.86, political rights only when their lives are actually becoming better because of that.
324.08,325.22," Look at China, for example."
325.8,329.96," Second, because often these people are former revolutionary leaders, they care about the country"
329.96,333.86," and the state they're in a lot. They're really invested, right? They literally risk their life"
333.86,337.96," for independence. But then thirdly, they're also quite educated and knowledgeable about this country"
337.96,342.32," and its issue. And fourthly, I think generally we can know that they're good leaders because they"
342.32,348.58," reconciled independence movement. Compare the central opposition, where you get an unstable democracy because they have little buy-in."
348.88,352.36, That is firstly because there is distrust into the Western democratic system.
352.8,354.14," Panel, I just want to make this very clear."
354.5,358.72, This was the system that was used to create the inequality you are experiencing.
358.72,369.2," The system that was in place when your cousins were taken away, your parents were murdered by the white settlers white missionaries put the system onto you i don't think there's a reason why african farmers"
369.2,374.0, would trust it then second because ethnic groups have lessened incentive to buy into the system
374.0,378.64, that is because every group gains from overthrowing the new weak order we are likely
378.64,383.52, getting coups and constant changes in who leads what panel there are precedents in algeria in
383.52,389.1," 1999 when an islamist party tried to overthrow the government, or in Ghana when a military coup overthrew"
389.1,393.54, Khamenei Nukwa's government. This is uniquely harmful to democracies because they depend on
393.54,397.74," wanting people to buy into it. You need to go to elections, you need to accept their results,"
398.06,402.74," you need to support protests of either side of the house. Third layer then, on why we get more"
402.74,405.24, actionability. Democracies are generally
405.24,409.28," slow, especially if they're new, right? You have no established compromise mechanisms, you don't"
409.28,413.14," even know which parties are running for an election then. Second, because democracies in"
413.14,417.46, post-colonial states specifically are likely blocked by ethnic tensions. We need to compromise
417.46,421.74, and there are potential deadlocks that occur when parties specifically cater to certain ethnicities
421.74,428.04," when engaged in clientelism where policies are specifically designed only for one. Before I move on, why this argument is generally important,"
428.14,434.82," is there a PY? Okay, moving on. Why then is stability so important? Because we think in"
434.82,439.34," the best case for opposition, you're getting an unstable and dysfunctional government that cannot"
439.34,444.14, deliver basic necessities like building hospitals and infrastructure because it all requires
444.14,449.02, government action that is blocked on opposition side of the house and a democracy that is
449.02,453.5," in deadlock. But I think in their worst case, you have weak structures that are prone to"
453.5,458.46," coups and civil wars. Panel, you need to get your land back to get your country back. We"
458.46,468.02, say you get immaterial equality before you get immaterial rights. So proud to propose.
470.16,470.36," Okay, thank you for speaker from proposition."
507.0,514.0," Now let's welcome for speaker from opposition. Hello, am I audible? Okay, great. Just give me a second to set up my timer."
514.0,530.34," Okay. I'll begin my speech in three, two, one."
530.34,535.24," Panel, we think a lot of what composition is perpetuating is contingent on two things."
535.24,540.12," Firstly, it is contingent on the willingness of these leaders to redistribute land in the"
540.12,542.12, model that they have given to us.
542.12,549.68," Firstly, we look at the model of Zimbabwe when Zimbabwe was another country that prioritized land reform. Land was not accessible to the average individual"
549.68,555.44, but was rather prioritized to be redistributed to party loyalists and those who participated
555.44,559.04, within the struggle. And we think this was something that was common amongst most African
559.04,564.24, states when we look at countries like Uganda and Zimbabwe. Why does this become important in proving
564.24,568.4," that side propositions model doesn't work in this debate? That's on the first instance,"
568.4,572.32, on the willingness of the political leaders to partake in this form of redistribution.
572.32,577.04," But on the second level, we don't think there's people who will buy into the fact of there being"
577.04,582.16, a cap being put on the amount of land that is being given back to them. Because we think on
582.16,591.28," the principle of reparations, you do not choose the amount you wish to give back but you give back what is due if i as a fat as my ancestral family"
591.28,597.84, on 30 of the land i expect to be reparated 30 of the land we think in terms when we put a cap on
597.84,603.6, this you're likely to run into a lot of conflicts and friction with people who do not agree with
603.6,608.94, this model but secondly on that of brian we think ethnic groups especially won't buy in.
608.94,617.62, When we look at minority groups have already been disenfranchised and receiving a lot of their land from majoritarian groups.
617.62,626.64," And at a point that you put a cap, we think it becomes a scapegoat from majoritarian groups not to back the majority of the land that was stolen from them."
626.64,632.08," Secondly, we think that a lot of people would be too poor to access a lot of these rights."
632.08,638.0," In my speech, I'll recontextualise what economic reparations actually look like"
638.0,643.92," and what political emancipation also looks like, and then giving you intuitive rebuttals in it as we go on."
643.92,649.18," So firstly, on recontextualisation, we think the contention of this debate relies on where"
649.18,654.42, we think the international community can assist these post-colonial African states in attaining
654.42,658.44," the best method, which would then guarantee the second one as well."
658.44,662.5, What does political emancipation look like and what does economic emancipation look like?
662.5,663.5," Firstly, political."
663.5,668.4, We think this looks like drafting legitimate constitutions secondly providing a separation of powers between the
668.4,673.6, judiciary and executive and thirdly setting up a judicial system that acts as checks and balances
673.6,679.12, on justice in the current country on a civil and political level we think economic emancipation
679.12,686.0, looks like the devolving of financial needs down to the leaders appointed of these countries to embark on economic
686.0,693.08, survival on their own or setting up of a democratic structure why this is true we think it is the
693.08,696.92, common trend that is perpetuated in multiple countries if we're really looking at what
696.92,701.6, economic preparations look like not what side purposes they gave you we look at how the Zimbabwe
701.6,706.36," Zimbabwe government said they wanted land reparations in the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979,"
706.36,712.26, and they were given 650 million euros that equated to the amount of land that was stolen from their people.
712.26,718.94," And then they were told to do with it as they pleased, whether or not they would use it to buy back their land from the white settlers."
718.94,725.0, So we find as we find it more preferable in pursuing a sound political system.
725.0,731.0, The clearest context of these two roots we will use in this debate is that of the conscience of South Africa and Zimbabwe.
731.0,737.0, The reason why is because geographically they are close in proximity and share a lot of the same geographical things.
737.0,743.0," So they were ruled by the same people and thus their only real substantive reason for difference in political, economic and social progression"
743.0,749.36," is their difference in the route taken after gaining independence. We think one, South Africa asked for help in setting"
749.36,753.6, up administrative judicial structures and a demarcation between the executive and the
753.6,759.08," judiciary, whilst the mob would prioritize economic emancipation in the form of reparations."
759.18,763.06, This will act as a rebuttal to a lot of the substantive from first speaker. The impacts of
763.06,765.6," this. Firstly, South Africa in the 28-year democracy has been able to recall lot of the substantive from first speaker the impacts of this firstly satan in the 28-year"
765.6,771.76, democracy has been able to recall two of his presidents to question their conduct with zuma
771.76,778.96, effectively facing jail time and repercussions whilst in zimbabwe robert had a 37-year term in
778.96,785.66, office because the constitution ultimately allowed it this being brings about a focus on economic emancipation
785.66,789.5, and in turn this had a despot in its presidency
789.5,792.48, while South Africa has curbed this with political structures.
792.48,795.2," And secondly, South Africa in turn has experienced"
795.2,797.58, a degree of economic emancipation
797.58,800.04, after pursuing political emancipation.
800.04,802.28, We think this looks like there's been better housing
802.28,806.0," at cheaper prices, a new industry that has begun"
806.0,807.62, to spring up in a political system
807.62,809.42, where if people can call it out
809.42,811.46," and they're being changed at a point in time,"
811.46,813.84, the people call out the inconsistencies
813.84,815.44, within the political system.
815.44,817.88, Whilst the Zimbabwean economy is shattered
817.88,821.72, when we look at the 2000 land reform policies
821.72,824.66, that came along that prioritized devolving land
824.66,826.32, to loyalists and those who
826.32,834.38," participated in the struggle, not actually reparating it back to the people who previously"
834.38,838.7, owned it. Why is this a problem? This is a problem that is particularly contingent on
838.7,843.36, side proposition. At a point in time that they want to put caps on the amount of land that
843.36,845.12, devolved back to people
845.12,851.6, this would mean that there's no guarantee that one those who lost will attain it back and secondly
851.6,857.84, those who may not necessarily actually had any um any claims on said that might gain claim to access
857.84,863.28, on said that if they have a political and social quota in that country at that point in time we
863.28,865.44, think this looks like loyalists to certain
865.44,870.88, um dominant pirate parties and those who then support this movement this becomes important
870.88,875.44, when we ask ourselves how do we measure the success the success of a post-colonial state
875.44,880.24, four things one in the existence of an effective system of hierarchy secondly the average utility
880.24,886.4," to the basic citizen thirdly the self-sufficiency of that state, and fourthly international relations and its position in geopolitics."
886.4,890.5," Menzi will touch on three and four and I will touch on one and two, but before that I'll"
890.5,892.78, take your POI.
892.78,898.9, How would a farmer in Zimbabwe ever have survived if five percent owned sixty percent of land
898.9,899.9, in Zimbabwe in 1980?
899.9,901.9, We think it's much better that you expropriated.
901.9,905.76, At a point in time that we think that you are
905.76,912.48, pursuing a policy of economic reparations it means what has been taken away is what you must give
912.48,917.28, back and a point of time this what your model leaves room for someone to then make claims to
917.28,921.68, a land that they previously did not know we find that there's something extremely morally
921.68,930.0, problematic on your side of the house but even engaging on your best case scenario we think that um you better capacitate these people to gain
930.0,934.88, access to these lands at a point in time you set up political systems where they can lay claims to
934.88,939.6, it on your side of the house they cannot lay claim to that land because they are not humanized they
939.6,944.0, do not have a political voice and they do not have any grounds to approach a judiciary that will
944.0,949.12, support them in laying claims to that land now and that's how we create a better hierarchy and a better
949.12,953.2, utility firstly we think when you set up proper political systems you have better checks and
953.2,957.84, balance balances from political leaders that is why a south african citizen can sue states and
957.84,963.28, actually get this win holding states an account of an action we offered that in contrast to zimbabwe
963.28,965.2," where in 2019 January riots,"
965.2,969.84, how none of the police force who opened fire on the citizens were held accountable to this day.
969.84,975.12, This is why Mr. Veni can be in power for extended periods of time with constitution offering no
975.12,980.88, ammo to opposition parties to actually remove him from power. This is lack of efficient political
980.88,989.44, structures have been set up to ensure that haven't been set up to ensure equitable equitable access on ours on their side of the house you have a better clear defined
989.44,994.0, structures with clear rules on our side of the house where there is no confusion on what the
994.0,999.6, judiciary is responsible for what the executive is responsible for and therefore this allows people
999.6,1004.24, to then exercise the monomotory and self-determination to lay claims to things that
1004.24,1005.12, were previously there
1005.12,1008.96, but on what men's is going to further extend on the speech and just a bit of preemptive on that
1008.96,1014.0, on the principle of self-determination and how we attain better utility we think in the inverse on
1014.0,1018.8, their side issues of economic emancipation come up due to there being a messiah-like complex
1018.8,1024.32, of the liberators who then will not want to equally distribute land amongst those who truly
1024.32,1025.28, own it and those who
1025.28,1030.0, previously ordered but amongst the loyalists and those who they wish to do poverty side with
1030.0,1037.76, opposition because that is siding with humanity thank you okay thank you for the first speaker
1037.76,1089.78, from opposition let's welcome the second speaker from proposition her from publishing. Okay. Okay.
1089.78,1092.94, Just give me a second to set up everything.
1092.94,1097.0, Find all my notes.
1097.0,1109.9," Okay, I would prefer if you for my PIs either wave your hand in the camera or type them in the chat. So please don't give them to me audibly if that's okay."
1110.56,1115.98," Okay, perfect. I'll start this debate in three, two, one."
1116.36,1122.02," Three things I'm going to talk about. Implementation, quality of life, and how does political systems look like in practice."
1122.02,1129.52," Before that, I want to note one thing. The material always comes before the immaterial. I care more about having to put food on the table,"
1129.52,1134.08," sending your kids to school, or starting your own business, than I care about casting a vote that"
1134.08,1138.16," doesn't change an election, or having the ability to sue the government even though I can't afford"
1138.16,1142.96, the lawyer. You only ever get your country back when you get your land back. This is what
1142.96,1145.62," Proposition stands for. Firstly, on"
1145.62,1150.84," implementation, I think here opposition tries to push us unjust burdens on us. They argue our claim"
1150.84,1155.04, doesn't really work and therefore we're not actually achieve the change we get. But add someone on
1155.04,1159.4," the other side argue they get a perfect one. I don't think this is fair. Firstly, I think we can"
1159.4,1163.64, reasonably assume that a cap will be high enough to get enough land. I think an authoritarian leader
1163.64,1168.44, has an incentive to set the cap at a certain level where his policy is effective enough to
1168.44,1172.42," actually achieve the change he wants. Why would he otherwise try it in the first place? Secondly,"
1172.6,1176.32, I also think we get a justice system just as they do. The difference then lies in how the
1176.32,1180.08," democracy political system looks. The reason is because even as an authoritarian leader,"
1180.28,1185.0," I need to have an incentive and a way to enforce the policies, enforce the rule of law I want,"
1185.06,1188.82, and government and a way where I can sue people is a great way on how I can do that.
1189.18,1193.72," Okay, two direct responses, two direct attacks they give us. Firstly, leaders would not be"
1193.72,1196.84, willing to actually redistribute. I think this is a fairly wrong claim because I think we've
1196.84,1201.66," told you here enough. I think, one, there's a huge reason for the people to want this inequality and"
1201.66,1209.04, want this land redistribution. They would hate the fact that the Hollandizers came in in here stole the land and took it away from them they want this back i think land
1209.04,1212.64, secondly is more tangible and political right this is something that gives them an immediate benefit
1212.64,1217.12, i don't think they can claim on their side there's a bigger idea of getting theirs thirdly i would
1217.12,1222.8, argue because equity and equity is affects how happy you are because i compare my happiness and
1222.8,1228.68," high life satisfaction compared to other people if everyone is equal on our side and people want to be happy, we're more likely"
1228.68,1233.68," to get that. I think landowner politicians, even regardless, have incentives to also push that."
1233.94,1237.14," On the one hand, they want brownie points, right? They want to make sure there's no uprisings that"
1237.14,1240.86, actually control them down. They want to have a symbolic policy that people can actually get
1240.86,1244.68," behind, something that applies to all ethnic groups, not just clientelism. And secondly,"
1244.74,1247.44, because I think there's a big threat in them if they have landowners that are too
1247.44,1251.44, powerful if you have a couple elites that are powerful there's in the people you have to serve
1251.44,1255.68, to people you have to give like tax breaks and other things to people control you out of policy
1255.68,1259.68, i don't think it's something you would want i think therefore on our side secondly the ideas
1259.68,1263.44, they tell us or the cap system is wrong because not everyone gets a just representation i think
1263.44,1269.68, this happens on a spectrum thus even if i don't perfectly get what i want or what i deserve even if it's not getting
1269.68,1274.16, some it's better than getting none i think therefore this principle still stands but note
1274.16,1278.48, they assume our policy does not work at all but don't ever prove our implementation on their side
1278.48,1282.96, works i would argue implementation is harder for something that is intangible something that is not
1282.96,1288.52, native to this community and it's harder to actually implement secondly on the quality of life of these people
1288.52,1292.6, because I think you are Hannah tells you quite a few mechanisms here which go completely unrespond
1292.6,1296.62, to the only ideas we get no thank you is this idea it's not perfectly redistributed but I think even
1296.62,1300.4, on a marginal level even I tell you because they want to cater to every ethnic group they want to
1300.4,1303.88, make sure this is a policy that they can reunite people under they're more likely to make this
1303.88,1307.84," fair but even if they don't even if they give it to some people, I still think this works for a majority of people."
1308.04,1316.06," I still think a majority of people now can flee exploitation of these landlords, can flee the loan wages, and therefore actually get possibility of some economic reparations."
1316.26,1317.38, Some is better than none.
1317.38,1320.74, But I want to crucially give you an extension of what Ioana here tells you.
1320.96,1329.72," Because I tell you, rich landowners, oftentimes embedded in the colonial structures, use their land to sell back to the West. A person in the Ivory Coast, a farmer,"
1329.92,1334.2," probably sells his cocoa beans in his farm back to the West. Comparatively on our side,"
1334.34,1339.24, local producers are more likely to produce for themselves. This crucially means we get more food
1339.24,1343.76," on the table for people in this area. This is better. I want to tell you, because this argument"
1343.76,1345.04," is not enough responded by, this works really well and is super i want to tell you because this argument is not enough responded"
1345.04,1348.88, by this works really well it's super important i tell you we tell you that we get people who are
1348.88,1353.12, on the worst side of this better because we give them colo give them a baseline of severity but
1353.12,1357.12, even if you're better off we give them collateral this is super important because i think we judge
1357.12,1361.2, our happiness individual happiness compared to other people this is better on our side and we
1361.2,1369.12, feed people's mouths secondly i'd be a totally an idea of political systems i just want to point out here that's how the ideas of picking out two examples and trying
1369.12,1372.4, to win the whole debate on this it's completely untrust we are talking about hunt we're talking
1372.4,1376.08, about tons of different countries here i don't think it's fair but even if you use the metrics
1376.08,1380.16, of south africa being the perfect example south africa the highest crime rates like last year
1380.16,1384.8, like in the whole world at least in africa they had a huge unrest in 2021 and 350 people died in
1384.8,1385.08," that i don't think there's an example where they proved that this world policy works in other way in the whole world, at least in Africa. There was a huge unrest in 2021, and 350 people died in that."
1385.22,1386.82, I don't think there's an example where they proved
1386.82,1388.78, that this policy works in other ways.
1389.04,1391.26, The only idea we get here is that we have a loyalist.
1391.26,1392.98, I want to point out this again would mean
1392.98,1394.92, that we've given power to a small elite.
1395.16,1397.2," This is not something a politician has incentive in,"
1397.36,1400.1, because a small elite would mean I'm dependent on a small group
1400.1,1401.12, to actually keep me in power.
1401.32,1403.18," To have multiple people spread it out,"
1403.36,1408.56," there's not an individual who can actually throw me out of my room. Spreading the eggs I have to feed to, meaning, for example,"
1408.56,1412.08," giving economic growth to everyone, giving land reform to everyone because it's something everyone"
1412.08,1416.48," can get behind, is so much better. Again, I want to point out here that Johanna gives you mechanisms"
1416.48,1420.08," on how, for example, political deadlock will happen, how, for example, policies will not"
1420.08,1423.68, actually be enacted or there's civil rights on their side. I think it's hugely important.
1423.68,1428.12," Let's get to my own substantive addition here, the long-term trajectory. The thesis is, in the"
1428.12,1432.46," best-case scenario of both sides, proposition gets fair redistribution, opposition gets their"
1432.46,1437.32," political rights, we also get political rights on proposition. Why will opposition not get land"
1437.32,1440.9, redistribution in the long term? The reason is because opposition gives all their people
1440.9,1448.96, political rights. This also means they give the right to property. This means opposition can't anymore expropriate the land of people because property rights are protected.
1449.38,1453.52," Leave them two options. One, they either have the prost policy of like having a willing seller,"
1453.88,1457.42," possibly a problem one, that not everyone is willing to sell their land. But even if they are,"
1457.46,1461.42," because they know this is a government plan, they hold the leverage of keeping prices extremely high"
1461.42,1467.64," and therefore not actually being affordable for the government. Secondly, they can expropriate land without a willing seller because the land government"
1467.64,1472.12, actively infringes on the right of a person. Compensation has to be extremely high to justify
1472.12,1476.66," this. Problem is, post-colonial countries oftentimes are extremely poor, have small"
1476.66,1480.68," government budgets, they can't actually afford this. This is opposition's worst case. This means"
1480.68,1488.84," this won't have any form of land redistribution at all. In opposition's best case scenario, they get some land distribution, but it's on a small scale, doesn't affect everyone,"
1488.98,1493.36, few privileged people get this. It takes a big part of government budget and is really slow and
1493.36,1497.72," takes a lot of time. Before I can tell you where Proposition gets political rights and redistribution,"
1497.94,1503.66, I'll take a POI. Voters and cash transfers can't be equitable without a justice system
1503.66,1505.2," to safeguard these for you. I think I tell you this in my intro, be equitable without a justice system to safeguard these things?"
1505.6,1509.96, I think I tell you this in my intro. We also have a justice system. We also have a legal system.
1510.2,1514.2, And the active incentive on why we have it is because it makes it easier to actually implement
1514.2,1518.32," these policies, implement their policy, implement their rule. But even if you don't buy my"
1518.32,1522.82," mechanistical examples, look at Namibia, look at Egypt, look at different authoritarian countries"
1522.82,1526.86, like Saudi Arabia in the world. They still have these kind of justice systems. I don't think there's a claim.
1526.94,1530.36, I don't think there's a mechanism behind how they get this. Okay. Why do we get political
1530.36,1534.32, rights and redistribution in long-term? What we create is a strong middle-class. Lots of people
1534.32,1538.8," on our side own land suddenly, and now have a baseline of wealth. Additionally, they can use"
1538.8,1543.56," the land they have to pay for education, to start a business and actually grow. Analogy here is on"
1543.56,1545.12," their side, they'll have an Elon Musk."
1545.12,1547.32," On our side, we'll have a million homeowners."
1547.32,1550.6, This will lead to the democratisation in the long term because people with economic
1550.6,1552.92, power will now demand political rights.
1552.92,1556.4, This is especially the case because these people are more educated on our side and
1556.4,1559.84, they are rich enough to actually care about other things than just care about other
1559.84,1562.4, things and not just only their material well-being.
1562.4,1565.24, But the middle class is so big and so vital for the economy
1565.24,1567.7," that even the credible threat of them standing up,"
1567.78,1569.2," them stopping producing goods,"
1569.28,1571.38, is enough to bully and push the government
1571.38,1572.42, and actually giving up.
1572.5,1574.48, I think the authoritarian regimes at that point
1574.48,1576.7, are unable to further be able to do this.
1576.9,1577.98," How this could look is, for example,"
1578.06,1578.96," in a British monarchy,"
1579.24,1581.58," where, for example, you had the rich aristocracy,"
1581.72,1582.64," which you only cater to,"
1582.8,1584.32," but at the point of industrialization,"
1584.42,1588.82," you had merchants, you had engineers, you had a bigger middle class were wealthy and because of this the king"
1588.82,1593.18, had to create assemblies in later parliament to satisfy the demands of this growingly important
1593.18,1598.44, class democracy was created because a few couldn't could be paid off with government contracts but
1598.44,1603.28, because we had so many people now you had to necessitate and you had to give them powers even
1603.28,1608.56," if this fails governments will have to improve their institutions and go kind of go in the demands of these people,"
1608.86,1612.52," bettering the lives of everyday people because of all of this, because we can claim the benefits."
1612.66,1614.36, They can't claim ours. Vote side proposition.
1620.98,1626.0, The second speaker from the proposition. Let us welcome the second speaker from Team Proposition.
1633.0,1638.0, My name is Menzi. I'll take your eyes in the chat.
1638.0,1643.0," That said, I'll start the speech in three, two, one."
1643.0,1646.54, Civil rights are the foundation of citizenship
1646.54,1648.76, and creating national identity.
1648.76,1650.56, And that is important for the building up
1650.56,1654.2, of a new and a functional nation we are proud to oppose.
1654.2,1656.2, A few things that I'm going to talk about in this speech.
1656.2,1658.54," Firstly, I'm going to talk about the average citizen"
1658.54,1661.56, that proposition cares so much about in their quality of life.
1661.56,1664.42," And then secondly, I'm going to talk about what exactly does it"
1664.42,1669.76, mean to enhance economic policies. And then i'm going to talk about what exactly does it mean to enhance economic policies and then i'm going to talk about argumentation primarily on utility
1669.76,1674.08, and a few extensions of the things that you already got in first but i think firstly a couple
1674.08,1678.64, of direct engagements to the lines that proposition wants to run in this debate because proposition
1678.64,1683.92, does a few things that you lose them this debate on strategy alone firstly they assume so much
1683.92,1685.52, fear and power to assume that their policy so much VAT power to assume that their
1685.52,1689.6," policy is going to be implemented, to assume that their policy is going to work, and to assume that"
1689.6,1694.0, their policy is going to actually achieve equal redistribution of all the things that exist.
1694.0,1698.0, There's a few reasons why they cannot get away with this in the debate. Because we don't
1698.0,1702.72, necessarily think that prioritization of like economic and land reparations is something that
1702.72,1709.12," hasn't been tried historically and is something that is entirely new. That is to say, first on reparations, reparations is"
1709.12,1713.52," not to say we kept the amount of land that you get, it is to say we take land that was"
1713.52,1717.76, taken away by white colonizers and give it back to black people. When they tell you that
1717.76,1722.24," their form of reparation is kept in land, we say A, they are uncontextual to the actual"
1722.24,1725.04," set of the debate, B, they also are unproved"
1725.04,1729.82," to principles of reparations within themselves, on that alone they deserve to use this debate."
1729.82,1733.56," But then secondly, even if we take them in their best case scenario and it were true"
1733.56,1738.04," that Kepi accounted for reparations and was an actual model that they could use, we say"
1738.04,1743.14," secondly, they needed to prove to you how colonialistic African states, post-colonialism,"
1743.14,1745.74," like Ed, that's very clear, were sufficient enough"
1745.74,1748.22, and were stable enough to take up such a policy
1748.22,1749.82, and to rightfully implement it.
1749.82,1751.52," That is to say, they needed to show you"
1751.52,1753.42, the existing political structures
1753.42,1755.56, that could actually hold into account leaders
1755.56,1758.04, to make sure that they actually distributed lead
1758.04,1759.38, in the means that they feared.
1759.38,1760.98," Secondly, they needed to show you"
1760.98,1763.08, that there existed actual burdens
1763.08,1768.88, for these political leaders and actual checking mechanisms that would make sure that they kept this land in the systems that they feared.
1768.88,1774.88," Because in first speech, Sharon explicitly tells you how in the prioritization of actually land redistribution,"
1774.88,1777.84," what happened is the majority of countries that did prioritize this,"
1777.84,1788.12, we had situations where you only had people who were at the forefront of the liberation movement actually gaining access to land because the rest of the country could not fight this because they had no civic liberties
1788.12,1792.06, to look to and to fight their con anyway. Cool. A few things then that we think are
1792.06,1795.72," very important to engage in this debate so we understand what's actually happening. Firstly,"
1795.72,1799.5, just on basic contextual clarity and what these two policies look like because proposition
1799.5,1803.18, has no proper understanding. After sharing gives you an actual analogous thing of what
1803.18,1808.88, happens in Africa. A few things that we think are very important a we told you that when you look at things such as political
1808.88,1814.0, reparations and what they look like such as like creating civil liberties it means that the
1814.0,1818.56, countries like western liberal democracies at a point of these countries were becoming post-colonial
1818.56,1822.88, there was a meeting that was set up e.g the lancaster hours agreement and also like the
1822.88,1829.28, movement within south africa what happened is it was you had to prioritize whether or not you had to create proper financial structures
1829.28,1834.24, and redistribute land or you had to create actual political systems where individuals could vote and
1834.24,1839.36, use build up large democratic sites which would be used as accountability mechanisms. That isn't why
1839.36,1843.68, the two examples that they have for their entire case don't wreck Egypt and Namibia is primarily
1843.68,1848.46, because Namibia invested mostly in creating a proper function of democratic structures
1848.46,1852.54, that could hold governments accountable and make sure that they couldn't merely just take
1852.54,1856.36, advantage of citizens and points at which they want to keep their real up-and-touch
1856.36,1860.54," and investigate. Before I talk about quality of life, I'll take that POI. Go."
1860.54,1868.44, Why then did a majority of countries that tried civil political rights fail and slide back into authoritarianism on your side?
1869.5,1872.92," Listen, you are very up on the fact that what actually happened in Africa."
1873.26,1874.44, There's a few things that happened.
1874.62,1889.76," We say, A, the countries that did prioritize the creation of political and civic rights, countries such as South Africa, managed to create systems that were efficient. That is to say, we managed to recall Jacob Zuma, managed to recall Thabo Mbeki, we managed to historically recall actual presidents."
1889.76,1894.08," Two, it meant that these individuals have been capacitated to historically sue the state"
1894.08,1899.28, and effectively take out presidents. This didn't happen in countries that actually prioritized
1899.28,1903.84," the creation of, you know, that prioritized that deprivation that Staff Sharon already explained"
1903.84,1908.7, to you in first speech. Let's talk about quality of life because this is propositions based level engagement
1908.7,1912.96, you say one this is contingent in them proving that they're actually able to enjoy economic
1912.96,1917.76, emancipation without political rights why do we think that this is unlikely we say freshly there's
1917.76,1922.74, a trickle-down hump of what these leaders look like especially post-independence we told you
1922.74,1929.2, that these leaders in themselves viewed themselves as heroes. That is to say they viewed themselves as those who deserved more than that basic and
1929.2,1934.16, average citizen. Within society they were more likely to actually capture the state and use it
1934.16,1938.48, for themselves at a point at which citizens did not have active democratic structures to call
1938.48,1943.44, them out and to make sure that the system was inherently better. Note the only reason why white
1943.44,1946.94, people were effectively able to take away the land of black people
1946.94,1949.78, is because they did not have civic rights that protected
1949.78,1952.0, them from that ever happening in the first place.
1952.0,1954.28, When you just take those people and give them back
1954.28,1956.92," those in that land in that very same situation,"
1956.92,1959.26, I think it is equally easy for the government that exists
1959.26,1961.96," to use policies to directly take away that land,"
1961.96,1964.78, even if they redistributed at the very start of your policy
1964.78,1968.68, in your best case scenario. So we think anyway you're likely to repeat the harms that you
1968.68,1972.4," talk about. So the best response that you get then from opposition to our, from proposition"
1972.4,1976.6," to our entire case is that like economic policies themselves are unstable, we don't necessarily"
1976.6,1980.46, have structures and why the structures don't exist. I think in first picture it does a
1980.46,1984.4, really good job in showing you what setting democratic structures actually look like political
1984.4,1988.32, in post-colonial African states and systems where it was prioritized but it
1988.32,1992.56, meant something to say it meant that you would sit down at the table with active people who were
1992.56,1997.28, already involved such as the un and other bodies that already actively involved in democratic
1997.28,2001.44, systems they would help with the initial foundation of state democratic system and make
2001.44,2008.8, sure that they were fine and make sure that you could actually separate legislature and other forms of state power to make sure that they were sufficient in
2008.8,2014.24, holding people accountable etc etc so a few things then also in other extensive argumentation firstly
2014.24,2018.4, i think it is very important to understand what this means for self-sufficiency because sharon
2018.4,2022.48, explains to you that self-sufficiency is very important for countries to be functional in the
2022.48,2029.04, first place note that historically there's been a direct correlation between democratic countries and countries that are able to be
2029.04,2034.0, self-sufficient no countries such as norway sweden and belgium which are the most democratic countries
2034.0,2038.4, in status quo are largely the countries that are also the most self-sufficient why do we think that
2038.4,2043.2, this is true we say one because you directly create a system where individuals are represented
2043.2,2049.2, within parliament and policies are directly passed to actively build up citizens and make systems better for them but then secondly we
2049.2,2053.76, say you create active accountability mechanisms these accountability mechanisms create systems
2053.76,2058.32, in which you can actually directly have a system where you can call out governments at a point at
2058.32,2062.72, which they don't necessarily like you know solve the problems that exist in these countries but
2062.72,2067.76, for invite i think this debate is about who achieves both sides of the spectrum the most or to the greatest degree even when
2067.76,2071.76, you prioritize one thing proposition cannot fear that they end up with political rights
2071.76,2077.36, no zimbabwe in status quo is still a very unstable democracy you still have people who can actively
2077.36,2082.32, be called out as autocratic we say also countries such as randa also haven't achieved actual
2082.32,2089.28, political changes within status quo what's the delta here we say when countries actually prioritize political creating functional political
2089.28,2093.92, systems you do a few things hey you create judicial systems that you can actively go to
2093.92,2098.4, at a point at which you're not being economically emancipated as an individual and complain about
2098.4,2102.72, that you create structures that you can directly complain to but two if you have a historic
2102.72,2109.76, claim to a certain piece of land if you have functional judicial systems we say those judicial systems can actively help you as a person
2109.76,2115.2, with civic and political rights to reclaim that land as yours the difference here is that on
2115.2,2120.24, proposition side they only assert that their policy actually works we show you how political
2120.24,2125.36, rights directly give individuals claim to a judicial system that makes it sufficient for
2125.36,2130.8, people to end up getting their economic and their laboratory rights that they want to prioritize
2130.8,2135.36, within the union both matrix and everything that they run otherwise is symmetric proud to oppose
2138.64,2194.62, please thank your second speaker for opposition let us welcome the source equal from proposition. you Just give me a second to get my timer please.
2194.62,2214.56," I prefer my POIs audibly, otherwise I might not see them in the chat. Panel proposition can't get both."
2214.56,2218.44, They tell you that Rwanda and Zimbabwe never got rights.
2218.44,2222.12, But note that Rwanda is now a functioning democracy.
2222.12,2223.12, Why?
2223.12,2226.56, Because of economic land distributions they were able to get a functioning democracy. Why? Because of economic land distributions they were able to get a
2226.56,2232.94, functioning democracy that could then push for democratic rights. Note that Zimbabwe
2232.94,2238.76," is probably one of the only examples that they could pick here to cherry pick, right?"
2238.76,2243.74, Just because it didn't work in one country doesn't mean that it wouldn't work in others.
2243.74,2245.84," We point you to the example of Malawi,"
2245.84,2250.8," we point you to the example of Namibia, we point you to the example of Egypt. All of these were"
2250.8,2256.0, examples where first you introduced land-risk distribution and then you were able to get
2256.0,2262.0, a democracy. Also note that if the only countries that they want to talk about are South Africa
2262.0,2265.84," and Zimbabwe, we will tell you two things. Firstly, on Zimbabwe,"
2265.84,2272.08, the situation would be much worse if on top of the autocracy you would then also have economic
2272.08,2278.64, inequality. At least most people in Zimbabwe are able to live in relative economic stability. But
2278.64,2287.74," secondly, on South Africa, note that it literally has the highest crime rates in Africa for example note that 2021"
2287.74,2293.74, violent protests right like yes maybe the government doesn't violently struck down a
2293.74,2300.34, protest but people struck each other down I wouldn't want to live in that country okay with
2300.34,2305.0," that I'll be talking about three things firstly about, about implementation. Secondly, about the economic."
2305.22,2306.78," And then lastly, about the political."
2306.92,2309.52," So let's start off by talking about implementation, right?"
2309.58,2312.9, Because their opposition's push is that implementation will be bad
2312.9,2315.46, because that will be given to rich people and loyalists.
2315.74,2316.22, Two reasons.
2316.38,2319.66," Firstly, note that elites are a direct threat to leaders, right?"
2319.7,2321.36," So if you give people economic power,"
2321.36,2325.3," they can then use this power to defeat you and control you politically,"
2325.5,2330.8," right? Especially right after a revolution where leaders are presumably the weakest, it is a bad"
2330.8,2336.46," idea for them to give lots of land to powerful people, right? It is much easier to tax and control"
2336.46,2341.86," lower classes in the short term. Secondly, note that after a revolution, there is still this"
2341.86,2350.2," revolutionary move, right? The leader has seen what can happen when the people get angry and overthrow a government this is why they are likely to want"
2350.2,2356.42, to get brownie points with the entire population that means that giving land retribution therefore
2356.42,2363.0, like ending basically colonization because only if you get your land back do you get your country
2363.0,2365.6, back it is likely to be incredibly popular.
2366.04,2370.28, Note that also this policy equally benefits all ethnicities.
2370.28,2385.4," And thirdly, if you are relatively well off, then the potential personal gain from a revolution does not outweigh the risk of having the revolution fail. For all of these reasons, it is a very good idea for these"
2385.4,2390.32," leaders to implement this policy to like keep their power, which is why they will do this."
2390.7,2395.84," Note that this is unlike political rights, right? Because when you give people the ability to vote"
2395.84,2402.28," you out of office, this directly threatens your leadership, right? We would tell you that"
2402.28,2407.0, opposition simply asserts that they will be able to get a democracy.
2407.0,2411.0," Never do they give you mechanisms, structure, reasons why they will be able to do this."
2411.0,2418.0, We would give you two further reasons why it is much easier to get land redistribution than a functioning democracy.
2418.0,2426.32," Firstly, land redistribution is a one-time policy. A functioning democracy needs continuous political buy-in and people to support"
2426.32,2431.84, it secondly right note that on our side of the house we have a capable administration that
2431.84,2438.16, previously distributed land to the colonizers and can now do the reverse and like like give it to
2438.16,2443.28, the local population versus on their side of the house they have no tradition of a western
2443.28,2445.2, democracy how is it going to stand?
2445.48,2451.46," But ultimately, Tarun's argument tells you why on the long term, we will be able to implement both, right?"
2451.52,2453.28, Because only we can do this.
2453.44,2458.1," Because when you have a democracy that functions, if we take opposition at their best,"
2458.36,2461.58," then that democracy guarantees property rights, right?"
2461.68,2465.5," And you would have to give people compensation for like, and that would"
2465.5,2470.22," probably be too expensive for a developing country's government. On proposition, we tell you,"
2470.22,2475.92," the more economic power people have, the more they will push for these to be politically formalized."
2476.24,2481.86," If a lot of people can now care about self-actualization, that is when we get democracy"
2481.86,2490.72," in the long term on our side. Okay, with that, let's talk about the economic right. And under this, we tell you that the material must always come before the"
2490.72,2496.3," immaterial. Why? Three reasons. Firstly, because people simply care more about material things,"
2496.38,2501.86," right? In order to redress past injustice, I have to cut my country back, I have to get my land back."
2502.08,2505.4, This is internalized injustice that people want to redress.
2505.86,2512.12," Secondly, on an individual metric, material things are simply more tangible for me and have a bigger"
2512.12,2517.64," impact on my quality of life. If I have money, I can pay a good education for my kids and give"
2517.64,2523.82," them a good life. However, one vote is unlikely to change the outcome of an election. Thirdly,"
2523.92,2525.62, material things are logically
2525.62,2531.82," prior in Maslow's hierarchy of need, right? First, you need safety and your physiological needs met"
2531.82,2537.9," before you can reach self-actualization. I need money in order to pay tuition, in order to get"
2537.9,2543.76, access to my right to education. I need to be able to buy a newspaper in order for freedom of press
2543.76,2546.36, to matter. This is why you should prioritize the economic.
2546.52,2550.38," Now, why are people economically better off on our side of the house?"
2550.78,2553.28," Johanna talks to you about survivability, right?"
2553.4,2558.5," How now people are not forced into exploitative work on like elite farms anymore, right?"
2558.5,2564.82, That these elitists can lobby in weak democracies where there is less accountability and transparency
2564.82,2566.06, to keep these
2566.06,2571.76, people in like extremely bad working conditions she talks to about fluctuations of currency and
2571.76,2577.58, also note that oftentimes on these big farms run by elites crops get exported to the West instead
2577.58,2582.26, of selling to local populations because that is more profitable we tell you all of this massively
2582.26,2585.5, harms the local population and therefore they're
2585.5,2589.6, badly up. On our side at least they can have substance farming in which they will be very
2589.6,2594.42, invested and is more likely to be sustainable. But we tell you that on top of this people can
2594.42,2599.98," get loans and have collateral in order to have an education, a business that is unique to our side"
2599.98,2605.14," of the house. The only two responses we get is oh oh, but people don't buy into a cab system."
2610.26,2614.96," But note that comparatively, they are better off than under colonization, right? They will be happy to simply be better off to have some wealth, even if it isn't perfect, because presumably they"
2614.96,2619.74," understand that perfection isn't perfect. But secondly, because colonization was probably like"
2619.74,2624.84," 200 years or so, they probably don't even remember who exactly their land owned for. Now, what they"
2624.84,2628.62," tell us is, oh, but on our side of the house, people can sue for the land. Firstly,"
2628.68,2633.28, we would tell you that oftentimes there is a lack of official land records from this period. So how
2633.28,2637.68," would you ever prove that this land belonged to you? But secondly, we will tell you that the elites"
2637.68,2642.92," to whom this land belongs to have more money to pay for good lawyers, and they could possibly even"
2642.92,2645.2, corrupt the courts in a weak democracy right
2645.2,2649.76, we believe that therefore your chance as a poor exploited person to ever get that land back
2649.76,2654.72, is basically zero okay with that let's talk about political things right because here we basically
2654.72,2659.6, get two push firstly that they will be able to like hold politicians accountable but again note
2659.6,2664.08, that mugabe is probably a massive exception because he's the most democratic leader in most
2664.08,2666.86," other countries these have eventually been toppled, right?"
2667.46,2674.32," And note that even if they are right, they need to prove why their democracy will be able to work in the long term, right?"
2674.32,2682.52," We tell you that it is much more likely that because rights are on our side of the house, we get stability."
2683.02,2685.12, And this matters because rights cannot
2685.12,2690.0, be guaranteed in instability right instability means that it is more likely that the country
2690.0,2695.6, goes back into conflict authoritarianist backslides and your quality of life is massively
2695.6,2700.24, like impacted when you don't have stability right at this point it doesn't matter that the west will
2700.24,2705.1, help because the west has no idea about your local country just look at Afghanistan
2705.1,2709.9, ultimately Taiwan even told you that on our side of the house we're likely to get a better
2709.9,2715.18, democracy because it's initiated by the locals for all of these reasons so proud to propose
2719.5,2755.44," okay thank you the third speaker from proposition now let's welcome the third speaker from opposition I'll take your eyes in the chat and I'll begin my speech in three, two, one."
2755.44,2760.5," Panel, even if in truancy you buy into some of the propositions argument, I'm going to"
2760.5,2764.32, show you why strategically they use on their model when it's never specific.
2764.32,2769.12, And I'll also show you why they use on all their principles because they're not absolute.
2769.3,2772.12, We don't even think they understand what reparations are at this point.
2772.12,2779.12," I'm going to show you why the democracies we're talking about didn't fail, at least not in the ways they think they did."
2779.34,2785.04," We think even if countries have a high crime rate, that doesn't mean you can't take those people to court and"
2785.04,2789.68, actively hold them accountable that is the difference that is what we're defending but
2789.68,2795.04, let me take you through specific things that were said firstly they say in second prop we're going
2795.04,2802.0, to set up courts to regulate and safeguard these economic rights note that is something they cannot
2802.0,2805.28, run courts are a judicial principle that is a part of
2805.28,2812.18," our case, a part of prioritizing the safeguards that exist under democracy. Civil and political"
2812.18,2817.34, rights are your only legitimate claim within a court of law. They can't actually safeguard
2817.34,2822.44," through courts. Secondly, they tell you they're going to have a 10 percent, like you can't own"
2822.44,2828.24," more than 10 percent of the land. First of all, we think this is actually like very actually like very big right you're still gonna have a lot of white strongholds but then they"
2828.24,2833.04, also tell you that like they're going to have people having some of this lands first they say
2833.04,2837.44, that they're going to do enough to make people happy then they tell you in third that some is
2837.44,2842.48, better than nothing so they're okay we don't think they're principally consistent here but even if
2842.48,2845.44, they were principally consistent what do they not tell you
2845.44,2849.44, about they don't tell you about any of the monopolized businesses that and what they're
2849.44,2853.68, going to do with those they don't tell you how they're actually going to transition an economic
2853.68,2858.96, stronghold that's going to that has been exploited towards people they just tell you that you're
2858.96,2865.36," going to give some black people marginally more land And they said that this was going to sit,"
2865.36,2868.44," like people were going to be satisfied with this,"
2868.44,2871.04," even though it was way less than they deserved,"
2871.04,2874.14, given what white people stole historically.
2874.14,2876.72, We think they're the only ones who actually normalize
2876.72,2879.62, a conflict and a civil war within their country.
2879.62,2882.06, But then they tell us that Rwanda
2882.06,2883.8, is a functional democracy.
2883.8,2886.48," First of all, Paul Kagame is an autocrat regime."
2886.62,2888.3," He is a dictator, effectively."
2888.68,2891.0, Do they have some economic systems that work?
2891.12,2895.04," Sure, we can agree, but people do not have civil rights within that country."
2895.32,2896.16, That is never true.
2896.44,2898.52," Secondly, Egypt is also kind of a contextual,"
2898.52,2903.1, because they regulated their specific economic things by having courts first.
2903.24,2906.32, We think this is also so um civil and political
2906.32,2913.04, rights let's get into some then specifics of the debate and direct responses to those things
2913.04,2919.04, firstly we tell you that the problem is with um land redistribution and like in status quo even
2919.04,2924.16, in democracies right is that it's for it's controlled by the elite there is an inequality
2924.16,2925.2, within south africa that's something we can con controlled by the elite there is an inequality within south africa
2925.2,2930.96, that's something we can concede to right but why is their land still controlled by the elite not
2930.96,2936.88, we give you a full five-layer analysis on the nature of governments who are going to come into
2936.88,2942.24, power right and even if they originally had altruistic incentives why they have a jesus
2942.24,2946.08, complex by thinking they saved and actively liberated people
2946.08,2951.04, in the struggle and think then they don't owe as much to the citizens as they should and are
2951.04,2955.76, willing to manipulate the power they have especially when there's no accountability
2955.76,2960.64, mechanism to necessarily hold them accountable we think at that point we think they take a lot of
2960.64,2969.92, the wealth for themselves as we've seen in status quo or just give it to their friends loyalists this is things that they never responded to within this debate other than to say
2969.92,2975.36, they made election promises or like promises during the liberation struggle that they actively
2975.36,2980.0, are still going to uphold for some reason they give you no examples they give you no analysis
2980.0,2984.64, as to why especially when they actually fail on the promises they made because what they actively
2984.64,2989.2, said in the struggle is that you get all your land back everything they deserve now they're
2989.2,2994.08, giving you this cap that means you don't even get that what are we then talking about and um
2994.08,2999.12, further than that right they tell you that we're going to have little buy-in into our democracy
2999.12,3006.56, because people distrust like colonial governments right yes everyone distrusts um exploitative regimes
3006.56,3012.24, exploited instructions democracy is the like direct opposite of that we think people largely
3012.24,3018.0, buy in to what we're doing here but why do they buy in even more because they get to self-determine
3018.0,3023.36, it means that they get to actively choose who they have in power and have a political voice
3023.36,3026.56, to choose what kind of policies shape their lives
3026.56,3030.8, right we think that even if you don't have a lot of money to send your child to school the fact
3030.8,3036.08, that you have a political voice to actively call out government for its lack of um investment in
3036.08,3041.2, the education system is still a mechanism for which you are able to protect yourself when you
3041.2,3051.22, don't have like all that money even though we don't think like everyone is stood for within a country even if we run on their best case but note them why people aren't even
3051.22,3056.32, self-reliant when they can't even tell us who is going to be in this and their side of the debate
3056.32,3060.76, or that it's the majority of the country but they can't even tell you that it's there's a likelihood
3060.76,3066.72, that this happens but not that even in an economic sector right the harm that happened
3066.72,3073.04, even within that space of society was not just the wealth stolen right that's just one aspect
3073.04,3078.0, but when you go to your job there's a lack of protection in mind because you don't have a claim
3078.0,3084.08, to that protection it means you're actively having your dignity violated every time police like strip
3084.08,3086.2, search you for something and necessarily
3086.2,3091.32, brutalize you in the streets. It's when you don't have a claim to have sick leave at your
3091.32,3096.32," job, right? We think these are all problems that still run rampant in their society that"
3096.32,3101.68," actively means people are hurt every single day, do not have their dignity recognized"
3101.68,3107.52, on a precedent level within any system of society and that is necessarily
3107.52,3113.04, something you're always going to prioritize more when they tell you safety is something that's very
3113.04,3118.72, important to you but somehow make that analogous to economic rights and not the very rights that
3118.72,3125.6, put people in jail when they necessarily harm your safety. Note the contradiction there and why they can't have it all.
3125.8,3128.24, Not why we actually can have it all.
3128.36,3131.84," Because when you set a precedence of dignity within society,"
3132.04,3136.04," we think when the ANC comes into power, Mandela directly states"
3136.04,3139.24, that there needs to be a true and reconciliation commission
3139.44,3142.24," that necessarily deals with how we reparate people,"
3142.4,3145.76," how we quantify injustice, because it wasn't just an"
3145.76,3152.18, economic harm it was a dignity one and we directly talk about those things and we have bee set up in
3152.18,3157.1, the economic system which is like a form of quota right we have things like affirmative action we
3157.1,3163.34, have things like France and social welfare that trickled down that is the status quo we did have
3163.34,3170.38," both even if it's not to the extent that side of proposition wants, we think it's still better on that comparison."
3173.84,3190.24, Malawi's redistribution plan led to a 40% increase of income for the people involved. Why don't you want this for every single african because it's not equitable at the point in which it's not equal across the globe you can't have a reparation principle and still give that 40 to the elite
3190.24,3195.76, right we don't think that works but when we say to you that that increase in and of itself was
3195.76,3200.52, something that can still gradually happen over time when we sit when we set a precedent that
3200.52,3210.02, people and their dignity matters and it's going to matter in the economic sector as well when we start to reparate them slowly and like prop them up within the financial world we think
3210.02,3214.46, that that's a benefit because we're willing to trade off and push to the side when we then look
3214.46,3220.4, at like democratic and civil rights that necessarily mean you have people in place
3220.4,3225.52, that protect you that safeguard you and that democracy can never backslide because there's a
3225.52,3230.88, constitution and constant pressure that means when people do then have those like power-hungry
3230.88,3237.44, incentives that we do we were called jay consumer we were called um and that necessarily could only
3237.44,3243.76, happen on our side of the house because we realize that things like brutality things like exploitation
3243.76,3246.36," are not exclusive to white people, and that's"
3246.36,3251.02," something that the other side can never actively claim why they protect for those things, so"
3251.02,3253.02, proud to oppose.
3253.02,3257.58," Okay, thank you, Sir."
3257.58,3276.36," Speaker from Obsession, and let's welcome the reply speaker from Africa."
3278.76,3281.12," So I'll be starting my speech in three, two,"
3281.12,3282.02, one.
3282.02,3283.16, Che.
3283.16,3287.04, It was very important to understand the harms that Africans suffered
3287.04,3291.92, historically due to colonialism and due to so many problematic things that were directly
3291.92,3297.2, unchanged on them by white colonizers who chose to take their land and for proposition to stand
3297.2,3301.6, in this debate and tell you that they do not need political rights was very important to them.
3301.6,3308.48," There's a few things that I'm going to talk about in this speech. Firstly, I'm going to talk about strategy. Why proposition? This is this debate on strategy alone,"
3308.48,3312.96," and then I'm going to go on to content and analyze the clashes that happened. I think firstly,"
3312.96,3317.28, note that proposition's case actually gets majority of its building in third speech.
3317.28,3322.96, They give you legitimate actual mechanisms for a model in third. That in itself is strategically
3322.96,3325.12, unjust. But secondly secondly when we questioned their
3325.12,3329.92, strategy when their mechanizations in first speech we told you that you cannot just claim that
3329.92,3335.68, political will and genuine political incentives existed for this policy to be implemented in the
3335.68,3340.64, way that they say they needed to mechanize and show you how that would actually happen
3340.64,3345.36, throughout these speeches they provided no mechanization of why these politisms would be
3345.36,3349.6," held accountable, why they would redistribute the land in the way that they say they would,"
3349.6,3354.4, and all these are the harm just things that they claim. But this meant for their entire case. This
3354.4,3359.12," for all the benefits on individuals getting food, getting land, were contingent on them showing you"
3359.12,3363.76, that their model would ever be mechanized. Sharon questioned this in first speech and throughout
3363.76,3366.74, three speeches they failed to engage and show you what had happened.
3367.04,3369.56," Secondly, we told you that when you redistribute land,"
3369.64,3371.32, it is oftentimes given to the leaders.
3371.66,3373.42, And then those leaders of those countries
3373.42,3377.68, now have some obligation to redistribute it
3377.68,3378.74, to the rest of the society.
3379.08,3381.52, We showed you how historically in colonized states
3381.52,3382.46, that never happened.
3382.76,3389.18," They kept this land, gave it to some of their direct people who bought into their parties people who fought the wars majority"
3389.18,3394.22, of the citizens who are on the ground never got land on redistributive mechanisms we showed you
3394.22,3398.48, why that would never happen but mostly we told you that that's not how reparations works in their
3398.48,3402.38, best case scenario we told you that reparations actually possible on our side the reason why this
3402.38,3409.68, was so is we explained to you that the moment people get political and civic rights then they had the right to claim reparations and to claim
3409.68,3413.84, later that they had historical ownership too we showed you that this is something that they
3413.84,3418.64, got through a judicial system the only response you got to this was you needed money to access
3418.64,3423.04, the judicial system we told you how newly built judicial systems were really accessible for these
3423.04,3428.16, individuals but further than that they did not prove that they got the money that they say is necessary to access
3428.16,3432.16, judicial systems anyway so what then are the comparators on argumentations i think first
3432.16,3436.4, of all which side can have both no we told you that proposition can never have both in this
3436.4,3441.52, debate because effectively countries that prioritized having economic redistributions
3441.52,3445.58, in status quo are still actively in dictatorships that are primarily
3445.58,3450.14, harmful countries like Zimbabwe and it is very weird that they claim Randa under Fort
3450.14,3455.06, Kagame which is literally an autocracy as an example for their case but most important we
3455.06,3459.5, told you that countries that in status quo have both are countries that historically prioritize
3459.5,3464.0, making sure that they first go political high drives that is to say countries like South Africa
3464.0,3466.42," countries like Namibia and countries such as Egypt that they also put political high rights. That is to say countries like South Africa, countries like Namibia, and countries such as Egypt,"
3466.42,3467.6, that they also claim again.
3467.6,3469.48, It feels really weird because the countries
3469.48,3471.52, that first set up democratic systems
3471.52,3473.92, that could hold these politicians into account
3473.92,3476.14, and make sure that they did the policies
3476.14,3477.7, that they promised the citizens.
3477.7,3479.76," Further than that, we told you that the best example"
3479.76,3481.94, for this debate was SA and Zimbabwe.
3481.94,3483.52, Told you that these are countries that exist
3483.52,3489.36, very close to each other in proximity on terms of like geography and all this. Told you that most of the benefits that they
3489.36,3493.76, could incur were symmetric for these two countries but the difference was in what policy they chose
3493.76,3500.24, to use in making sure that they actually achieved their form of like um of freedom and independence.
3500.24,3504.64, We showed you then throughout analogies how Zimbabwe in status quo is significantly worse
3504.64,3507.0, on a political spectrum on an economic spectrum.
3507.0,3515.0, We've shown you how South Africans have directly managed most of them to at least have access and claim land that they historically owned was their ancestors and they got it back.
3515.0,3525.04," We showed you how they managed to recall presidents. The only response they gave you to this was to their example and not the analysis itself, and was merely to say South Africa is corrupt, corruption is bad."
3525.04,3529.44, We don't think that Arasahamdas was conclusive because he showed you that this analysis was not
3529.44,3534.16," based off of that just impact alone. But most importantly, the third speaker concedes that these"
3534.16,3538.56, institutions are unstable on their side. We say that concession in itself meant that they could
3538.56,3559.0," never get the pragmatics that they claimed proud to oppose. Thank you Opposition Reply Speaker, the last welcome to Opposition Reply Speaker."
3559.0,3563.86," Panel, I'm no expert on African history and don't know the full depths of every example,"
3563.86,3569.76, but I don't think this is what debating is about. And I think this is why opposition loses this debate today. This isn't an
3569.76,3575.58, example of what we would have needed. It's strategic and mechanistic evaluation of why they get a
3575.58,3581.0," democracy, but we never get land redistribution. The problem is that the comparative they set up"
3581.0,3590.48," from the very first speech is an unfair one. This isn't South Africa versus Zimbabwe, the literal only example where land redistribution has failed. This is a nuanced"
3590.48,3594.84, engagement that we would have needed from the opposition to win this debate. We win because
3594.84,3599.62, we can engage with our best case and because we can engage with our worst case and still tell you
3599.62,3604.44, why land redistribution wins you the case every single time. For opposition to have any benefit
3604.44,3605.02," in this debate,"
3605.14,3609.44, they would have needed to prove why they get basic quality of life for people. Because what they want
3609.44,3613.58," to claim is, well, I can get economic rights through political rights. But panel, I want you"
3613.58,3618.16," to remember that in my very first speech, I told you that I can never access political rights if I"
3618.16,3623.64, don't have a baseline survivability. I just can't care about going to vote if I don't have bread on
3623.64,3631.14, the table for my family. You get this because of land redistribution panel uniquely that even if you buy that it doesn't work perfectly on our side of the house.
3631.24,3635.96, I think we're more likely to give this to more people. They would only be able to access these political rights anyways.
3636.3,3641.5," Proposition opposition doesn't have any benefit in their very best case, even when they get political rights."
3641.5,3648.56," If they don't explain to you why they get economic ones. Then I want to talk about the comparative exclusivity, right? Because I think opposition"
3648.56,3654.16, can only win this debate if you truly buy that the kind of redistribution we'll get is inherently
3654.16,3658.64," unfair and just goes to flames, right? But I think the problem is, Penno, that you will have to"
3658.64,3662.88," compare this to opposition's democracy going badly, right? And I tell you this in first about"
3662.88,3669.28, deadlocks having no actionability because the leaders just don't care. You're just in clashes with the ethnic parties the whole
3669.28,3673.34," time. And because people want redistribution, have an active incentive to overthrow a government"
3673.34,3678.24," that doesn't give them that, right? They never engage with that, right? Because the problem here"
3678.24,3682.36," is in the worst case, this just means another civil war. This just means a weak government"
3682.36,3688.2, that is overthrown again and again and again. This is their worst case. They never engage with that. We think that we win by that alone.
3688.58,3691.98," Let's engage with our worst case then, right? Because what they tell you here is, well, you're"
3691.98,3695.62," principally inconsistent, panel, we just don't care. We're better at the degree of fulfilling"
3695.62,3699.06," reparations. They never give you a mechanism why they get, like, we get enough, right?"
3699.56,3703.4," But in the second, they want to claim, well, this is inherently an unequal distribution. You only"
3703.4,3709.2, give this to loyalists. They ignore what Tarun and Oud talk to you for four minutes throughout both of their speeches right
3709.2,3713.6, you would necessarily want to cater to everyone rather than creating a small elite right if I
3713.6,3718.16, give Oud and Tahun all of my land it's much more likely than they can that they can overthrow me
3718.16,3722.24, rather than when I give it to all of you in this room because individually you're less likely to
3722.24,3729.52, overthrow me this is an incentive to do land redistribution well i'm not going to give it to all of my like only like the loyalists second i
3729.52,3733.6, think the leader is afraid of being overthrown again if they don't do this well i think because
3733.6,3738.72, people have such a massive desire which they never contest this is likely to be very very very well
3738.72,3743.76, done right we see this in examples we see this in ghana for example right i think other ethnic
3743.76,3747.46, groups will then hold them in check it's likely to be very well done. But even if that weren't
3747.46,3750.92," true, they tell you well, but like the government is too weak. Panel at best is asymmetric,"
3750.92,3754.36," if the government is so weak, they never get a democracy on ours, their side of the house"
3754.36,3758.14, as well. I think much rather it's then easier to get land redistribution because it's only
3758.14,3762.04, one time because ethnic parties have an active incentive to buy into that and to get it well
3762.04,3767.44, done. What is the impact of this panel? I think we're way more likely to get good land redistribution
3767.44,3769.18, than they are to get good democracy.
3769.18,3771.58," But I think even if they win on good democracy,"
3771.58,3773.86, you necessarily have to have economic rights
3773.86,3775.72," before political rights, because you're never"
3775.72,3777.76, able to access a democracy without having
3777.76,3779.44, the baseline survivability.
3779.44,3781.9," Panel, I think opposition then only lastly wins"
3781.9,3784.22, if you really buy that these authoritarian leaders will
3784.22,3787.38," be so brutal and kick their population down and stuff like that, right?"
3787.62,3791.76," I think these are extreme cases in which we get international accountability, similar to their side of the house."
3791.76,3794.14, We have only ever seen this in Zimbabwe.
3794.3,3797.96," Even then, we have gotten US backlash and clearly Mugabe isn't in power anymore."
3798.32,3802.28," Panel, opposition loses this debate because they fail to engage with the comparative in this debate."
3802.54,3804.78, That's a bad democracy against bad land distribution.
3805.24,3807.32, It's good land redistribution against good democracy.
3807.62,3808.68, We win in either case.
3808.9,3810.0, So proud to propose.
3811.94,3813.46," Okay, thank you, other speakers."
