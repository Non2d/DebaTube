0.0,56.24," Okay, looks like that's working. So without any further ado, I'll call upon the first proposition speaker to open up this debate. Thank you. Okay, great. I think I didn't specify this, but I prefer POIs to be in the chat. Thank"
56.24,73.8, you very much. The biggest purpose of the justice system is to reintegrate criminals. The best way we do this
73.8,80.06," is when we give them a front row seat to justice. Two points on framing, and we'll then continue"
80.06,86.54," to two substantive arguments. First, how will this application process look like? We think that"
86.54,92.16, ex-convicts are going to be subject to an application process like happens in the status
92.16,98.24, quo. Note that ex-cons to leave jails must have completed a process of rehabilitation and
98.24,106.4, retributive justice that society consented to collectively through mechanisms of law over 80 percent of people in jail in the united
106.4,112.96, states today are in there for violent crimes and crimes of context as a result we think that it is
112.96,120.16, unlikely for murderers to get in to these places especially because to get in ex-cons will have to
120.16,130.4, go through background checks and interviews like in the status quo obviously with the consideration that they have extenuating circumstances because of this condition
130.4,135.6, characterizing murderers in the police force would be extremely uncomparative for side opposition
135.6,140.4, to the second we think that there are two scenarios we must clash in this debate first where
140.4,145.18," individuals apply and don't get accepted but But second, a condition where they do and enter."
145.3,147.74, Not clashing here would be damning for side opposition
147.74,152.32, because their material couldn't be impacted on either way.
152.5,155.42, We think there are three conditions you should weigh on in this route.
155.42,158.9," On ex-cons, on institutions, and on societal narratives."
159.18,161.06, My third word will speak about.
161.82,166.74," But first, first argument here will prove to you that this measure is necessary to"
166.74,172.54, improve the miserable conditions of ex-cons in the status quo and uniquely improves these conditions.
172.72,177.72," There's two prongs here. First, on necessity, we tell you that in the status quo, ex-cons are"
177.72,182.66," largely discriminated against. In the status quo, the reason ex-cons can't join the police"
182.66,191.46, in the first place is because there exists a narrative and stigma that they're all extremely violent but the principled reason for the justice
191.46,197.4, system to exist is reintegration and therefore they have an obligation to extend mechanisms
197.4,204.02, for reintegrations that are lacking in the status quo and counter this stigma this means that even
204.02,205.74," if this measure is ineffective,"
205.9,209.7, it is principally legitimate and therefore creates a condition in which the government
209.7,216.04," best fulfills its mutual obligations towards citizens, towards ex-comvicts. The impact here,"
216.16,221.74," panel, lies in the idea of safeness. Crimes don't always occur in vacuums. Criminals are not"
221.74,231.06, inherently bad people who intend to commit crimes due to contextual conditions of injustice. Everyone has a right to be recognized as dignified enough to
231.06,237.4," apply for a job, and this dignity tends to materialize in beneficial things for ex-convicts."
237.58,243.54," In Portugal, drug addicts were given jobs at the peak of their addiction, and for that reason,"
243.54,246.52," they reintegrated effectively into society,"
246.52,253.46," they picked themselves up, and 98% of them ended up quitting jobs. We think the mechanisms for"
253.46,258.42, people to reintegrate have to be proposed by the government. This narrative is especially
258.42,266.4," significant because it humanizes conflicts, it gives them tools to achieve the very things that they have and"
266.4,271.76, in here in their human condition and it limits justifications of violence against them simply
271.76,276.88, because they are ex-convicts note in the status quo this causes conditions of unpunished police
276.88,282.64, brutality for instance that cannot continue to go unchecked because this mechanism is separate from
282.64,285.84, effectiveness palin you must weigh it significantly
285.84,292.24, because we proved two things one why this improved the police force but two why in principle this was
292.24,297.6, so beneficial because it dignified criminals and it helped them materialize their humanity yet
297.6,303.36, further if ex-cons can join we think this measure creates three significant benefits one convex are
303.36,305.04, re-indicated because the institution
305.04,309.28, that oppressed them allowed them to enter it no this creates a unique tipping point towards
309.28,314.88, breaking the stigma because the institution in charge of protecting you as an individual
314.88,321.52, tells you it's okay the institution you charge you with your life with the institution your trust
321.52,326.1, is telling you that ex-cons are trustworthy as well. Panelists is a unique
326.1,331.14, voting condition because this debate's biggest impacts lie on ex-cons on our side. We clearly
331.14,336.78," benefit from them the most because even if they're rejected from this job, they have marginally better"
336.78,342.46," conditions for them in day-to-day society due to this destigmatization. But second, ex-cons are"
342.46,345.26, likely to be less stigmatized because police officers are
345.26,349.02," constantly in contact with them. They know that they're people, they have seen successful"
349.02,353.48," conditions of rehabilitation. We think for this reason, it's likely that this job is beneficial"
353.48,358.24," for them. And for this reason, we think that if you want ex-cons to be better off, you vote"
358.24,363.82," proposition. I'll take your POI before I go into second. Yeah, what does the speaker think is the"
363.82,365.7, main reason why these ex-cons would
365.7,371.5, want to join the police force? We tell you that ex-cons on both sides of the house are disenfranchised
371.5,376.22, and lack opportunities. We think that's the mechanism on why they want to apply. We tell
376.22,381.72," you that for that reason, giving them additional benefits to go in is significant, but we also"
381.72,390.64, think that there is a measure of reivindication. These people want to show society that they are worthy of respect and are therefore also likely to join
390.64,394.88, in the first place. We'll prove to you in this second substantive why this measure improves
394.88,399.98, the police force. We tell you that allowing ex-convicts to apply creates four beneficial
399.98,405.24," conditions. One, society now perceives the police as open to change and adjusting to the changing"
405.24,411.3, needs and narratives of societal behaviors. This occurs separately than if people want to apply
411.3,416.62, or not apply. These benefits aren't contingent and therefore opposition can apply them as so.
416.86,421.54," Even if this measure is ineffective, it still incentivizes an institution like the police to"
421.54,425.6, begin adjusting systems that have been historically oppressive.
425.6,430.28," Simply, panel, the condition of the justice system becoming more malleable is beneficial"
430.28,434.68," because it can marginally better serve society when it's open to feedback,"
434.78,439.04," when on our side it is not seen as a historical institution that never moves,"
439.18,442.62, but as something that can adjust to changing needs of society.
443.0,445.64," Second, the justice system for the first time"
445.64,446.9, receives feedback.
446.9,450.3," For true justice, the system needs to be constructed"
450.3,453.38, and serve the individuals it affects the most.
453.38,455.72, We think principally the justice system falls
455.72,459.26, when it ends up harming disenfranchised individuals more
459.26,461.7, in a retributive justice scenario.
461.7,464.66," On our side, one of the justice system's biggest actors,"
464.66,465.12," the police,"
465.36,471.58," are now accepting ex-convicts. In principle, here, the justice system gives them back the very"
471.58,477.76," condition of humanity that they lost, regardless of effectivity. This is why you vote proposition."
478.06,483.44," On our side, you're constructing a system that serves the individuals it oppressed. Opposition"
483.44,486.08, needs to justify why the status quo
486.08,492.24," is enough when it definitely isn't. Practically, in the status quo, having ex-cons allows policemen"
492.24,497.76, to have greater checks on problematic behavior when they enter these spaces. A marginal benefit
497.76,503.12," proposition is unable to materialize, especially when we understand that policemen have become"
503.12,508.0," increasingly oppressive. But third, as ex-cons become increasingly integrated in the long term,"
508.0,513.0, we think criminals' viewpoints help the institution materialize systems for equity.
513.0,521.0," Panel, these are the most effective because they directly respond to a context and condition of people who understand what the system lacks."
521.0,529.42," So even if these changes are very small, they're very effective for this condition. Even in our worst case scenario where this measure creates backlash,"
529.42,535.84," final, we think you weigh here on scale. Improving an institution that serves the entirety of society,"
535.84,540.46, the police who today are not fulfilling their principled obligation towards those they're
540.46,546.08, designed to serve will always outweigh backlash or even a societal condition of this
546.08,550.64, trust that can be created in our worst case scenario because in the long term we have
550.64,556.64, greater mechanisms for correction of this mistrust as these institutions are constantly subject to
556.64,562.64, feedback and are open towards responding to the necessities of citizens and of those it oppresses
562.64,565.76, for justice this is a clear proposition ballot.
569.06,586.0, I thank the first proposition speaker. Invite first stop to open up their side of the debate. Okay. Just go ahead. Okay.
586.0,596.0, Everybody ready?
596.0,598.0, Perfect.
598.0,607.34, Then my time starts now before moving on to a few key points of rebuttal and finally the opposition case.
607.72,612.02," Firstly, a clarification on the purpose of the justice system. It isn't to rehabilitate."
612.02,615.44, That's a means of achieving the purpose of the justice system.
615.88,622.2, The purpose of it is to protect the harmony and the general fabric that keeps society together in peace.
622.62,625.36, Don't be confused by side propositions framework on that.
625.36,628.88," Look, firstly, I'm going to be talking about their model and why it's inherently flawed."
628.88,632.64," Then I'm going to talk about this point on the humanizing criminals and the trust. And finally,"
632.64,637.2, on this idea that cops will actually become less oppressive or that the institution of the police
637.2,641.04," force will become less oppressive. So firstly, on their model, look, they characterize themselves"
641.04,649.92," and pay close attention to how they did this, that the majority of people in prison were in jail for violent crime and that like the people who would be accepted"
649.92,654.8, into the police force needed to fill fulfill these like extenuating circumstances look i don't think
654.8,658.8, they can out frame and get away with squirreling the motion just to saying that it's going to be
658.8,663.68, a minority of these ex-commons that are going to be the only ones that have access to joining
663.68,669.2, these like these institutions because that already like removes up the ability for them to access the majority of
669.2,674.0, their benefits as to why the majority of ex-commons are going to be able to reap the benefits of this
674.0,679.04, change right so look they need to bite the bullet on this because if the majority of criminals are
679.04,684.88, all like in jail for like violent crime then that also means that the majority of ex-cons will be in
684.88,685.44, the police because that needs to be proportional to the ones in jail right like violent crime then that also means that the majority of ex-cons will be in the police
685.44,690.4, because that needs to be proportional to the ones in jail right like that's very crucial and even
690.4,694.88, the ones and pay close attention to this when they're saying that the ones that are turned away
694.88,698.72, like look we're going to say that like if the majority are turned away then it's literally
698.72,704.0, symmetrical to the status quo or like there isn't any in the in the police force but the only change
704.0,710.54, on side propositions house is that hey you get more wasted resources with the whole like application process and needing to interview all of them.
710.54,728.32," But more importantly, it's going to build more resentment, and it's going to build more stigma, which is the very benefit that they're trying to claim. Look, we flip that because we're telling you that when the majority of ex-cons were trying to access and be part of the police force are turned away because they did very bad things and they committed violent crimes then that's going to be a problem because that's"
728.32,732.48, only going to create more stigma for the prisoners that weren't able to access those and those are
732.48,737.36, going to be perceived worse in society because they were not given the chance at like at
737.36,742.08, retribution by joining these institutions that's why we feel we get more stigma and more resentment
742.08,749.28, inside propositions house look they're claiming also that they're going to humanize these people but they can't claim humanizing if most of them get turned
749.28,754.24, away because again you get that increased stigma to those and and also i'm going to clash this with
754.24,758.4, a lot of my substantive on why we actually get more humanization with the exclusive alternatives
758.4,762.72, that we get on our side but finally on this idea that cops are actually less oppressive in their
762.72,768.96, world look first of all we think that these like idea that cops can only become less oppressive if you're allowing ex-cons
768.96,773.12, like work at like as part of them is false we think that they're like painting a very false
773.12,778.8, dichotomy here we think that actually we can get like the institutions to be like less oppressive
778.8,783.12, still within our alternative because you're giving ex-cons the ability to effect more change and more
783.12,789.84, on that later but you're also going to get this idea that like um cops need to uphold the rule of law and they need
789.84,794.24, to stand for that and the public needs to see that they will always be upholding like a high standard
794.24,799.12, of the rule of law because people who are cops firstly needed to respect the law as citizens
799.12,803.44, and then as cops right so under this idea we're going to be clashing a lot but look first of all
803.44,807.52, let me get into some points of framing like why do people commit crime first and foremost look there are
807.52,811.76, three different types of criminals firstly we're going to talk about the ones that like are actually
811.76,815.92, malicious and they're intense they benefit and they want to benefit from crime and they have no
815.92,819.92, remorse and therefore they have this incentive to join the police force because it gives them
819.92,823.6, a leg up and my partner will be specifically dealing with that second of all we have people
823.6,827.92, who may not be bad but they've made bad decisions be it because they have little discipline because
827.92,831.92, they have a short fuse or they're highly emotional and that leads them to making very bad actions
831.92,837.36, with high repercussion we think that the police by nature of their job needs to be very calm and very
837.36,841.44, like even tempered because that's what allows them to do a good job and finally we think that there
841.44,847.66," are people who like they said in their own characterization have grown up around entrenched poverty, and then we're pushed into doing that. With that being said,"
847.7,852.12, the second point of clash here is that the police have access to a lot of like information rich
852.12,856.86," confidential records, resources and insider information that will specifically be dealt"
856.86,860.6," with in that second speech. And finally, this idea of stigma, look, we agree that whether"
860.6,866.84," unfounded or not, like people generally have poor, like poor views or perceptions of criminals."
866.84,868.58, And that's because politicians have incentives
868.58,869.58, to be tough on crime.
869.58,871.36, That's because the media likes to sensationalize
871.36,872.72, the worst kinds of crime.
872.72,874.78," And we think that that's like exceptionally,"
874.78,877.3," and that's a truth in the status quo,"
877.3,878.5, whether proposition wants to or not.
878.5,880.5," Look, the stance here is that the main metric"
880.5,882.98," or motivator for ex-commits, like they said,"
882.98,884.58, they wanna redeem themselves in the eyes of the public
884.58,888.16, because they wanna be helpful and they wanna be be useful we think that that is only up
888.16,891.92, like that can only happen in our side of the house where they aren't part of the police force because
891.92,896.56, of two or three arguments from side proposition the first is this idea of public trust and how
896.56,900.88, it's based on existing perceptions and second of all why they can't actually help combat them in
900.88,904.8, side props only under our alternatives and finally we're going to be talking about why it facilitates
904.8,907.84, crime look sec this first argument on like public trust and the
907.84,912.64, frame the premise here is the framing that we gave you on stigma and why people are already unlikely
912.64,917.2, to trust cops so when people see that the very ex-convicts the ones that are like guilty of
917.2,922.48, disrupting society take jobs in these very high stakes position you get that one their decreased
922.48,928.72, trust in the institutions that put them there in the first place but second of all there's a decreased trust then in the police force that
928.72,934.32, is built of of ex-convicts as well because the people that are meant to protect them that can't
934.32,939.2, live uh the people that are meant to protect like can't actually live up to their very same promises
939.2,942.96, because they were the same people who were disrupting their society to begin with whether
942.96,948.24, it's true or not there we do think that there can be some ex-convicts with good intentions but people are not going to perceive
948.24,952.64, it as that and that's why you get a fall in like this trust in the key part of the like law
952.64,957.52, enforcement system and that's why you see like an emergence of like saving vigilantism or people who
957.52,961.44, don't trust the cops so they take matters into their own hands and that becomes like that creates
961.44,966.8, a very chaotic society and that like means like a myriad of harms in that sense before i move on yes a very quick point
969.28,975.2, on what on your side what safety nets do ex-cons have to reintegrate that's literally my second
975.2,978.4, point so don't worry about it i'm getting there and second of all let's talk about trust within
978.4,982.8, the police look police need high degree of trust in their partners like not just in the office
982.8,988.5," because of all this information that's like very confidential and very important that I framed, but also and especially in the"
988.5,992.8," field, like the person next to them, they need to trust them with their life because of the person"
992.8,995.66, in front of them that has a gun and that's potentially threatening both of their lives.
995.9,1000.24, What happens when the person next to them used to be the person in front of them? That creates for
1000.24,1004.8," a very mistrusting environment and panel, this is very crucial. So when police officers can't trust"
1004.8,1009.2," each other, not only does it risk their lives lives but it prevents them from actually doing a good"
1009.2,1013.84, job and even from the perspective of the ex-convict they're going to build more resentment because
1013.84,1017.6, even if they have good intentions and they want to do a good job the rest of their colleagues
1017.6,1021.2, aren't going to believe that and that's why they build a very strong resentment against their
1021.2,1024.56, colleagues or the people that they're supposed to be wanting to help and that's going to be very bad
1024.56,1026.76, for these stakeholders but second of all on this idea
1026.76,1030.5, where they can't actually help and these safety nets that team mexico was asking me about look
1030.5,1037.2, what do vulnerable people um like in who like might be susceptible to crime respond to best
1037.2,1042.48, and that's i think the very powerful thing that ex-convicts can do is prevent crime before it
1042.48,1045.74, happens especially or like exclusively outside of the
1045.74,1050.7, like police force in the first place look when you get a cop for example or like people who say
1050.7,1055.82, are in these areas that are like filled with like entrenched crime they see cops again with a lot of
1055.82,1060.34, stigma because of the like harms that they've been done right they see them as racial profilers they
1060.34,1064.46, have a very bad perception of cops within these communities that are wrong that have been wronged
1064.46,1076.02," by them so when they see someone who is part of their community and instead joins them, they see them as traitors or as someone who, like, by their own job needs to put them behind bars because they were forced to commit crimes that they may or may not be in agree with."
1076.3,1077.36," But that's period, right?"
1077.36,1080.02," Like, these ex-cons will still have to put them behind bars."
1080.14,1088.1," So they can't be able to reach them or they can't be able to build trust. Or alternatives, for example, like being part of therapy, of counseling, of motivational speaking."
1088.1,1093.9, This is very important and exclusive to our house because of the fact that they're able to help them so much more
1093.9,1097.1, because they're more likely to reach the very people that feel disenfranchised
1097.62,1100.52, and that feel like they can't trust the police in their status quo.
1100.66,1106.16," Right. So under these frameworks, we're so proud to oppose."
1167.0,1192.78, I think the first speaker on opposition invites second prop to continue their side of the debate. you um am i audible invisible Am I audible or invisible? Please do our POI student chat. The stigma that ex-cons at space shackle them to disenfranchisement.
1192.78,1195.66, We strip away harmful perceptions.
1195.66,1198.28, We are so proud to reintegrate them to society.
1198.28,1202.8, I'm going to note three things about opposition's case that largely take out the whole thing
1202.8,1203.8, that they brought to you.
1203.8,1209.72, The first thing is to note that what we told you in our framework was that 80% of the crimes are non-violent crimes.
1209.82,1214.66, That means there's 80% of people that should have the opportunity to reintegrate. I think the fact
1214.66,1219.18, that opposition one wants to strawman our case lost them a lot of relevant rebuttal. But the
1219.18,1223.16, second thing to note is that they're in a double bind because they can simultaneously say that many
1223.16,1229.28," people will join on our side, that the harms are this bad but they cannot also simultaneously oh not people not many"
1229.28,1233.28, people are going to join because then that means that the harms that we present to you are not as
1233.28,1238.56, bad as they want to say we are not going to fall into vigilante chaotic society as opposition one
1238.56,1242.64, paints to you but the third thing is i think we can out from a lot of the characterizations they
1242.64,1249.28, paint to you when we tell you on our side the fact that these convicts are likely to enter a police force means that they
1249.28,1253.96, will face training that they will be told and treated as employees I think the whole thing
1253.96,1257.7, they want to tell you about look at all the confidential files that they're going to be
1257.7,1261.8, facing look at how the violent attacks that they're going to making are extremely unlikely
1261.8,1269.36, because on our side if ex-convicts are likely to enter the police force they are going to be treated as such and if they face necessary training all that kind
1269.36,1273.76, of stuff to actually make sure their job is actually sufficient first question to answer
1273.76,1278.8, then where is the police force as an institution better off opposition's argument that they gave
1278.8,1283.44, you was like on trust and why you need to be able to trust firstly like people don't trust society
1283.44,1291.04, like society will not trust the the police officers knowing that they're convicts but also like between the co-workers and
1291.04,1295.2, police officers they're not likely to have trust because they have a huge stigma i think the very
1295.2,1300.0, thing first thing to note is that they paint the status quo as a huge issue right that there's a
1300.0,1309.84, huge stigma against these people especially perpetuated by politicians that is the exact same status quo that side opposition is defending where these people have no alternatives are
1309.84,1314.64, shackled within the labels of ex-convicts not allowed to have any opportunities to persuade
1314.64,1318.32, but the second thing i would note about this argument is that it just largely asserts that
1318.32,1322.56, on our side because people don't have trust in the government they will simultaneously just take
1322.56,1329.46, action for their own hands go into vigilantism go into a very chaotic society. I think they needed more analysis to warrant this
1329.46,1334.78," huge, huge impact. But let's talk about the trust that people have. We already gave you a way off"
1334.78,1339.42," from first proposition that I want to highlight very clearly. On our side, sure, maybe in the"
1339.42,1343.26," beginning, people are not going to trust the police. But we think that when you are normalized"
1343.26,1345.74, and when more convicts are actually accepted
1345.74,1346.88," into the police force,"
1346.88,1349.72, then the fact that there's more people that are ex-police
1349.72,1351.64, are normalizing the fact that these individuals
1351.64,1353.96," are key workers within the police force,"
1353.96,1356.6," I think in the long-term, we can get that trust."
1356.6,1358.68," Even in the short-term, if there's a transition period,"
1358.68,1360.94," this is like natural, this is organic."
1360.94,1363.04," We think on the long-term, we get that trust."
1363.04,1365.6, But let's also talk about like the co-workers how
1365.6,1369.76, they're less likely to feel safe the whole perception of like them being ex-traders i
1369.76,1375.04, think for in the i think that we can engage in the case that reintegrating them sure in the beginning
1375.04,1380.0, as i explained to you they might feel disconnected they may not be able to like work as best in the
1380.0,1384.24, beginning but i think the long term of it is really really impactful because inside opposition
1384.24,1388.56, they do not have an alternative to even give them the opportunity to join that force to actually
1388.56,1394.72, work and collaborate with people i think that's a huge part of yes you're going to have small issues
1394.72,1398.96, with co-workers i do not think the harm that they paint to you was as big as they wanted you to
1398.96,1403.28, believe what did we tell you on the point of institutions we gave you a second argument on why
1403.28,1409.42, the justice system is so crucial in being open to having feedback. And this was a key argument that opposition one
1409.42,1414.64, really was not sufficiently able to engage with. Because what we told you is regardless of whether
1414.64,1419.88," ex-convicts join, the fact that you are opening up those applications for those specific individuals"
1419.88,1424.7, means that they're one step towards change because you're more likely to have individuals that can
1424.7,1429.5, talk about their experiences in jail actually shed light onto perhaps the abusive natures
1429.5,1434.14," in the status quo. On our side, we are reintegrating and making sure like forms of"
1434.14,1439.12, checks and balances actually being transparent about what happens in the jail system materializes
1439.12,1443.46, on our side of the house on that point. And the huge principle that we bought to be regardless
1443.46,1449.28, of whether these ex-convicts are being being open to feedback of being open to change is a better alternative than the
1449.28,1454.4, status quo the second question is going to be on x convicts but before that i'll take your point
1455.2,1460.24, yeah so under your model like what metric would you use to like filter out these applications
1460.24,1465.84, would they be treated as any regular applicant or is there a special police forces are going
1465.84,1471.3," to be as any other job, have job interviews, have background checks, make sure that a person"
1471.3,1475.38, is actually viable to take on that job and have to face that training.
1475.38,1479.66, I don't think that the worst case you paint of us having extremely violent and just horrible
1479.66,1482.88, convicts on the police force is extremely unlikely.
1482.88,1486.5, The second question I'm going to talk about is where ex-convicts best off.
1486.5,1488.04, The second argument they wanted to give you
1488.04,1489.86, are like why do people like ex-convicts
1489.86,1492.12, on their side of the house somehow counseling
1492.12,1494.08, and some mechanism to support them?
1494.08,1495.32, I think I would first note
1495.32,1497.34," that there's no exclusivity of that point, right?"
1497.34,1499.06," Because they tell you counseling exists,"
1499.06,1500.32, it helps ex-convicts.
1500.32,1501.76," If that already exists in the status quo,"
1501.76,1503.46," that is a mechanism that is parallel,"
1503.46,1509.6," that is not a benefit for their side. But I would say even if exclusive counselling exists on their side of the house,"
1509.74,1514.34, I think the fact that you are giving them a job opportunity is a bigger benefit. The fact that
1514.34,1519.04," you are recognised as someone to be given and worthy of a job, which is very, very different"
1519.04,1524.0," than in the status quo, where you are painted as someone who does harm and is an aggressor,"
1524.06,1525.44, you are not given a second
1525.44,1529.82, chance. But I want to then bring back the first argument on reintegration and why the principle
1529.82,1534.34," was so important, because they completely just dropped the principled obligation of the justice"
1534.34,1539.26," system. Because if they themselves recognize that the point was to prevent harm, then preventing"
1539.26,1544.56, harm is to make sure that people are reintegrated or actually rehabilitated and can function within
1544.56,1545.12, society.
1545.12,1549.98," We understand that ex-convicts aren't perfect, but on our side, we have better checks and balances"
1549.98,1554.66," for these individuals when they're reintegrated within society, maybe have a place in a police"
1554.66,1559.26," force, are checked and balanced due to like having a job that requires like mental and physical"
1559.26,1563.94," capabilities. We think on our side, you have better mechanisms to treat and make sure that"
1563.94,1569.42, these ex-convicts are doing the best that they can. I think the strategic value of this question is that
1569.42,1573.52," we prove the necessity of the policy, right? Like why this is so necessary while in the status quo,"
1573.6,1578.46," you are simply leaving behind the most vulnerable individuals who require a job, who require"
1578.46,1583.26," redemption, who require an opportunity. Let's then move into our third argument on societal"
1583.26,1589.76," perceptions, where we'll prove to you that these harmful, harmful negative stigmatized views of ex-convicts are enhanced"
1589.76,1593.6, on our side this is directly going to engage on the worst case scenario that opposition wants to
1593.6,1598.8, paint you on why they're going to continue to be stigmatized continue to have resentment we think
1598.8,1603.92, that the problem in the status quo as both sides agree is the fact that these convicts are
1603.92,1605.4, perpetuated and seen as aggressors not reliable actors but is the fact that these convicts are perpetuated and seen as
1605.4,1610.9," aggressors not reliable actors, but also the fact that these police force and these individuals"
1610.9,1612.24, are machines of abuse.
1612.24,1615.5, I think there's two key ways that we change such societal perception.
1615.5,1619.74," The first thing is that if these individuals actually join the workforce, they're legally"
1619.74,1620.74, finding to be protectors.
1620.74,1624.74," They go through the training, are taught to be safeguarding society, the role they take"
1624.74,1629.2," on as a police officer, marginally increases and benefits the societal perception"
1629.2,1633.92, that currently exists in the status quo i think the very fact that they applied to the job in the
1633.92,1638.56, first place knows that they at least want to have a job keep it therefore we'll actually make sure
1638.56,1643.28, that they're safeguarding policies that they're going and aligning with what is necessary for the
1643.28,1648.7," job but secondly on our side we do think we stem, we can humanize the police force, right? Because you"
1648.7,1653.12, are more likely to add nuance to the type of people that are included and represented within
1653.12,1658.36," the police force. These individuals, ex-convicts are directly those who have felt the impact of"
1658.36,1662.54," the justice system. We think that when they're included, when they're represented within the"
1662.54,1667.2," workforce, that humanizes them rather than just simply seeing as corrupt seeing them abusive as"
1667.2,1670.72, in the status quo i think in our absolute worst case scenario where these
1670.72,1674.48, individuals are violent at least they are part of a workforce where they can
1674.48,1678.64, be held accountable can be seen by the public eye i think that wins us even in
1678.64,1682.0, our worst case scenario we proved you the necessity of this we proved you why
1682.0,1700.24, ex-convicts absolutely left with no alternatives we are so proud to propose i thank the second proposition speaker no worries spain i know it's
1700.24,1704.56, easy to do so just everyone make sure that you're setting your two to everyone so that the pois go
1704.56,1705.8, there it happens all the time.
1706.36,1708.18, I invite second opposition speaker
1708.18,1709.18, to continue their side.
1719.04,1720.02," Okay, am I audible?"
1723.7,1724.3," Yeah, right."
1724.64,1724.82, Sorry.
1725.88,1726.08, Yes. Okay.
1734.08,1739.78," Judge, I want to be very clear. Essentially, all of the benefits that Team Mexico gives you,"
1739.98,1750.74," as for stigmatization, as for benefits of the justice system, benefits to ex-convicts, are not exclusive to ex-convicts having access to a job as police. There are other ways to access"
1750.74,1754.7," those benefits on our side of the house, which we are more than happy to support and tell you from"
1754.7,1760.54, first. What we are not willing to do is to worsen societal trust and make situations far worse with
1760.54,1764.4, the harms that we give you that Mexico responds to very weakly. I want to look at two things in
1764.4,1766.68," this speech, the principle and practicality,"
1766.68,1767.86, and then give you a substantive point
1767.86,1771.34, on how Team Mexico side of the house increases crime.
1771.34,1773.1," So firstly, Team Mexico comes up here"
1773.1,1775.28, and gives us like a bunch of principles that sound great.
1775.28,1777.4," You know, the idea that ex-cons deserve the ability"
1777.4,1779.28," to have jobs, that ex-cons deserve the ability"
1779.28,1780.48," to integrate into society,"
1780.48,1782.48, that ex-cons like deserve to be humanized.
1782.48,1783.8," Look, this is fine,"
1783.8,1786.12, but why does this principle fundamentally fall?
1786.12,1787.92, Because none of this is exclusive
1787.92,1790.26, to ex-convicts being policemen.
1790.26,1792.42," Look, they can have access to other jobs"
1792.42,1793.86, that are not in the police force.
1793.86,1795.68, They can improve perceptions by interacting
1795.68,1799.08, on a one-on-one level with people within society.
1799.08,1799.96," We would argue that in fact,"
1799.96,1800.98," that in terms of perceptions,"
1800.98,1803.24, that is far more effective than the hierarchical nature
1803.24,1804.98," that we tell you of a policeman,"
1804.98,1807.84, like interacting with someone on the ground level but look they need to give you
1807.84,1812.72, a tangible reason as to why this principle is exclusive to police when in reality it is not
1812.72,1816.32, that principle false but realistically that's less important in debate more importantly is the
1816.32,1821.28, practicality first thing i want to touch on here is the model so first of all i want to be clear
1821.28,1828.22," that most of the benefits they give you can be accessed without this model look the, the perception of the police force as being static can be combated by things like"
1828.22,1832.5," which are already existing, such as the hiring of more minorities who are not criminals."
1832.5,1835.94," For example, in the United States, we see constantly increasing levels of African Americans"
1835.94,1837.5, participating in the police force.
1837.5,1841.44," This is something that we generally support, but we do not support these people being convicted"
1841.44,1842.44, criminals.
1842.44,1848.72," Look, the idea of like being able to give feedback to the justice system. This is something which ex-convicts are able to do without having access to the police"
1848.72,1852.24, force. I would also note that the police force is largely disconnected from the justice system
1852.24,1856.0," and the courts, so we don't necessarily understand the mechanism. That's exactly why once they're"
1856.0,1859.28," like a low-level police officer, they would suddenly be able to like reform the justice"
1859.28,1863.6," system. I would argue that acting as someone who like, you know, like fights for this justice like"
1863.6,1865.88, outside of the police force would be far more effective.
1865.88,1867.78, But also look at this situation here.
1867.78,1869.98," Look, sorry about like not misunderstanding the idea"
1869.98,1871.3," of 80% of violent criminals,"
1871.3,1874.12," but even 20% of violent criminals who get freed from jail,"
1874.12,1875.5, it's still realistically a lot.
1875.5,1877.48, I wanna contrast this with the idea of the model
1877.48,1878.74, of being able to turn people down.
1878.74,1880.24, So we have two different scenarios here.
1880.24,1882.58," The first of all, is that even if it's a small number,"
1882.58,1884.74, some number of violent criminals are now in charge
1884.74,1888.96," of enforcing the law. Look, you're unable to like filter out all of these violent"
1888.96,1893.36, criminals with the vague model that Mexico gives you. The idea of saying that they go through a
1893.36,1897.6, training program or go through a legally binding process is not enough to mitigate the harms of
1897.6,1902.8, violent criminals who are likely able to get into the police force with this model regardless. Or
1902.8,1908.48, you have the alternative here of so many people getting turned away because you have a fear of violent criminals being on the police court
1908.48,1912.24, force so you are not able to access the benefits from proposition because you cannot change the
1912.24,1916.72, perceptions or access the benefits if the police like if ex-convicts are not being hired at
1916.72,1921.92, extremely high rates look at the like exclusive harms we bring you though first of all is the
1921.92,1928.48," opportunity cost and like a waste of resources if you're just turning people down, that's like minor. But secondly now is the stigma that"
1928.48,1932.72, increases for ex-convicts who are turned away and are not allowed to access this job. If they want
1932.72,1936.56," to look at stigma, I would argue that the stigma is far worse for these people who now get turned"
1936.56,1940.8," down. If violent criminals are such a big problem, I would argue that that number will likely be"
1940.8,1944.8," very high. But secondly, the thing I want to touch on here is why people join the police force in"
1944.8,1948.16," the first place. So generally speaking, you have two reasons. Firstly, you have"
1948.16,1951.44," people who are well-intentioned, and secondly, you have people who are malicious. I'll touch on why"
1951.44,1954.72," malicious people are obviously bad in my substantive, but let's look at well-intentioned"
1954.72,1958.88, people. First to note that Mexico gives a substantive argument on people being well-intentioned
1958.88,1962.64," in the police force, which like drops all of our announcements we give you in first and does not"
1962.64,1968.56, directly clash with it. What do we tell you? That even well-intentioned police officers if their ex-convicts are unlikely to
1968.56,1973.28, help people on the ground because of the hierarchy that you see when they interact with people which
1973.28,1977.44, is to say it's unlikely you shift perceptions when the person that is the like police officer
1977.44,1981.6, trying to persist those perceptions on the ground level is to not commit crime and like that sorts
1981.6,1990.0," of thing or is someone who has power over you, who has the ability to arrest you, this is unlikely to meet like the like universal like respect level that"
1990.0,1993.52," is necessary to shift perceptions on the ground. We would argue that things like therapy, things"
1993.52,1997.4," like counseling, things like, you know, like motivational speaking are far more effective"
1997.4,2001.34, at accessing those benefits because that power imbalance does not exist. But I also want to
2001.34,2004.98," touch on this idea of trust, which is very important. Look, Mexico essentially asserts"
2004.98,2007.84, that these people are going to be trusted this assertion is not enough for them
2007.84,2012.64, to win this debate because look at the harmful perceptions of conflicts which exist convicts
2012.64,2017.28, which exist in society and what is the mechanistic reason for this because the justice system tells
2017.28,2021.84, people who are ex-convicts that they are bad people and even if it's not true this perception
2021.84,2028.0, does exist therefore the difference is now that this lack of trust so like the difference in the status quo between like convicts in general and complex
2028.0,2032.16, specifically in the police force is that trust gets extended to the police force which requires
2032.16,2036.64, public trust to function and lastly this idea here of long-term trust they don't really mechanize why
2036.64,2040.8, this is the case look i think this is likely untrue because the resentment from police officers
2040.8,2044.24, who put their lives on the line to convict criminals now they have to work alongside
2044.24,2047.76, but also the idea that this doesn't work with society is the knowledge that criminals
2047.76,2052.32, exist is enough to lose public trust and also because of the fact that interactions with cops
2052.32,2057.52, firstly are very rare so perceptions on a societal level are unlikely to shift and secondly these
2057.52,2061.6, people do not know that the cops were ex-criminals when they interact with them therefore they are
2061.6,2067.68, unable to shift perceptions on the ground level all of those benefits they are unable to access on their side of the house note that the society is a
2067.68,2071.92, majority in terms of perceptions and they are unable to access them i'll take the point why
2071.92,2077.2, would minority quotas counseling for congress only exist on your side of the house look we're telling
2077.2,2081.44, you that sure to some extent it is symmetrical the difference now is the harms when it comes to
2081.44,2087.84, things like trust and when it comes to things like what i'm going to get into now about facilitating more crime that is what is not symmetrical so how do
2087.84,2091.6, you facilitate facilitate more crime on team mexico side of the house first i want to characterize
2091.6,2094.88, what type of people that we're talking about here we're looking at people who are like so deeply
2094.88,2098.48, entrenched in crime that crime will always be a part of their lives look they like grew up in
2098.48,2102.24, lives lives of crime these are people who like don't have families but have families in terms
2102.24,2108.8, of the people that they interacted with in crime networks in gangs extremely tight familial like bonds something which jail times
2108.8,2114.16, can really not undo now when these people have access to the police force specifically ex-convicts
2114.16,2118.16, having access to the police force they now have access to weapons they have access to evidence
2118.16,2122.24, things like dna or forensics access to knowledge on police raids or like where the police will be
2122.24,2128.16, patrolling at certain times access to a police chief that can be lied to and i also want to note here why is this something that can
2128.16,2133.04, like not be mitigated on on like side proposition side of the house assuming that ex-convicts are
2133.04,2137.36, allowed on the police force at all as per their model because there is no way to know when ex
2137.36,2141.28, convicts intentions when they join the police force which is to say the only thing they have
2141.28,2146.8, access to are likely you know like a record of crimes that they've committed i would argue that like convicts are like realistically if you want to
2146.8,2150.96, look at like interview processes it's very easy to lie and say you are well-intentioned when you are
2150.96,2154.88, not therefore someone who's committed an armed robbery if you're just looking at like face value
2154.88,2159.2, could be equally reformed and well-intentioned as they could be malicious it is likely something
2159.2,2163.12, that will always be a problem so what does this look like it looks like giving these people giving
2163.12,2167.38," false information to the police to force people to like, or to force them to protect criminals that they"
2167.38,2170.74," are friends with to turn their back on crime, which is happening in certain neighborhoods to"
2170.74,2174.7," take bribes from criminals because you are more sympathetic to them. Look, the reason that cartels"
2174.7,2179.18," are such a problem in so many countries in Latin America is because of things like bribes, which"
2179.18,2183.08, allow for this crime to happen. Note that the effects of things like bribery are very similar
2183.08,2189.36, to the effects of ex-convict police officers who are sympathetic to criminals in allowing crime to happen in the first
2189.36,2193.92, place the secondary impact beyond just more crime here is that when people see police officers being
2193.92,2199.84, arrested for example for being moles citizens and police officers both have decreased trust in the
2199.84,2204.08, police force remember why trust is so important specifically in something which upholds justice
2204.08,2208.42," and upholds safety within our society and i want want to be clear here, we understand that this might be"
2208.42,2213.26," an inherently rare situation, although maybe not. But look, even if it is rare, on any scale,"
2213.54,2218.58," the propagation of crime, especially coming from the organization, which is meant to deter crime,"
2218.72,2227.72, is unacceptable on a principled and a practical level. For of these reasons I am very proud to oppose.
2231.72,2256.46," I thank the second opposition speaker and invite third prop to close out constructive speeches for their side of the debate. Hi, can you hear me?"
2258.16,2258.54, Okay.
2259.22,2268.16, Please make all POIs through the chat.
2274.24,2280.8," When the justice system labels people as convicts, potentially taking their destiny from their hands, they have a responsibility to reintegrate them to at least mitigate the harms that they caused."
2280.8,2291.0," First, I want to talk about the decision that makes Team Spain's path to the ballot extremely complicated in this debate, and it's in regards to the counter mechanism they bring."
2291.0,2307.9," Two errors here. The first one is that they never warrant why this is exclusive, and this was even conceded by the second speaker, meaning that all of the benefits they claim on their side of the house can be easily absorbed for hours and therefore this mechanism, thank you very much, helps us a lot."
2307.9,2314.0," But note that they bank their case on alternatives like quotas and counseling, yet never explain"
2314.0,2316.76, to you how they disappear on our side.
2316.76,2319.26, We think that this is incredibly important.
2319.26,2326.46," But secondly, they never take into account that they'll never improve a status quo that they themselves criticize,"
2326.66,2331.4," that they themselves characterize as harmful, that they themselves concede have stigma,"
2331.4,2338.68," have no opportunities for convicts, and still these mechanisms of counseling and all this aren't enough to fix it."
2338.76,2341.38, That is precisely why we're proposing this motion.
2341.74,2345.84, That is precisely why you only have a marginal case that we can largely
2345.84,2350.32, absorb so let's go on to the first question which is under what side of the house do we have better
2350.32,2356.4, conditions for ex-convicts they told you that ex-convicts if they don't get into these jobs
2356.4,2361.36, they will be resented first we believe that they're more recent under your side of the house
2361.36,2365.48, because they get no opportunity whatsoever to apply to these jobs.
2365.48,2368.52, I think that therefore the mechanism and the narrative
2368.52,2370.54, that you're sending under your side of the house
2370.54,2373.22, is that no one that has stepped into jail
2373.22,2377.42, deserves a place in a job in the justice system.
2377.42,2379.48," I think this is a lot more detrimental,"
2379.48,2382.5, and that is one mechanism in which you get more resentment
2382.5,2384.0, under their side of the house.
2384.0,2391.12, But then they told you that the solution they propose is counseling as and therapy note that these aren't mechanisms
2391.12,2396.48, of reintegration these are mechanisms of rehabilitation and i think that therefore
2396.48,2401.84, whenever they never prove to you why ex-convicts are likely to have access to opportunities like
2401.84,2405.62," basic jobs under their side of the house, I don't think they can"
2405.62,2410.96, win the debate because they never explain to you how they're likely to reintegrate under their side
2410.96,2416.4," of the house. But lastly, they brought to a third argument on increased crime in which they"
2416.4,2422.16, essentially talked to you about this ex-convicts having access to guns and information and how
2422.16,2425.92, dangerous that is for society. society first this is our complete worst
2425.92,2431.28, case scenario a worst case scenario in which you literally ignore the mechanism we gave to you
2431.28,2436.0, in which this ex-convicts have to go through processes like background checks have to go
2436.0,2441.68, through mental health checks etc we think that therefore we largely mitigate this risk
2441.68,2445.5, when we have these kinds of mechanisms implemented under our side
2445.5,2452.48," of the house. But secondly, if they want to claim that counselling is so good and so effective under"
2452.48,2458.82," their side of the house, then we can largely assert that these ex-convicts are being rehabbed"
2458.82,2464.52," effectively, and therefore the possibility of them doing these kinds of actions is very small,"
2464.62,2471.0," taking them at their highest ground, where those alternatives are even slightly better on their side of the house."
2471.0,2480.0, I think that's in the moment in which we can appropriate this analysis and tell you that because of that rehab process they're less likely to like reintervene.
2480.0,2490.64," But lastly, we talked to you about the importance of having a job. We talked to you about like an experiment done in Portugal, where they set drug dealers to have jobs and they stopped being"
2490.64,2496.8," involved in these types of crimes. Why? Because having a job, it's having a form of literally"
2496.8,2501.68," being busy with something that isn't crime, of literally learning to coexist with other"
2501.68,2509.68," individuals. We think that therefore, because they never proved to you a single mechanism as to how they will get jobs for these people they can't claim"
2509.68,2514.72, any of these impacts but what did we tell you in regards to this we brought to your first argument
2514.72,2520.32, on ex-convicts in which we told you at first they're in a space in which they're less likely
2520.32,2525.86," to be stigmatized why because policemen believe in the power of the justice system,"
2525.94,2532.52, because policemen are less likely to stigmatize like this ex-convicts whenever they have seen
2532.52,2538.76, success stories of convicts that have come out of jail successfully and that have like undergone
2538.76,2545.64," trauma and still were able to thrive. Therefore, we understand that if these people get in, the kinds of jobs"
2545.64,2551.36, we can guarantee are a lot better because they're marginally exposed to less stigma to whatever job
2551.36,2558.2," opposition wants to claim these people can get in. But secondly, even if no one gets into these jobs"
2558.2,2563.02," and they're rejected, we believe that those that don't get into the justice system will be"
2563.02,2565.76, benefited because they're seen as valuable
2565.76,2571.04, people because the police forces are sending a narrative in which they're telling society as a
2571.04,2577.52, whole that these people can be recruited for these kinds of very important jobs i think that therefore
2577.52,2583.6, this has a trickle-down effect in which if the police forces trust so much on these people to
2583.6,2586.8," be able to have an important job, such as being a policeman,"
2586.8,2592.7," then it is very likely that they trickle down into other kinds of jobs, into other kinds of industries,"
2593.04,2600.0," because the institution provides this trust, because the institution tells society that these people are valuable."
2600.2,2602.46," Before I move on to my second question, yes, you're good."
2602.9,2605.36," Yes, a clarification on exclusivity."
2605.54,2610.2," You've been running up and down your bench that the, like, it's exclusive benefits of,"
2610.42,2615.66," like, reintegrating is exclusive only under your model, and yet you're trying to take"
2615.66,2616.92, away the benefits of alternatives.
2617.0,2617.6, So which is it?
2617.76,2620.48, Is it exclusive to making them part of the police force or not?
2620.94,2629.0," We think that what you're confusing is that you're literally giving us an alternative rehabilitation, which is something that we also have on the our side of the house."
2629.0,2638.0," Reintegration is the exclusive part. So, secondly, under what side of the house does the justice system become more efficient?"
2638.0,2650.32, They brought to a first argument on public trust in which they told you at a they're going to get access to extremely confidential information first literally the way the justice system works is that they go up rankings and
2650.32,2655.76, therefore they start getting more important cases when they prove themselves as trustworthy this is
2655.76,2660.24, not only something that happens with convicts this is something that happens with literally
2660.24,2665.32, every single person that gets into the police forces. We think that this wouldn't like stopping
2665.32,2669.18," the case on the other side of the house. But secondly, we tell you that these policemen"
2669.18,2674.44," get trained and therefore they have mechanisms of checks and balances to prevent leakages,"
2674.56,2678.62, even in our worst case scenario. I think we outweigh this because they're basing themselves
2678.62,2683.76, on an extremely small probability. But then they talk to you about decreased trust in the
2683.76,2685.02, institutions. They talk to you about how trust in the institutions. They talk to
2685.02,2691.38, you about how the public has no trust. We believe that the trust towards the police isn't very big
2691.38,2695.64, in the status quo. Both teams can see that in the moment in which they give the characterization
2695.64,2701.18," on vigilante groups already existing in the status quo. So therefore, even in their best"
2701.18,2712.0," case scenario in which this is true, at least on the other side of the house, this wouldn't be a huge change because this is a condition that already exists, and therefore that entire point is very marginal."
2712.0,2725.24," But then what did we tell you? We put a second argument on the justice system, in which we told you at first, this justice systems are more likely to be open for change in the sense that now ex-convicts have a right to be heard because"
2725.24,2731.14, they literally belong to the institution. They can criticize jail. They can criticize all the
2731.14,2736.24, things they went through when they are a part of the institution and the institution legitimizes
2736.24,2741.9," them. But even if this wasn't the case, we talked to you about the importance of having insight in"
2741.9,2745.58, the mind of criminals. We understand that particularly in
2745.58,2751.28," the example they bring to us of cartels in Latin America, information that former cartel members"
2751.28,2756.86, can give on these kinds of cartels is extremely valuable. We think this is something worth fighting
2756.86,2762.86, for because the police in the status quo is ending with mechanisms that actually promote justice.
2762.86,2768.56, We bring it back thank you
2773.2,2787.0," i thank the third proposition speaker and invite third op to close out constructive speeches this debate okay am i audible okay then uh i prefer my pys in the chat, by the way."
2787.0,2788.0, Okay.
2788.0,2789.76, Then my time starts now.
2789.76,2794.14," At the top of my speech, I just want to clarify a bit on mutual exclusivity and what exactly"
2794.14,2797.42," it is that side opposition have been running up or down our bench in this case, because"
2797.42,2800.1, there seems to be a little bit of confusion.
2800.1,2815.54," We tell you that a lot of the benefits side prop is pushing in their model, which from first until third had been exclusively about integrating them and rehabilitating them solely through having them become police officers and then suddenly changed in third to try and co-opt all our benefits."
2815.62,2828.0," I'll explain why they're choosing a second, but I just want to clarify the fact that like, right, so they're trying to tell you that they can suddenly access all our benefits as well as theirs, right, by having it open to every single kind of rehabilitation and reintegration."
2828.0,2834.0, And the extent of their rebuttal to our point about that being like still mutually exclusive is that they're supporting reintegration and we're not.
2834.0,2845.02," We think offering them alternative job opportunities is doing just as much to reintegrate them into society, i.e. they have a job, can pay their bills, and live in a house the same way any other regular citizen can, right?"
2851.86,2852.14," But the idea here of mutual exclusivity comes at the point at which police officers, the justice system, and society in general,"
2855.06,2855.16," feels like it's fulfilling its role to these ex-convicts, right?"
2861.26,2861.52," As long as they are convinced that they are doing something to help these people by opening the door to them to let them apply to become police officers,"
2863.64,2867.92," it's like a sense of virtue signaling, right? They're going to pat themselves on the back for feeling like they've done something to help these convicts. And then"
2867.92,2871.56, they're not actually going to do something to facilitate all the convicts that maybe don't
2871.56,2876.04, want to be police officers and want to like go back to school or become a therapist or become
2876.04,2880.44," a doctor or whatever else, right? The reality is that they need a variety of opportunities."
2880.58,2884.64," And when you're giving them one that seems like a holy grail, but it's actually not doing anything,"
2884.82,2893.0," you're closing a lot of other doors, especially when stigma exists right, and then they tell us that like, I'm sorry actually I'll just move on"
2893.0,2908.82," to my cautious because I have a lot to get there so I'm going to be doing this on a bit of like a stakeholder analysis right so first on X cons and me weighing throughout so they tell us at first that-cons are the most crucial stakeholder in this debate. Look, even if we take them at their best and say we still think we do more for ex-cons,"
2908.96,2912.76," but the reality panel is that there's a lot more at stake in this debate, right? Because when you're"
2912.76,2917.26, talking about something as crucial as the way that policing and crime is perceived generally by
2917.26,2921.3," society, it's going to affect a lot of other things. And i.e., that's where it's important"
2921.3,2924.92," to consider things like the way people perceive their justice system, the way police do their"
2924.92,2927.88," jobs, and also the way that future crime is prohibited or not."
2928.06,2932.98, And this is where we also win on a long term kind of scale. I'll talk about that later when I get to my final bit of class.
2932.98,2936.92," But first, these S-cons. So two scenarios here. One is that they apply and don't get in."
2937.18,2940.8, What happens here is that it builds a sense of resentment because they're offered false hope.
2941.0,2947.36," They tell some first the majority are going to be rejected. So there's really no harm done if we think that it's dangerous for them to get in, right? So they're kind of"
2947.36,2951.02," preempting this idea that we're going to tell you that it's like really bad if they get in, right?"
2951.14,2954.74," The reality is that it's also bad if they get turned away, right? Because like I already told"
2954.74,2958.16," you, it's virtue signaling and it's going to close doors in other areas of opportunities, right?"
2958.16,2961.26," Because they feel like, oh, they have a job here and they don't need it over there, right? And"
2961.26,2965.12, like the harm that comes there is that these people feel like a system that
2965.12,2969.36, like promised them help is now turning them away and that's going to lead to more resentment and
2969.36,2973.52, more feelings of like no dignity for themselves it also just takes away the time that they could
2973.52,2977.92, be putting in to better alternative to themselves right to something that's going to do more for
2977.92,2981.76, them rebuilding their like self-love after going through something like being in jail which both
2981.76,2987.3," sides seem to agree is generally kind of a traumatic thing we think it's actually worse for their dignity when they're turned away, when"
2987.3,2990.98, they're trying to show improvement. We think there are other paths where they won't be turned away
2990.98,2996.68, that are going to be frowned upon a bit more inside the population's world. So what happens
2996.68,3001.42," if they apply and they do get in, right? A couple of things here. The reality is that there's a"
3001.42,3005.6, long-standing public perception about criminals that is highly negative.
3005.6,3010.6," It exists in almost every single level of society, except among the few people who can"
3010.6,3015.44," empathize with criminals because criminals who don't commit crime out of hatred, but"
3015.44,3016.44, rather necessity.
3016.44,3019.5, And those are the people who have committed those crimes or people who have loved the
3019.5,3020.5, ones who have been through that situation.
3020.5,3024.06, The reality is the majority of society is not reflected in that.
3024.06,3028.72, The majority of society is resentful of these people because of like the way that politicians are hard
3028.72,3033.36, on crime they tell us their rebuttal to this is that that's the status quo you're you're like
3033.36,3038.0, siding with we never once told you that we think the status quo is perfect we've been clear from
3038.0,3042.96, the beginning that we want this stigma to change and it is only going to change if we decrease
3042.96,3045.16, crime necessity and other things like that.
3049.54,3049.7," Again, more on that later, right? Then let's like take them at their best and say that like, oh,"
3054.3,3057.48," even if they are well-liked and well-respected by their co-workers once they get in, the reality is they're likely going to be rejected from the community that they came from. This isn't the"
3057.48,3062.0, majority of cases where people commit a crime of necessity and then they go back home as one of the
3062.0,3068.92," people who arrested their loved ones, essentially, and are now rejected by the people that they grew up with, right? This is because the perception of"
3068.92,3073.14," criminals towards cops and also cops towards criminals, right? And they're likely still not"
3073.14,3077.12," going to be trusted by society, even if they're trusted by their co-workers, because they have a"
3077.12,3081.68," much lower degree of one-on-one engagement with society, i.e. if their co-workers trust them at"
3081.68,3087.68," all, it's likely because they, like, see them day-to-day and see that they're a good person even though they perceive them poorly the average citizen does not"
3087.68,3092.4, get that kind of engagement and therefore is still likely to trust the news and general political
3092.4,3098.16, like pushing that is anti-con um convict not communist my god then on the idea of the justice
3098.16,3104.48, system and here i'm going to fit in like police and general people perceptions as well so um first
3104.48,3105.76, i want to start with like why police
3105.76,3110.16, trust is so important we already told you that the lives are at stake for these officers when
3110.16,3114.08, they feel like they cannot trust the person sitting next to them because maybe their criminal
3114.08,3119.2, buddy killed their last partner that's kind of a really difficult thing for them to overcome
3119.2,3123.68, the same way it is for the average citizen to overcome the fact that the person who violated
3123.68,3128.92," the justice system is now meant to uphold it, right? These are the kind of things that are really difficult to change"
3128.92,3133.48," in either side of the house, but we actually think that side prop is worse off for it because they're"
3133.48,3137.08, giving these people a sense of false hope that they can change it when they're likely just stepping
3137.08,3141.28, into a work environment in which they're going to be disrespected and degraded every single day
3141.28,3144.62," by the people that they're supposed to put their life into like their hands, right?"
3144.98,3148.32, Some idea of like whether the justice system is going to get more modern and
3148.32,3151.88, better on which side of the house they tell us that the only way to change the police system
3151.88,3156.14, is from the inside the reality is that we've already tried that and it hasn't really worked
3156.14,3160.14, that's why a lot of people around the world are protesting against police officers because they
3160.14,3164.1, can't really fix themselves right and this is also where they lose this point about stopping
3164.1,3169.28, criminals from getting in because of good training and stuff they can't even catch bad cops who don't
3169.28,3173.12, have criminal records we think they're gonna have an even harder time doing that when they do have a
3173.12,3177.92, criminal record right and now on this point about like uh will will people trust them right they
3177.92,3183.12, tell us that like that basically again they only attribute this to the status quo the reality is
3183.12,3185.68, that the impacts here are super strong on panel.
3185.68,3190.24, When people feel like the people who like committed crimes are now meant to enforce the law
3190.88,3195.76," when they violated in the past, they likely fear their own police officers. They think that the"
3195.76,3200.0, rule of law has become flimsy in the society and they are more likely to want to take justice into
3200.0,3204.64, their own hands. This is where we see the law degraded publicly. This is where we see more
3204.64,3209.2, violence and chaos in our society. There is a reason that police need to be highly trusted by
3209.2,3213.44, people. There are reasons why the ACAB movement is so detrimental around the world because when
3213.44,3217.6," people feel like their police are not doing a good job, it destroys the integrity of the justice"
3217.6,3221.52, system and the democracy that these people live in. This is a huge impact that COP has not
3221.52,3229.04," sufficiently combated. And finally on this point of the future of crime, this is really, really important panel, because both of us want to live in a"
3229.04,3233.96," harmonious society. That's what police are meant to do, right? They're meant to eliminate crime,"
3233.96,3238.88," both by deterring future crime, and also by catching the people that do it in the first place."
3240.1,3243.46," Because like, this is where we see the impacts of like financial pressure on jails,"
3243.76,3247.16, of the government system being overworkeded because so many people are committing crimes.
3247.16,3253.26, And we again create more ex-cons who have to suffer through the consequences of our reality on either side of the house.
3253.44,3265.24, The reason we do a better job of preventing this is because we encourage ex-convicts to get a better path to the people that are more likely to commit crimes of necessity. This is the crime that we can anticipate.
3268.66,3273.68," And this is a crime that police officers cannot actively combat because these are the people who by nature are not trustworthy of police officers, right?"
3273.68,3279.54," I can think of very few more opposing roles other than police officer and cop,"
3279.6,3281.7," except for maybe prof and op, right?"
3281.82,3286.26, The reality is that these future criminals are unlikely to be convinced by
3286.26,3290.96, the person who might arrest them to change their ways for these reasons very proud to oppose
3290.96,3298.32, i thank the third opposition speaker invite op reply to close at their side
3298.32,3312.12," perfect is everybody ready? Awesome. Then my time starts now. Panel, two questions in"
3312.12,3317.64," my speech. First, who gets better law enforcement? And second of all, who better benefits ex-cons"
3317.64,3322.3," and their futures? But first of all, a very important clarification on this issue of exclusivity."
3322.42,3325.12," Look, we're not saying that alternatives and this can't"
3325.12,3329.0," happen in the same world, but that both of these benefits can't be accessed and that side"
3329.0,3333.14, propositions world is significantly worse off if they choose the model that they're running with.
3333.2,3338.02," Look, in our world, in our best case scenario, we get our alternatives and the benefits that come"
3338.02,3341.54," with them. But in their side of the house, they're trying to take these benefits of their alternatives."
3341.84,3348.4, But those benefits are nulled by all of the harms that we told you up and down our bench and that i'm completely unengaged with right so we have
3348.4,3352.48, the harms of decreasing public trust which means that people are more likely to resort to like
3352.48,3357.04, trying to protect themselves and mental vigilantism and self-defense that isn't warranted because they
3357.04,3361.68, don't trust the police because they see the police as like an institution that is being corrupted by
3361.68,3368.78, people that have previously disrupted like the fabric and harmony of their society but you also get decreased trust within the police be it warranted
3368.78,3372.78, with all the malicious intents that we told you yes it's our worst case scenario but that's not
3372.78,3376.92, a sufficient response to get away with it which is literally my entire my partner's entire second
3376.92,3381.28, point they went unengaged but we also tell you that even in the case where it's unwarranted and
3381.28,3388.0, these people have good intentions and genuinely want to do a good job in the police all it's going to do is because there's so much mistrust there's going to be like
3388.0,3391.6, a lot of resentment and all it's going to do is that it's going to weaken the institution because
3391.6,3395.36, it's going to make it very fragile and unstable on the inside and of course when you have an unstable
3395.36,3399.28, police force you can't access all the benefits that they're trying to claim are exclusive to
3399.28,3403.52, our alternatives so look we're telling you that they can't access benefits because they're also
3403.52,3406.44, harming their own case and they haven't responded to that sufficiently.
3406.62,3410.0," So, first of all, who gets better law enforcement? Look, three prongs to this."
3410.06,3413.44," The first is trust. Second, effectiveness. And finally, long term progress."
3413.44,3429.6," The first thing that we told you in terms of trust, look, in their side of the house, we're literally telling you that we have zero analysis that comes from Team Mexico when it comes to the fact that the public is going to have less trust in in these people right they literally just told us in a surgeon no they're"
3429.6,3433.04, going to have trust and even if we get some mistrust in the short run suddenly that's going
3433.04,3437.6, to evolve into trust in the long run we're telling you that by virtue of it being so mistrusting in
3437.6,3441.84, the short run all it's going to do is make it even harder for these ex-cons to prove themselves
3441.84,3448.24," because there's no valid channel for them to do that we're telling you that in our world we get far better trust. Why? Because first of all,"
3448.24,3452.0, we're giving the police and their institutions the ability to uphold the rule of law that is
3452.0,3455.44, so essential and that's why people trust them because that's what they're viewed upon because
3455.44,3460.08, they have very high standards for what like their own conduct as citizens but also in terms of the
3460.08,3464.08," things that they're responding. In the moment that you get people who violated that, you lose it,"
3464.08,3468.96, you loosen this idea that there's like trust in in the rule of law and law enforcement and second of
3468.96,3474.56, all this idea that like there's um that more people trust like ex-cons when they can reach
3474.56,3478.8, people and that only happens in our side of the house when you reach them as people instead of as
3478.8,3483.44, cops when you get one community that's been like violently affected by crime they won't be reached
3483.44,3489.04," by a cop because that cop even though they empathize with them, if they're going to do a good job, which Team Mexico"
3489.04,3492.94," says that they're going to do, and to some extent, we agree, by virtue of them having to do a good"
3492.94,3497.04," job, regardless of how much they empathize with these people that are affected by crime, they're"
3497.04,3501.0," going to have to put them behind bars, period, right? And even we told you, even if that's not"
3501.0,3504.4," the case, and they empathize with them to the point where they're willing to like skirt the law"
3504.4,3506.94," and like let them off, we're also telling you that that's obviously"
3506.94,3510.6, going to be harmful to society because they're letting criminals away. So under both of these
3510.6,3514.8," frameworks, they're literally not able to reach people, right? So additionally, let's tell you"
3514.8,3519.62," why, like who benefits like ex-cons the most. Oh, sorry. And quickly on effectiveness, we're telling"
3519.62,3524.78," you because of malicious actors, police's like main job is to literally focus on like trying to"
3524.78,3525.36, combat crime outside. This is obviously going to be very is to literally focus on like trying to combat crime
3525.36,3529.12, outside this is obviously going to be very difficult to achieve if they also need to worry
3529.12,3532.4, about the person that's standing in the desk in front of them or that's going into the field next
3532.4,3535.76, to them they won't be able to trust them if that person used to be the person in front of them
3535.76,3540.16, holding a gun right but who benefits ex-cons look we give you a far more nuanced characterization of
3540.16,3544.16, what ex-cons actually look like and we got no response from it we told you that there are cons
3544.16,3548.88, that are like likely came from like entrenched communities um that come communities that were
3548.88,3554.4, entrenched with crimes and we're telling you that these communities of ex-cons benefit from ex-cons
3554.4,3559.28, reaching them again as people instead of like as a cop for these reasons and second of all we get
3559.28,3564.24, the people that made bad decisions and aren't necessarily like criminals like by nature and
3564.24,3568.56, we're telling you that they're more likely to benefit again from therapy and from being reached these people are
3568.56,3572.08, unlikely to want to become cops in the first place we're telling you on these brands we get
3572.08,3579.68, former alternatives on these brands we're proud to oppose i thank the opposition reply and finally
3579.68,3624.62, call upon the proposition reply speaker to close out the debate. Let's take a look at two characterizations of side opposition that largely undermine
3624.62,3625.0, their case.
3625.0,3631.0, The first one is how they engage in what our side of the police force and actually going into these jobs.
3631.0,3635.0, We painted through since violent Valentina speech that we would have training.
3635.0,3650.8," We would have job interviews that these are things that are structurally within an employment within an employment atmosphere, I think to sideline these mechanisms that we gave and create far-fetched scenarios of people taking and stealing weapons, of creating like falsified evidence or"
3650.8,3654.88, very worst case scenario comparatives that side opposition wanted to engage in. But the second
3654.88,3658.88," thing is about the counterfactual exclusivity of the things they defend, right? Because they wanted"
3658.88,3663.92," to bring you minority quotas, counseling and theory therapy. What was different between it"
3663.92,3665.2, was these are
3669.52,3674.16," rehabilitative mechanisms, these are not reintegration mechanisms, and that is why we can appropriate those mechanisms because if they already happen in the status quo then on our side"
3674.16,3679.12, the exclusivity that you're literally giving them a job opportunity that is the mechanism and way
3679.12,3684.32, back into society that is a benefit that the opposition can simply not claim. I think that
3684.32,3692.0," by through painting the status quo of ex-convicts being that much bad, and they do not have the alternatives to actually enhance it, that already lost them the debate."
3692.0,3699.0," But let's look at two flashpoints in the debate. Firstly, on ex-convicts and the perception that they have within society."
3699.0,3705.54," They wanted to bring you two big pushes. Firstly, on the trust from society, how ex-convicts being in police forces are that"
3705.54,3710.18," much harmful. We told you that firstly, it does begin, the trust does begin to change when people"
3710.18,3714.96, recognize that the status quo is simply not enough. You need better mechanisms of checks and balances
3714.96,3719.34," within the police force. On our side, you are making sure that those who have had experiences"
3719.34,3724.66," within jails who do have that impact from justice system are actually included, are actually"
3724.66,3725.5," representative. But we did give you a way off. And sure, in the beginning, they who do have that impact from justice system or actually included are actually representative."
3725.5,3727.02, But we did give you a way off.
3727.02,3729.78," And sure, in the beginning, they might not have that trust"
3729.78,3730.92," because they're not familiar,"
3730.92,3732.5, they're not aware of this condition
3732.5,3734.42, in which ex-convicts are part of a police force.
3734.42,3736.38," But in the moment that you normalize it,"
3736.38,3738.54," you allow more individuals to be part of it,"
3738.54,3740.56," you do see that they are worthy of it,"
3740.56,3743.18, that you do see that they should be trusted with that point.
3743.18,3748.46, But the second thing that they wanted to bring to you was on the resentment of those who are rejected we told you at least
3748.46,3753.68, they had an opportunity to apply for a job on side opposition you do not have those opportunities
3753.68,3758.42, specifically on a police force which many people idolize when you a police force themselves
3758.42,3764.12, recognize the ex-convicts deserve a job are valuable are dignified for having that position
3764.12,3765.76, that is a big benefit on it
3765.76,3770.56, of itself what we told you the first argument was a principled obligation of why the justice system
3770.56,3775.44, and the government have to make sure that people who have fulfilled their do how who have fulfilled
3775.44,3780.32, their depth to society are actually getting mechanisms to reintegrate we told you that
3780.32,3786.08, conflicts are better reinvented or vindicated when you break the stigma in the status quo because police
3786.08,3790.8, the police force is recognizing these individuals as valuable as someone that can contribute to
3790.8,3795.44, society that is a huge push that we have to counter stigma a huge push to take away the
3795.44,3800.64, damaging societal procedures that exist in the status quo the comparative is the alternatives
3800.64,3804.96, on their side that somehow like magically appear on their side where the status quo hoping that
3804.96,3808.52, these individuals can be included that the government is just wanting and in the
3808.52,3812.82, long term hoping for organic change on our side you are pushing and the government is actively
3812.82,3817.92, pushing for these individuals to be included and jobs that is the huge side on why you have to vote
3817.92,3821.9, on our side we are giving them the practical mechanisms not hoping that the government in
3821.9,3828.0, the future does something about it the second second small clash point was on the police system as an institution.
3828.0,3834.0," We gave you a second argument on why it was so important for the justice system to be adapted, to be open, to give you feedback,"
3834.0,3837.0, irregardless of if any ex-convict actually enters.
3837.0,3843.0," The fact that you are opening up to more individuals to apply, to actually have that feedback, is a benefit in itself."
3843.0,3849.52, It is damning that opposition does not respond to this case because if both sides recognize that the police is failing
3849.52,3855.04, the status quo is simply not enough on our side we give a mechanism of pressuring of accountability
3855.04,3860.16, making sure that the police system as itself is more evolving has more progression on our side
3860.16,3866.0, we recognize the cracks in the justice system where convicts are not exclusive or disenfranchised
3866.0,3871.2, on our side we give them the opportunity the key to well-being we are so proud to propose
