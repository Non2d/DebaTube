0.0,7.76, final day of debates i started the recording okay hopefully not final date for debates uh
8.56,13.84, for all of us uh okay in that case i will start the debate uh i call upon
13.84,27.0," the first proposition speaker uh to open the floor for us here Hi, am I audible?"
27.0,31.0," Perfect. I'll step here, rise in the chat, please, if that's alright."
31.0,47.62," And my speech starts in 3, 2, 1. Panel, the question in today's debate is simple."
48.12,51.36," When Africa freed itself from colonial rule, it had a choice."
51.78,59.06, Prioritize a Western model of democratic statehood or correct the wrongs that those same Western countries had inflicted upon them.
59.44,65.68," Post-colonial leaders chose to imitate their oppressors, and Africans have been paying the price ever since."
65.68,71.04, The wording of the motion may be a mess but Africa didn't have to be. We're very proud to propose.
71.04,76.0," What is our stance on proposition? Four things. First, the clarification issued by the motions"
76.0,81.6," committee states that opposition have to defend the world that did exist during the time, i.e."
81.6,85.44," the status quo. To be absolutely clear, this is a world in which much"
85.44,90.8," of Africa lives in poverty, exploited by the West, and devastated by civil war. That is the world they"
90.8,96.02," must defend. Two, our burden is to defend a hypothetical world in which the majority of"
96.02,101.02, post-colonial African states reclaimed stolen land and money from colonial elites and redistributed
101.02,107.08," it among the African population. There are three types of program. A, there were cash transfers to individual people"
107.08,110.96," of an amount roughly equivalent to $1,000 in today's money."
110.96,114.06," B, land reallocation, particularly of foreign lands"
114.06,116.64, so that land ownership is allocated roughly equally
116.64,118.06, across the population.
118.06,120.2," And C, this looks like state reclamation"
120.2,122.56," of natural resource wealth, like oil wells"
122.56,124.98, and regular cash payments to the population
124.98,130.16, of the profits from these. Three three we think that in most cases a leader of the independence movement
130.16,134.48, would likely become a non-democratic ruler who would initially rule the country on a national
134.48,139.68, level and initiate this policy supported by a network of local community governments four
139.68,144.8, note that this motion covers an entire continent given this we think the burden on both sides
144.8,149.6," is that the policy works for the majority but but not for all countries. Having made that clear,"
149.6,154.72," first argument, where would these policies have been done well? Who is carrying out these policies?"
154.72,159.6," They are the immediate leaders of post-colonial African states. In almost all cases, these are"
159.6,163.76," the leaders of the revolutionary movements in these states, as they were the obvious and only"
163.76,169.36, candidates for colonial powers to hand over in reign soon. What assets would these leaders have been distributing?
169.36,173.2," We think the state would have owned some land and assets to begin with, but they would likely have"
173.2,177.6, had to take most land off predominantly white colonialists who owned it or the minority of
177.6,182.08, African land-owning elites who had gained it by collaborating with the colonizers. We think they
182.08,189.58, should have taken this land back without recompense or with relatively tokenistic payments. It was stolen of the people of African states.
189.58,193.88, We accept this might not have been easy and it might have even been violent in a few cases.
193.88,198.24, We think however that in most cases it would have been successful for three key reasons.
198.24,202.36, A. There would have been a lot more black Africans than white colonialists. By sheer
202.36,205.02," quantity they clearly win. B, they now control"
205.02,209.26," the levers of the state, including the army, so they have much more power. But C, we are supporting"
209.26,213.82, a world where many African states chose to view this. This means that even if the first few cases
213.82,218.28," where this policy was attempted were difficult and potentially bloody, white landowners in other"
218.28,222.64, African states who saw this would likely have realized their time was up. Given the colonial
222.64,228.8," powers who had just left, neither wanted to see their citizens die, nor themselves get embroiled in conflict, they likely would"
228.8,233.02," have paid these white landowners to leave peacefully, as the British did when they left"
233.02,238.94," Kenya. Why would these leaders allocate resources fairly? Three reasons. A, they have been literally"
238.94,243.18," fighting for their nations, and have recent experience of being oppressed, but B, within"
243.18,249.48," their legitimacy at that point in history, is heavily hinged on their willingness to fight for the rights of their people, and"
249.48,254.12, c within a core part of the majority of these independence movements were African intellectuals
254.12,257.0, who were arguing for the justice of this exact policy.
257.0,258.38," Second argument, the principle."
258.38,263.9, We think under our side there are three powerful principled obligations which the government
263.9,269.6, of the time also prioritized and could only be fulfilled by redistributive policies the first principal
269.6,275.44, obligation is that land and wealth are the correct form of reparation this land was stolen by white
275.44,279.84, colonizers whose descendants profited from it often by enslaving the descendants of its original
279.84,285.0," owners not only did the land have significant economic value, it also had unquantifiable cultural"
285.0,287.0, value to the people it was taken from.
287.0,290.0, These are historic religious sites or bureau grounds.
290.0,293.0," Given that, the criteria for reparations are clearly fulfilled."
293.0,298.0," A, the stolen property itself, i.e., the land, is unambiguous and of immense value."
298.0,300.0," B, the rightful owner is clear."
300.0,305.88," And C, unless opposition wants to defend colonialism, the illegitimacy of the current owner's possession"
305.88,307.1, is also clear.
307.1,310.16," Rather than redress this, opposition requires new states"
310.16,312.7, just to shed from the shackles of colonization
312.7,314.22, to start absolutely protecting the rights
314.22,316.18, of white colonialists.
316.18,318.4, The second principal obligation is that land and wealth
318.4,320.18, fits with the will of the people.
320.18,323.32," But for colonialism, communities looks much more like those"
323.32,329.84," which our redistributive policy would facilitate. Smaller, much more communal, predominantly locally led. Importantly,"
329.84,334.56, a lot of independence movements held up this model when they pushed for the end of colonialism.
334.56,339.28," People called for it, they fought for it, they desired it so deeply that men are willing to lay"
339.28,344.0, down their lives for it. The third obligation is that land and wealth preserves your right to life
344.0,349.06, and ought to be the most important. Food and money keep you alive. This is what you need to access any of
349.06,354.0," opposition's political rights. Look, we respect that OPP has some claim to be granting people"
354.0,358.5," rights, but they're obviously far less important than these because A, granting people a right to"
358.5,363.56," vote has no guarantee of improving their life, and B, freedom of speech and association are"
363.56,365.16, nebulous and often restricted
365.16,369.44, even in democratic countries. These are of no importance when compared to returning their
369.44,374.16," property, respecting their wishes, and protecting their lives. Before we move on to my third"
374.16,379.44," argument, I'll take your POI. Even if land reparations do occur, how can you assure that"
379.44,384.0," individuals have enough capital or even enough land to make a living off of it? Perfect,"
384.0,388.64, that's exactly what I'm going to explain in my third argument why do we massively reduce suffering and death in
388.64,393.44, post-clinical africa opposition stands for a world where literally millions of people died from
393.44,397.76, preventable poverty because they chose to prioritize westerners over their people there's
397.76,402.08, three ways in which we change this this directly responds to a pure while when they ask us why this
402.08,409.24," money is so important first way money is used to solve immediate issues like food and medicine. This is a simple impact, but it's incredibly"
409.24,413.78," important. In our world, people are given money that they can spend on food and medicine. They"
413.78,418.84," are given land that they can live on, grow things from, or sell. This allows them to escape extreme"
418.84,423.48, poverty. The second way is because they have money to invest. Knowing that you have a regular
423.48,426.38," monthly income from your stake and the local life,"
426.38,428.1, or that you have been able to make savings
428.1,429.62, from your initial payment of cash
429.62,431.52, allows you to invest in the future.
431.52,434.3, A community can collectively buy farming equipment
434.3,437.16, that makes it far more efficient to invest in a well.
437.16,439.34, The third way is because we give people control
439.34,440.58, over the land.
440.58,442.4, Africa has the potential to grow enough food
442.4,445.0, to feed itself three and a half times over.
445.0,449.0," Despite this, they have suffered more famine than anywhere else in the world."
449.0,455.0," That is because Western companies own their farmland over-planted to the point of soil degradation,"
455.0,458.0, and then sell the crops out of Africa to European buyers.
458.0,463.0," On our side, people control their own land. This improves food security in two ways."
463.0,465.2, A. They farm it in a less commercially aggressive
465.2,470.16," way, thus reducing the chances of crop failure. B, they have control over the products that are grown."
470.48,474.54," That means that even if there's a bad harvest or a drought, people are better able to adapt to help"
474.54,479.46," themselves. In a reduced harvest, you're able to keep the crops to grow and feed yourself, rather"
479.46,484.16," than be forced to sell them to Europe. And even in a truly dire year, you're better able to make the"
484.16,489.28," choice to switch to animal agriculture to save yourself yourself because the land is yours. On a wider level,"
489.28,493.92," within redistributive policies, reduce the risk of civil war. Civil wars typically occur when there's"
493.92,498.32," a combination of extreme poverty, limited opportunities, and the lack of trust in the state,"
498.32,502.4, and are even more likely to happen when there are multiple ethnic groups who in Africa were often
502.4,507.16, set against each other by colonial powers. Those conditions are why there have been countless
507.16,509.1," civil wars since the end of colonialism,"
509.1,512.0, and why there are 21 happening in Africa right now.
512.0,513.82," That's what opposition's policies led to,"
513.82,516.1," poverty, weak democracies and conflict."
516.1,518.82, Why would this be better with redistributive policy?
518.82,521.24," We explain why poverty is alleviated,"
521.24,523.34, but giving people land gives them stake in their nation.
523.34,529.52, It's much easier to abandon everything for a chance to be a soldier is a lot harder when you have a stake in a community
529.52,534.8, but needless to say this is about as big as an impact gets civil wars wreak unfold damage to
534.8,539.6, countries in the long run this running of the motion may be a mess but africa did not have to
539.6,540.56, we're proud to propose
543.52,570.0, thank you judges all set
570.0,578.04, excellent in that case thank the speaker for their speech and call upon the first speaker
578.04,605.0," said opposition to deliver theirs hi uh my name is iga i I'll be the LO. My pronouns are she, her, and I'd prefer POIs in the chat,, the African continent has been plagued by instability."
605.0,612.0," However, note that this occurred despite the existence of political and civil rights, not because of it."
612.0,618.0, Civil and political rights formed the last stronghold against the attempts at unbridled grabs for power.
618.0,629.96," My speech will be divided into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to analyze why proposition is unlikely to succeed in their reparations. Secondly, why they're likely to create more economic harms. And thirdly, why we're able"
629.96,635.64," to create a more stable society. But before that, I want to make a strategic note. It is not sufficient"
635.64,640.74," for proposition to just argue the benefits of reparations. The motion has a flip side, which"
640.74,645.24, requires proposition to defend the absence of political and civil rights.
650.72,656.88," In other words, a dictatorship. Because in order to win this debate, proposition has to prove why it is both legitimate and preferable to subject individuals to literal authoritarian rule."
657.26,662.14," Okay, moving on to the first part of my speech on why we think that land redistributions will"
662.14,665.2, simply not work. Note that this directly attacks the
665.2,670.08, Prime Minister's first argument on why they think land reparations will be done well. Note that even
670.08,675.52," if the proposition has some fiat to enact their policies, that doesn't guarantee that external"
675.52,680.72, factors will make it literally impossible for their policies to succeed. We tell you there are
680.72,689.6, three reasons as to why we are more likely to achieve civil and political rights than they are to achieve economic and land reparations firstly in terms of international
689.6,694.16, support when we look at for instance assistance for civil and political rights we've already seen
694.16,699.28, this happening where for instance in senegal other countries have provided independent observers to
699.28,703.6, ensure elections were free and fair this is because generally on the international stage
703.6,709.06," civil and political rights are right widely recognized But we say on the flip side, there's oftentimes a lot of"
709.06,714.34," backlash for land redistribution. Note that, for instance, the US has sanctioned Zimbabwe for the"
714.34,719.68," last 22 years, partly because of their forceful land redistribution policies. Note that this also"
719.68,730.44, offsets any economic benefits of such redistribution. The second reason as to why we're more likely to achieve our world is because of the concept of taking versus giving. Land reparations means
730.44,734.9," you have to actively take away someone's assets, which will likely spark aggressive opposition."
735.36,739.88," This is what we've seen in Ghana, where farmers literally hired private mercenaries to protect"
739.88,745.22," their own land. Comparatively, civil and political rights are merely given to people, and thus"
745.22,750.26, individuals don't have an incentive to fight for what has been taken from them. The third reason
750.26,754.72," here is that there are already blueprints for enshrining civil and political rights. For instance,"
754.9,760.2," you can copy existing constitutions and other democratic frameworks. However, land redistribution"
760.2,769.88," in such large, ethnically divided and unstable, have never been done before, and so it's far more complex to do so. What this means is that it is"
769.88,774.94," very unlikely to get economic and land reparations, while it is more likely to get civil and political"
774.94,779.88," rights, even if both sides have the same amount of fiat, we have substantially more external factors"
779.88,784.48," that help us. Moving on to the second part now, and why we think proposition is likely to create"
784.48,792.88," more economic harm, but before that that i'll take a poi there are 54 countries in the african continent"
792.88,798.32, do you think that the us is going to sanction all these 54 countries and derive themselves of great
798.32,804.0, economic opportunities look like if you look at sort of empirical evidence the west is more than
804.0,807.36, happy enough to sanction countries that don't follow democratic norms.
807.6,814.78," Like, I don't really understand this point. OK, let's move on to the second part now on why we think that proposition creates more economic harms."
815.1,819.4," We tell you they're likely to have four harms, firstly, of underutilized land."
819.62,830.0," This is what we meant in our POI, because even if proposition distributes land land properly it is not going to be properly used and this is for two reasons a there's limited capital so simply giving"
830.0,834.48, impoverished individuals land doesn't give them access to economic capital we saw this in South
834.48,838.8, Africa where black farmers couldn't get mortgages from banks so they still couldn't afford the
838.8,844.16, necessary machinery to work the land we tell you secondly uh there's oftentimes fragmentation of
844.16,845.34, land assuming that land will be distributed equally's oftentimes fragmentation of land. Assuming that
845.34,850.46," land will be distributed equally, you have large plots of land that we split up into many smaller"
850.46,855.62," plots. This is seen in Ethiopia, where half of all the plots of land were less than a quarter of a"
855.62,860.68, hectare panel that is literally tiny. You cannot live off of that. Note that this threatens food
860.68,865.82, security. These nations already face food shortages. So every time you waste
865.82,870.2," scarce land that could have been used to grow crops, you bring the countries closer to the"
870.2,876.78, brink of starvation. This is also what contributed to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984 after their land
876.78,881.0, redistribution. The second harm here is you're less likely to have foreign direct investment
881.0,888.58, because foreign companies are reluctant to settle into authoritarian regimes where individuals have absolutely no rights because they're afraid of for instance the
888.58,893.38, sanctions this means that job opportunities are lost in countries that already have high rates
893.38,897.76, of unemployment the third harm here is that you have no development aid because countries are
897.76,902.44, reluctant to give aid to dictatorships for instance after the United States made charges
902.44,909.5," of corruption against the government of Kenya, they halted the development aid. This means communities lose out on hospitals that could"
909.5,914.42," have been built. They lose out on schools. They lose out on food, for instance. The last harm"
914.42,918.5, here is you're likely to have poor economic policy. And this is caused by the dictator's
918.5,924.24, dilemma. Opposition might give people a bag of money. But if your country has hyperinflation
924.24,925.78," because of economic mismanagement,"
926.02,927.8, that money is literally useless.
928.26,930.16, Bad economic policy might happen
930.16,931.22, on either side of the house.
931.36,932.88, But the difference in our side of the house
932.88,934.78," is that when you have political and civil rights,"
934.9,935.82, you can correct that.
935.94,937.92," In a dictatorship-like propositions world,"
938.14,939.78, people who are critical of the government
939.78,942.0," will never be able to express their critics,"
942.28,943.5, their beliefs.
943.76,944.58," Look at Zimbabwe,"
944.72,945.7, where Robert Mugabe
945.7,947.2, literally caused hyperinflation
947.2,948.88, by just continuously printing money
948.88,951.98, and plunging the entire country into economic crisis.
951.98,953.84, What this argument shows you
953.84,955.88," is that even on the metric of the economy,"
955.88,958.64," which is propositions grounds, we still take the debate."
958.64,960.74," Note that this also tackles the principle argument,"
960.74,962.84, because we believe that the best form of reparation
962.84,969.86, is to give back the country a stable economy after the disruption and chaos caused by colonialism. They cannot do that. We can.
970.14,974.52," Moving on to the third and last part on why we can create, we can prevent violent conflict."
974.94,978.88," We're here, we're going to show you why the lack of civil and political rights will exacerbate"
978.88,983.62, conflict and lead to more unnecessary death. Why do we think this is true? We tell you this is for
983.62,985.32," two reasons. Firstly,"
989.74,993.68," citizens will turn to violence when they cannot voice their dissatisfaction peacefully. To illustrate, in the early 90s, the Nigerian government tried to make a deal with Shell"
993.68,998.72," about extracting oil from the Niger Delta. The local communities hated this plan, and a small"
998.72,1002.68, conflict emerged. But because we had democratic structures that recognized the voices of the
1002.68,1008.64," people, they were able to establish environmental regulations in propositions world you don't have these rights you would prevent"
1008.64,1013.44, citizens from being hurt entirely we tell you the small conflict would have escalated to far worse
1013.44,1018.24, to become far more violent but secondly we tell you in propositions world authoritarian leaders
1018.24,1025.98," are far more likely to stoke conflict to maintain control we saw this this happening in Kenya in 1992, when the president tried to purposely"
1025.98,1032.26," stoke ethnic conflict to ban opposition parties. Luckily, people were able to hold them accountable,"
1032.6,1037.12," and the president was later ousted from power. On the opposition side, they lacked that form"
1037.12,1040.94," of accountability. We tell you ethnic conflicts would have worsened, and many more would have"
1040.94,1050.02," died. Note that this also clashes with their third argument on reducing death and suffering. We tell you, even if initially our world is not a fully functioning democracy at"
1050.02,1055.16," first, enshrining civil and political rights is a prerequisite for that. It is the seeds that must"
1055.16,1060.5," be planted before the flower of democracy finally blooms. We tell you that in our world, we are able"
1060.5,1069.2," to create the basis for that. This is because, firstly, when you have the right to vote, you're more likely to be able to establish systems of elections. In many African countries,"
1069.2,1073.76," voter turnout has been comparable, if not higher than in the West. But secondly, we're able to have"
1073.76,1078.0, the establishment of opposition parties that can organize to pressure government reform.
1078.0,1081.68, What this ultimately means is that we are the side that is able to maintain stability.
1081.68,1088.48, We are the side that helps these people i'm so proud to oppose
1119.76,1122.8, thank you George is all set. Great. Can everyone hear me?
1122.8,1125.0, Yes.
1125.0,1126.0, Whenever you're ready.
1126.0,1149.84," Well, yeah, thank the previous speaker and go on the second speaker team proposition. 70% of all land is owned by Namibians of European descent. And we think it is outrageous that these countries are still in the modern day controlled and"
1149.84,1153.7, owned by the descendants of those who colonized and exploited them.
1153.7,1155.7, That's why we're so proud to propose this policy today.
1155.7,1158.24, I'm going to talk about a couple of things in this speech.
1158.24,1162.76," First of all, I'm going to address the clashes of whether this would work, then on principle,"
1162.76,1169.44," then on practical, and then I'm going to bring a new argument on long-term development for the African continent, both economic and political."
1169.44,1174.44," First of all, some above. I just want to flag where I could start here, that every single"
1174.44,1179.76," example opposition has given you of failure, of poverty, of terrible conflict that has"
1179.76,1184.16, devastated people's lives and livelihoods happened under their side of the house. We
1184.16,1185.0, were very clear
1185.0,1189.12," in our answer, according to the clarification from the motions committee, side opposition's"
1189.12,1193.8, burden is to defend the world as it exists today. They have to defend the status quo.
1193.8,1197.64, They have to defend what these countries chose to do. That's why when they talk to you about
1197.64,1202.32," Ethiopia, that's why when they talk to you about Ghana, they have to stand behind the"
1202.32,1205.44," failures there. But then, would this have worked? Because"
1205.44,1209.52, side opposition want to challenge us here. They tried to tell us first of all that these leaders
1209.52,1213.28, are going to carry out these policies badly and then they tried to say you're not going to be
1213.28,1218.56," successful at taking things away from people. How do we respond to this? First of all on incentives,"
1218.56,1223.28, we believe that these leaders wanted to carry out these policies well. First of all opposition tried
1223.28,1225.42, to tell us that these are going to be bad people.
1225.42,1226.92, Or we think actually they're likely
1226.92,1228.08," to be the same on either side,"
1228.08,1229.68," as Helen points out in first,"
1229.68,1231.42, and as we get no response to.
1231.42,1232.6, Five reasons for this.
1232.6,1234.44," We think first, they have huge name recognition"
1234.44,1235.44, across the nation.
1235.44,1236.62, These people are coming off the back
1236.62,1239.14," of the biggest political win imaginable, independence,"
1239.14,1240.66, so they have popular support.
1240.66,1242.06, They tend to be very charismatic.
1242.06,1243.86, That's why these people have risen to the top
1243.86,1247.36, of the independence movement. They have the infrastructure of the independence movement around them and
1247.36,1251.04," that's a ready-made party and they're the ones who are shaping the discussions of independence,"
1251.04,1255.36, so they have the advantage in rising to the top of any system they create. Whether it's democratic
1255.36,1259.6," or not, we think these are always going to be pro-independence leaders and as we also explained"
1259.6,1263.76," to you, we think they are likely to have good incentives for three reasons. First, they want"
1263.76,1267.92, to do what's best for their people. people second because their legitimacy is hinged on providing people
1267.92,1272.48, and third ideologically they are part of the independence movement they care about these
1272.48,1277.12, policies but also on our side they probably have better incentives because when they see themselves
1277.12,1281.2, purely as caretakers they aren't legitimized as school rulers when you tell these people that
1281.2,1289.04, they still have to fight for democracy and that fight against colonialism isn't over we think they're far more likely to be more conscientious about the potential
1289.04,1294.0, for democratic backsliding and about doing things well therefore we think it's very clear that these
1294.0,1298.8, leaders are going to have good incentives why then are they going to be successful at taking
1298.8,1305.52," random money away from the people who own it under side opposition. First, in number. Note that there were 23,000"
1305.52,1311.6," Europeans in Kenya in 1945, compared to 5.2 million Kenyans. We think if the Africans want"
1311.6,1315.84," to revolt, if they want to take away this property from the white Europeans, they're not only"
1315.84,1320.16," justified, they are more than capable of doing so. Second, we tell you that they have the apparatus"
1320.16,1324.24," of the state behind them. And third, we tell you that when all countries are going to be doing"
1324.24,1326.52," this, they will be able to back each other"
1326.52,1328.4, and white settlers are more likely to leave
1328.4,1330.36, as soon as they see this is the possibility.
1330.36,1333.08, Think that the probability of backlash
1333.08,1334.56, is actually very low.
1334.56,1335.44," We think under our side,"
1335.44,1337.72, it's clear that this is going to be successful.
1337.72,1338.56, Given that we've proved to you
1338.56,1340.22," and that this is going to be possible,"
1340.22,1341.68, we think if we're able to prove to you
1341.68,1344.38, that reparations are either principally justified
1344.38,1348.96," or are practically better than civil and political rights, we think we are clearly able to win"
1348.96,1352.96, this debate. So what does side opposition try to tell us from the practical? They don't really
1352.96,1357.2," respond to any of our actual analysis on why it is so good to have money, why it's so good to have"
1357.2,1361.92," stability, why this is so good for the economy. They simply give us a set of counterclaims on"
1361.92,1368.64," why they think this is bad. First, from international support. They say their side is better because you're able to have observers to ensure that these processes"
1368.64,1372.88," are free and fair. First of all, under our side we think it's so much easier because you don't need"
1372.88,1376.96, these observers. We're able to do it once and crucially on our side you can't take away those
1376.96,1381.68, reparations. On their side democratic backsliding is very easy. Then they try to tell us that the
1381.68,1388.88," United States is going to impose sanctions. As we point out in the POI, the US isn't going to sanction all these countries. It could only sanction Zimbabwe"
1388.88,1393.52, because there was only one Zimbabwe. But if the whole continent had stood together in pursuing
1393.52,1398.16," these policies against colonialism, they would have been far more successful. Then they tried"
1398.16,1401.12, to talk to us about how it's bad to take away someone's assets. I think we've already dealt
1401.12,1404.88, with that in the clash over whether this is going to work. Then they tried to tell us that the land
1404.88,1407.68, is going to be underutilized their first mechanism for this is
1407.68,1411.84, that you're not going to be giving people enough money in that slightly odd that this is the only
1411.84,1416.48, argument they could think of against giving people money and black but how do we respond to this as
1416.48,1420.8, we make it very clear in advance we think when you give direct cash transfers to individual people
1420.8,1424.56, and yes we've done the maths this looks like a thousand dollars in today's money when you're
1424.56,1428.16, reallocating farmland so that people are able to have a roughly equal share
1428.16,1432.56, farmland and crucially when you have a stable source of income from natural resources which
1432.56,1436.88, we tell you we split among the people of these countries we think frankly that is quite clearly
1436.88,1441.68, going to be enough to build a living and it's far better than having absolutely nothing at all
1441.68,1445.52, which is the comparative under their side and then they say well you're
1445.52,1450.24, going to have fragmentation of this land no again they preemptively responded to this because we
1450.24,1453.84, told you about how these groups coalesce into communities and how much better this is than
1453.84,1459.84, having absolutely no food or money finally on fdi don't let the myth of us by fdi developing african
1459.84,1464.56, states trick you panel the us's fbi in africa look like building a road in a straight line from a
1464.56,1465.36, port to a
1465.36,1466.36, mine.
1466.36,1468.76," This was never helpful, but as I'm going to prove to you in my speech, even if we get"
1468.76,1470.76," marginally less on our side, what we do get is better FBI."
1470.76,1475.32, But note also that they gave absolutely no response to our principle other than saying
1475.32,1478.02, we have to prove that we're okay with a dictator.
1478.02,1481.24," We think we've proved to you that these are A, going to be the same people on their side,"
1481.24,1488.08," B, they get their figures on their side anyway, and C, that these are probably going to be people who have good incentives. Why then do we get better long-term"
1488.08,1492.72," development under our side? First, economically. Africa broadly fits two main niches in the global"
1492.72,1497.04," economy. The first is cheap labour. In Oxford, Africans are able to be exploited because they're"
1497.04,1501.04, willing to work for extraordinarily low wages and have no bargaining power to improve their
1501.04,1508.56," conditions, so Western MNCs are able to exploit them. This led to decades of low wage labor and appalling conditions because their only competitive advantage was the cheap"
1508.56,1512.48, price of labor and therefore improvements of quality of life came at the unacceptable risk
1512.48,1516.08, of a company moving out of the country and people starving but this would have been different on our
1516.08,1520.4, side because africans would have had an alternative source of income to fall back on their land and
1520.4,1524.32, their livestock so they wouldn't have been able to speak the words into low wage labor and companies
1524.32,1526.44, would still have invested in these states because they were keeping
1526.44,1530.94," the resources there, but on our side it's on far more equitable terms. Secondly, natural"
1530.94,1534.5, resources. Africa is the richest continent on earth and has the natural resource wealth.
1534.5,1538.32," But in opposition, all governments who are trying to protect political rights allowed"
1538.32,1542.44, neo-colonial companies to continue extracting that resource wealth and funneling money back
1542.44,1546.56," to the west. But in our world they'd have taken this land back, they'd have extracted and sold the resources"
1546.56,1550.22," themselves, and they'd have used the proceeds to build state infrastructure, and crucially,"
1550.22,1552.56," to pay cash transfers, as we outlined."
1552.56,1556.28," This both makes the state far richer, but also creates consumers who attract foreign"
1556.28,1560.0," investment that is not there to exploit their labour, but rather to sell them goods."
1560.0,1563.28, Don't underestimate how many billions of dollars this would have funneled into the coffers
1563.28,1567.84, of African states and the pockets of African people. They're not a long-term political development because
1567.84,1571.76," opposition wants democratic rights for African states, that's their only argument. If we prove"
1571.76,1576.96, we get this better on our side we so clearly take this debate already. In a continent of 54 nations
1576.96,1582.08, there have been two continuous democracies since decolonisation. Right now Africa contains one full
1582.08,1585.92," democracy, seven flawed democracies, and 46 states that"
1585.92,1587.82, are considered fundamentally undemocratic.
1588.24,1592.64, This is because a certain level of economic development is a prerequisite for any democracy
1592.64,1593.44, to succeed.
1593.56,1594.3, Two reasons why.
1594.6,1598.28," First, there's a basic level of education needed for people to learn and understand"
1598.28,1600.82, about the democratic system they're expected to participate in.
1601.1,1604.6," Second, because you need a level of engaged political class who can put in the time to"
1604.6,1608.16, build political parties and scrutinize government practices the absence of these
1608.16,1612.8, conditions is the reason why under the status quo they defend every african state bar two has failed
1612.8,1617.12, to successfully have long-term democracy but on proposition we think sure there would have at some
1617.12,1620.8, point been education to the implementation of democracy but that transition on the outside
1620.8,1624.64, would have been far more peaceful because it's helen's two people in more developed states have
1624.64,1626.22," so much more to lose from war but it would also have been far more peaceful, because as Helen touched, new people in more developed states have so much more to lose from war,"
1626.22,1628.22, but it would also have been far more likely to be successful
1628.22,1630.72, because these countries meet two criteria that we outlined.
1630.72,1633.16," So on opposition's own metric of democratic rights,"
1633.16,1634.62, we think there would have been far more democracies
1634.62,1637.22, in Africa today had these policies been implemented.
1637.22,1639.36, But given that right now there are over eight of them
1639.36,1640.76," across the entire continent,"
1640.76,1643.0, any more than that wins this debate independently
1643.0,1643.86, for team effort.
1643.86,1699.48, We're so proud to propose thank you you I think I briefly dropped there after the end of the speech. Can everybody hear me?
1700.66,1707.0," Yes. Okay, cool. Okay. Hopefully the recording didn't."
1707.0,1713.0," We'll see. Anyway, are judges ready to proceed."
1713.0,1726.32," Yep. Yep. Excellent. In that case, thank the speaker for their speech and call upon the second speaker to sign opposition to deliver there. Hi, am I audible?"
1730.32,1731.12, Am I audible?
1731.84,1732.92," Yes, okay, great."
1734.0,1735.84, I'd like POIs in the chat.
1736.7,1738.68," Other than that, I think I'm ready to begin."
1743.36,1748.54," Proposition keeps pushing a problem on us, which is that Africa currently, in the vast majority of cases, is not perfect."
1748.54,1756.78," That is true, but our stance since first has very clearly been that yes, there are imperfections in current democracy in Africa,"
1757.14,1760.7," but that is not because of the focus on civil and political rights, it's despite it."
1760.98,1762.96, The counterfactual would have been significantly worse.
1763.26,1765.12, It would have had a faster decline to
1765.12,1770.48," authoritarianism, the re-rolling of good policies, increasing economic mismanagement. This speech is"
1770.48,1774.24," going to be fairly simple. Firstly, I'm going to rebut the claims which come out from opposition,"
1774.24,1781.36, then I'm going to explain why the two substantive arguments about economic and land reforms being
1781.36,1793.06," actively damaging and about civil and political rights being important in the absence of, because they help you get out autocracies and stop tensions, you should vote for us."
1793.06,1813.88," In terms of responses, I'll start with the new edition from the second proposition speaker. They claim about development, the long-term development in and of itself, is reliant entirely on their own case of you getting these reparations and of these reparations being sufficient enough for you to live off of them."
1814.14,1824.66," But secondly, note for development, you don't just need people being able to be economically active. To get development, you need a new income of capital that requires a level of foreign direct investment."
1824.66,1827.28," No, thank you. And also in the chat, please. new income of capital that requires a level of foreign direct investment of the house no thank"
1827.28,1832.0, you and also in the chat please but secondly in terms of the claim of people need security
1832.0,1836.56, security to get democracy and when people are in good economic circumstances they're more likely
1836.56,1841.52, to ask for democracies firstly i just like to note this is empirically untrue in saudi arabia and
1842.08,1845.18, china the standard of living is relatively higher or significantly
1845.18,1851.26," higher than a lot of countries in Africa. However, they're significantly less democratic."
1851.7,1855.36, Also note that our own case to a large extent already deals with this. But there are a couple
1855.36,1859.28," of reasons why just fundamentally this is not true. Firstly, the moment in which the government"
1859.28,1863.4," is the only thing which guarantees you your income and guarantees your access to your land,"
1863.64,1869.34," that's when people are more reliant on the government, therefore they have more to lose. Secondly, people don't really"
1869.34,1872.46, have that much power of the government on the proposition side of the house. You don't have
1872.46,1876.54, the ability to vote and you don't have the ability to protest. Even if people defy this and start
1876.54,1880.02," protesting, on the proposition side of the house it's significantly easier for governments to"
1880.02,1884.52, prevent protests from ever getting any kind of steam. This is incredibly important because if
1884.52,1888.48," a protest ever wants to achieve anything, it needs to reach a level of critical mass, which requires"
1888.48,1892.38, a huge amount of people to participate in it. So protests are constantly being put down by
1892.38,1897.42," autocratic regimes. You're unable to, even if people have a good quality of living, ever achieve"
1897.42,1903.18, any kind of change. This is how the CCP maintains a grip over the people of China.
1903.64,1905.86," Secondly, in terms of their principal claims,"
1906.36,1906.98, three things here.
1907.32,1909.72," Firstly, I would like to note that this also hangs"
1909.72,1911.08, on the rest of their case being true.
1911.32,1912.44," So, so far from proposition,"
1912.68,1913.7, you've gotten two arguments
1913.7,1915.12, which are impacting of one argument.
1915.38,1916.7," If we can disprove that argument,"
1916.84,1917.6, then we've won this debate.
1918.08,1920.74," Secondly, on the idea of, I think this is weighing,"
1920.92,1922.82, where they say land is particularly important
1922.82,1927.0, because there are certain historical places which have unquantifiable value.
1927.36,1932.66," Firstly, I find it unlikely that a lot of the specifically historically important places are going to be redistributed."
1932.88,1936.08, We get the impression from the first public speaker that this is about farmland specifically.
1936.52,1939.48," Secondly, this is hugely problematic to their case."
1939.48,1943.52," Surely that would only increase the amount of tensions that you have about the redistribution of land,"
1943.68,1950.0, make it harder to pass and increase the likelihood of wars or smaller scale conflicts uh uh lastly we think that
1950.0,1953.76, is also like taking away individuals rights for instance the ability to exercise your religion
1953.76,1958.16, the ability to exercise your language is also unquantifying the value to individuals and their
1958.16,1962.48, culture so insofar as we are able to restore these rights better on our sub house we think we also
1962.48,1968.98," restore things of unquantifiable value to individuals. Thirdly and lastly, the lack of political power and the ability"
1968.98,1974.08, to self-govern is also what was taken away from Africans. It wasn't like the British were just
1974.08,1977.68," like, hey y'all, y'all can vote on anything, we're just going to peacefully take away your land. No,"
1977.78,1982.62," it was oppression in every possible regard. In fact, this was the biggest thing that the"
1982.62,1985.22, Western colonial nations took away from Africans. Why? Because this was the biggest thing that the Western colonial nations took away from
1985.22,1990.08, Africans. Why? Because this was the root of all these symptoms of proposition sense. So taking
1990.08,1994.34, away land and taking away welfare from these countries was a symptom of the fact that they
1994.34,2000.3, were in a state of oppression. Since we are the side which is more likely to allow African nations
2000.3,2005.52," to attain some level democratization, we should we should win on this principle"
2005.52,2011.44, idea but lastly in terms of the idea of economic and land reparations being likely we already have
2011.44,2015.76, three responses to this the first was an eager speech about international support they say well
2015.76,2020.96, you can't sanction every single african country um that's true but firstly i find it unlikely that
2020.96,2025.54, every single african country is going to do be a backsliding democracy at the same rate.
2025.8,2034.94," But secondly, I think it is to an extent plausible just because the USA and the EU trade far more with each other than with African nations and trade with China far more than they trade with African nations."
2035.18,2042.5," So in terms of the power disparity there, African nations with relatively little importance to the economies of Western nations."
2042.9,2045.44," Secondly, in terms of local influential elite, elite"
2045.44,2049.4, is also already material from Egas Egas speech in the first argument we give you.
2049.68,2053.04," They say, well, firstly, in the PM that they will just peacefully leave"
2053.04,2054.68, after you've attained some victories.
2054.68,2056.84," Firstly, this is circular reasoning."
2056.84,2059.8, It requires you to have attained those victories in the first place.
2059.92,2062.12," But secondly, I find this incredibly unlikely"
2062.12,2063.8, just because like a proposition does the research here.
2063.8,2066.0, They're literally just been war started about why
2066.0,2070.0, colonisers were not wanting to give up their land when it comes to land redistribution.
2070.0,2076.0," Like, why would you want to give up everything that you have just because you see other people getting it take away?"
2076.0,2081.0," If anything, we think white colonisers are more likely to want to firstly do exactly what we're talking about, which is abuse the system."
2081.0,2085.42," I'll take a PY in a second, by the way. And secondly, if that's impossible, to fight for it,"
2085.56,2087.16," which is exactly the impact that we're talking about,"
2087.2,2089.26," about civil wars, about conflicts happening."
2089.64,2092.58," Secondly, they say that Black Africans outnumber white Africans"
2092.58,2093.82, to a significant degree.
2094.18,2098.16," Firstly, this is a point about political power."
2098.16,2101.78," We are unsure why the numerical game matters more than the political game,"
2102.16,2104.82," especially since the local influential elite,"
2105.42,2105.56," firstly,"
2109.7,2109.8," have the full support of the Western colonizers who've just left behind them. And secondly,"
2113.8,2113.9," because they're the ones with by far the most capital. If you want to hire a private militia,"
2117.64,2121.88," then it's not going to be the coarse individuals in Africa, then it's going to be the local elite trying to protect their assets. Thirdly, and lastly, this is a new mech here, about zero sum."
2122.14,2131.0," So for instance, if you want to vote, then your ability to vote doesn't detract from my ability to vote. However, if I give you land, then that must directly come up with the land that is given to me."
2131.0,2142.0," So it's relatively easier to implement reforms around civil and political rights than specifically economic reforms, because the amount of land you can get the amount of wealth which relies on the con, which is in the country is zero."
2142.0,2146.48," So before I continue, I'm happy to take a pui you stated at the start"
2146.48,2151.28, of your speech that china and saudi arabia are doing perfectly well under authoritarian
2151.28,2156.8, governments if that is true why are political rights necessary under our side um no we don't
2156.8,2161.44, think the chinese and saudi arabian people would be like any or worse often they would be under a
2161.44,2167.68, democracy the point was just more so there are nations in which people have a relatively higher level of prosperity than a lot of african nations which are still able
2167.68,2174.24, to operate in autocracies okay lastly in second they say that the leaders of these parties wanted
2174.24,2180.0, to these countries to do well to do well firstly i just find this empirically untrue like regarding
2180.0,2184.88, by the uprising against white colonizers and in turn then turned his ring into a dictatorship in
2184.88,2185.36, which he
2185.36,2189.92," deprived Zimbabweans of rights. But secondly, I think there's a more structured reasons that we"
2189.92,2193.6," give you. Even if you want to do well, the reality is that you rely on international support and you"
2193.6,2198.72, rely on the influence of local elites. This brings us quite nicely to our own case. Even if you buy
2198.72,2203.92," everything that propaganda gives you, we explain firstly that economic and civil rights or economic"
2203.92,2206.36, and land reforms are actually quite bad.
2206.72,2210.68," Firstly, for food insecurity, because individuals don't have sufficient capital and fragmentation."
2211.14,2216.18," All they say is, well, we give you the money to buy better equipment and fragmentation isn't really a problem, guys."
2216.58,2218.52," Panel, we tell you that this is about comparative."
2219.0,2224.76," Currently, they're able to produce a lot of food because you have corporations with huge amounts of capital that they can dump in."
2228.64,2233.44," On the comparative, you massively reduce the amount of output that you can get that still causes food insecure it's insecurity all the other mechs which i won't currently go over"
2233.44,2237.44, still left standing overall because we're the side which reduces tension because we're the side which
2238.0,2240.48, which rent economic comfort africans you should vote for us
2243.04,2245.0, thank you vote for us. Thank you. We thank the speaker.
2245.0,2270.0," Sorry, judges, judges all set."
2270.0,2271.0," Yep, yep."
2271.0,2272.0, Cool.
2272.0,2277.0, Thank the speaker for their speech and call upon the third speaker the proposition to
2277.0,2289.26," deliver their. Hi, am I audible and visible?"
2292.64,2294.26," I'll take your eyes verbally, please."
2299.82,2305.28, Colonialism was horrific and unjust for so many reasons reasons and that's why we began by establishing
2305.28,2310.56, our principal duty to address those harms. One of the biggest harms it caused was disrupting
2310.56,2315.06, the natural development of these states. Throughout history states have emerged naturally and
2315.06,2319.7," followed a fairly standard path of development where land was occupied, resources were produced"
2319.7,2329.52," and distributed and then economic growth occurred and following that democratic rights emerged. Colonialists from the UK and the Netherlands stepped in and destroyed that natural process,"
2329.8,2333.84," artificially imposing their own borders, laws and customs on a foreign land."
2334.16,2348.72," And the reason why democracy in Africa failed under side opposition status quo is because we tried to skip to the final stage of that process without letting the state develop organically first. So in the short term, Team England explained how we provide immediate relief from extreme poverty"
2348.72,2353.44," and instability that I'll have to contend with. But in the long term, we also provided a much"
2353.44,2358.08, more sustainable path to democracy and economic development. So we went on opposition's own metric
2358.08,2362.4," of democracy, but we get there on a path of far less suffering. Vote for opposition. Three points"
2362.4,2368.88, of clash in this speech. Firstly on the second only massive immediate harms of their side of the house and thirdly on the long-term
2368.88,2373.92, development what do we claim about the principle we give you three powerful principle obligations
2373.92,2378.56, firstly that land and wealth are the correct form of reparations and recognize here panel the
2378.56,2382.64, importance of this alone from the practical consequences that i've tried to tie in because
2382.64,2388.88," if you have stolen something if you have stolen say my land, even if you have built something on that land that benefits me"
2388.88,2393.6," or my community, that does not make it okay that you have stolen that land from me. And in that"
2393.6,2397.52," case, even when there are practical benefits, we would say that you ought to return what is not"
2397.52,2402.08," yours. But secondly, we told you that this pursuit of land and wealth fits with the will of the"
2402.08,2409.12, people and that land and wealth are necessary to preserve your right to life. How do they engage with this? Two things. First of all they say that maybe this
2409.12,2413.68, is true but dictatorships are really bad and we can't have that. And they never really analyse
2413.68,2418.48, this. And I want to note firstly here the massive concession that Second Op makes that basically
2418.48,2423.2," takes out this response because they acknowledge that dictatorships can be effective, that people"
2423.2,2429.76," can have good lives and that you don't need political rights in order to have economic success. But secondly, I'm just"
2429.76,2434.48," not sure this is the big win that opposition think this is, given, as we pointed out, the failure of"
2434.48,2438.66," democracy under their side of the house. To be clear, their world is filled with dictators,"
2438.84,2442.74," but the difference is that the people in their countries don't have land or money, which means"
2442.74,2445.16," that if there is corruption on both sides of the house,"
2445.16,2446.94, we would much rather be in a world
2446.94,2448.2, where at least you are less dependent
2448.2,2449.22," on a corrupt government,"
2449.22,2450.6, because you can produce your own food
2450.6,2451.94, and you can look after yourself.
2451.94,2452.78," But thirdly on this,"
2452.78,2454.76, we just don't think that strong dictatorships
2454.76,2455.96, are as bad as they say.
2455.96,2456.8," Look at Singapore,"
2456.8,2458.22, a dictatorship where individuals
2458.22,2459.7, have massive economic power
2459.7,2461.18, and that is incredibly prosperous.
2461.18,2462.98," And now we're not trying to tell you,"
2462.98,2469.44," that every African country becomes Singapore. But at the same time, we think it is unfair proposition to assert that every African"
2469.44,2473.72," country will become North Korea. Finally, on this, we want to talk about backsliding,"
2473.84,2478.84, because it's so much easier to take away political rights than it is economic rights. Because once
2478.84,2483.02," you've been given this land and this money, that is yours. And you will notice if someone tries to"
2483.02,2485.04," take it away. In comparison,"
2485.04,2488.8, if you slowly erode democratic rights you are much less likely to realise that and so you are
2488.8,2496.08, much less likely to lose the benefits that they claim. They say that if these are that important
2496.72,2501.6, then redistributing this land is bad. But this is about choices planning. We would much rather
2501.6,2505.82, have Africans have the land that is important to them than some random English or Dutch colonizers.
2505.82,2509.98," Now, I recognize that this is a creep rap, but that is not an excuse for not engaging"
2509.98,2511.98, at all with the analysis that Helen gave.
2511.98,2513.24, And note the way in here.
2513.24,2517.54, We say that these principal obligations trump any other rights to democracy or to vote.
2517.54,2518.76, Let me illustrate this to you.
2518.76,2522.5," If you're an individual farmer, you care about feeding yourself and your family."
2522.5,2527.68," If you're a community, you care about taking control of your natural resources and what was stolen from you. And if you are the state,"
2527.68,2531.76, you care about representing your people's wishes. Given that we prove why this is the principle all
2531.76,2535.68," three of those levels care about, it's the one that should be prioritised. Before I show why"
2535.68,2540.64," we went on immediate benefits, I'll take your feel-eye. China is currently in the process of"
2540.64,2544.8," committing genocide in Singapore, but UNSL for being gay. If those are really the countries"
2544.8,2548.1," which opposition wants to champion, then you should really reconsider your stance in this"
2548.1,2552.04," debate. We really want to talk about homophobia here, where over half of the countries in the"
2552.04,2556.6, world where being gay is illegal are on the African continent and four African countries
2556.6,2561.42, still have the death penalty for being gay. We tell you that not all dictatorships are as bad
2561.42,2569.32, as North Korea and that in fact you can have many positive benefits especially when they later transition to democracy. What do oppositions say on immediate benefits?
2569.48,2573.42, They hinge a lot of their rebuttal on saying that these redistributions won't work and I want to
2573.42,2577.92, point out that while doing this they do nothing to explain why their policies will and given the
2577.92,2582.26, reality that they don't we think they fail at their burden. However we're going to be charitable
2582.26,2588.62," in our analysis and explain why even if they were able to get these rights, they are still worse than the alternative that we gave."
2589.0,2592.98," They give you four reasons why we think we are not going to succeed. Firstly, the lack of"
2592.98,2597.24, international support. The beauty about these economic reparations is that we don't need
2597.24,2602.52, international support because you only have to do this in a one-time transfer. Your side requires
2602.52,2605.14, that continuous monitoring and goodwill from the
2605.14,2609.14," state, which is so much harder. Secondly, on backlash, and the only example and analysis"
2609.14,2613.74, here is look at Zimbabwe. We tell you that Zimbabwe was unique because they were the only
2613.74,2618.02, country that did this. We think when every country on the continent is trying to implement these
2618.02,2622.38," policies, it is so much harder to have this sort of backlash and have these sorts of sanctions."
2622.64,2627.2," But even if we do, Maya has explained, well, we don't think that is bad enough to make it not worth it."
2627.52,2631.0," Thirdly, we get this idea that we're going to have backlash from the people who you're"
2631.0,2635.4, reclaiming this land from. We point out that these people are massively outnumbered. There
2635.4,2643.28," were 23,000 Europeans in Kenya in 1945, compared to 5.2 million Kenyans. And it is simply implausible"
2643.28,2645.1, to believe that these people are going to
2645.1,2648.86," get the UK government to come back and fight for them. By contrast, what we think is much"
2648.86,2652.76, more believable is that the colonial powers would subsidise their citizens leaving so
2652.76,2657.22, as to avoid them dying in any conflict. That is exactly what the British government did
2657.22,2661.3," in Kenya. Fourthly, they say that economic and land reparations are complex. We don't"
2661.3,2664.62, necessarily think this is true. We take the land and we give it to community leaders as
2664.62,2667.78, we set out in our model. And note that we don't need it to be perfect to get all the
2667.78,2672.78," massive immediate benefits that we get. And I want to flag our mechanisms here, which they never even"
2672.78,2677.14," bother to pay lip service to, about why we're going to be successful. We tell you that we massively"
2677.14,2681.7," outnumber the colonisers, that they have the levers of state, that many countries are doing it, and"
2681.7,2688.48," the colonial powers are likely to support this. So given that all of their rebuttal hinges on them proving that we're unsuccessful, we can take out an enormous"
2688.48,2692.48," amount of their material. Secondly, they say that this isn't going to be enough to give people the"
2692.48,2695.36, help that they need and it's not going to be enough money. This was clearly a point they
2695.36,2699.04," wrote before, it doesn't engage with our model that we are giving people immediate money and"
2699.04,2703.84, they stake in the resources around them. But know that they concede here the money is indeed helpful
2703.84,2708.62, and is useful and the problem with that case is that they never contend with how to get it under their side of
2708.62,2713.64," the house. We would much rather people have some land than no land at all, because they're able to"
2713.64,2718.24," coalesce and use this together in order to get benefits from it. Finally, on this idea that"
2718.24,2722.36," these people are going to turn violent and that their leaders are going to stoke ethnic conflict,"
2722.36,2726.16, their own example was of a conflict that happened in a democracy.
2726.16,2729.2," Because when you are scared of another party taking power from you in an election,"
2729.2,2732.88, that is when you stoke ethnic conflict to stop people supporting them.
2732.88,2735.48," We tell you we're going to allocate these resources well,"
2735.48,2738.56, and that we are able to give people money to solve their immediate issues
2738.56,2740.16, and restore control over their land.
2740.16,2741.64, They never engage with that.
2741.64,2748.96," So recognise the millions of lives and livelihoods that we save, and do not let opposition sacrifice these people for the abstract promise of democracy in the"
2748.96,2752.24, future. What do they claim about the long term? Because their only claim there is that there's
2752.24,2757.12, going to be less FDI in the future. We point out why sanctions are implausible and their only
2757.12,2761.2, response is to say that not all countries will do this so you don't have to sanction everyone.
2761.2,2768.24, the motion assumes that Africa acts as a whole so at the very least we have to believe that a large substantial number of countries are going to do
2768.24,2772.56, this and recognise that other countries are able to invest even if this was the case. We would much
2772.56,2777.44, rather have better investment once people have control over this land so they're able to negotiate.
2777.44,2782.16, Shell is no longer able to come in and bribe a corrupt government to take control of oil supplies
2782.16,2788.8, when those oil supplies are owned by the people. We tell you we get much better economic success in the long term and political success in the
2788.8,2792.48, long term and they never engage with those mechanisms that Maya gave you. We went on
2792.48,2795.6," the short term, we went on the long term and we went on the principle. So the wording of"
2795.6,2798.8, this motion may be a mess but Africa didn't have to be so proud to propose.
2801.76,2833.0, Thank you. All judges set.
2833.0,2847.52," Cool. And that piece we thank the third speaker aside proposition, and ask the third speaker aside opposition to deliver their solution. Yes, give me one second to set up my timer."
2852.16,2852.66, Yes.
2857.76,2874.16," POIs in chat, please. panel the number of multi-party systems in african countries increased from five in 1989 to 35 in"
2874.16,2883.36, 1998 while the number of one-party states decreased from 29 to 2. malnutrition dropped to 22.3 percent
2883.36,2885.96, in the last 20 years in the whole of Africa.
2886.28,2890.62, People living under the poverty line dropped 10% the last 20 years.
2891.04,2891.34, Panel.
2892.04,2897.24, Proposition tries to kill the trend of progress that Africa is currently on.
2897.5,2903.5," On the contrast, the economic success on said proposition is unlikely and more civil war is certain."
2903.5,2905.86, Never been prouder to oppose. In this
2905.86,2911.36," speech, I'm going to go through four things. Firstly, the principle. Let's say what they"
2911.36,2915.1," told you under this principle here. They tell you three things. Firstly, land and wealth,"
2915.5,2922.08," we need to give reparations. Two responses. First of all, this depends on the point whether they're"
2922.08,2925.28, able to give the reparations in the first place so it's like
2925.28,2929.92, e that proposition will never even be able to give the reparations due to first argument so this
2929.92,2937.2, changes on a practical not a principle second of all we tell you the takeaway rights themselves
2937.2,2946.34, right the right to to speak freely the right to organize are also rights these people deserve are also reparations that these people
2946.34,2953.76, deserve especially minority communities won't be able to express their culture under the
2953.76,2958.5, dictatorship of psych proposition the second principled line i tried to give you is that
2958.5,2963.62, it's fit with the role of the people small communal communities panel i think it's extremely
2963.62,2966.1, weird to characterize the whole africa
2966.1,2971.18, of wanting to go back to small communities which tell you they've changed in the colonial rule
2971.18,2976.22, the third layer that i say it's the it's good because then people can stay alive again this
2976.22,2980.54, hinges on the practical aka this principle falls out of the debate now let's engage with the more
2980.54,2985.68, important things the second clash is whose policy is most likely to be effectively
2985.68,2992.64, implemented here we gave you three three main reasons why proposition land redist true land
2992.64,2997.6, redistribution will never work and we give you empirical evidence notes that the world is not
2997.6,3003.68, black and uh black and white so the examples we get venue are attempts at implementing props
3003.68,3009.84, policy yes it was in this in the status quo world but there is just one of those gray areas that did implement.
3009.94,3012.8, The majority of countries did implement social and political rights.
3013.06,3017.48," That is why we're a trend of progress, except the countries that implemented props policy."
3017.72,3020.56," So their whole point about, oh, they can't bring examples doesn't work."
3020.92,3022.74, So then what did we bring you under this clash?
3022.74,3028.7," Three things. Firstly, they need international support. Props issue tells you, no, they don't. They can just redistribute land"
3028.7,3035.6," themselves. No panel, because sanction will be harming. You need aid to be able to bring about"
3035.6,3046.96, agriculture. You need fertilizers to not have all the insects kill your food you need you need a water irrigation system so that the droughts that
3046.96,3053.2, are on their continent don't hamper this food security yes you need western support secondly
3053.2,3058.88, they will tell you uh land preparations are zero sum because when i have planned team england can't
3058.88,3070.62," have land on the other hand political rights are nothing. I'm speaking, they're speaking. My speech is not a zero sum thing. They never engage with this point. This means that this is one"
3070.62,3074.1, of the reasons that stand why land redistribution will never work.
3074.1,3078.28, The third reason we gave you was that it's actively taking land from other people versus
3078.28,3082.96," giving. There's empirical evidence to show that it's unlikely to be successful. For example,"
3082.96,3086.26," in South Africa, who started the Reconstruction and Development Program in 1994,"
3086.82,3089.68, the largest land redistribution program to date.
3090.12,3092.58, Less than 10% of the redistribution target
3092.58,3094.46, has been reached by the state.
3094.64,3095.78, It doesn't work.
3096.28,3099.8, Note that this alone means the whole proposition case false
3099.8,3102.28, because they are never able to implement
3102.28,3104.9, these land redistributions anyways.
3106.8,3114.24," But look, maybe even if they do a little bit it is a skill they are not going to be able to redistribute all land at best"
3114.24,3119.52, small parts of their land the the impacts of redistributing very small part of land never
3119.52,3124.16, way up to the violence that they create which i will explain in a second what then do they tell
3124.16,3128.08," you no no they'll be able to do this because firstly, they're more African than colonists."
3128.5,3132.78," Look, if it were by mere numbers, it doesn't work. Like in South Africa, there are many more"
3132.78,3139.84," black people than white, but still the white hold power. Only numbers are not a point in politics."
3139.92,3144.24," It's about who has the resources, the money and the army. They don't have the army. The Western"
3144.24,3145.82, armies are still stronger.
3146.34,3150.4," Thirdly, they tell you, no, no, no, we support a world where African states can learn from"
3150.4,3150.8, each other.
3151.2,3153.44," Whoa, not all African states are the same."
3153.44,3159.0," The fact that it worked in one state doesn't work under the colonizer of another state,"
3159.08,3159.26, right?
3159.4,3163.74," They tell you that they can learn from each other, but the fact that it worked for an"
3163.74,3166.0, ex-French colony doesn't mean that worked for for an ex-french colony doesn't mean
3166.0,3173.12, that it works for an ex-english colony the end of this flash it's clear proposition is very unlikely
3173.12,3178.96, to ever be able to do land distributions in the first place however they need they need to deal
3178.96,3184.32, with the bad things that happen even if they would be able to achieve land reparations namely the
3184.32,3187.24, economic harms we talk about in our second argument.
3187.24,3189.54, We tell you it will be underutilized.
3189.54,3194.8," For example, in Zimbabwe, two thirds of the population were at risk of starvation during"
3194.8,3198.76, a rain season because the land had been redistributed.
3198.76,3203.22," Secondly, we tell you the lack of FDI is crucial."
3203.22,3207.52, The stabilization program by the IMF in the Democratic Republic of Congo
3207.52,3214.96," led to the inflation decline from 8% to 2.5%, which how you FDI is crucial."
3215.54,3216.54, What do they tell you then?
3216.72,3221.72," No, no, no, but we can reduce suffering because they can use like the thousand dollars of cash"
3221.72,3226.14, we give them right away to alleviate immediate suffering. Note that
3226.14,3231.5, you finish the thousand dollars in two months after the Africans are a bit off as they were
3231.5,3237.02," before. However, to sustain policy in the long run, you need institutions which create tax incomes"
3237.02,3241.64," that can sustainably provide for people. That is why on our side of the house, there is more"
3241.64,3250.38," involvement in secondary education, doubled more from the inabundance until now, because we create sustainable institutions that give people"
3250.38,3259.1," a true improvement on the long run, not just a thousand dollar cash influx. That's never enough."
3259.9,3264.28," Second of all, we tell you that the money to invest in the future never work. They don't"
3264.28,3267.86, have the economies of scale to collectively buy things
3267.86,3270.2, at the point that they didn't have money in the first place.
3270.44,3273.24," Before I move on to my third question, I'll take that be alive."
3273.84,3276.58, What's more useful to you as someone in extreme poverty?
3276.88,3281.34, A polling booth in a town three hours away or land that you can now farm to keep you alive?
3282.06,3286.16," First of all, I've proven to you, you'll never have land to keep you alive. Even if you have land to keep you alive first of all i've proven to you you'll never have land to keep you alive"
3286.16,3292.24, even if you have land to keep you alive probably you'll have an oppressive dictator which creates
3292.24,3297.2, civil war which brings me onto my third clash which they never engage in gateways why a
3297.2,3303.84, proposition conflicts would increase so this was our third road to victory what we prove to you
3303.84,3328.1," here is that proposition policy is probably going to stroke conflict. First of all, because when citizens have no peaceful means to express their dissatisfaction, they turn to violence. Secondly, authoritarian leaders stoke conflict to maintain control. Look at your notes. This was in LO. We've given examples. What does this mean? Civil and political rights would protect against conflict."
3328.5,3332.94, Everything you buy about civil conflict being bad in the status quo would be worse.
3333.22,3339.24," For example, in the Casamance conflict in Senegal, which was a low level conflict for the independence of the Casamance region,"
3339.52,3347.68, whose population is religiously and ethnically distinct from the rest of Senegal. The only thing that solved this conflict was that the Senegalese president was
3347.72,3351.64, pressured by the people to sign a treaty with this region.
3351.68,3356.04, This prevented mass conflict to escalate further.
3356.08,3360.6, We've given you the example of how this happened in a Niger region.
3360.64,3362.2, No response. Panel.
3362.24,3364.76, More civil wars on proposition is a clear win.
3364.8,3365.2, Vote up. Thank you. region no response panel more silver bars on proposition is a clear win vote up
3367.6,3393.0, thank you Judge is all set.
3393.0,3401.32," Cool. In that case, I thank the third speaker of side opposition and call upon the replied"
3401.32,3406.3, speaker of side opposition of the liberal speech.
3407.38,3408.68," Yes, thank you."
3411.74,3414.56," Panel, I think it is unfair for a proposition to characterize the entirety of the African continent"
3414.56,3416.36, and the status quo as terrible
3416.36,3418.9, because we point to you to examples like Botswana.
3419.22,3420.86," We point to you to examples like Ghana,"
3421.0,3422.68, where because they were able to enshrine
3422.68,3423.76," civil and political rights,"
3423.98,3428.0," those were the seeds that eventually allowed democracies to bloom. The fact that, as our"
3428.0,3434.04," third speaker points out, more and more countries are transitioning from single-party systems to"
3434.04,3439.16," multi-party systems shows the hope in our world. The status quo may not be perfect, but that wasn't"
3439.16,3443.22, our burden to prove. We don't have to tell you the status quo is good. All we have to prove to you is
3443.22,3445.6," that on their side, it gets significantly worse."
3445.94,3452.16," Two questions in my speech. Firstly, on which side is more likely to occur? And secondly, on which side is more important?"
3452.5,3460.12," So on the first question, note that what we proved to you from the very first speech onward is that even if we have fiat on both sides of the house,"
3460.28,3465.18, there are still external factors that make it more unlikely for proposition to achieve their aims.
3465.44,3469.26," Because in propositions world, you have to constantly be taking away land from the rich,"
3469.46,3474.14," from the elite. In propositions world, you don't have a blueprint because every country is filled"
3474.14,3481.22, with complex ethnic tensions where it's very difficult to plan things like land redistribution.
3481.5,3484.96," The comparative in our world is when it comes to enshrining civil and political rights,"
3488.38,3492.7," these rights are oftentimes negative rights. You don't need to directly give it to someone. Rather, the absence of the states just not infringing on your right is enough. The fact"
3492.7,3496.34, that you already have blueprints like other democratic institutions and other constitutions
3496.34,3501.98, make it significantly easier. What does Proposition say to this? The first thing they tell us is that
3501.98,3508.54, they can also have land reforms because leaders on both sides of the House will have good intentions.
3508.84,3512.12," Panel, I'm sure Robert Mugabe probably had good intentions at the beginning."
3512.38,3519.88," But the problem is oftentimes when you have no accountability mechanisms, when you cannot vote out leaders, when you cannot protest against leaders, that's when leaders get bad."
3519.88,3524.92," So even if both sides of the House have good intentions, the problem is when they do mess up, we can hold them accountable."
3525.36,3529.34," Proposition cannot. Then they say, ah, at least we'll have more black individuals."
3529.34,3533.06, So somehow we will have more equitable land reform. But note that this doesn't matter.
3533.24,3536.16, It was also the case in colonial rule that the black was the majority.
3536.46,3540.4, The difference is your numbers only matter when you have civil and political rights.
3540.4,3544.46," This was pointed out by our second speaker, because numbers only matter when it comes to things like voting."
3544.78,3549.0, Numbers only matter when it comes to things like protesting. You're not able to do that in proposition side of the house.
3549.0,3559.0," They have no power whatsoever. I also think it is interesting that the second proposition, for example, of Namibia, where 70% of land is owned by European descendants."
3559.0,3563.0, Panamibia is one of the few countries that actually actively prioritized land reform.
3563.0,3568.22, It was the president that actually had that main goal in mind. What we tell you is it is simply not likely to happen.
3568.5,3573.86," But moreover then, which side is more important? We tell you, let's take proposition in their best"
3573.86,3577.84," case scenario. Let's say in their best case, you do have economic reform that finally works. You"
3577.84,3583.12," give each individual $1,000. Why is this still not good enough? We told you two things. Firstly,"
3583.32,3586.32," that even if you give individuals land, you cannot use it properly"
3586.32,3588.52," because oftentimes the land that you redistribute,"
3588.52,3590.38, you have to divide it to such small pieces
3590.38,3591.7, that you just can't live off of that.
3591.7,3593.5," But more importantly, you don't give people"
3593.5,3595.84, enough sustainable capital to actually use that land
3595.84,3599.7, to continue to be able to have enough resources
3599.7,3601.52, to farm off of it year after year.
3601.52,3603.5," But secondly, we tell you that money doesn't matter"
3603.5,3604.88, if you have poor economic policy.
3604.88,3608.14," If your country is suffering from hyperinflation, that bag of a thousand dollars"
3608.14,3612.8," doesn't do anything for these individuals. But thirdly, we told you independent of anything else,"
3612.94,3617.32, you're far more likely to have civil conflict in their world because individuals who do not have
3617.32,3621.44, their voices heard are more likely to go to extreme ends. What does this mean? It means that
3621.44,3625.16," for the oppressed, when you cannot protest, you're far more likely to result to things like riots."
3625.36,3631.96," That when you cannot express your opinions with democratic institutions, that was when you resort to more violent means."
3632.26,3637.34," The way of then this debate is very simple. In their best case, they may have some sort of economic reform."
3637.68,3643.0," In their worst case, this is the cost of it. In their worst case, it comes at the cost of oppression."
3643.0,3645.52, It comes at the cost of terrible economic policy.
3645.76,3647.8, It comes at the cost of civil conflict.
3648.16,3649.32, Please vote for opposition.
3651.84,3652.48, Thank you.
3661.66,3671.64," Judges, all set? Well, in that case, I thank the Opposition Reply Speaker for their speech and call upon"
3671.64,3675.04, the Proposition Reply Speaker to close up this debate for us.
3675.04,3681.12, Can everyone hear me?
3681.12,3689.82," Political rights don't always equate to prosperity. And that's why when 54 different African states tried to enact side opposition policies, they"
3689.82,3690.82, failed.
3690.82,3696.5," Because side opposition's policies were always a colonial imposition, an imitation of a system"
3696.5,3699.12, that enslaved this continent for centuries.
3699.12,3703.8," That's why opposition's case was a mess, but Africa didn't have to be."
3703.8,3704.8, That's why we're so proud to propose.
3704.8,3705.88," I'm going to talk about a few things in this speech. First of all, on whether this works. opposition's case was a mess but Africa didn't have to be. That's why we're so proud to propose."
3705.88,3709.12," I'm going to talk about a few things in this speech. First of all on whether this works,"
3709.12,3713.56," second on the principle and finally on the practical touch. First on does this work,"
3713.56,3719.5," because in response to a POI and third, opposition concede that land is more useful than being able"
3719.5,3724.72, to vote. Their only rebuttal then is to claim that we never get that land. We think we've shown why
3724.72,3729.44," we've been able to take this land back from a small number of colonizers. But to be clear, this is not all"
3729.44,3734.32," on us. If we show that in a large number of cases we are in fact able to redistribute that land,"
3734.32,3739.6, we provide massive benefit and they've already conceded our case. There are two parts whether
3739.6,3743.92," this policy can work. First, do the leaders of these nations have incentives to make it happen?"
3743.92,3747.0," And second, is it physically possible for them to do so?"
3747.0,3750.0," On the first question, we prove that these leaders are going to be well-intentioned."
3750.0,3758.0," We gave you incentive analysis that side opposition completely ignored, explaining why these people are likely to be selfless, to be idealistic, to want to do this."
3758.0,3768.08," And second, on whether they can carry it out. We point out that the African population had numbers on their side, had the power of the state, that they had all countries doing this so they could back each other when"
3768.08,3772.72," white sectors would leave, and finally that colonizers would be likely to fund this, to buy"
3772.72,3777.84, this land off them as a sunk cost of decolonization as the British paid off Kenyan settlers because
3777.84,3781.84, they don't want their people to die. We prove to you therefore that we are capable of carrying out
3781.84,3788.24, this policy. They've already conceded that land is a good and useful thing and i think we therefore win this debate on that concession alone
3788.24,3792.08, but on the principle because we brought you a three-part principle explained for us where land
3792.08,3796.64, and wealth are the correct form of reparations because this uniquely is what had been stolen
3796.64,3801.84, from the people of africa there was no electoral democracy or u.s style constitution stripped from
3801.84,3809.2, them it was the land that families had farmed or lived on for generations. That is what we have to return. And when they talk about how land redistribution
3809.2,3813.76," is a zero-sum game, it's not fair that we're taking it from other people. Panel, we are taking"
3813.76,3818.8, land from white colonisers or elite collaborators who stole it in the first place. The principle of
3818.8,3823.52, justification is clear. And then we tell you that taking land and wealth and distributing it fits
3823.52,3828.16, with the will of the people and crucially preserves the right to life and ought to be the most important because
3828.16,3832.64, that's what you need to access any opposition to political rights. They respond not by engaging
3832.64,3836.16, with this principle but by trying to weigh it against the assertion that civil and political
3836.16,3840.56, rights matter more. But how do we respond to this? First preemptively with the second and third parts
3840.56,3849.84, of our principle because this is what independence campaigners wanted democracy doesn't have to look like side opposition's narrow western view of going to the ballot box every five years
3849.84,3855.36, it can look like a huge popular support for a life that was materially different a new chapter after
3855.36,3859.84, colonialism but we also tell you that you need to stay alive to access any of these benefits when
3859.84,3864.24, side opposition concedes that people need land and money to survive they can see the debate but we
3864.24,3868.4, also prove in our second speech that we get better civil and political rights under our side.
3868.4,3873.52," There's no response to this argument than a claim that, oh, this is contingent on your policy work."
3873.52,3878.16," We've made it clear that this policy does work, the principle stands. Then on the practical,"
3878.16,3881.68, first thing opposition say here is that we're going to have a dictator. But as we've made it
3881.68,3889.04," very clear, central authoritarian rule is something both sides have to grapplele with because opposition have to stand behind the status quo where dictators at"
3889.04,3892.96, some point have had power in all the two countries in Africa. They should have been more careful
3892.96,3897.12, before making too many critiques of this but then they only give us two actual practical
3897.12,3901.04, harms both woefully unarguable. I'd like to point out that the rest of their case which we dealt
3901.04,3909.2," with earlier is pure mitigation. First on the lack of FBI. We tell you that the large availability of labour, the purchasing power advantage of cheap currency, and the presence"
3909.2,3913.52," of natural resources, coupled with pressure from Western countries to find new locations for their"
3913.52,3917.68," factories, means that these companies would still likely have invested in these countries. The difference"
3917.68,3922.08," is, as we talked about in second, our workers could have demanded better conditions and better wages."
3922.08,3928.72, Then they say that people are likely to become violent. I think in the first question I proved why this doesn't happen. But we tell you about the unique
3928.72,3932.48," benefits, unique benefits that side opposition can see when they say there is a high standard of"
3932.48,3937.2, living in China and Saudi Arabia. We tell you four reasons why people don't starve when they have
3937.2,3942.48," land, why it's such a good thing. We tell you about how we avoid the catastrophe of civil war."
3942.48,3945.04," We tell you about how we get long term economic development,"
3945.04,3947.44, but also how we build on opposition's own metrics.
3947.44,3949.18, Because we're the only side that needs two free
3949.18,3952.26, requisites if you need for a stable functioning democracy
3952.26,3954.58," panel, we win this debate on every count."
3954.58,3957.64, We're so proud of those.
3957.64,3959.12, Thank you very much for that speech.
3959.12,3962.02," In fact, the debate has a call."
3962.02,3963.98, If I'm going to stop recording.
