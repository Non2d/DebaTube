0.0,6.14," All right, that works. Then I would like to give the floor to the first proposition speaker"
6.14,9.5, to open this debate. Good luck.
9.5,16.88, Can I confirm that I'm audible?
16.88,31.42," POIs in chat, please. Make no mistake, post-colonial African states have been misled, and in the fourth strand of hope is in pursuing liberal democracies."
31.76,36.02, They have neglected pressing issues that only furthered the legacy of suffering imposed upon their people.
36.34,39.16, Economic reparations are the prerequisite for all other benefits.
39.54,43.16, Political and civil rights are a leaf in the relentless wind of reality.
43.16,45.04, Our burden on proposition is not to
45.04,49.44," deliver a utopia, but we do think that states would have benefited local populations, and the"
49.44,53.42, balance of probabilities created a stronger foundation for them to build and develop into
53.42,57.74," the 21st century. What do we stand for? As these states gained independence, they would prioritize"
57.74,62.14," limited political resources into implementing economic changes, such as land redistribution"
62.14,68.8," and cash transfer payments. This speech will prove three things. Firstly, economic reparations are likely to be applied best under our side."
68.8,73.12," Second, they bring the most and greatest immediate benefit. And finally, economic reparations are"
73.12,77.92," prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights. Firstly, why economic reparations are"
77.92,82.16, more likely to be successfully applied than civil and political rights. And this is crucial because
82.16,87.68, it explains why it's only under proposition that a policy that is likely to be implemented successfully and note that this argument
87.68,91.84, preemptively will respond for all of opposition's benefits because they're all contingent on
91.84,95.52, political and civil rights being carried out successfully there are three parts to this
95.52,99.68, argument firstly economic reparations are initially more achievable in a post-colonial
99.68,104.16, state recognize that the revolutionary leaders which this debate occurs upon are not purely
104.16,108.0, altruistic but they balance genuine desire to help their nation with selfish desire for power.
108.0,119.0," Despots like Mugabe, who have no desire to help their nations, fall out of this debate because of their unwillingness to implement either side's policies in a meaningful manner."
119.0,129.44," So given that, civil and political rights require a far greater training offer of because you necessarily set up systems to on your own demise. Conversely, economic reforms enable leaders to pursue"
129.44,133.04, a desire to better their own nation without compromising their own motives to power.
133.04,137.76, That's why leaders like Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana went on to create one-party states to prevent
137.76,142.08, losing their own rule. So what this has established is that leaders both have the incentive and
142.08,147.66," capacity to fail to implement opposition's political rights, whereas they'll be more willing to implement our economic rights."
147.94,151.54, The second part of this argument is to say that even if opposition proves that political rights
151.54,155.5," were initially successful, it's unlikely that they'll be sustained into the future for three"
155.5,159.78," reasons. Firstly, because political and civil rights require additional buy-in into seemingly"
159.78,164.3, Western systems of democracy. These populations who have had no encounter with these democracies
164.3,169.36, before necessitate that distrust. Democracy only works effectively if it is engaged with and
169.36,173.2, without the trust it will fail. But secondly because civil and political rights are highly
173.2,177.44, inter-reliant such that the failure of one right necessitates the downfall of all others. For
177.44,182.24, example the right to vote is inconsequential if you lack information because of pipe state control.
182.24,185.02, But thirdly because political rights require additional
185.02,186.28," and continued maintenance,"
186.28,187.92, such that the states have the capacity
187.92,189.56, to provide political rights and name
189.56,190.8," without actually doing so,"
190.8,192.2," through mechanisms like gerrymandering,"
192.2,194.14," voter suppression and miscounting ballots,"
194.14,195.56, all of which are easy to hide
195.56,198.44, versus whilst observing land distribution
198.44,200.3, is relatively obvious under our side.
200.3,201.7," So what we know so far,"
201.7,203.9, the political rights at the point of implementation
203.9,211.8," do not guarantee the benefits that opposition will claim, in the same way how Eritrea was one of the first African nations to have free elections, but was not successful in sustaining them."
211.96,218.62," The final part of this argument is to note that, by comparison, economic reparations are likely to succeed after initial application for three reasons."
218.76,229.2," Firstly, because economic reparations provide immediate benefits, even when citizens do not have ideal access to them. Even if you believe that economic reparations are imperfect, recognise that half the access to"
229.2,233.44," these policies is still good. If you receive a cash transfer but no land redistribution,"
233.44,237.36, it still benefits you and that is still better than no reparations at all. Compare that to
237.36,241.68, opposition where the imperfect application of one right harms all the other rights which they try
241.68,246.9, and gain. The second thing to say here is that economic benefits are more easily sustained during a context
246.9,249.32, of political instability in post-colonial Africa.
249.32,250.68," We know that empirically,"
250.68,253.1, many African states experienced political turmoil
253.1,254.08, during those periods.
254.08,256.42, Political and civil rights could not have been maintained
256.42,258.96, whilst the economic benefits we provide before that
258.96,260.74, are given and they are able to remain.
260.74,262.84," But the third thing to say is that unlike opposition,"
262.84,263.9," which gets weaker with time,"
263.9,268.54," as more people lose faith in democracy, economic reparations compound. That's because economic"
268.54,273.02," reparations allow you for continuing development, like educating your children or working in the"
273.02,277.32, land that you're given. This allows the benefits we claim to grow over time in comparison to
277.32,281.98," opposition, who will likely have those democracies rapidly backslide. So at the end of this argument,"
282.34,289.26," from the under proposition, where policy is likely to be implemented successfully, and which is what all of opposition benefits will be contingent on in"
289.26,293.06," this debate. I'm now going to move on to my second argument. But before that, I'm happy to take a"
293.06,298.12, point of information. How are your operations more sustainable if you don't have property rights?
299.58,303.44, So I've just explained that we are likely to be able to have these sorts of things because they
303.44,308.08," compound over time. If you give someone money, for for example you're able to invest that in yourself you're"
308.08,313.44, able to educate yourself and that necessitates in fact if we give them land they're able to work on
313.44,318.24, that and that is likely to grow only under outside you guys cannot claim that so secondly why
318.24,322.48, economic reparations bring the greatest immediate benefit and this argument explains why even if you
322.48,328.18," believe that both policies in this debate are equally enforceable, you must prioritize economic reparations because they provide the"
328.18,332.34, greatest immediate benefit. Side proposition solved the immediate problem of poverty and
332.34,336.32," starvation, which is the greatest impact in this debate. The impacts of political rights are long"
336.32,340.78," term and speculative because they require future action, whilst economic reparations do not and"
340.78,345.08," are guaranteed. We look to examples of huge famines in Ethiopia, where 1.2 million"
345.08,349.18," people died, and democratic rights did nothing to help them. And note that even if opposition"
349.18,353.68," tries to claim that they eventually get economic reparations, you must still vote side proposition,"
354.08,357.98, because of the immediacy of our benefit. Because every day where governments deny economic
357.98,361.94," reparations, thousands more have died. And opposition at this point has an enormous"
361.94,365.76, burden in this debate. Tell us how they're going to help the people suffering right now.
365.76,369.56," Why, even in their best case, it is worth having to wait decades to save lives"
369.68,371.92," rather than grant immediate economic reparations,"
372.04,373.88, which only we can do under our side.
373.88,377.12," Finally, why the prioritization of economic reparation"
377.32,380.32, is a necessary prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights.
380.56,384.56, The thesis of this argument is to suggest that economic reparations
384.56,385.92, are prerequisite for accessing anything that this argument is to suggest that economic reparations are prerequisite for
385.92,389.84," accessing anything that this opposition wants to claim. So even in opposition's best case,"
389.84,393.68," if you believe that those rights are important, you must vote side proposition. That's for two"
393.68,397.76," reasons. Firstly, you have to recognise that individuals need to be economically secure"
397.76,402.08," to be politically engaged, because you need time to conduct protests, because the right to vote in"
402.08,408.16," name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper, because the right to vote in name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper because the right to freedom of the press means nothing if someone is too"
408.16,412.16, illiterate because their parents could not afford them to send them to school secondly this is
412.16,416.72, because this would lead to a less power asymmetry between ethnic groups economically actually
416.72,421.44, increasing civil and political rights effectively because that inequality is lessened and therefore
421.44,428.98," safety increases under our side all that is to say that if you want to unlock any civil and political benefits that opposition wants to claim, it is necessary to"
428.98,433.7, first achieve a baseline of wealth that only we can access on side proposition. That is what this
433.7,438.42," opposition has to contend with in this debate. By comparison, you're more able to push for civil"
438.42,442.66, and political rights when you're in a better economic situation for two key reasons. The
442.66,449.28," first thing to say is because you have more power, you are able to pressure unwilling governments because of the fact that you hold economic power."
449.28,453.2, That is through the mechanisms like lobbying and platforming politicians by giving them
453.2,457.76, funds to conduct things that could only happen under our side where you have that economic power.
457.76,462.0, That level of government reliance on individuals is how you achieve a voice under our side.
462.0,469.28," But the second thing to say is that for the reasons before, individuals can only mobilize and push for rights when they have that initial economic basis that we"
469.28,473.36," provide. Because rather than thinking about how you're going to put the food on the table at night,"
473.36,476.56, you can think about who you're going to vote for. You can think about how you're going to enact
476.56,480.88," change. Obviously, we're not saying that these individuals will have all the economic power,"
480.88,484.8, but the question you have to ask yourself in this debate is who has comparatively more economic
484.8,487.66," power, which flows into political power for the reasons that"
487.66,488.66, we've given.
488.66,493.28," At the end of the speech, economic reparations are a prerequisite for all other benefits."
493.28,496.22, Political and civil rights are a leaf in the relentless wind of reality.
496.22,498.24, That's what this opposition has to contend with.
498.24,526.34, Vote proposition. Thank you very much for that speech.
526.34,531.0," And now to open the debate on behalf of the opposition, we go to the first OPP speaker."
531.0,578.32, Good luck. you Can everyone hear?
578.32,609.04," Once again, verbal POIs from Prop, please. Please, I'll start my speech in 3, 2, 1 proposition cannot claim that civil and political rights firstly quickly on our stance and what happens when you're prioritizing civil"
609.04,613.6, and political rights or the responding to a chunks of material coming from proposition then quickly
613.6,618.24, on some rebuttal then we'll present our own case firstly then on our stance one we want african
618.24,622.64, countries to prioritize civil and political rights but secondly we're also okay with countries
622.64,629.2, carrying out economic and land reparations on our side if the people in the countries decide to do so vote for governments that support that but
629.2,634.88, crucially the predisposition for operations for reparations being careful carried out in an okay
634.88,639.28, way is prioritizing civil and political rights giving the people the power so they can keep the
639.28,643.52, government accountable to carry out economic distribution correctly what then happens when
643.52,645.56, you're prioritizing civil and political rights?
645.56,646.9, We think that three things happen.
646.9,648.56," One, you codify those rights."
648.56,652.1, This means rights are written in constitution and laws.
652.1,653.44, Those are very hard to repeal.
653.44,655.74, It's a literal constitution.
655.74,657.64, You cannot really challenge it very easily.
657.64,659.4," Secondly, ensuring those,"
659.4,660.56, governments are going to be ensuring
660.56,662.04, that those rights can be exercised.
662.04,664.22, Meaning you'll have the means as a person of Africa
664.22,668.64, to go to court and demand actors in society to respect your rights but thirdly we also think
668.64,672.8, that institutionalization of those rights will be pushed forward this means that governments on our
672.8,676.96, side prioritize building institutions that protect your rights this means you're insured more public
676.96,681.6, defenders more judges more inspector that can for example come check abuses on your workplace
681.6,688.82," on proposition countries have different goals those things are crucially left behind, and they're then different on two grounds. One, although they might give you"
688.82,692.68," land, you can't be unlawfully detained. You can't be unlawfully stripped of the land that you were"
692.68,697.7," given. You don't have the right to let go about your life as you want to. But secondly, even if"
697.7,703.36," the right to land is codified on their side, it's unclear to us to what extent you can exercise this"
703.36,705.44, right. This extent is severely limited when
705.44,709.2, you don't have the institutions developed to complain to courts to have the judges look at
709.2,713.28, your cases this means that we're already better at achieving the right that proposition wants to
713.28,719.92, claim before i move on to a negation proposition engage your side is the status quo in all of
719.92,723.68, africa the three functioning democracies how has your side been successful can you repeat that
723.68,725.76," sorry the sound was up your side is the status quo in all of africa the three functioning democracies. How has your side been successful? Can you repeat that? Sorry, the sound was off."
728.48,734.16," Your side is the status quo. In all of Africa, there are three functioning democracies. How has your policy been successful?"
734.16,736.64," We think that on our side of the house, it's still better than your side,"
736.64,739.92," when all the countries are going to be autocratic, when all of the rights of the people of Africa"
739.92,743.6," are repealed, when people have no way to be humanised. It's better to have like"
743.6,748.32, weak democracies on our side than no democracy on opposition then let's talk about the likelihood of stuff happening
748.32,752.16, which is the main push coming from first up we tell you that it's equally likely that both things
752.16,756.24, will be carried out initially because the same amount of power has to be taken from the government
756.24,759.44, on our side the power that is taken from the government is that you're probably going to have
759.44,763.2, a bit less control over what's happening with your country but you're probably okay with that because
763.2,767.18, you want the people of africa to also be liberated because you were literally fighting for that
767.18,771.6, on their side you're probably also having to give away a lot of your land because you're coming from
771.6,774.8, a privileged background a lot of your wealth because you're coming from a privileged background
774.8,780.16, because colonialism benefited you that you're now in the government this means that the same
780.16,785.84, amount of power has to be taken away we tell you that we then win on being able to achieve the
785.84,790.32, rights more sustainability sustainably which i'll explain more in our second argument i'll flag out
790.32,794.96, when i'm telling you this analysis first argument then we shall be clashing with our second argument
794.96,799.92, about how the rights of civil and political rights are really principally important we tell you that
799.92,804.24, civil influence are inherent to someone's dignity and self-determination and thus must be prioritized
804.24,808.26, this means that people need to be able to decide for themselves about their life choices. This
808.26,812.18," cannot be done when rights are literally being denied to you. When you have like no rights,"
812.42,816.28, someone can always make choices instead of you. Someone can always control your life. Someone can
816.28,820.9, always decide when and what you're allowed to say. Even if the actor making decisions is completely
820.9,824.88," benevolent, you're never seen as a free and worthy individual. Notice that then on proposition,"
828.7,832.66," even if you have material freedoms, you're never free because freedom of non-interference has to come before material rights otherwise regardless of whether you have"
832.66,838.12, ten dollars on proposition or like if you cannot control how you spend it if you cannot unionize
838.12,842.14, to get more than ten dollars if you cannot decide whether something is more important to you than
842.14,848.24, getting those ten dollars you this right is equally like less important because it doesn't allow you to access all of the rights that you
848.24,852.56, would actually need it just assumes that you want those ten dollars it doesn't really matter what
852.56,857.68, you are accounted for this means that proposition inherently keeps people of africa dehumanized
857.68,861.68, because they're always seen as incapable individuals of making decisions for themselves
861.68,869.08, like they were during colonialism when they were literally enslaved they had no control over the land they had no control to war confrontations etc this
869.08,873.94, means that specifically in this context people of africa deserve and need to be given their dignity
873.94,878.58, back they were stripped off of it by oppressive european leaders were the only ones giving it
878.58,883.08, back to them on the second argument i'll be engaging with more props material notice that
883.08,893.0, from proposition like on opposition political and political rights and rule of law are crucial for a state accountability and proposition doesn't really have that increasing accountability happens on
893.0,908.84," two levels on our side. One to political rights. Notice that this is especially important to keep government politically accountable because they don't always add benevolently, and you don't always have the best intention in mind. Notice that this debate is happening in context of post-colonial society. There is a lack of trust between ethnic groups."
909.08,913.68," The one in power was probably privileged during colonialism and other powers, other ethnic groups"
913.68,918.16, are largely going to mistrust this. This incentivizes the people that are in power to act
918.16,922.64, in a not benevolent way because they want to keep those powers which proposition already characterizes.
923.02,928.56, So but even if you act benevolently and have incentive to do so you're not necessarily always acting in the best interest
928.56,932.56, of the people because you don't necessarily know what the people on the ground want and need so
932.56,937.28, it's crucial to keep the government in check political rights are then political rights that
937.28,941.88, do do this by directly allowing people to participate in the political life of the country
941.88,948.34," this means you can go out and vote for the representative that best represents you. This means you have freedom of speech, you can criticize the"
948.34,954.2," government, but it doesn't give you the needs that you need. You also can go out and protest,"
954.46,958.5, you can show the satisfaction with all the things that the government is doing wrong. This means
958.5,962.88," that only on our side, you show the government what you want, you can hold it accountable when"
962.88,968.48," it doesn't do that. But secondly, also to to the rule of law in societies where there are already big disparities between the rich and"
968.48,972.88, poor the rich who want to benefit further and they want to entrench their power into the system or to
972.88,977.28, get more wealth and more land this is crucially important for the countries to focus on the rule
977.28,981.92, of law rural thought gives the basis for rights being protected meaning that laws are applied as
981.92,987.54, equally as possible for everyone this means that someone cannot just come on your land and take it away from you because
987.54,988.92, it is your right to property.
988.92,993.6," And even if they do so, even if they seize your land, your injustices have to be fixed"
993.6,995.76, because you can go to court and complain about it.
995.76,998.72, We have three impacts of all of this analysis that I just told you.
998.72,1002.48," One, government policies are more likely to be representative of what the people need"
1002.48,1007.76, and want because they're able to express their needs to political rights so even if proposition gives them some good things we're
1007.76,1011.68, able to give them more good things because we give them what they want secondly everyone can demand
1011.68,1015.68, the same benefits from the state so because your rights are codified on our side you can demand
1015.68,1020.24, your rights being fulfilled to the same extent as the rights of other individuals even in proposition
1020.24,1024.0, wealth gets distributed to a few individuals in the country on our side all individuals have the
1024.0,1032.0," right to demand it but thirdly proposition doesn't necessarily get good land reparations and economic reparations, because it don't pay your day civil and political rights."
1032.0,1039.0," Firstly, we think the government will not redistribute land and economic reparations evenly, because one I already showed you how there's a lack of trust."
1039.0,1042.0, You're probably likely to prioritize the people that are going to keep you in power.
1042.0,1068.96," But secondly, you're probably also going to reward the army that literally helped you get in power and help you to the liberation movement, staying in power. This means that the poor people in the country, for all the people are getting the land people will be like taking away the land from the more powerful actors on proposition because this happened in zimbabwe"
1068.96,1074.0, for example when a retired army general that had a lot of power violently took over the alamain
1074.0,1078.8, park consisting of 5 000 hectares of land previously that was redistributed to the people
1078.8,1083.2, on our side of the house those people would have the power to go to courts and say that their rights
1083.2,1085.1, are being validated and get back the land.
1085.1,1086.56, This is impossible proposition.
1086.56,1088.04, This is why it's far more important
1088.04,1090.14, to firstly give the people civil and political rights
1090.14,1092.24," than maybe focus on economic land reparations,"
1092.24,1132.8," Proud to oppose. you All right, thank you very much for that speech."
1132.8,1136.68, We now go back to the proposition for the second prop speaker.
1136.68,1138.36, Good luck.
1138.36,1140.76, Thank you.
1140.76,1141.76, Our camera.
1141.76,1142.76," Okay, there we go."
1142.76,1145.94," Our camera had temporarily disconnected, but it looks like it's back on now."
1164.8,1176.6," Is it picking that I'm audible? In which case, starting the speech in 3, 2, 1."
1176.6,1181.62," This debate burdens us with a comparison of post-colonial states as they are, not a side"
1181.62,1183.18, opposition wants them to be.
1183.18,1186.08, A status quo where only three out of 54
1186.08,1191.44, african states has a functioning democracy so any bit of material they bring you about a perfect
1191.44,1196.56, function and constitution that industry and institutions like supreme courts which are
1196.56,1201.36, always going to preserve their rights are a fantasy they need to deal with the debate as it
1201.36,1209.52, is a world in which when these colonial powers withdraw they leave these countries with nothing they leave people with institutions that are broken and they allow
1209.52,1215.04, individuals with power to take hold what we do is we take the most vulnerable in society those
1215.04,1219.92, who cannot even feed themselves as they go to bed at night and we get their lives to be better we
1219.92,1231.36," make them happier neither side can claim a utopian benefit, but side proposition can improve lives, we propose. Two questions before a substantive contribution. Firstly, which side"
1231.36,1235.7," is most important, dealing with their principle? And secondly, which side is better able to achieve"
1235.7,1240.26," and secure rights? On the fur, which type of rights are most important? They make one big"
1240.26,1245.14," claim here, which is to say that rights are things inherent to their dignity. But note that"
1245.14,1249.16, underlying every piece of rhetoric they give you is simply an assertion that what people need is
1249.16,1254.64, agency. We would tell you crucially that economic rights are linked to agency in just the same way.
1254.84,1259.64," That is to say, it is restricting your agency when you cannot buy food to feed yourself. It"
1259.64,1264.0, is restriction of your agency when you don't have enough money to send your child to school. All of
1264.0,1267.76, those things limit your ability to exist like a normal person in society.
1267.76,1271.66, There's an unfair characterization to say that economic rights don't in the same way
1271.66,1274.8, restrict people's ability to exist in normal society.
1274.8,1275.8, What do you know then?
1275.8,1279.52, You know that dignity and reparation can come from economic rights too.
1279.52,1284.14," So this debate is not about one where each side is more principled, it's which side can"
1284.14,1285.1, actively improve
1285.1,1289.0, the lives of these individuals. That is what you need to weigh in this debate. Which takes me to
1289.0,1293.62," the second question, which side is better able to achieve and secure rights? The first claim they"
1293.62,1298.96," make is about the accountability of these states. Two big responses. First, it is important to note"
1298.96,1304.18," that neither side can change the behaviors of the most dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side,"
1304.18,1305.04," no matter which direction you can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side, no matter which direction you"
1305.04,1309.28," can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like Mugabe in the types of policy directions"
1309.28,1312.96," they take. It doesn't matter which thing he prioritized, it was always going to be most"
1312.96,1316.8," dictatorial, you're never going to hold him accountable. So what you need to deal with then"
1316.8,1321.28," are those in the middle, those with a level of altruism. What do they tell you? First, that you"
1321.28,1328.74," have a right to protest and a right to freedom of speech, and that mechanism through which you hold them accountable first we reject that you were able to achieve"
1328.74,1332.6, these rights in and of themselves that is to say note how much rhetoric and time they spend on
1332.6,1336.82, proving how this can like improve the lives of these individuals but no time proving how these
1336.82,1340.88, institutions actually enable these people who have these rights we would tell you through every piece
1340.88,1348.72, of material at toby the fact that individuals see this as an attack on their power because now these individuals can go out and treat and protest them is why they are
1348.72,1353.2, likely to never give these individuals what they need and what they deserve but secondly and
1353.2,1358.4, crucially even if you can claim freedom of speech or right to assembly we tell you that you're if
1358.4,1363.28, you like need to focus on working 16 hour days in order to get food on the table if you don't have
1363.28,1369.3, the ability to protest because you can't read or because you're just like in a rural area that is not interacted with the
1369.3,1374.46, state you're not able to be successful in that way finally then on the claim about fairness they tell
1374.46,1380.04, you that a minority gains a sense of power three key responses firstly as I mentioned before it
1380.04,1384.66, is important framing that a dictatorial state states neither side can change this but those
1384.66,1389.52," in which you can we ask you to be imaginative. That is, obviously, firstly, and it's the piece of framing"
1389.52,1393.32," we gave you earlier, it's less than an attack on an individual's power when you're likely to give"
1393.32,1396.66," them economic rights, sort of less likely that you just give it to your ethnic minority then."
1396.9,1401.48," But secondly, you need to think of the long term, which is to say, if it is true that some"
1401.48,1405.66," dictators are likely to prioritize some individuals within society and push up their minorities,"
1406.06,1412.52, it is crucial to know that our side only needs one good person with some level of altruism willing to do a good policy.
1412.7,1418.96," They need to deal with the fact that they need multiple dictators or multiple governments in succession to preserve things like constitutions,"
1418.96,1423.44," to preserve things like democratic rights, be unwilling to repeal everything that has been done previously."
1423.8,1429.12, So if they want to make this debate about which side gets the greatest best people in power in terms of like fairness and
1429.12,1433.56, things like that they have to deal with the side that is just more likely under their world that
1433.56,1437.16, is the status quo because they have to deal with multiple individuals coming into power and being
1437.16,1442.44, willing to repeal things like that but even if it is symmetrical even if it is unfair why do we still
1442.44,1445.44, win this debate first because giving a minority economic
1445.44,1449.46," rights is still a benefit at the point at which it keeps society running. That is to say, if you"
1449.46,1453.76," give a minority of individuals, an ethnic minority, for example, the ability to vote, that doesn't"
1453.76,1459.96," necessarily impact the ability of other people to exist in society. But if you give people money,"
1460.24,1464.46," it keeps the economy running in an important way. But second, we will tell you that economic rights"
1464.46,1465.14, to these individuals
1465.14,1466.46," makes their lives better,"
1466.64,1469.28, but doesn't empower them to actively make the lives of others worse.
1469.46,1471.68," Which is to say, when you give people the right to vote"
1471.68,1473.84," and only give that to a specific group of people,"
1474.08,1477.84, they are able to push for policy which actively discriminates against a certain group.
1478.06,1481.52," Which means in their worlds, what they have to deal with is where a dictator may be unfair,"
1481.8,1484.88," may only give the right to vote to a certain number of group of people,"
1484.94,1487.36, and they're able to weaponize that to cause the most harm.
1487.44,1489.48, What do you know then at the end of this practical clash?
1489.8,1492.74," Firstly, that we actively better these individuals' lives."
1493.06,1495.42, We make them more able to feed themselves.
1495.58,1497.58, We make them better able to feed their families.
1497.86,1499.9, We make them able to enjoy life more.
1500.1,1501.34, That is crucial in that way.
1501.34,1508.32, Any rhetorical example they give you where they haven't done the mechanization to prove why they actually get these changes before i get onto my one point of
1508.32,1513.28, substantive i'll take a poi if there is one minorities on your side can always be unlawfully
1513.28,1517.52, detained can always be taken from their land and taken away from your family on our side we
1517.52,1521.44, protect that they can fight for their rights through democratic and civil institutions
1522.56,1526.64, no we reject that premise something it's like saying now you have the right to
1526.64,1531.2, protest doesn't actually mean that the states can't just come in and save you if the institutions are
1531.2,1535.44, against you and if the government is against you right like obviously like it's nice rhetoric but
1535.44,1540.08, it doesn't actually equate to change point to the status quo where dictatorial states literally are
1540.08,1544.08, just going into communities and ripping people out even though they have a veneer of legitimacy
1544.08,1548.4, and the veneer of democracy just because you say it's democratic doesn't mean it is you have to
1548.4,1552.72, deal with the nature of this world that is the status quo one point of substantive where economic
1552.72,1557.52, and land preparation reparations rather were necessary to prevent state failure empirically
1557.52,1561.6, we know that these nations do experience enormous instability in the aftermath of
1561.6,1569.76," colonial withdrawal it brings conflict it brings poverty it brings devastation. Three key ways in which economic rights represent instability. First,"
1569.76,1574.16," they stabilize tensions between competing ethnic groups. That is, in the aftermath of colonial"
1574.16,1578.64," withdrawal, ethnic tensions emerge as different groups attempt to control political power."
1578.64,1582.64," What does the competition look like? It looks like the rise of populist and racist leaders,"
1582.64,1587.82, those who bring about an us versus them mentality mentality which in and of itself brings instability and brings division.
1587.82,1592.0, These leaders capitalise on existing economic disparity between groups to support their
1592.0,1596.48," cause, that is, observing how a colonial regime has benefited some groups more than others"
1596.48,1599.12, and how post-colonial structures have failed to fix these problems.
1599.12,1601.12, How do we stop this competition?
1601.12,1608.72," First, observe that this competition stems from a watch to solidify economic prosperity for themselves and their communities. We pre-empt this competition from"
1608.72,1613.92," existing at all by granting economic rights to all, decreasing perceived inequality and hatred."
1613.92,1618.96," But second, we just limit economic inequality. You can't foster hatred surrounding post-colonial"
1618.96,1623.2, systems if they give money to everybody. You can't manipulate democracy if you have the power that
1623.2,1628.74," you have to manipulate because of your economic prosperity is lessened. Secondly, though, we tell you that economic rights"
1628.74,1633.86," foster strong narratives about independence. That is, colonial society acted like wealth extractors."
1633.98,1638.42," In their departure, what emerged was a sentiment and a fight for independence, which had underpinned"
1638.42,1642.5, the demands to reduce poverty and famine that had ravaged the continent. Point to the independent
1642.5,1648.42, movement which emerged in Mozambique. What does this mean? It is crucial that these states deliver on these economic promises
1648.42,1653.2, to prove their legitimacy to these populations. Regardless of any benefit that practical
1653.2,1658.0," benefit the side opposition can point to, populations can be easily galvanized into"
1658.0,1662.76," riots and violent revolutions against yet another failing system of government, yet another"
1662.76,1665.38, post-colonial structure which doesn't get them what they want.
1665.38,1667.78," At the end of the speech, we improved people's lives."
1667.78,1669.5," We dealt with the status quo like it is,"
1669.5,1670.76," not like we would want it to be,"
1670.76,1699.04," so incredibly proud to propose. All right, thank you very much for that speech."
1699.04,1727.0," We now go back to the opposition for the second opposition speech Hi, am I audible?"
1727.0,1770.48," Okay, just a second that I set up my timer and everything. 2, 1, at the point of which the government has every reason to just shoot you out in the street because you have no rights a piece of land does not help you before i move on to our constructive uh constructive point a couple of points on fiat principle accountability and lastly ponder last argument"
1771.04,1777.04, firstly they told us that we cannot claim a perfect democracy that we have a limited resources
1777.04,1782.0, and yes we agree you have some political capital and this is weak on either side of the house
1782.0,1790.0, however with that political capital according to the fiat we can claim that we can ensure some rights even if this is a weak democracy we would
1790.0,1795.68, rather have a weak democracy than no democracy at all okay to continue now on to their last point
1795.68,1799.92, that they brought up about state failure i would like to point out that a lot of this argument is
1799.92,1804.0, also going to be clashing with my constructive material which i'll be flagging up they told us
1804.0,1809.4," that the only way to stabilize tension in this in this state is by giving everyone economic rights,"
1809.44,1815.34," by giving everyone equal opportunities. However, we would like to point out that even in our first"
1815.34,1821.5," speech, we already told you three constructive reasons why this is unlikely to happen. Because"
1821.5,1825.44," firstly, as we told you, these people in power are afraid of others"
1825.44,1829.36, afraid of other ethnicities second of all because they want to stay in power and lastly because they
1829.36,1835.28, have an incentive to give more and more resources to their own ethnicity so we told tell you that
1835.28,1841.04, it's unlikely and even impossible to achieve this perception that the other ethnicity is going to
1841.04,1849.48, is going to be equal to you with just giving them land why because you're not going to give them land equally they're not you're not going to prioritize their well-being as
1849.48,1854.28, equally as prioritize the well-being of your own ethnicity we're talking about the people in power
1854.28,1859.32, here so what is there going to happen here the perception of inferior race is even is it's going
1859.32,1863.52, to stay so even if we take them at their best and say okay maybe they're going to get some land
1863.52,1868.64, what's going to happen then because you don't have property rights by the way this was an insertion made in their first
1868.64,1874.56, speech after we we asked them in a poi how do you sustain these rights look it's still a lot more
1874.56,1878.56, likely that someone's going to come and take your land away this is especially relevant for
1878.56,1882.64, minorities who are still going to be hated on their side of the house why are they going to be
1882.64,1888.4, hated well because you never change the perception that they're not the inferior group in this in this country rather that they're all
1888.4,1892.56, equal and how do you do that you do that by institution institutionalizing all rights you
1892.56,1898.0, do that with ops case okay to continue on to some rebuilding on prophecy on the principle we tell
1898.0,1902.8, you that the principle the the examples that they gave to you like how it's more important that you
1902.8,1908.58, get to go to school how star come on being is more important. We tell you that all of these things that they tried to claim
1908.58,1913.12, is completely dependent on the benevolence of their government. This is why we believe that
1913.12,1916.78," this principle is much more important, even if we take them at their best and say, okay,"
1916.8,1921.54," maybe the government is going to be benevolent. Still, we tell you that these people need the"
1921.54,1925.36, access to self-determination. These people need to be able to decide what they
1925.36,1930.88, want to do in their what they want to do for themselves they need to be finally be able to
1930.88,1936.48, have the control because notice we're putting this into post-colonialistic context these are the
1936.48,1941.2, people that have been for centuries told they're the inferior race we tell you that it's much more
1941.2,1946.32," important to be humanized to be, to have your humanity codified,"
1946.32,1950.88," than having a piece of land. Okay, but then secondly then, upon accountability and upon"
1951.52,1956.08," how we're not able to achieve this, we tell you that the side proposition is being very"
1956.08,1960.72, paternalistic at the point of which they tell you that these poor people cannot change their own
1963.28,1967.84, situation. We tell you that this is very uncomparative and it's also not put
1967.84,1973.76," in the real world. Look, we tell you that poor people are very capable of changing their own"
1973.76,1978.88," country, they're capable of unionizing, we have a lot of examples of that, they're capable of putting"
1978.88,1983.52," major mass protests, they're capable to vote in the people that they themselves like, and with that"
1983.52,1989.92," they're capable to also change their country, they're capable of bettering their situation but before i move on"
1989.92,1995.68, to additional points i can take you even if you want to take your principle to a vacuum
1995.68,1999.36, why isn't your right not to starve just as important as your right to freedom of speech
2001.12,2006.34, because we tell you that this is not what this principle is about. We tell you that
2006.34,2010.78," the principle is about you being able to be humanized, about you being the human, you"
2010.78,2016.4, being very equal as every other citizen. We tell you also additionally that the fact that
2016.4,2020.32, you're starving is contingent on you proving this is going to be something that you will
2020.32,2024.56," be tackling on your case. We tell you that this is very unlikely because once again,"
2024.56,2028.56, the sustainability of these rights on your side of the house was assertion you gave us no
2028.56,2033.44, mechanization how exactly these these uh these rights are going to be sustained additionally we
2033.44,2038.96, would like to prove you we would like to point out the comparison here what is more important even
2038.96,2043.28, if you take them at their best and say these reparations are going to be happening look
2043.28,2050.16, what at which point are you going to be just shot out in the street? At the point of which the government actually has written out in
2050.16,2054.48," their institution that this is something that they cannot do, or at the point of which there's nothing"
2054.48,2059.44, written out in the institution and everything is contingent on the benevolence. We tell you then
2059.44,2064.88," why we are more likely to improve love on the side of opposition, because we give the people,"
2064.88,2069.72, finally give the people the power to decide for themselves what they want but continue then
2069.72,2074.94, onto our constructive the prioritization is very important because we ensure protection on
2074.94,2080.24, individual and collective manner look at the point of which as already proven out in the first speech
2080.24,2084.9, and in the negation you're far less likely to be discriminated on grounds such as national origin
2084.9,2087.0," social class and things like that this means that the government're far less likely to be discriminated on grounds such as national origin, social class, and things like that."
2087.0,2095.0," This means that the government is much less likely to take you and the thing you for whatever, which, for example, happened in the absence of this rights in Ghana in 1,958."
2095.0,2098.0, This is a country that did not prioritize civil and political rights.
2098.0,2106.0, They they have a preventive preventive detention bill which was used to essentially silence opposition and
2106.0,2107.64, silence the critics that they didn't like.
2107.64,2110.92," And in 1965, over 2000 people were in detention."
2110.92,2115.34," We tell you that when the side opposition, this is much less likely to happen simply"
2115.34,2119.68," because you have things like that prevented in the institution, even if this is a weak"
2119.68,2120.68, democracy.
2120.68,2134.0," Additionally, the second point here under the protection on an individual level, you have, you are protected from the intervention of other citizens, as we already told you, there's no insurance of property rights and in the absence of this, nothing official"
2134.0,2146.88," eventually prevents the neighbor or any other person who's more powerful for example, a person with a gun to get to your house to get your property, and just take it away from you. We tell you that it's very important that we institutionalize this."
2146.96,2151.62," And this is especially important in the context of these reparations, because look, these"
2151.62,2155.44," reparations, as we tell you, in their best case scenario, is going to be helping only the"
2155.44,2157.22, middle class and the upper class.
2157.24,2161.38, Why? The weakers are still going to be at loss simply because these weak people are still
2161.38,2166.22," going to be the weakest and they have no protection from the state to ensure that they have these rights,"
2166.22,2168.3, to ensure that they still have the piece of land
2168.3,2169.58, that the government gives to them.
2169.58,2172.08," So we tell you that in best case scenario,"
2172.08,2177.08," if we ignore all of the analysis that we've given to you,"
2178.52,2180.98," that these things are not going to be carried out properly,"
2180.98,2181.82, we still win.
2181.82,2183.54," But secondly then, on the collective manner,"
2183.54,2189.56, it's very important that we give them a mechanism of collectively fighting for justice against most powerful
2189.56,2195.4," actors. Look, the site proposition gives these people the ability to form unions, ability to"
2195.4,2200.22, form associations. We give them the ability to demand improvement without being at risk for being
2200.22,2204.66," shot out on the street. And this is exactly what sets us apart from the previous system. Look,"
2204.7,2208.96, the comparative here is that the change on site opposition happens because we can it can because
2208.96,2213.6, we give them the ability to do so whereas on the side proposition the change is contingent on the
2213.6,2218.24, benevolence of the government this is also how we can co-op the site propositions benefits simply
2218.24,2222.48, because we give these people to ability to achieve these reparations because they can't protest
2222.48,2225.84, because they have they can't have reforms because of things like that.
2226.04,2229.44, So the impact here is then the existing power imbalances
2229.44,2230.28, get much smaller.
2230.52,2232.04," But lastly, on the point of minorities,"
2232.26,2233.36, this is especially detrimental.
2233.6,2236.08, We already told you that these countries are not homogenous
2236.08,2238.72, and that the dominant ethnic group still has the incentives
2238.72,2241.64, to deprioritize the other ethnic minorities.
2241.98,2243.14," Look, they'll be the most harassed,"
2243.18,2248.88," they'll be the most disrespected and the most discriminated. And look, reparations are only going to further"
2248.88,2253.6," this world gap. So what we do here, we give them the ability to go to court, to unionize,"
2253.6,2256.96," and we close this discrepancy gap. So because we help the weakest people,"
2256.96,2290.5," because we actually humanize people, that is why you vote side opposition. Thank you very much for that speech and now we return to the proposition for the"
2290.5,2291.5, third prop speech.
2291.5,2367.0," Good luck. you Assuming that everybody can hear me, I say what you want and then respect it. Because all of that pretty weighing and rhetoric doesn't make sense"
2367.0,2370.28, considering that false dichotomy and choice they prove to you.
2370.64,2375.04," We say that the cases like absolutely insane despotic leaders,"
2375.12,2379.84," which is all Team Slovenia's case deals with, are outside the scope of this debate"
2380.0,2384.0," because in either world, they would not be the actors who are making this decision"
2384.16,2392.0, about whether to prioritize democracy or land rights. Therefore this debate is one on the marginal grounds of how
2392.0,2397.12, these leaders would act assuming that they had the capacity to do this choice and assuming they're
2397.12,2402.4, not shooting people in the head. I'm going to ask three questions in this speech. The first is a
2402.4,2405.06, question of fear and setting up what this world
2405.06,2410.66," looks like, what the choices the actors get under our side and their side truly are. Secondly,"
2411.12,2415.58," I'm going to deal with the principle, which is far too contentious on Team Slovenia's side,"
2415.8,2420.28," even in the abstract. And thirdly, I'm going to bring you some practical material about how we"
2420.28,2425.28, are the only side that provides an immediate benefit to people who are suffering massively in
2425.28,2432.08, the status quo on the first question of fiat four things to note here first of all this debate is
2432.08,2437.12, equating different forms of capital that is to say if you believe this government is going to either
2437.12,2442.08, do things like make like a start make a constitution we would be directing any capital
2442.08,2449.94," that we think that would translate to on a monetary basis into action that would directly benefit people. That means on a baseline, you have to believe"
2449.94,2454.82," that we are starting with more immediate economic action, immediate economic action that goes to"
2454.82,2460.52," people. Second of all, in regards to prioritization, it is not fair for Slovenia to say that we get"
2460.52,2465.12," democratic rights and economic rights, but you can't even make a land court like in the first"
2465.12,2470.16, place we think because the fact this is a prioritized debate we are able to do things like
2470.16,2473.44, assume that these leaders aren't going to immediately take the land right away because
2473.44,2478.96, of the characterization Slovenia brings you third of all we think they're still like countries can't
2478.96,2482.88, access these resources in the first place obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do
2482.88,2488.72, not believe that's in fear some many countries do have vast natural resources in the first place. Obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do not believe that's unfair. Some many countries do have vast natural resources in the fourth place and last of all to
2488.72,2494.0, the extent in which we're talking about nations in these like status quo the opposite has to deal
2494.0,2498.4, with this. This is not a speculative debate on their behalf it is a debate looking into the past
2498.4,2503.44, which means that is the ground on which this debate is won. Therefore what we do have to contend with
2503.44,2505.42, is the actuality of the status quo
2505.42,2510.66," of what these countries look like. Because according to global reports, three countries"
2510.66,2516.38, in Africa have functioning liberal democracy. That is a whopping statistic considering the
2516.38,2521.5," accountability they tell you is likely to work. So on this question of accountability, we hear"
2521.5,2529.46," from Slovenia, you can codify rights, ensure the judiciary, and build institutions. Once again, as I'm going to tell you, most of these democracies are likely"
2529.46,2534.52, to be imperfect. This fiat does not assume they can make a beautiful status quo. That means these
2534.52,2538.48, democracies are susceptible to things like lobbying. They are susceptible to people who
2538.48,2543.24," are privileged, having massive control, and they are susceptible to falls, which is where all of"
2543.24,2545.0, our second speaker substantive takes into place.
2545.0,2549.0," Second of all, we would tell you voting is not the only means of accountability,"
2549.0,2554.0," because obviously, to the extent in which these are semi-liberal states are making this way up in their own heads,"
2554.0,2558.0, they are likely to be to some extent receptive to the needs of their public.
2558.0,2565.28, This means insane leaders like Mugabe are out. What we are dealing with is leaders who perhaps do want to appease their populations
2565.28,2570.0, therefore when they tell you about things like we get no democracy and institutions that doesn't
2570.0,2574.88, fall we get a degree of accountability so do they the point is that we are not willing to trade that
2574.88,2580.4, off for people's food now moving on to the second question about how the principle works in this
2580.4,2590.6," debate i think it's really important to bring some clarity on what exactly the world is, because this is a question of unionizing and those kind of goals in the first place. This is a world"
2590.6,2595.7, where many colonial leaders had systems of indirect rule. They moved people onto different
2595.7,2600.82, land. They put them to the least terrible sections of the population where they knew they could not
2600.82,2607.1, farm the land in a sustainable way. They were physically removed from having any ability to thrive.
2607.1,2608.82, And that's incredibly important
2608.82,2610.32, because it's not enough to say
2610.32,2613.44, that these lofty and speculative ideals of democracy
2613.44,2614.88," are meaningful to people,"
2614.88,2617.46, noting that all their analysis essentially proves
2617.46,2619.16, that democracy is a good means
2619.16,2621.36," of getting to an end goal in the first place,"
2621.36,2623.64, assuming it is on the point of agency.
2623.64,2625.36, We would also tell you that all
2625.36,2630.24, the analysis about your being in the past you've been stripped by european leaders really falls
2630.24,2635.44, down when you consider how history functions because yeah rhodesia was normally a democracy
2635.44,2640.64, many people in these african states are really untrusting of democracies in the first place with
2640.64,2645.14," good reason that means all of our analysis that, oh, you know, we need democracy,"
2645.26,2650.96, it is a good system. Democracy is the first and only economic political system that exists.
2651.24,2656.7," We think before democracy, pre-colonial states had systems of consensus, their own structures,"
2656.7,2661.4," people are far more likely to buy into. So at the point in which you think democracy is a good,"
2661.62,2669.2, it is unclear whether that is a good that would be appreciated in the context of this debate considering the historical legacy that we're talking about and lastly if
2669.2,2673.76, side lobenia wants to talk about political vacuums i think in the abstract being alive is more
2673.76,2678.16, important than having the right to say what you want at the end of that you know that side
2678.16,2682.8, australia wins this debate just on principal grounds alone because we are not forcing this
2682.8,2685.76, system upon um post-colonial african states
2685.76,2690.72, a system which although tries to profess to give them agency truly does not in the vast majority
2690.72,2695.76, of cases as i'm going to elaborate on now so on this the first thing i'm going to establish is
2695.76,2701.68, why their economic policies fail because that is the only tangible and concrete benefit they bring
2701.68,2705.46, in this debate three reasons first of all you have to believe at the
2705.46,2710.2, very least there is a trade-off that is happening we think that at least in the short term you have
2710.2,2715.54, to buy the weird side that will give people cash transfers or they don't that looks like people not
2715.54,2721.54, starving I think that's pretty important when Malawi in 2002 literally had a famine sweep
2721.54,2726.12," across the country they couldn't eat democracy they they were starving. Before I move on, I'll take a point of affirmation."
2728.28,2732.72," On your side, this is all. You're constantly speculating what the people want and the people"
2732.72,2736.5," need. If the people on the country on your side are not going to actually get food,"
2736.5,2740.94," if the people on your side actually need more benefits first, we're actually decided and"
2740.94,2743.82, guaranteeing that African people can determine what they want for themselves.
2744.66,2748.48, The point is that assumes that this will be implemented in the fullest way possible.
2748.48,2753.44," Given the way we tell you that these rights are entirely codependent, at the point in which we"
2753.44,2757.44," prove at the very least that they are not implemented perfectly, that is automatically"
2757.44,2761.04," a loss for you. Because money in the hands of people, whether or not they are the poorest"
2761.04,2765.54," people, if those people are not starving, we win. If those people are starving,"
2765.54,2767.88, then we win the debate even by a bigger margin.
2767.88,2768.76," Then moving on,"
2768.76,2771.96, why are the economic policies also likely to fail?
2771.96,2773.36," Because in the event they occur,"
2773.36,2775.46, they're unlikely to turn massive public will
2775.46,2776.76, into something that is effective.
2776.76,2779.3," We'd say at the point in which decolonization was happening,"
2779.3,2781.04, that was a point where the greatest will
2781.04,2782.32, to implement economic things.
2782.32,2783.84," You're not susceptible to lobbies,"
2783.84,2789.68, to interests that are shifting at the point later which democracy is established noting this exists on a time continuum
2789.68,2794.0, first of all we think they lose momentum the uk was perhaps on the board of the lancaster health
2794.0,2798.24, agreement initially when decolonization was happening they're far less likely to do it today
2798.24,2803.36, more on this we say it's far more likely that economic um rights are far more likely to turn
2803.36,2809.12, into political rights this is when we give you from first that is not responded to. That is incredibly important. At the point in
2809.12,2813.52," which you do not have food on the table, being able to vote doesn't matter when that voting"
2813.52,2817.68, system is dominated by elites when you feel like you have no rights in the first place.
2817.68,2822.08," Large economic disparities are the reason democracy breaks down and when democracy breaks down,"
2822.08,2825.0, there is no tangible thing you can cling on to deliver
2825.0,2826.0, benefits to these people.
2826.0,2830.1, Notice once more all the framing I gave you about ethnic tensions means if there are massive
2830.1,2832.1," genocides happening, that is symmetric."
2832.1,2836.32," But in any way, based on our second speaker's substantive, it is far better for us that"
2836.32,2838.32, we try and undermine these tensions in the first place.
2838.32,2844.28," At the end of this speech, you must be realistic because an Africa today is an Africa that"
2844.28,2846.32, traded off their potential to do
2846.32,2852.24, things like cash transfer programs for a desire to institute democracies that have not worked because
2852.24,2898.12," three out of 54 isn't a good statistic. People starving is all the evidence you need, we propose. you All right, thank you very much for that speech and now we go back to the opposition for the"
2898.12,2899.12, op whip.
2899.12,2947.0," Good luck. you Hi, can I get the confirmation that I'm audible and visible?"
2947.0,2992.5," Okay, cool. Let me just set up my papers real quick. Okay. Okay, I will start my speech in 321."
2992.5,2996.08, It's pretty arrogant for side of proposition to claim that they know best what is the like
2996.08,2998.34, the best solution for the African people.
2998.34,3001.96, We believe that the African people should have the ability to control their own lives
3001.96,3005.04, to actually decide what's best for their own existence instead
3005.04,3010.0, of a government or proposition telling them no no no trust me i know better than you that would
3010.0,3015.04, but as if they were told by the colonialists a long time ago firstly let's talk about what's
3015.04,3019.36, more important so which principle secondly on the efficiency and lastly which side actually
3019.36,3023.76, is a better to able improve situation on the long term but firstly let's characterize what is this
3023.76,3027.76, about debate actually about so we tell you on both sides of the house there's an equal political
3029.12,3033.68," capital to do different things. On their side of the house, whole political capital goes into land"
3033.68,3038.88," redistribution. On our side of the house, however, this goes into more political rights, into more"
3039.68,3043.6," in constitution, into more public defenders, into more judges, into more inspectors,"
3043.6,3049.06," and things like that, which we've already claimed right but then we tell you that prop does not understand that they claim that"
3049.06,3054.22, this is not about like like autocratic regimes and like uh and like despotic leaders we tell
3054.22,3058.6, you that yes exactly the site that created the despotic leaders and autocratic regimes on the
3058.6,3062.26, long term is actually the side of proposition at the point in which people have no checks and
3062.26,3067.5, balances but I will further discuss this later on now let's talk about which rides are actually more important right we tell you
3067.5,3070.92, that at the point in which you were told by the colonialists and you were stripped of your human
3070.92,3075.78, dignity you were perceived you were told that you are less than a human being you were worth less
3075.78,3080.94, people were controlling you as if you're if you're like not a full human being that deserves the
3080.94,3089.12, respect we tell you that this is at the point in which you necessarily need to be humanized you need to be to regain the control of your own life you need to get you need to be
3089.12,3094.56, empowered and you need to have the ability to like control and we tell you that's a proposition
3094.56,3098.72, didn't actually engage with our actual argument at the point in which they only tell us yeah but
3098.72,3102.72, this is about freedom of speech no it's not only about freedom of speech it's about the freedom
3102.72,3110.44," of autonomy it's about being able to control your life and not someone else telling you, I know better than you, because you're not capable, and because you cannot make good decisions."
3110.44,3128.44," This is what sort of proposition is doing, they're telling these people that they're not capable of making good decisions for themselves. We believe this is very paternalistic, we believe this is not the right way to go. This is why we tell you that at a point of way, this is like a point of human existence for you to feel in control and for you to feel as if you're worth equally as like your leaders,"
3128.44,3133.6, as like your government and as other people in like around you. And we tell you this is also
3133.6,3137.8," the prerequisite for you to fully get the benefits of economic rights, because it doesn't mean"
3137.8,3142.4, anything to me that I have a lot of land or that I got cash from cash transfers at the point at
3142.4,3148.4, which I will be killed at a protest and to try and to actually get more of these rights or at the point in which someone else will go on my land
3148.4,3152.72, and actually try to steal it from me and i will i will actually end up without all of this land
3152.72,3156.32, they tell us that we never responded to this prerequisite but this is the response that came
3156.32,3161.2, even earlier they tell us no thank you that they added that the economic rights are prerequisite
3161.2,3164.88, for like this civil and political rights we tell you maybe this is the case this is best case for
3164.88,3167.44, them they never actually proved that but we tell you that even if it is a prerequisite for like this civil and political rights we tell you maybe this is the case this is best case for them they never actually prove that but we tell you that even
3167.44,3171.6, if it is a prerequisite for you to exercise political and civil rights they never prove
3171.6,3175.92, to us the likelihood of this actually happening right even if i have like flour in order which
3175.92,3179.44, is a prerequisite for bread this does not necessarily mean that i'm going to make bread
3179.44,3183.12, so they cannot prove that they get civil and political rights on their side of the house
3183.12,3188.08, so we're able to win this clash on the principle and we believe we humanize people and we tell them they're capable on their
3188.08,3192.0, side of the house they still control them and they still tell them they know better secondly
3192.0,3196.32, then let's talk about which side actually gets like it improves the lives of people more we tell
3196.32,3200.8, you that the outside of proposition failed to prove to us why do they get good economic policy right
3200.8,3204.8, maybe they get it maybe they get it immediately never proved on why is government actually so
3204.8,3207.0, benevolent that it will give like equal land to all of them.
3207.0,3214.0," We tell you, firstly, there's likelihood of people actually being killed during the process of rent distribution as happened in Zimbabwe, for example."
3214.0,3222.0," Secondly, we tell you the elites are lucky to get all of this land at the point in which you as the leader of the movement, at the point in which you as a government that has no checks and no democratic checks and balances."
3222.0,3228.56, You have selfish incentive to stay in power and you want to give the money and the land to the people that you trust
3228.56,3233.44, thirdly we tell you that they never responded to all of this then the the money is going to go to
3233.44,3237.04, like the military generals at the point which these are the people that keep you in power as
3237.04,3241.92, a government leader however on our side of the house the mechanism for you as a government leader
3241.92,3248.8, to stay in power is for you to be re-elected so there's a necessity for you to listen to the people this is the mechanism in which you stay in power on
3248.8,3253.28, proposition the mechanism for you to stay in power is to actually be oppressive government and to
3253.28,3258.32, give less power to the people less land to the people less cash transfers to the people but also
3258.32,3264.72, way less rights and actually like backtrack before moving on i can take a poi given the instability
3264.72,3265.84, we've seen in the African
3265.84,3270.9," continent as a legacy of post-colonization is far-reaching, do you think that in the case"
3270.9,3276.32," where both policies fail, is it easier for people to hold on to a constitution or a block of land?"
3276.7,3279.96," We believe on our side of the house, we have way more stability at the point where there's less"
3279.96,3283.66," chaos, at the point at which you're able to go to courts, at the point at which you're able to claim"
3283.66,3285.82," your right. On your side of the house, you might get,"
3285.82,3287.62," or might not get land, you might get the land,"
3287.62,3290.22," this is now I'm going to best case scenario of proposition,"
3290.22,3292.86, even if there's an ideal land distribution
3292.86,3294.84," or cash transfers, there's a high possibility"
3294.84,3296.16," of someone taking it away from you,"
3296.16,3298.28," and you have no ability to claim it back,"
3298.28,3299.4," because you do not have court,"
3299.4,3300.88," you do not have the right to complain,"
3300.88,3302.48, you do not have all of that.
3302.48,3308.52," Secondly, we also tell you best case scenario for prop, these rights can be revoked in the long term. We see this happening in Zimbabwe at the"
3308.52,3313.46, point in which they're taking the land back away from this. And this is why we're able to win this.
3313.68,3317.26," But then lastly, we also tell you that these policies, they never proved to us why are these"
3317.26,3321.14, policies actually going to be good. Because there's no checks and balances. There's no one
3321.14,3329.68, actually asking the people why do they need this or if this is a policy they specifically need if i lack education if i lack hospitals it does not mean a lot to me if i have
3329.68,3333.92, a bit more money on my bank account at the point in which my grandparents are dying because they
3333.92,3338.64, aren't able to access the hospital on our side of the house however we give people on a comparative
3338.64,3343.44, way more ability to express their rights because as stated in the motion dear panel we give people
3343.44,3348.0, the right to vote we give people the right to form associations through which they can actually push and tell the
3348.0,3353.28, government we want hospitals we want cash transfers we want higher wages and things like that
3353.28,3357.76, firstly they're able to express that but secondly they're able to actually push for that on our side
3357.76,3361.28, of the house because at the point in which you have all of these mechanisms that are lacking
3361.28,3366.16," on side of proposition you can vote you can signitions, you can go to referendums and things like that."
3366.16,3369.5, And you can use these mechanisms actually achieve something.
3369.5,3373.3, So there's a leader of your government is the one that you elected and the one that
3373.3,3375.5, actually fulfills your own wants and needs.
3375.5,3379.32," On set of proposition, there's a random government that does not necessarily know best what the"
3379.32,3380.32, people want.
3380.32,3383.86," Secondly, we tell you, you're more likely to unionize and have the ability to unionize"
3383.86,3387.98," at the point at which if you unionize and try to organize your coworkers,"
3387.98,3392.36," you won't be sent to jail on our side of the house because you have these rights written in the Constitution,"
3392.36,3395.88, because this is the first thing that happened after the colonialization.
3395.88,3400.9, You can and you can actually more likely to do that and achieve all of these benefits on our side of the house.
3400.9,3411.0," On your side of the house, you try to unionize and the government sent you to jail, as happened to a lot of activists in the Egypt, for example, when like people were activists were put on the terrorist list right even though they were simply peacefully"
3411.0,3421.0," protesting, or in the worst case scenario on their side of the house, where they want to put they never proved to us how do they get democratic rights on their side of the house, this is the long term impact that I'm talking about."
3421.0,3426.44," So we are able to co-opt a lot of the benefits outside of proposition. However, they never proved to us,"
3426.44,3428.22, why are they able to get this right
3428.22,3429.06, on their side of the house?
3429.06,3430.82," We tell it is very, very unlikely"
3430.82,3432.82, at the point in which government has a lot more power
3432.82,3433.66, on their side of the house
3433.66,3436.16, because they not give political power to the people.
3436.16,3437.48," And they're likely to then,"
3437.48,3438.56, at the point in which you protest
3438.56,3439.78," and the government wants to keep power,"
3439.78,3441.6," it's likely to like shoot you at the protest,"
3441.6,3442.44, which is happening.
3442.44,3444.18, People are dying at the point in which they protest
3444.18,3446.72, in Nigeria.
3446.72,3448.26, And this is what happens on their side.
3448.26,3450.98, So the people are never able to achieve all of these better
3450.98,3451.62, rights.
3451.62,3453.74," But then lastly, let's talk about the worst case"
3453.74,3455.46, scenario for both sides of the house.
3455.46,3459.5," Their worst case is actually maybe getting some like,"
3459.5,3462.44, is actually sliding back into an autocratic regime
3462.44,3464.44, at a point at which people aren't able to hold you
3464.44,3468.24," accountable as a government. So on their side of the house, they have a lot of violence and an autocratic regime at the point at which people aren't able to hold you accountable as a government so on their side of the house they have a lot of like they have a"
3468.24,3472.88, lot of violence and an oppressive regime however on our side of the house maybe our worst case is
3472.88,3476.96, that maybe we do not get a lot of these economic benefits but at least we have some democratic
3476.96,3480.24, rights so at least people are not being killed at the point in which they go on the streets
3480.24,3513.84," because we're able to win even on our worst case scenario i'm so proud to propose All right, thank you very much for that speech and now we stay with the opposition for the"
3513.84,3515.48, first reply speech of the debate.
3515.48,3548.0, Good luck. Proposition kept using the rhetoric that colonialists kept using against the people of Africa.
3548.0,3553.72," They tell them, we know best, we know what's the best thing for you, you should not have the right to decide what you need."
3553.96,3558.96," We uniquely give the people of Africa humanization, we tell them they can decide what they need,"
3559.14,3563.0," even if this is not perfect at the start, we're able to give them this right to be improved."
3563.36,3565.64," Firstly, we're already clearly winning on the"
3565.64,3567.72," those rights are the most important thing, because they"
3567.72,3570.08," never managed to tackle our principle, they just tell you"
3570.08,3572.36, that our principle is not important. Our principle is
3572.36,3574.62," crucial, because we tell you that we give the people of"
3574.62,3577.52, Africa the right to decide how they're going to control their
3577.52,3580.64, life. So even if proposition proves to you that cash
3580.64,3582.88," transfers are going to be perfect, all the people are"
3582.88,3589.12," going to get them, we're unsure as to why people on their side have the right to use this cash in the right way chose to get this cash"
3589.12,3594.32, instead of investing it to a local hospital and chose to actually not and are still why is this
3594.32,3599.2, more important than you not being too able to be taken away this cash when you're unlawfully thrown
3599.2,3604.4, in the detention center tortured from all whatever means the government's one the only response they
3604.4,3609.08, have to all of our claims is that but the prerequisite for civil and political rights is economic
3609.08,3613.04," reparations. This all falls if I prove to you, which was already proven to all of our"
3613.04,3618.5," speeches, that you cannot actually eradicate inequality. That is a prerequisite that they"
3618.5,3623.24, say for achieving better civil and political rights that it shows to you in second speech
3623.24,3625.4, but drop in third entered then let's talk
3625.4,3629.48, about the propositions back to Victory we tell you that the only propositions back to Victory
3629.48,3634.04, is the likelihood analysis of what is actually going to stay true we tell you that they tell
3634.04,3637.94, you like civil political rights we reappeared because governments are not willing to give out
3637.94,3642.74, their power and because democracies are sustainable to lobbying times and times again we have shown to
3642.74,3650.32, you that we're more likely to have accountability in a democratic regime when you're able to have means and checks of the power as compared to
3650.32,3655.02," an autocratic regime on the side of a proposition. This means that on our side of the house, you have"
3655.02,3659.18," a lot of mechanisms to keep the government in check. Voting, criticizing the government,"
3659.18,3669.0," going out to protest, but also forming civil unions, labor union to go against your employee when he's denying you the right to go out and get a higher wage."
3669.0,3673.0," This means that we can achieve far more things for the people, especially those fees that they want."
3673.0,3678.0," Even if those things are weak at the start, we can see that they might be because there's a limited political capital."
3678.0,3683.0, They exist and people are able to improve that and they're more likely then to keep those rights.
3683.0,3689.44," Crucially, it doesn't exist on prop and here's why they lose the debate. One, because this means the satiety of analysis means"
3689.44,3693.04, that the land reparations are going to fail and their entire case falls because of this. The
3693.04,3698.48, prerequisite analysis I mentioned earlier then relies on you being able to achieve economic and
3698.48,3702.88," land reparations first. This does not happen because you're not distributing the land correctly,"
3702.88,3708.48, you're not giving it to the most vulnerable people the government wants to hold in power wants to keep in check and the arson
3708.48,3712.48, is going to give the cash away from themselves they might be giving it to the lead they might
3712.48,3716.0, be giving to the people that are close to them they might be giving it to the party but the most
3716.0,3720.32, vulnerable people are never going to get it so i'm unsure as to why their prerequisite analysis
3720.32,3724.32, actually improves on their side but secondly also about observation they never showed you
3724.32,3725.76, by minorities in the country are actually going never showed you why minorities in the country
3725.76,3727.2," are actually going to get land,"
3727.2,3729.64, why minorities in the country are actually going to be able
3729.64,3731.0, to benefit from their policy.
3731.0,3733.52, It's far more likely that minorities in the country
3733.52,3735.08," benefit from our policies,"
3735.08,3737.12," because even if the constitution is weak,"
3737.12,3740.04," even if the democracy and democratic institutions are weak,"
3740.04,3742.0, minorities are able to go out and protest.
3742.0,3744.0, It's not a prerequisite that you're not starting
3744.0,3745.16, to go out and protest. People are literally a prerequisite that you're not starting to go out and protest.
3745.16,3747.02, People are literally able to unionize
3747.02,3749.06, in the worst conditions possible
3749.06,3751.18, because they know that they want to improve their conditions.
3751.18,3752.78, We already give you that analysis.
3752.78,3755.4," And lastly, the harm that they do is crucial"
3755.4,3757.46, because the harm that they actually do
3757.46,3759.1, is that the people are not going to be deciding
3759.1,3759.94, on their side.
3759.94,3760.86, This is very important.
3760.86,3762.92," Because one, you are not actually giving the people"
3762.92,3763.76, what they want.
3763.76,3768.88, I'm unsure as to why people would be prioritizing cash transfer in an institution where they don't have roads when
3768.88,3773.74, they don't have like hospitals etc why would they not democratically vote for those things to be
3773.74,3777.8, prioritized i think it's more crucial that people decide what they want but more importantly you're
3777.8,3782.22, not able to equally demand from the government what you're able to achieve because even if on
3782.22,3785.52," their side land gets given to like few people, if on our side,"
3785.52,3787.18," people decide for land reparations,"
3787.18,3789.96, all of the people are able to demand through courts land
3789.96,3791.04, reparations existing.
3791.04,3793.56, This means that we're able to not only give the people what
3793.56,3795.72," they want, improve their situation far worse."
3795.72,3815.58, And this is why you vote for opposition. Thank you very much for that speech.
3815.58,3818.88," And now for the final speech of the debate, we return to the proper plan."
3818.88,3825.0," Good luck. Thanks,"
3825.0,3830.0, everyone.
3830.0,3835.0, Thank you.
3835.0,3840.0, Thank you.
3840.0,3859.18," Thank you. This side affirmative wants to talk about patronizing, but they are clearly the ones"
3859.18,3862.22, that have lost this debate because they're the ones in this debate that are saying that
3862.22,3868.0," the only way Africa can function is from a Western imported liberal democracy, and at the expense of life and starvation,"
3868.2,3869.74, that is what they have to contend with this debate.
3870.02,3871.6, They are the ones who lose on their own principle.
3871.9,3873.48, Three questions I'm going to answer in this speech.
3873.74,3875.94," First, which set of rights is more likely to be sustained?"
3876.3,3878.3," Secondly, who brings the greatest immediate benefit?"
3878.46,3881.32," And finally, do economic reparations lead to political rights?"
3881.58,3883.5," Firstly, which set of rights is likely to be sustained?"
3883.7,3887.88," And I'm starting with this, and it's important, because all of opposition's material are actually contingent"
3887.88,3891.7," on these rights actually being sustained. And note that this notably deals with their principle,"
3891.98,3896.28, because there is no self-determination if democracy does not work. There is no self-determination if
3896.28,3900.2, people starve and they die. They start this off by saying a few red herrings. Their first line
3900.2,3904.32, of attack is that they say that because you have the same power means that it has the same level
3904.32,3908.34," of enforceability. This falls down in three ways. The first thing that we explain at first,"
3908.56,3912.24," it said that it's not just about the power, but it's about the will of the person to actually"
3912.24,3915.94," implement that policy correctly. And to the extent that you were directly giving away power,"
3916.08,3919.72, that is unlikely to be done in a way that's particularly good. We point to the example of
3919.72,3924.64," Uganda, of Kwame Nkrumah, this opposition has not responded to. The second thing that we point out,"
3924.74,3928.46," because that's not just about instituting rights, but it's about people actively engaging with it."
3928.68,3932.04, And to the extent that we point out that this system is one that is seen as particularly
3932.04,3936.18," colonial, because it comes from this Western background, people are unlikely to have the"
3936.18,3940.7, sort of faith that this opposition would require to actually have an effective democracy. The third
3940.7,3944.6, thing that we explain is that notice the extent you have to believe opposition's rights to fail
3944.6,3947.98, is exceptionally low. Because we point out all down the bench that
3947.98,3952.84," failing one right necessitates failing many others, whereas even if they can mitigate some of our"
3952.84,3957.52," benefits in terms of not getting land reparations, still getting cash transfers, that is clearly"
3957.52,3961.42, something that we're still on top of in this debate. All that is to say that the world of
3961.42,3968.48," this opposition is not a functioning democracy. Because we point out it's easy to miscount votes, as we point out it's easy to gerrymander, we point out that there are all"
3968.48,3972.56, these reasons and all these ways that the people in power can skew it and they have the incentive
3972.56,3976.88, to do so meaning that they do not get the democracy they want. The second line of attack is that they
3976.88,3981.52, say what's constituted constitutional but that ignores the fact we give you all these why that
3981.52,3985.2, constitution while it may exist is unlikely to be applied correctly
3985.2,3989.76, the third line of attack is to keep talking about zimbabwe but we know from first this is out of the
3989.76,3994.96, debate because mugabe would not implement either policy under either side successfully which is to
3994.96,3998.48, say that it's symmetric which means that you cannot weigh that the final line of attack is
3998.48,4002.96, say that we implemented poorly because they we lack land force we will know this is a prioritized
4002.96,4008.64, debate perhaps we can have land force but we will prioritize the economic reparations. And that is what this opposition
4008.64,4012.76," has to deal with. So with that in mind, they cannot claim any of their benefits on democracy."
4012.94,4016.34," If they can, they're incredibly marginal. And you have to weigh that up against what I'm about to"
4016.34,4021.04, tell you. So who brings the greatest immediate benefit? And this is crucial because of the 51
4021.04,4024.64," nations in Africa that are not functioning democracies, they're still waiting. They're"
4024.64,4028.8, still starving. And opposition does nothing. Even even taking opposition is the best they have not
4028.8,4032.88, answered why it is worth waiting decades for people to stop starving we point to the fact
4032.88,4037.44, that 1.2 million people have starved in ethiopia and that is the reality and that is what this
4037.44,4042.0, opposition has to defend which they have not the very benefit of humanization is not enough to
4042.0,4045.04, overcome death itself because you cannot feel humanized if you
4045.04,4049.52, are dead you cannot gain that benefit mentally if you're someone who's no longer living because you
4049.52,4053.52, have starved at the end of that that is clearly the greatest way that we win this debate and this
4053.52,4058.56, opposition has no response other to say that maybe in a few years maybe in a few decades we might be
4058.56,4063.36, able to get change we get it right now we save those lives finally do economic reparations lead
4063.36,4068.72," to political rights and notably this allows us to win on this opposition's metric, because we explain that you can only access"
4068.72,4072.54," political rights if you are not starving, because the right to vote means nothing if you're too"
4072.54,4076.4," hungry to lift the ballot paper, because the right to freedom of press means nothing if you're"
4076.4,4080.94, illiterate because you are not given an education because you're incredibly poor. Note that we also
4080.94,4084.94," explain that wealth can be used to influence this sort of political system, and that necessarily"
4084.94,4086.44, means that we're actually able
4086.44,4088.96, to get these changes better than this opposition.
4088.96,4090.62," Not under this opposition,"
4090.62,4091.94, they have not been able to contend
4091.94,4093.8, with their own realistic characterization.
4093.8,4095.56," They say that we are the side shooting people,"
4095.56,4096.6," but that for some reason,"
4096.6,4099.48, they're able to get people to perfectly follow constitutions
4099.48,4101.9, which are written out and fought against their power.
4101.9,4102.98," At the end of this debate,"
4102.98,4105.4, economic reparations are the prerequisite for all benefits.
4105.64,4107.22," Life itself is what is most important,"
4107.52,4109.14, and that's what we defend on side projects.
4124.26,4128.62," All right, thank you very much for that speech and thank you all for the debate."
4128.62,4130.94, I will now end the recording.
