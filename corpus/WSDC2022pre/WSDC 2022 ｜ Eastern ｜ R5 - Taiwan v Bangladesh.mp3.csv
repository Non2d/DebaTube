0.0,11.12," Hello, just to confirm one last time that I'm visible and audible."
12.0,12.48," Yep, you are."
13.62,14.1, Perfect.
15.16,16.68," Again, verbal P.O.I.s."
16.68,23.56," I'll start my speech in 3, 2, 1, go."
24.16,28.8, A doctrine of fairness is a doctrine of truth we propose framing three parts
28.8,33.34, firstly what does the doctrine look like it looks like having a diverse amount of opinions with
33.34,38.1, equal airtime whilst abiding by other current media standards these look like media needs to
38.1,41.68, get political candidates of all sides during debates it looks like interviewing people
41.68,48.88," representing different opinions or using media of different perspectives. Obviously, fact-checking exists on both sides of the house, meaning that"
48.88,54.12," this debate isn't about factual information but about opinion representation. Secondly, this policy"
54.12,58.86, will be moderated by the FCC and other legal bodies. This means that it will be accountable
58.86,63.42, because it will go through democratic check and balances that are subjected to high degrees of
63.42,69.36, scrutiny by other media outlets and lawmakers. implementation involves one in creating a framework that
69.36,74.08, outlines three to five major perspectives per issue that needs to be reported this is sufficient
74.08,78.4, because most issues are narrowed down to a few main camps of solutions anyways for example the
78.4,82.08, refugee crisis can be narrowed down into two main solutions opening or tightening border controls
82.08,88.1," for refugees this also could look like laxing or adding restrictions are the two main solutions, opening or tightening border controls for refugees. This also could look like laxing or adding restrictions as the two main solutions to gun control. Second part of"
88.1,92.04, implementation is that we will fight and take legal actions against channels that fail to
92.04,96.68," implement doctrine. Thirdly, we think that we will also have an appeal system that can be implemented"
96.68,101.68," for certain viewpoints to be implemented retroactively. Third part of framing, presumably,"
101.98,108.86, this debate is about controversial issues. Insofar as it occupies the majority of news headlines and causes the most amount of controversies.
109.22,110.8, We have three arguments to bring to you in this debate.
111.14,113.58," Firstly, why we fulfill the role of media companies."
114.08,117.04," Secondly, why we increase discourse and change human interaction."
117.64,120.96," And thirdly, Sophia and DPM will tell you why we uphold democracy."
121.36,129.84, But now into first arguments and five layers under why we were able to fulfill the role of media companies first point media corporations in this debate definitely have
129.84,135.04, a large audience reach this means the scale of your audience is larger than other media outlets
135.04,139.2, therefore the extent of influence you have and the negative ramifications you cause through
139.2,145.52, a nuanced information is much higher secondly the media the media with significant audience reach have a reciprocal
145.52,151.0," obligation to optimize informational access. Given that they exist successfully today,"
151.36,155.86," due to public and state policy, there is a responsibility to provide a variety of information"
155.86,161.36, means that they internalize information that corresponds best with the world's viewpoints
161.36,166.54," and lived experiences. Thirdly, media corporations are unique actors that people turn to for information,"
166.8,168.48, because people expect news to be trustworthy.
168.94,172.16," This means that news corporations nurture political identity and choice,"
172.4,176.14," because their information influences individual choice and preference,"
176.46,178.82, especially given how frequently people interact with the news.
179.26,183.2," This looks like, if someone is not given the information about how vaccines are made"
183.2,189.44," or the real dangers of COVID, their opinions formed on COVID is probably skeptical, hence illegitimate. This is important"
189.44,194.48," in two-fold. One, information is a prerequisite for a functioning democracy. Without information,"
194.48,199.2," people's capacity to exercise their choice significantly diminishes. Secondly, choice is"
199.2,203.92, a reflection of self-identity. Being able to choose amongst ideas and find out the one that
203.92,205.26, best suits you is the
205.26,210.2," role of the state. But now to the fourth part of this argument. Crucially, news media and the status"
210.2,214.9," quo deprives you of choice, meaning that the fairness doctrine is an important mechanism to"
214.9,219.92, counteract the lack of choice. News media creates a deprivation of choice in three major ways.
220.42,225.38," Firstly, profit incentivizes news corporations corporations means that they deploy sensationalist tactics"
225.38,227.88, to suck you in and continuously watch the news.
227.88,232.62," This means once you opt in, you stay subscribed to the same channel and thus have limited"
232.62,234.5, access to alternate information.
234.5,238.9," Secondly, news companies have perverse incentives to compete against other channels."
238.9,243.0, This means that they will actively demonize other outlets and discourage viewers from
243.0,244.0, searching channels.
244.0,249.42," Thirdly, this form of coercion is long-term because children are born into families with specific ideological"
249.42,254.2," leanings. Fifth part of this argument, how does the fairness doctrine help media companies fulfill"
254.2,260.48," the role? Fairness doctrine mandates an equal and equitable portrayal of the both sides, which means"
260.48,267.8," that consumers have access to differing viewpoints that are not misconstrued. This means that as long as we propose more viewpoints on site proposition,"
268.22,270.68, we fulfill this principle of government argument.
271.34,275.34," This looks like in places where there's more biased ideological leanings,"
275.34,279.28, media corporations are responsible for representing the other political camp.
279.92,289.1," Therefore, this just means that we increase exposure and acknowledgement of the other side's ideals, meaning that we're better able to help individuals construct their own opinions."
289.1,300.6," The implication of this argument is, regardless of the fairness doctrine's practical outcomes, access to information is a principled right, given that it helps individuals know how to act on a day-to-day and maximizes the choice to exercise."
300.82,302.06," Before I move on, I'll take your point."
303.32,310.26," Why do governments have it in their best interest to not abuse the media sphere and turn this into media censorship? Firstly,"
310.74,315.02, we told you already that media censorship is highly unlikely because there is a significant
315.02,319.28," amount of backlash that will happen. Media outlets, if they are shut down for no reason,"
319.28,323.62," will most likely go out and protest. Individuals will most likely protest, right? This debate"
323.62,329.3," probably happens in a sphere where there is actually democracy, otherwise this debate just doesn't exist. Hence,"
329.3,333.98," therefore, the amount of backlash you'll receive as a government for trying to censor material and"
333.98,338.54," do not have a perfect justification means that it is too high of a risk for any government to take,"
338.54,342.8," and even if they do take the risk, it is highly likely that it will have significant consequences."
342.8,346.92," But now to argument two, which is why we increase discourse and change human interactions."
347.4,348.6," The thesis of this argument is,"
348.86,350.38, the implementation of the feminist doctrine
350.38,353.72, counteracts existing polarization and creates less toxic discourse.
354.22,354.68, Three layers.
355.08,356.94," Firstly, how is the news worsening polarization?"
357.5,358.02, Three reasons.
358.32,360.2," One, in the age of social media,"
360.54,362.8, news organizations have to stand up from a sea of information.
363.22,364.94, They have no choice but to sensationalize news
364.94,368.48, and use clickbait titles to attract views and maintain ad revenue.
368.48,372.64, This results in newsroom editors intentionally spreading misinformation to appeal to certain
372.64,377.1," demographic biases, such as poor people are lazy or immigrants are dangerous. Secondly,"
377.1,381.18, the rise of populism around the world post-Trump means that politicians default to mudslinging
381.18,385.1, and demonizing as the most convenient political strategy to gain votes.
389.24,393.74," This new sensationalization feeds into society's political division and treaches legislative paradox. Third reason, media corporations have an incentive to maintain existing viewer bases."
394.12,397.7," Changing political leanings may cause viewers to turn to other channels. Hence, they have an"
397.7,402.56, incentive to not address multiple perspectives and continue to maintain their existing viewer base.
403.24,405.46," Layer two, why does the fairness doctrine solve?"
405.64,406.1, Two reasons.
406.44,409.38," One, we force news organizations to compete with each other"
409.38,411.02, by providing continuous substance.
411.66,414.46, Organizations that can address the best form of opposing arguments
414.46,416.2, will most likely gain the most credibility
416.2,418.52, than the ones that address the shallow version of the same view.
418.84,420.56," This is unique because to the fairness doctrine,"
420.98,425.4, news corporations now compete to represent the variety of viewpoints
425.4,430.5, and better whereas on opposition different news media engage with non-overlapping perspectives
430.5,435.72, appeal to different audiences hence there is no competition at all on-site opposition second
435.72,439.98, reason this reason is awareness on what these issue other issues are right prompting discourse
439.98,443.4, on news channels and interviews as well as prompting individuals to do more research on
443.4,449.36, their own about these issues so what is the impact there's two impacts one we decrease echo chambers echo
449.36,452.96, chambers are hard to form on our site because each topic are exposed to different viewpoints it
452.96,457.92, forces individuals to engage with opposing views whereas they were not previously aware before
457.92,462.8, tangibly when we reduced echo chambers with demeaning views on minorities minorities also feel
462.8,469.52," more comfortable speaking out about their experiences in open discourse. Furthermore, echo chambers thrive on government conspiracies,"
469.52,473.36," they are being silenced for speaking the truth. When they are given the sufficient platform,"
473.36,478.08, it undercuts their conspiracy theory when they have to gain legitimacy through proper reasoning.
478.08,483.36," Now to the second impact, on democracy. People are now making independent decisions instead of"
483.36,486.86, voting based on biased information presented by news media corporations.
487.28,494.52," When people make independent rational choices on what is best for them, then it will most likely be more accurate in terms of democratic representation."
495.06,508.0," Even in one-party states, you are increasing nuance and discourse within the parties themselves because their constituents are introduced to views beyond the party line. Furthermore, when people are later experiencing the consequences of policies that they illegitimately support,"
508.0,512.08, then there is a lack of confidence in the state which encourages counterproductive trends such
512.08,516.0, as decreasing political participation. It also looks like an apathy towards government policies
516.0,527.8," or encouraging governments to further intervene in common life. With all of that, we are so proud to to propose."
528.3,529.96, Great. I thank the speaker for that very fine speech.
529.96,530.88, Calling upon Elo.
530.88,531.38," Yeah, yeah."
541.86,583.62," I'll just take like 20 seconds to wrap up my speech, get my papers in order. Am I audible and visible?"
583.62,585.2," Yes, you are. Okay. Am I audible and visible?"
585.9,587.32," Yep, you are."
587.62,588.92, Okay.
590.48,590.58, I'll take POIs through chat.
592.76,600.04, Please don't unmute yourself at any point of my speech.
602.12,603.78," I'll start in three, two."
606.08,606.36, The fairness doctrine is not fair.
611.2,611.44, It is one that governments can abuse to consolidate power and it leads to reduced discussion of important issues.
612.1,612.26, What do we support?
613.7,613.8, We broadly support the status quo.
615.08,615.22," Specifically, we want three things."
621.52,621.84," One, an independent regulatory body that punishes intentional misinformation, such as the FCC in the US and Ofcom in the UK."
629.44,633.56," Second, instances of unintentional misinformation need to be addressed in a future broadcast once the error has been identified. And finally, enforcement of antitrust legislation to prevent media consolidation. Before I move on, I'll deal"
633.56,637.24," with the responses, right? Recognize the first thing that we get from proposition is that they"
637.24,640.6," talk about their model, right? Where they're going to have the regulatory bodies going to be"
640.6,649.8," something like the FCC and other legal bodies are going to hold them in check. Who elects who stays on this regulatory body? Is this a democratic process? If not,"
649.94,653.56," then presumably the government does that, right? Presumably the government is going to decide who"
653.56,657.92," sits on this regulatory body, which means they have an active incentive to ensure that these"
657.92,661.28," are people who are going to support them, who are going to ensure that the government isn't"
661.28,667.84," being criticized and questioned in the first place, right? We think that this a leverage to the government to manipulate what kind of in what kind of news is"
667.84,671.6, being propagated they had to make it clear why that doesn't happen on their side right but
671.6,675.84, recognize what we get from their side they talk about how choice is important panel this isn't
675.84,680.32, a debate about whether or not choice is being restricted choice is literally once one click
680.32,684.56, away you can go to a different news channel and you can just click and read up what they're saying
684.56,688.96, right this is not about choice this is about how people aren't this like this debate
688.96,693.52, is about how people aren't actively trying to like take up uh to like use that choice right
693.52,697.04, we don't think that is a relevant that is a relevant argument in this debate right but
697.04,700.8, secondly they talk about how like uh but secondly they talk about how like media corporations in
700.8,705.04, general propagate very very like false news and very like uh news that is
705.04,710.56, aligned with one side we think this is we think this is not true because recognized media houses
710.56,715.76, in general have an incentive to propagate news that that is not you know very extreme or very
715.76,721.2, like aligned to one side right because recognized corporations provide ad money which is how media
721.2,727.84, houses run right we think that they still need this money to function we think that on their side this does not happen because corporations do not want to associate
727.84,733.12, with media houses that are blatantly so that are blatantly so you know uh like positive towards
733.12,737.04, one side we think that because of pr these corporations don't necessarily do that but
737.04,742.4, before i move on i'll take a poi if there is one how is the regulatory body on your state house
742.4,746.04, not biased as well given that you want to use the same macro on-site proposition?
746.8,751.82," On our side, at least these media companies have the ability to come up and say what they want, right?"
751.84,755.68, We think there's the independence of the press that exists on our side that doesn't exist on your side.
755.74,757.9, That is the comparative. Moving on to the first argument.
758.3,761.18, This policy hinders a free and fair democratic process.
761.52,768.3," Freedom of press is absolutely essential for any democracy to function. And this largely deals with the POI, right? Because recognize it provides us information"
768.3,772.06," on the government and its actions that people need to decide. Without it, people are unable"
772.06,776.56," to make an informed decision about how to vote, which party to support, etc. In the status quo,"
776.8,781.12," the press is only interfered with under very strict conditions, such as one, limiting"
781.12,785.54," misinformation, lies or slander, or second, like banning direct incitement of violence."
785.78,791.48," In both of these cases, the rules are objective. A fake story is objectively untrue."
791.76,795.88, An incitement is when you have directly caused an objective risk to a person or a group.
795.88,802.94," However, in propositions world, whether a network is covering a controversial issue sufficiently is very, very subjective."
803.26,809.68, What is sufficient coverage and which viewpoints need to be covered are all subjective what are the potential consequences of this first
809.68,814.8, for any political party it is always advantageous to suppress media platforms that challenge them or
814.8,820.0, support oppositional viewpoints in propositions world they are likely to use whatever powers they
820.0,825.28, have to appoint members in this regulatory body in a way that benefits themselves this also deals
825.28,829.44, with the prime minister's response that in a democracy media censorship is not likely because
829.44,835.2, even in the best liberal democracies politicians clearly have this incentive even in the us where
835.2,840.0, commissioners of the fcc are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the fcc
840.0,844.56, used the fairness doctrine to force the washington post to reduce coverage of the watergate scandal
844.56,849.26, during the nixon administration it is something they need to defend. But it's far worse in weaker
849.26,854.4," democracies like India, Poland, Hungary, or Brazil. They can keep suing news companies for alleged"
854.4,860.16," breaches and cost them a huge amount of time and money. These lawsuits are intended to censor,"
860.38,864.78," intimidate, and even silence political dissent from news corporations. This is their comparative."
866.0,873.0," This is why they're worse. These are also hard to hold to account, since the public often don't care or understand the details of legal disputes over regulation."
873.0,886.2," Right. All of this has this is all like enabled simply because of all of this is enabled simply because of how subjective the standards of fair representation of all viewpoints is, right? But"
886.2,892.24," even if I take government at their best, even if proposition somehow has the best regulators and"
892.24,896.92," there is no room for abuse, they still need to make a highly subjective judgment with limited"
896.92,901.78," budgets, which will lead to errors. This means when prioritizing the allocation of resources,"
902.1,905.82, they will avoid prosecuting the large broadcasters against
905.82,910.5, whom legal battles are more difficult to win smaller news corporations on their side will
910.5,914.82, be targeted in an arbitrary and discriminatory way with who will be like driven out of the industry
914.82,920.7, due to costly legal battles they cannot fight the industry will be monopolized even further at the
920.7,928.12," end of the argument it's evident that politicians can use this policy to hinder a free and fair democratic process, even in Proposition's best case."
928.5,932.96," On to the second argument, then, about how controversial issues have reduced coverage in their world."
933.26,940.52," Unlike the COVID-19 or Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are a series of issues that are important but are not immediately apparent to an audience."
940.8,943.44," Thus, the broadcaster has discretion over whether to cover it."
943.66,949.68," In Proposition's world, these issues get covered a lot less for two structural reasons one logistical reasons it"
949.68,954.96, takes far more resources to analyze an opposing viewpoint in a broadcast for example complex
954.96,960.16, nuances of a climate bill now need top experts on their side to discuss both sides as a news
960.16,964.88, broadcaster in fear of prosecution by the regulatory body you avoid covering the issue
964.88,968.88," altogether you know this issue is not immediately interesting enough for your audience, so they"
968.88,973.76," don't necessarily tune out because you aren't covering it. And secondly, for ideological reasons,"
973.96,979.18, the most ideologically rigid media organization know that they will lose viewers when they discuss
979.18,984.08," the opposing side to certain controversial issues. For example, when Fox News would avoid"
984.08,985.04, covering the later
985.04,989.92," stages of Bush's war on Iraq, just because recognize that even though these later stages"
989.92,994.68," weren't so central that viewers expected coverage on them, reporting on this could potentially turn"
994.68,1001.26," off your audience, right? The harm of all of this is that you lose out on opinions about"
1001.26,1005.32," controversial topics important to decision making, all because media"
1005.32,1009.84," corporations fear the fairness doctrine. Furthermore, we argue that it is untrue that"
1009.84,1014.46," presenting both sides of the story is always good. This is a direct response to their argument,"
1014.58,1018.44," right? Because recognize first, some of the best journalism in the history of the profession"
1018.44,1023.4, were one-sided biting critiques of specific powerful actors like the Watergate reports on
1023.4,1025.16," Nixon administration, or like the Boston Watergate reports on Nixon administration or like"
1025.16,1030.34, the Boston Globe's reports on sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church. The core of the government's
1030.34,1037.34," case in here is that they get a better informed society. This policy, despite its intent,"
1037.64,1042.72," leads to the opposite occurring. But second, two sides of a debate do not always deserve"
1042.72,1047.38," equal coverage, right? On their side, ering both sides on these kinds of issues is dangerous."
1047.76,1049.38, Think about COVID-19 vaccines.
1049.78,1054.24," Anti-vax proponents who are invited on proposition side can be very persuasive speakers,"
1054.62,1060.24, use misleading facts that are hard to rebut in real time and therefore be convincing despite lack of evidence.
1060.24,1062.02, This literally costs lives.
1062.32,1066.36," Think about minority issues in countries, right? Think about"
1066.36,1072.44," how them not receiving, think about how presenting both sides is essentially going to come back and"
1072.44,1077.4," cause literally harms to human dignity, right? This is something side opposition refuses to"
1077.4,1081.88," stand for. On our side, most news corporations naturally refrain from representing the side"
1081.88,1088.88, that is dangerous or immoral. This is because most broadcasters earn their revenue from advertisers particularly large corporations who do not want
1088.88,1093.2, their brand to be associated with a network that is so supportive of what's dangerous or actively
1093.2,1097.84, can be seen as costing people their lives for all these reasons we think that news corporations have
1097.84,1108.06, an incentive on our side to not on our side to remain better. We oppose.
1110.22,1110.38, I thank the speaker for that very fine speech.
1132.0,1135.0," Calling upon DPM here. Hi, am I audible? Yes, you are."
1135.0,1178.56," Okay, thank you. Sorry, just give me a second."
1178.56,1182.32, I'm incredulous at the fact that our principle of choice was brushed off by saying that viewers
1182.32,1184.42, can just be a click away from getting other views.
1184.42,1187.36, We gave you structural reasons as to why they're incentives for companies to brainwash
1187.36,1191.68, their viewers and say exactly why and put them down a path of sensationalization none of this
1191.68,1195.2, was engaged with and because of this our principle of choice still stands and i'm going to prove to
1195.2,1198.24, you why further on this is round winning i have a few things i'm going to do in this debate first
1198.24,1201.92, let's talk about government obligation and government abuse secondly talk about why exactly
1201.92,1207.14, choice will be will be shifted on their house and then lastly talk about why we get better discussion on issues in and of itself.
1207.3,1210.52," So firstly, then on government obligation, I think the first thing that they say underneath"
1210.52,1215.54," this is that governments are abusive, and that regulations will be a gross misuse of power in"
1215.54,1219.06, the SAS code. I have a few responses to that. There are a few reasons why this won't be as
1219.06,1223.44," abusive or why it won't be abusive at all, right? So firstly, on the civil service branch, the FCC"
1223.44,1225.2, is a natural civil service
1225.2,1229.6, industry in the sense that democrats picked it and let's say to approve it so it checks and balances
1229.6,1233.36, so fcc has been doing this for decades they care about transparency and are likely to make the best
1233.36,1237.2, decisions given that you already operate using the fcc and the status quo but secondly there's
1237.2,1240.96, immense food to me right and i think that you cannot underline you cannot underscore this enough
1240.96,1244.16, when there is immense food you need to judge how many people are going to how many people are going
1244.16,1246.96, to view or what can be broadcasted or not there's literally going to be a lot of
1246.96,1250.48, whistleblowing a lot of pushback against if there are wrong decisions being made you're literally
1250.48,1253.84, the ones who are restricting news corporations if you do the wrong step or if you do something that
1253.84,1257.84, is miscalculated they will call you out in of itself right companies that can call the government
1257.84,1261.52, every day do this already right they can fight back because these are large corporations and
1261.52,1267.28, that's exactly why if the government missteps or over does something then they're going to answer calling them out calling them abused and corrupted
1267.28,1270.56, in and of itself that's probably something the government wants to avoid regardless of who's in
1270.56,1275.76, power right but secondly you know fcc also has a lot of transparency this is that they want to see
1275.76,1279.04, there's something unpoliticized they want to see that it's good because if they overset their
1279.04,1282.16, boundaries then the public is going to lose trust in them and that's something that they don't want
1282.16,1287.76, but lastly then cross comparison or call it can exist on our house so the government shuts down a viewpoint on one source individuals
1287.76,1291.84, from all groups can now point that out and cross compare with different users as to what exactly
1291.84,1295.36, has been left out and fill in the blanks by themselves so it's actually very easy to point
1295.36,1298.96, out what the government has done and why something that is so bad and that's why you just don't get
1298.96,1302.88, this massive overviews of power on their skies but lastly i just want to flip this point i want to
1302.88,1306.66," say that if the government understands is so perverse and has such bad incentives,"
1306.66,1308.68, there are much worse ways they can do that on their side.
1308.68,1311.0, And it's also when officials can do a backdoor bribery
1311.0,1312.26," or say, if you produce this,"
1312.26,1313.7," which is already happening in the status quo,"
1313.7,1316.26," if you'd produce this or if you have a storyline,"
1316.26,1317.48, can give you a lot of money for that.
1317.48,1319.18," It's a lot easier, it's a lot harder to call it out"
1319.18,1321.3, on their side of the house when these are behind doors
1321.3,1322.64, and there's no regulation in place
1322.64,1324.86, to actually give equal time to over issues.
1324.86,1327.44, And therefore there can be a disproportionate skew on both sides.
1327.44,1332.86," So I've taken down why exactly the government, because of immense scrutiny and because of cross-comparison, do not overstep their boundaries."
1333.16,1338.14," And why exactly? If they want to rely on regulations, they cannot rely on the fact that government abuse will be so rampant on their side."
1338.34,1342.74," But then secondly, then, I want to bring back the point about choice and tell why exactly it's so important in this debate."
1343.46,1348.4," Their whole obligation, their whole response was one click away is literally is one quickly is already happening and people have"
1348.4,1352.16, this choice already but that misses our nuance right we told you a few things like centralize
1352.16,1356.88, sensationalization and demonization about the other side even if it's not extreme which is
1356.88,1360.16, their mitigation that these are going to be mitigatory views they can still be selectively
1360.16,1363.92, skewed and tilted this is a nuance that they miss in the sense that it's profitable for these
1363.92,1369.0," companies because so long as they have a loyal viewer base, they don't really care about who exactly they're misconstruing and misrepresenting."
1369.0,1380.0," That's why profit still flows in, because advertisers don't care who the voter base is or who the viewer base is. So long as you have a constant and steady large majority base of viewers, then it's okay, a-okay for them, and they'll still fund you anyways."
1380.0,1388.0," So that's exactly why they're putting up funding, or why they have an incentive to be modernized or moderate that simply doesn't work they have an oil fan base and that's exactly why they get more radicalized"
1388.0,1392.8, and more sensationalized on their sales but lastly executives can make political decisions that limit
1392.8,1396.48, choice right so even if you don't want to be you want to be a moderate there still are executives
1396.48,1399.84, at the top who can make these decisions for you and since they have their own biases they have
1399.84,1403.28, their own political views and that's why exactly choice will be restricted when the people who are
1403.28,1407.52, viewing this think that it's unbiased but actually it's been gone through a lot of filtering and politicization
1407.52,1412.16, on their house so last conclusion of points that points to choose is very very limited on this
1412.16,1415.52, house and even if there are clicks away people do not click on it to begin with because of the
1415.52,1419.28, incentive structure of these companies and that's why the government has an obligation to fix this
1419.28,1424.24, but then moving on that why exactly do you avoid why why you don't avoid covering issues the whole
1424.24,1428.88, point underneath this was you lose massive amounts of funding when you have to go to other sources and thereby you
1428.88,1433.68, cover less things lots of these controversial issues in general a few responses this i think
1433.68,1437.36, that firstly on funding they just asserted that it would be a burden or a hinder right if these
1437.36,1441.52, are large multinational corporations who have millions of people tuning in each day i'm still
1441.52,1447.46, very unclear why exactly they'll lose massive amounts of money if they have to go through a little bit more viewpoints or have to do more interviews.
1447.74,1451.34," Likely they can cushion the thing in and of itself. But secondly, large companies probably"
1451.34,1455.18," have the most incentive to cut back on other miscellaneous things like gossip sessions,"
1455.3,1458.68," like other celebrity news stories, and they can redirect money into being more efficient there."
1458.84,1463.46," So we flip this claim so that even if they have to lose money, they will still put these more"
1463.46,1466.32, money onto better things and make it more efficient in and of itself.
1466.58,1470.1," But secondly, these corporations still have incentive to report on diverse issues."
1470.28,1475.4," Right. And for this mechanism, because when you have to report on the same things, you need other ways to differentiate themselves."
1475.6,1479.38, Right. People still want to know about national controversial issues because they still apply to them.
1479.44,1487.14, That's why news corporations will still report on them because they have the most and most ability to make a statement that's why on their side house you actually get less reporting on diverse issues
1487.14,1491.82, when they can only resort on help on reporting on one sort of or one aspect of the issue when
1491.82,1495.72, everyone has to put on the same things again more diversification we flip their point about why you
1495.72,1499.44, avoid issues that's what's happening on their sales before we move on I'll take your point
1499.44,1504.36, if all viewpoints deserve equal representation then would you pit a Holocaust denier against
1504.36,1506.32, a survivor of Auschwitz in the same debate?
1506.32,1508.82," Right, okay, let's move on to my last point."
1508.82,1512.12," Why not everything, why everything should be represented or why they claim about not"
1512.12,1514.02, everything should be represented is simply untrue.
1514.02,1516.12," I think firstly, this is extremely subjective."
1516.12,1517.66, You can trade pick examples all you want.
1517.66,1521.1," There are still a lot of unconventional issues that still have legitimacy, like abolishing"
1521.1,1522.94," prisons, like religious minority viewpoints."
1522.94,1527.04," These are still things that deserve to be represented, even if they are small points. You cannot just collectively pick ones"
1527.04,1530.42," and say this is bad, right? But think about secondly, those based on false truths and"
1530.42,1533.88, misinformation are probably going to be filtered out like in the status quo and still being given
1533.88,1537.28," consent to. So if the officer survivor doesn't want to be in this debate, then we wouldn't invite"
1537.28,1540.2," them on anyways. But there are probably many people who do want to engage in conversation,"
1540.44,1543.46, who do want to be represented on national television. And that's exactly why we give
1543.46,1547.26, them a platform that you don't get on their sales but thirdly at our worst case scenario when
1547.26,1550.68, we represent these viewpoints we get more engagement and you don't fester these bad
1550.68,1554.22, ideologies in the corner right when you bring them to a national stage and you get more awareness
1554.22,1557.7, attention on it that's what you actually call it why it's problematic to begin with this is
1557.7,1561.66, an entire flip on their side because on their side these ideals these ideas never get called
1561.66,1565.06, out on their side we do bring them out to. We do give them more of a national attention
1565.06,1566.64, and that's why they're more likely to be shut down
1566.64,1568.06, and more likely for people to understand
1568.06,1570.66, why exactly it's so bad when you engage them in conversation.
1570.66,1572.28," Then lastly, moving on to my last extension"
1572.28,1573.96, about why you uphold democracy.
1573.96,1575.64," Besides having your own political agenda,"
1575.64,1577.94, existing news sources are biased against smaller parties
1577.94,1579.56, and niche ideologies for two reasons.
1579.56,1580.98," Firstly, a lack of public engagement"
1580.98,1582.66, where more people are aware of existing parties
1582.66,1584.1, or large viewpoints and don't want to engage
1584.1,1586.88," with those from the minority, i..e religious minorities or far-left minorities"
1586.88,1590.8, for who are for abolishing prison they're not small in numbers per se but the majority has
1590.8,1595.2, conflicting viewpoints and that's why they ignore them but secondly nepotism and advantages of
1595.2,1599.84, being more mainstream also impact this so bigger parties can buy up time on articles or news
1599.84,1604.16, sources or tv segments to a much larger extent due to wealth and power like bezos and the washington
1604.16,1606.7, post jobs in the atlantic and Benioff in the Times Magazine.
1607.02,1610.54, Bigger parties tend to have internal connections to the owners of news sources through similarities
1610.54,1613.96," such as status, wealth, or business deals that reinforce news corporations to favor"
1613.96,1614.72, certain ideologies.
1615.1,1618.56," Knowing that is exactly why, under this house, deals are much more corrupt and much less"
1618.56,1618.92, transparent.
1619.12,1621.4," If they're not done through the government, they'll be done through the rich and the elite."
1621.66,1622.36, Why is it so bad?
1622.56,1624.6," See that at first, it corrupts democratic principles."
1624.9,1627.36," In a democracy, people are free to express their viewpoints and have them"
1627.36,1630.88," heard and responded to. When smaller parties are unfairly discriminated against by the media,"
1630.88,1634.48, they're disproportionately unable to express themselves and be engaged in the conversation.
1634.48,1638.48, This certainly clashes with the point about why you present wrong ideas. Because even if they
1638.48,1642.4," are wrong ideas, a portion of the of the of the population still holds them and thus we still"
1642.4,1647.84," deserve to represent them and have them engage in the conversation. This results in a few things, right? Bigger political parties are"
1647.84,1651.14," unable to be called out, and people stay in these viewpoints despite potentially liking another one"
1651.14,1654.6, better. Different viewpoints are being neglected and unable to reach general society means that
1654.6,1658.3, minorities aren't catered to as well. So how do we solve this on ourselves? When we mandate
1658.3,1662.06," means to give smaller parties or ideas a platform that is broadcast to mainstream society, it's"
1662.06,1667.52, easier to enter into the democratic conversation and not to be overshadows.. We humanize the other groups more and they're less likely to buy into
1667.52,1671.44," demonizing narratives and instead be more open to seeking middle ground compromises through politics,"
1671.44,1676.08," through policies, etc. For all these reasons, because we protect the principle of choice,"
1676.08,1677.76, we are very proud to propose.
1687.84,1690.24," Great, I thank the speaker for that very fine speech. Calling upon DLO, here you are."
1690.24,1694.5," Hi, before I start, confirming if I'm visible and audible."
1694.5,1695.5, You are.
1695.5,1696.5, Excellent.
1696.5,1698.28," Once again, preferred pronouns he, him."
1698.28,1701.32, I'll take POIs through the chat if you have one.
1701.32,1728.0," That out of the way, I'll be starting shortly. Starting my speech in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."
1728.28,1730.46," So in this debate, opposition needs to prove two things."
1730.66,1733.84," First, why are the media houses in the status quo irredeemably bad?"
1734.16,1736.86," Two, how do they actually fix this issue if they are so bad?"
1737.04,1739.6," If we can disprove any one of these issues, we win this debate."
1739.6,1742.44, But we'll do both in the two things that I'm going to discuss in my speech.
1742.7,1743.62," One, on abuse of power."
1743.78,1747.6," And two, on actually improving the quality of information available but before that i want to"
1747.6,1751.6, frame out this whole weird principle that they have on choice in two ways number one i want to
1751.6,1755.36, notice that their entire choice if you think about it if there's a store next to my house where i can
1755.36,1759.6, go and buy diet pepsi but i choose not to their entire principle says that i'm committing an
1759.6,1763.44, incredible moral harm the simple reality of the status quo is that there are numerous amount of
1763.44,1767.76, media houses that are available with the advent of the internet you can choose with the click of a button to access
1767.76,1772.56, any form of news that you want they say that news is coercive sure but then what you're doing is
1772.56,1775.92, equally coercive right because then you're forcing other forms of media outlets to come there and
1775.92,1778.88, express your opinions when you don't want it perhaps you're a liberal person who wants to
1778.88,1782.72, be expressed to liberal ideologies that's why you go to news outlets like jacob why are you then
1782.72,1786.0, forcing your ideas on them their entire principle backstabs on itself.
1786.0,1791.0," But number two, even if you don't buy the initial premise and you do think that it is important that people are met with a variety of information,"
1791.0,1796.0, Basma gave you layers and layers of analysis as to why less news is going to be covered in the first place.
1796.0,1798.0, Media outlets are unlikely to cover controversial issues.
1798.0,1801.0, Media outlets are likely to self-censor themselves because of government abuse.
1801.0,1803.0, Which brings me to my first point about government abuse.
1803.0,1808.24, What do we tell you? We tell you that the media outlets have an important role in our society
1808.24,1812.3, in holding the government accountable and by calling out instances of government abuse.
1812.58,1816.78, We think that this gives the government more capacity to hamper down on media. What do they
1816.78,1820.12, say? The first thing that they say is that this new board that they're going to make is going to
1820.12,1823.88, be incredibly impartial. And the example that they give us is because it's going to be elected by the
1823.88,1828.56," Senate. Guys, the Senate is the most politicized institution currently in the united states their"
1828.56,1832.08, entire job is to hold the president accountable and they don't because they didn't impeach trump
1832.08,1836.72, because the part because senate is in fact elected by republicans and it is incredibly politicized
1836.72,1840.72, and it's bipartisan the simple reality is governments have an incentive to crack down
1840.72,1844.8, on these media outlets and now you give them the capacity to do so because you give them a legal
1844.8,1848.32, right you give them the ability to give these board you get the government gets to
1848.32,1852.0, decide who gets to be on this board what policies are implemented by the board how are these
1852.0,1855.52, policies implemented the likely counterfactual then is the government is going to crack down
1855.52,1858.64, on dissenting voices that they don't like how do they respond to this isn't there ah there's
1858.64,1863.12, gonna be massive backlash no this backlash is not going to be anywhere near symmetric for the simple
1863.12,1867.12, reason that otherwise if the government were to randomly like lock up a journalist there would be massive backlash
1867.12,1870.88, because there's a visceral reaction to it i saw the journalist getting arrested now the government
1870.88,1874.8, hits them with loads of regulation the government hits them with loads of regal battles which people
1874.8,1878.88, are unlikely to notice notice most people don't watch up on like legal eagle every single day
1878.88,1882.56, you don't read up on what goes on in supreme courts every single day you are unlikely to notice
1882.56,1887.92, them let's be charitable let's assume that these regulators are good here's why even then they're still going to be bad actors
1887.92,1891.36, in two ways number one how do you know when something is fair like how do you know the
1891.36,1895.68, two experts are equally skilled if an idea is like underrepresented society because they're advocated
1895.68,1899.68, by a minority is it really fair if you just give it like the same amount of screen time given that
1899.68,1904.08, anywhere else they won't be represented the likely counterfactual then is that their personal biases
1904.08,1907.04, in this own regulatory body are going to come out and they're going to subjectively act
1907.04,1911.44, out on this because subjectively act out on this and then skyfall media number two they will
1911.44,1915.44, selectively exercise this power given that this is going to be subjective it is going to probably
1915.44,1919.92, very hard for you to actually win import battles if they do exist this means that media outlets
1919.92,1923.76, are going to selectively exercise these powers on entries they can think they can win i.e relatively
1923.76,1927.36, smaller media houses as opposed to corporations with billions of dollars in funding that can fight
1927.36,1931.12, off your legal battle why is the comparative important the comparative here is the only other
1931.12,1934.32, instances where the government does actually intervene the business of media and when you
1934.32,1938.24, can objectively prove it you can objectively prove that something is false via fake news you can
1938.24,1941.84, objectively prove that something is liable in a court of battle you cannot prove that something
1941.84,1947.52, is fair because of this degree of subjectivity we win this debate simply on this clash independently because media is the only
1947.52,1951.68, entity that can hold the government accountable in the absence of this government abuse corruption
1951.68,1955.92, uh human rights abuses all of these things go underported this is simply enough to assist
1955.92,1960.08, debate let's say you don't buy that let's say we need to prove why the equality of information is
1960.08,1963.92, better we've proven the first argument why states can use this to control the flow of information
1963.92,1966.96, we've proven the second argument why this causes fewer ideas to be discussed anyways
1966.96,1970.72, and i will prove in my third argument why people are drawn to alternative worst forms of media but
1970.72,1974.0, let's say you don't buy that either i will now respond to this claim that media houses are
1974.0,1987.62," impartial in four ways but before that go ahead okay seeing none sorry If not for the FCC, who regulates these policies?"
1987.78,1990.8, Who regulates what news articles is deemed as fair or not fair?
1991.7,1992.1, Exactly.
1992.24,1993.66, Our counterfactual is that they shouldn't.
1993.92,1995.88, Your literal model is that you have a government body
1995.88,1998.26, regulating what news outlets people should and should not view.
1998.48,2000.04," Even if these government bodies are good,"
2000.22,2002.18," we still gave you incentives where there's like massive,"
2002.26,2004.28, massive capacity for abuse to occur in the first place.
2004.5,2008.62, First response. We think that these outlets have an incentive to be impartial due to three reasons.
2008.88,2011.8," Number one, they get money from ad revenues. They get money from ad companies."
2012.0,2016.9," And while these companies may care about the ratings of these media agencies, they also probably care about their own reputation."
2017.16,2023.9, You would not want your company brand to be associated with a media outlet that is literally spreading false news and is causing people to die because of that.
2024.1,2027.56," Number two, there's often cutthroat competition between other media outlets. If you"
2027.56,2031.28," don't cross the aisle and you show information that the most amount of people you could want,"
2031.5,2035.12, your own people could go away from your media outlets and go to somebody else. You presumably
2035.12,2039.48," don't want that. Number three, you want to reach out to as many people as possible in order to"
2039.48,2043.72," maximize your revenue. Sure, media outlets could only show the ideologies of the far right or the"
2043.72,2048.0," far left, but by definition, there are relatively few people actually on the far right or the far left."
2048.0,2054.0," Therefore, if you are to maximize your revenue, you have an incentive to cater to the center, or the majority of people would actually want to believe it."
2054.0,2061.0, All of this proves that their policy is likely not going to be doing much for the simple reason that media outlets want to cater to it in the first place.
2061.0,2068.24, Let's say that media outlets are biased anyways the likely counterfactual that is that they're going to show this bias in the way that actually implement the
2068.24,2071.04, uh and the way they actually show both of the debate this means that they're probably going
2071.04,2074.4, to give tokenistic representation to all ideologies what does this look like it looks like
2074.4,2077.84, showing someone who's really bad at explaining a particular viewpoint an expert who's really weak
2077.84,2081.76, at explaining an ideology this happens all the time literally ben shapiro goes around college
2081.76,2087.84, campuses debating high school students at like college universities and calling them experts or it looks like you get the most extreme person for the other
2087.84,2091.12, viewpoint to show that this is what their viewpoint looks like every single time you want to have a
2091.12,2095.04, discussion about healthcare fox news gets the most dedicated communists in order to show that
2095.04,2099.2, everyone who cares about uh healthcare is actually a communist what this does is it shows to people
2099.2,2102.8, that this ideology is really really bad they're really french i should not believe in it anyways
2102.8,2106.76, so people are pulled away from those ideas. Let's say exposure is positive.
2106.76,2108.88," Even then, it's going to moderate"
2108.88,2110.08, very few amount of people.
2110.08,2112.08, This is because if you are a Trump supporter
2112.08,2113.48, and you actually watch Fox News
2113.48,2115.36," and you saw Fox News being critical of Trump,"
2115.36,2116.76, your likely reaction isn't going to be
2116.76,2118.0, to stop watching Fox News.
2118.0,2119.4, It's going to be stop believing in Trump.
2119.4,2120.96, You're going to stop watching Fox News altogether.
2120.96,2122.32," You're going to be angry at Fox News,"
2122.32,2124.32, which is why you're going to get even more radicalized.
2124.32,2127.32," You are unlikely to then feel that you are being moderated. Let's say this doesn't happen either. You're going to be angry at Fox News, which is why you're going to get even more radicalized, who are unlikely to then feel that you are being moderated."
2127.32,2128.68, Let's say this doesn't happen either.
2128.68,2130.24, You are going to be moderated.
2130.24,2133.94," Here's why, even then, showing all forms of viewpoints is something that is bad in society."
2133.94,2136.52," We asked them at a POI, do you think that a Holocaust survivor should be given the same"
2136.52,2140.1, amount of viewpoint as someone who is a Holocaust denier?
2140.1,2143.14, We think that this is absolutely horrible for two structural reasons.
2143.14,2145.86," Number one, in the instances of a pandemic, when there's a time-sensitive issue,"
2146.08,2149.68," every single time you want to have a conversation about vaccines,"
2149.86,2151.78, you need to have anti-vaxxers necessarily come in.
2151.98,2153.5, You need to give them the credence.
2153.7,2156.5, This fictionalizes the entire conversation because debates get stalled out.
2156.56,2159.32," They're much longer, which means that you actually have a much more time lag"
2159.32,2160.3, when actually fixing the issue.
2160.3,2164.2," But number two, you have to understand that some people might actually go on the side of the anti-vaxxers."
2164.26,2167.36, There's no guarantee that if their experts are actually good that is your best case
2167.36,2171.36, that some people will inevitably be drawn towards anti-vaxxers which means these issues never get
2171.36,2175.76, fixed in the first place let's say this doesn't happen either we then believe that people are
2175.76,2180.64, likely to flood to worse forms of social media or what's up on the news consumption i.e from social
2180.64,2184.72, media why does this happen one because your likely reaction to fox news showing being critical of
2184.72,2187.28, trump is to not watch fox troops you go to other alternative forms of
2187.28,2191.28, media like subreddits but number two people are in generally very critical of the government this is
2191.28,2195.36, because the government is often responsible for the 2088 financial crisis so incredibly critical
2195.36,2198.72, of the government now that the government controls the media you are unlikely to then believe in the
2198.72,2202.8, media so you go to subreddits you go to facebook groups these are significantly worse because one
2202.8,2208.16, there are no editorial bodies actually holding them to account but number two everyone can post anything there anonymously there
2208.16,2211.6, is no journalists you actually know so you can't actually call them out on it at the end of this
2211.6,2215.68, debate we tell you the government are going to heavily misuse this even if they don't media
2215.68,2219.2, outlets will never do this properly and even if they do we think that people are just going to go
2219.2,2267.0," to worse forms of media all of their harms are significantly amplified under their side. We are so, so proud to oppose. Hi, am I audible and visible?"
2267.0,2289.28, If you are. between the government or tycoons filtering media and which one is better secondly about what state has better discourse and use quality but before that i'll just engage with the 30-second extension
2289.28,2293.92, on extremism and why we force people to go into more radical news i'd just like to know this
2293.92,2298.48, clash is actually on our state house and where to win it is not contingent on us proving why we have
2298.48,2302.88, decreased radicalism it is about providing people a choice that they believe that they do deserve
2302.88,2313.22," and also about increasing discourse the clear record from from DLO was that if you have extremists and they see that Fox News is being infiltrated with liberal values, they want to go to even worse resources."
2313.58,2314.52, A couple of responses to this.
2314.94,2317.5," Response one, notice that a lot of these radicals have probably changed."
2317.76,2320.2, The reason for this is they want to believe that they're unbiased.
2320.2,2327.86," So if there's a fairness doctrine imposed and it suddenly switches views, it probably also implies to themselves that they are being biased, so that's why they wouldn't want to"
2327.86,2328.86, switch.
2328.86,2329.86, We also think they have ties to anchors as well.
2329.86,2330.86," For example, a Fox viewer probably would have ties to Tucker Carlson."
2330.86,2331.86, That's why they wouldn't switch to even worse extremist views.
2331.86,2332.86," Response two, we don't see opposition that actually exaggerates the harm of these radicals"
2332.86,2333.86, and what they could do.
2333.86,2334.86," Because if news is moderate, per the characterization, under the status quo, I don't really see why"
2334.86,2335.86," this fairness doctrine would suddenly be a tipping point because on our state house,"
2335.86,2336.86, our policy is just an extension of the status quo.
2336.86,2337.86," If it doesn't, then it's just a bias."
2337.86,2338.86," So if there's a fairness doctrine imposed and it suddenly switches views, it probably"
2338.86,2339.86," also implies to themselves that they are being biased, so that's why they wouldn't"
2339.86,2340.86, want to switch.
2340.86,2348.0, We also think they have ties to anchors as well. they could do because if news is moderate per the characterization under the status quo i don't really see why this printer doctrine would suddenly be a tipping point because on our state house our
2348.0,2352.0, policy is just an extension of status quo if it's so moderate as it could be claimed but even if
2352.0,2356.72, it's radical that do a lot of harm society within their already laws preventing that for example
2356.72,2361.84, sedition laws or terrorist prevention laws that do mitigate the harm from opposition response to
2361.84,2368.08," i think under state house even if there's harm it probably isn't circles of left influence because there aren't as many viewers, but even if there are a lot of"
2368.08,2371.76," viewers, criticalization, if we could regulate that on their state house. Fourthly, we don't"
2371.76,2375.48, need to prove why radicals are actually bad. All we need to prove is why our principle path to
2375.48,2379.1," victory, in which we actually allow them more choice, is a better comparative. So even the"
2379.1,2383.88," people who are pushing radicalism, I think that's a net good because you're able to also exercise"
2383.88,2388.08, your choice as well. I want to deal with our first question on government versus tycoon's full-time media
2388.08,2392.64, under this clash i'd like to deal with two things firstly engage with a principal practice victory
2392.64,2397.28, and push it and secondly deal with the claim coming from opposition about government outreach
2397.28,2401.6, the first thing i'm going to say opposition was that on how new since governments are able to
2401.6,2406.24, censor the media and these news media because they notice it they'll also censor themselves as well
2406.24,2410.56, and what is controversial is already subjective a couple responses to this i think firstly i'll
2410.56,2414.48, just like to know now model we made it really clear what these issues look like that have
2414.48,2418.48, large significant importance it looks like those that have large significant societal discussions
2418.48,2422.64, or that do also care to referendums but technically i would like to know on the opposition
2422.64,2428.0," they use the same actor as well so i don't't really think like under State House, we're so biased, why State House would be any better?"
2428.0,2433.0, They actually need to prove the comparative. We actively go to reasons why governments wouldn't really want to abuse.
2433.0,2437.0, So we told you why the government is largely a civil service and is not subjected by partisanship.
2437.0,2443.0, We also told you why you could also have call mechanisms and it directly engages the point about media self-censoring.
2443.0,2448.16, The reason for this is we think that when people more informed on our state house news media they also have an active
2448.16,2451.64, incentive to call out the government if they're constantly being abused within governments they
2451.64,2456.2, also have no direct incentive to also abuse the news corporation as well this is my third response
2456.2,2461.48, this is for two reasons firstly when you say those are in the fcc they probably go into news industry
2461.48,2467.26, after the term in the fcc because they're probably experts in that field So what happens then is that they also want to care about their own reputation.
2467.54,2471.18, So that's why they wouldn't really want to oppress these media because they'll be seen as being corrupt.
2471.44,2474.8," But secondly, though, we think the role of news media is to dig up their own politicians."
2475.12,2480.0," So if you have the SEC regulator that's being so corrupt, we think they also know that the news media might dig up their own."
2480.0,2483.14," For example, your scandal and also the mistrust and all these scandals."
2483.38,2488.08," So that's why on their statehouse, politicians, they don don't on our state house politicians have an active incentive not to be"
2488.08,2491.84, corrupt the next thing that give us on their state housing thank you it's an objective bricks you can
2491.84,2497.04, only they also censor media when it's also perpetrated violence or lies and slander two
2497.04,2501.36, responses i think one we're giving you objective risk on our state house which a lot of these news
2501.36,2504.96, that's so biased on their state and leads to active farms for example marginalization of
2504.96,2507.68, minorities and other people being politic of exercise. So we think
2507.68,2511.12," on our state, we're actually just preventing the farm. Secondly though, we think like value"
2511.12,2515.36," judgment on our state house is actually, value judgment on our state is actually being preserved"
2515.36,2518.96," as a net good for the principal. Now, the claim that gives us for a principal is that people,"
2518.96,2522.72," they don't have, like they could go to like different news channels and that's also a good"
2522.72,2527.64," thing. Couple responses. I think one, we give the active reason why people aren't able to cross-compare because they don't have the"
2527.64,2531.0, time. It also determines on the family they're born into. That's why it's even worse when people
2531.0,2534.84," don't have active choice. But secondly though, we also proven to you on why on their state house,"
2535.16,2538.68, it actually is even worse when people can't democratize the choice that they actually get
2538.68,2542.94, because the issue isn't intervention or no intervention. Intervention happens on both
2542.94,2548.08, sides. One side opposition is directly by these tycoons or media corporations for example mudrock or fox news so that's where
2548.08,2553.28, on your city house when you're able to only propose they support the principle then individuals are
2553.28,2556.96, able to make the choice because we actually told individuals that all these views are important we
2556.96,2561.92, don't have a ceo deciding that before that sure do you think brett kavanaugh cares about his
2561.92,2565.8, reputation when he's pushing forward conservative ideologies?
2567.74,2568.08," We think firstly, he's one of the exceptions."
2572.22,2572.4, We think a lot of these news media corporations and also these governments actually do care.
2577.16,2577.3," But secondly, even if they don't care, we think a lot of news media corporations and also the people will point it out."
2578.28,2578.56, It's not as bad as you claim.
2580.52,2580.78, Second question on whether it scores in news quality.
2582.88,2583.2, The first thing it gives us is that you have less funding and resources.
2584.86,2587.24," So that's why you want to focus on complex issues. A couple responses. I think, one, we're talking about big"
2587.24,2591.16," corporations under this motion. We still do have funding. Secondly, even that's not true. We can"
2591.16,2594.98, also focus on facts and fill in the gaps of discourse as well. You don't need to have a lot
2594.98,2598.94," of opinions. We're able to let people at least know basic facts of everything. But thirdly,"
2598.96,2603.0," though, we didn't even if, like, we have less resources to pour into a lot of views. All these"
2603.0,2607.36," individuals, they know different sides of the issue. They can cross-compare and understand these different issues as well."
2607.36,2610.72," Next time I give us is that presenting both sides of the issue is not good. For example,"
2610.72,2614.72," certain issues don't deserve equal coverage. For example, anti-vaxxers, they pose an actual harm"
2614.72,2619.28," to society. Couple responses. I think first, like not objectively, more people will actually believe"
2619.28,2622.96," in conspiracy theories. For example, the anti-vaxxer theory, we didn't see the more time"
2622.96,2627.6," you actually give to them, people also recognize that's something that shouldn't buy into. Within an understated house,"
2627.6,2631.04," if you don't give them a platform, essentially what they will say is that it's a witch hunt against"
2631.04,2634.16," our views. So that's why you're comparing it on their state health, it's far even worse."
2634.16,2638.16," But secondly though, we think even more people buy into conspiracy theories, that mindset also"
2638.16,2642.4," cuts full void, because a Fox News person might also be influenced by liberal values,"
2642.4,2649.34," but a person with liberal values may also be influenced by Fox News. So I think on the numbers game, it's not objectively true that more people will be influenced by the anti-vaxxer theory."
2649.52,2667.52," Response three, even if that wasn't true and of revenue. Corporate responses, I think one,"
2667.52,2672.32, that is not true because Mudrock for example by Fox he has ties to the Republican party and also
2672.32,2676.48, conservative values. So that's right because of ad revenue he has an active incentive to make sure
2676.48,2680.64, his profit incentives is actually maximized. That's not equivalent to preserving people's
2680.64,2683.84, best interests and also giving them information that they actually need to operate in the
2683.84,2687.24," democracy. Secondly, even though that was true, I mean it's actually impartial,"
2687.24,2690.08, wouldn't we make it just even better on Earth Day House? You have to weigh it on the
2690.08,2694.94," comparative. Next, the idea all gets us, but how news is largely going to be tokenistic"
2694.94,2698.7," on Earth Day House, which you actually intentionally portrayed views incorrectly, and is an illusion"
2698.7,2702.8," of sovereignty. Couple of responses. I think one, on Earth Day House, we have active competition"
2702.8,2709.0," between a lot of news sources. So if you intentionally portray a view wrong, we're able to also call it out and you'll get outcompeted in the media cycle."
2709.0,2716.0," Two, we need people that actually want to hear the views correctly portrayed because they're confident in your views and want to hear it directly engaged with."
2716.0,2719.0," So if it's not portrayed correctly, we'll also want to speak out for a model."
2719.0,2725.24," We'll be able to portray the most accurate views. But three, we think even if it's not true that people aren't able to call out a lot of news"
2725.24,2726.66," that's portrayed incorrectly,"
2726.66,2728.1, we think the audience will struggle overtime
2728.1,2730.0, on our state house and its unique benefit.
2730.0,2730.84, And what should I dare say?
2730.84,2733.36," People just get used to sensationalized views on our state,"
2733.36,2735.32," even if in the short term, you're unable to call out."
2735.32,2736.22," We think it's a norm,"
2736.22,2738.28, and we should be able to also achieve a benefit
2738.28,2739.12, in the long term.
2739.12,2741.16, But what is the response to on-site opposition?
2741.16,2742.36," I'd like to know a couple of things,"
2742.36,2744.0, because I think they have been largely dismissive
2744.0,2744.84, of our case.
2744.84,2748.02," Firstly, on the principle, we have told you why impoverished media corporations"
2748.02,2751.74, basically mean they self-centred and intervene on what youth people are able to access to.
2751.98,2755.42, We think people largely don't have the time to cross-compare. It's also arbitrary whether they
2755.42,2758.92," need to point into a family or whether they're conservative or not. Within our state house,"
2759.0,2762.86," we're actually able to uphold the principle of choice. But secondly though, we also told you in"
2762.86,2766.1, the second argument on why equal chambers also are going to be demolished
2766.1,2766.94," on our state house,"
2766.94,2769.2, and why we're also able in a third-standard argument
2769.2,2771.76, to get more smaller parties also having their views portrayed
2771.76,2773.26, the deal just didn't respond to this
2773.26,2775.5, for all these reasons I'm so proud to propose.
2780.88,2782.54, I thank the speaker for the very fine speech.
2782.54,2807.0, Got a number of a mobile app here. Am I visible and audible?
2807.0,2811.0," Great, thank you. I'll start in 10 seconds."
2811.0,2873.5," Just a reminder, no perfect pronouns and I'll take the words in the chat. Thank you. Starting my speech in 3, 2, 1."
2874.0,2877.36," From first proposition, we get a really idealistic world"
2877.36,2880.1," where they want to change every single thing that is wrong in the status quo,"
2880.3,2883.86, where they want to achieve massive utilitarian outcomes.
2883.86,2887.22," By Prop 2, they realize that they could probably never prove that."
2887.54,2890.78," So at the end of the day, what Proposition's only strategy in this round is"
2890.78,2894.34, to hedge their bet on maximizing choice.
2894.66,2897.9, But the problem of only prioritizing choice in a round
2897.9,2901.38, is that you never proved why choice is inherently important.
2901.72,2905.66," Unless you show to the panel as to why your principle has a unique value,"
2905.94,2912.08," i.e. why this is a fundamentally good thing to do, your principle necessarily doesn't weigh against"
2912.08,2916.7, that much of the outcomes that we're talking about. Let's clarify something. Proposition
2916.7,2920.54," has the burden to prove two things to justify the implementation of the fairness doctrine. First,"
2920.58,2923.48," that the problems inside a school can never be solved in any other way. And secondly,"
2923.48,2927.86, the fairness doctrine can in fact improve things by censoring outlets with significant audience outreach.
2928.26,2937.42," Notice that they cannot only say that they maximize choice because maximizing choice, unless it results in utilitarian outcomes, does not hold any form of value."
2937.66,2943.8," Insofar as we can disprove any one of those burdens and prove that they actually make things worse, we do have an edge."
2944.16,2948.74," From opposition, therefore, recognize our claims were pretty simple."
2949.12,2952.8," First, that the Fairness Doctrine could be, in fact, used for abuse of power by the government."
2952.94,2955.34," And secondly, that media coverage would, in fact, be worsened."
2955.62,2958.22," So therefore, I'm going to structure my speech to answer these two questions."
2958.48,2961.62," First, on the question of could the Fairness Doctrine be used for abuse of power by the government."
2962.0,2967.84, Notice that the way in here is all of Proposition's arguments were predicated upon them proving that this media censorship would be done effectively
2967.84,2972.0, and the policy would be implemented impartially so if we can disprove that all of their benefits
2972.0,2976.0, fall a common feature of both worlds is that politicians ranging from those in western liberal
2976.0,2979.44, democracies like the uk and the us to those in semi-democracies like hungary and brazil
2979.44,2983.6, have an incentive to prolong their tenure and hold on to power the deciding factor then becomes
2983.6,2986.8, was a capacity for them to actually materialize their ambitions.
2986.8,2988.62, Props suggested that the reason they have democratic checks
2988.62,2990.68," and balances is because A, it's a democracy"
2990.68,2991.76, where this debate occurs.
2991.76,2992.92, I have three observations here.
2992.92,2995.76," Number one, democracy is in a monolith, it's a spectrum."
2995.76,2997.94, Here's where Basma's argument about talking about countries
2997.94,2999.3," like Brazil, Poland, and Pakistan"
2999.3,3000.6," become really, really important."
3000.6,3002.7, The ruling parties are getting new legal processes
3002.7,3003.58," to limit media freedom,"
3003.58,3007.62," and that's exactly what happened in Hungary, where V Vides shut down oppositional parties by saying they weren't"
3007.62,3012.42, impartial. Propositions that only claim theirs even if these are semi-democracies people have
3012.42,3016.72, increased political participation. But no you miss the nuance here where you literally give
3016.72,3022.44, active ammunition to the ruling party to clamp down on oppositional coverage by literally saying
3022.44,3029.6," that they are not being impartial enough. This is incredibly harmful because you allow them to consolidate power far, far more. Secondly,"
3029.94,3035.2," even in the US or UK, Basma explained to you that how the administration actually intervenes so much"
3035.2,3039.16, in media coverage like the Watergate scandal. Also look at other cases as to how gerrymandering
3039.16,3043.92, allows them to legally manipulate constituents. What proposition does is legally codifies the
3043.92,3048.46, capacity for these administrations to essentially abuse their power that has been given to them.
3048.68,3053.38," What then is the comparative? Our world relies on objective data to punish outlets, i.e. if an"
3053.38,3056.18," outlet spreads misinformation, they can still be kept in check under our side of the house,"
3056.4,3060.46, relying on facts. Given that we do not rely on subjective perception of an entity as to what is
3060.46,3064.7," fair or how much time should be given to an issue, you allow a terrible metric to overtake media"
3064.7,3069.28, freedom. Here's where Shire's unengaged material becomes really really important he
3069.28,3074.48, explained to you that obviously there are differences between certain announcers on
3074.48,3079.76, one particular opinion show insofar is even if it is true that you both of them are experts
3079.76,3086.24, presumably proposition under side proposition they can never make a conclusive conclusion simply because you reach a deadlock.
3086.48,3091.0, What then they do is rely on enigma or eccentrics of the speaker.
3091.32,3100.42," Presumably, then what side proposition does is push people to make terrible choices where they are essentially flocking towards people who might be on the fringes now."
3100.58,3104.74," We told you that under our side of the house, media organizers can still liberalize."
3105.04,3108.56, Their second claim was that there would be backlash because these are larger companies who own this
3108.56,3112.88," media outlets. First, the government literally has legal defense and evidence that you're not doing"
3112.88,3115.84, enough. The nuance is this is a subjective perception. There is no way that the company
3115.84,3119.84," thinks is fair, would be considered fair for a government that wants to come down on you."
3119.84,3124.64," Secondly, notice that how large outlets are often owned by the same organization, i.e. Comcast owns"
3124.64,3125.28, both liberal
3125.28,3126.34, and conservative and outlets.
3126.34,3128.38," This implies even if one outlet gets slammed down on,"
3128.38,3130.42, they recognize their other outlets will perform better.
3130.42,3132.06, So they have no incentive to protest.
3132.06,3134.4, And their claim was this is a regulatory body.
3135.92,3137.78," Take a step back panel and notice,"
3137.78,3139.7, this literally knives their argument.
3139.7,3142.32, If their intuition is media outlets erode choice
3142.32,3144.86," by forcing down specific opinions on audience,"
3144.86,3145.6, why is it fair
3145.6,3150.64, for one undemocratic regulator to do the same where they decide how much coverage a victim of
3150.64,3155.12, gun violence gets how much covid vaccines are talked about this is literally the same thing
3155.12,3159.52, that they're doing only resulting in worse or outcomes second we told you that given that these
3159.52,3164.88, would be still selected by like say the government the biases would of the administration would seep
3164.88,3165.34, into them.
3165.56,3169.78, The comparative is one where we have international fact-checkers. We have apolitical bodies who are
3169.78,3174.32," not selected by the government. Propositions rely on government's whim. We do not. Therefore,"
3174.48,3178.48, this is the reason why they can never have impartial implementation. This proves that
3178.48,3182.56, their impacts would never manifest. What was the comparative? We told you that media continues to
3182.56,3186.32," liberalize over time because they want advertisers and funding. And more importantly, they have an incentive"
3186.32,3187.56, to garner more audience.
3187.56,3189.72, This engages with props claim that they always
3189.72,3191.1, rely on certain demographics.
3191.1,3193.36," No, they realize that there is a massive competition"
3193.36,3196.22, between outlets even in so you want to cater to centrists.
3196.22,3198.6," This looks like central liberals and central conservatives,"
3198.6,3200.28, or even those who are agnostic.
3200.28,3202.36," This means we have organic improvement of media,"
3202.36,3204.0," which even if it is time consuming,"
3204.0,3208.78," is far, far better than what you get on proposition, which is literal media censorship and silencing of opposition."
3209.28,3213.94, Media is the fourth pillar of the state. Proposition takes the wrecking ball and demolishes that.
3214.18,3216.26," Before I move on to the second question, I'll take a PY."
3217.22,3227.6," Why is it justified to let Murdoch or Fox News determine what news people determine to know, and how do you solve on your side like again notice that the fact"
3227.6,3234.32, that murdoch owns fox people still have the choice to watch fox i mean it's unclear it's probably
3234.32,3238.96, untrue that someone forced them at their gunpoint and said that you only have to watch fox here's
3238.96,3244.16, what our response that if you want you can switch to other outlets it is really really untrue that
3244.16,3245.12, people are always
3245.12,3250.8, co-ars into watching only one specific outlet that is just simply empirically untrue under the second
3250.8,3255.12, question under which side is media coverage better this takes proposition at their best we assume
3255.12,3258.8, that this will be done well i think there are therefore two subclasses under this first on
3258.8,3264.48, quality of information and spread props first claim is that they're that first you do not get
3264.48,3266.4, nuanced information this is empirically
3266.4,3269.52," untrue. News broadcasters recognize that if they're not detailed enough, if they're not"
3269.52,3273.14," extensive enough, they lose audience. Also, these outlets already have extensive reach,"
3273.36,3277.4, meaning more than the majority probably rely on their coverage anyway and actually think it
3277.4,3280.98, probably does a good enough job. Their second claim was that this forces people to take wrong
3280.98,3289.8," choices. There are two observations here. First, this is a contradiction because you curtail choice of media outlets to maximize choice of people. I'm unsure as to what"
3289.8,3295.16, is the weighing of the importance of choice of one entity over another. Insofar as you did not get any
3295.16,3299.32," answer to this question from site proposition, this argument should not be credited. But second"
3299.32,3304.38," and more importantly, notice panel, we do not allow people to opt into slave contracts. We do"
3304.38,3305.56, not allow them to opt into harmless assault we do not allow them to opt into
3305.56,3309.88, harmless assaults the reason is choice does not have a principal independent value it's what your
3309.88,3314.14, choice results in so far we have explained the choice that proposition provides would be skewed
3314.14,3318.94, would be manipulated and be forced by the government and more importantly this literally
3318.94,3323.5, hinders coverages and media freedom therefore their choice does not translate to important
3323.5,3328.72, grounds or important outcomes that is why this argument is no longer relevant more importantly we told you that you
3328.72,3331.92, can literally switch to other channels find information on the internet and interact with
3331.92,3337.36, other people with opposing viewpoints their claim was you do not click i'm sure why if the p if
3337.36,3342.08, their claim is that people have a want to get all information we can probably counter a certain that
3342.08,3350.6, say that instead of exists anyway then the last thing was on competition of outlets. We told you that this will never happen insofar as no news has any
3350.6,3356.0," distinct characteristics to set them apart from any other outlet. Insofar as that never happens,"
3356.3,3361.66, people have no objective criteria to determine which outlet is better. They become apathetic
3361.66,3369.12, and agnostic of the entire political spectrum because they realize every single news doctor does literally the same but what was the unique harm we told you that you
3369.12,3374.32, literally result in less coverage of controversial issues because people think i might get persecuted
3374.32,3379.52, or i might not be doing enough you also result this where minorities are literally targeted and
3379.52,3384.0, scapegoated under their side of the house by media coverage where because simply because
3384.0,3386.2, governments can allow you to do so.
3386.2,3387.5, Incredibly proud of those.
3396.9,3399.2," Great, I thank the speaker for the very fine speech."
3399.2,3401.08," Just a reminder, I mean, I guess all speech is over,"
3401.08,3402.94," but like all substance is over,"
3402.94,3404.82," but do keep the time, eight minutes, 15 seconds,"
3404.82,3407.84," four minutes, 15 seconds. Great, calling upon OptApply, here here."
3420.8,3422.72," Hi, just confirming if I'm visible and audible."
3424.64,3425.0," Excellent, starting shortly. Hi, just confirming if I'm visible and audible. Excellent."
3425.52,3426.26, Starting shortly.
3431.0,3437.96," Starting my speech in five, four, three, two, one."
3438.98,3440.68, Two things I'm going to do with my reply speech.
3440.86,3444.04," First, I'm going to weigh up the conflicting principles and compare them in this debate."
3444.26,3446.96," And second, I'm going to talk about actually improving the media sphere let's talk"
3446.96,3450.8, about principles the principle that we saw from proposition is that they basically have choice
3450.8,3455.2, and choices the problem is people already have the choice what they then diverge into is that
3455.2,3458.64, okay they have the choice they don't seek out the choice and that's still a principal violation
3458.64,3462.0, let's test out this principle people have the option to change their middle name they have
3462.0,3466.76," the option to change their religion but they don't probably because of familial obligations you but they don't. Probably because of familial obligations, you believe in your religion."
3466.88,3469.9, Probably because you care a lot about your religion and there's a lot of family pressure not to do so.
3470.1,3475.02," By their own principle, this would mean that you are brainwashed by your family to not change your religion."
3475.16,3478.9," Therefore, you ought to be forced to change your religion because that's the only way you can maximize your choice."
3479.16,3480.3, Their principle doesn't make any sense.
3480.36,3481.66, People already have a choice and status quo.
3481.66,3482.98, They have the option to seek out.
3483.18,3487.84, We should allow that to happen as opposed to forcing a choice on them let's say you don't buy that why is choice
3487.84,3491.36, good they just sort of asserted this throughout the entirety of the debate presumably choice is
3491.36,3495.52, good because it helps you make right rational choices if this is the case we are the only side
3495.52,3499.36, in this debate that actually tells you why the incentives of the media are schooling such a way
3499.36,3503.28, that if you do pass this policy things are just going to get far far more perverse let's weigh
3503.28,3507.34," this up with what we tell you which is abuse of power we think things are just going to get far, far more perverse. Let's weigh this up with what we tell you, which is abuse of power. We think that governments are going to misuse this."
3507.56,3511.34, The only mechanism that they have is that the FCC is going to do this well. They haven't done this
3511.34,3514.6," well historically. We give you the example of Nixon and the Watergate, which is that government"
3514.6,3518.74, institutions in general don't tend to do a good job in implementing policies. They say that Brett
3518.74,3522.9," Kavanaugh is an exception. Well, sure, I get Amy Barrett Cohen is an exception as well. Sure,"
3523.04,3525.12, I guess Clarence Thomas is an exception as well.
3529.1,3529.44," The problem is when you have so many exceptions, we just need one exception to be the head of the FCC."
3533.44,3533.48," At that point, they can misuse this policy in order to stifle dissent."
3540.08,3540.26," Even if the government regulation is good, though, we think it is still going to be bad for the reason that they don't actually engage with us."
3543.0,3543.16, They need to make subjective calls as to what is fair and what isn't.
3545.22,3545.44, Their own personal biases may actually seep out.
3549.06,3552.1," They may selectively apply this policy to instances where they can actually win, meaning that they're only going to do lawsuits against smaller outcasts who they know for a fact"
3552.1,3555.58," that they can win against, as opposed to behemoths like Fox News that have billions of dollars"
3555.58,3557.18, in revenue that can actually do this against them.
3557.46,3558.84, Why does this independently?
3559.16,3559.64, What is this debate?
3559.86,3560.24, Two reasons.
3560.48,3563.22," One, we know the media is the only entity who can hold the government accountable."
3563.52,3567.2, All other entities of holding government accountable are incredibly politicized. The Supreme Court is
3567.2,3571.34, elected by the president. The Senate is obviously elected on party lines. They are unlikely to go
3571.34,3575.22," against party lines. The media outlets are the only ones who can do this. Number two, in the absence"
3575.22,3579.28," of this, Sahib tells us that political parties can use this to consolidate their power in the media"
3579.28,3583.04," sphere. They can shut down dissent. They can shut down every single hit piece on corruption, which"
3583.04,3587.74," means it gets far, far easier for people like Rajapaksha to get away with stifling billions of dollars from Sri Lankan"
3587.74,3591.74, people. This is easily enough to win us this debate. The comparative here is simple. All other
3591.74,3595.38, forms of government intervention are objective. You can objectively prove that something is a lie.
3595.54,3599.42, You can objectively prove that something is viable. You can objectively prove that something
3599.42,3603.74, incited violence. You don't have that when there's a large degree of subjectivity. Let's say you don't
3603.74,3607.64," think that principles are important in this debate, and you think that only what's important is improving the media sphere."
3607.84,3608.8, We win this for four reasons.
3609.06,3612.52," One, we tell you why medias have an incentive to be pulled towards the center."
3612.74,3613.84, They care about their advertisers.
3614.1,3619.64," They want to garner as many people as they want, and if they only cater to the fringes, there aren't enough people on the fringes to actually make your ends meet."
3619.92,3623.5," They gave us their own incentive for this, which is that other media outlets will call you out."
3623.7,3626.72," Sure, but then they can call you out for being biased under your side of the aisle as well,"
3626.72,3630.56," on our side of the aisle as well, which gives us an even greater incentive to be objective."
3630.56,3635.04," Let's say, secondly, that they are biased, but then why would they actually portray the other"
3635.04,3641.2," side well? Why would Rupert Murdoch, on any side of the aisle, want to show a pro-regulation gun"
3641.2,3644.96," activist fairly? They're likely to give the weakest expert, or they like to show the most"
3644.96,3648.32," extreme viewpoint, so that people are polarized, people opt into less into that side of"
3648.32,3653.12," the aisle, meaning rational choices happen less. Third point, even if it's shown well, we think"
3653.12,3656.88," that it's likely to moderate very few amount of people. A Trump supporter, just because he sees"
3656.88,3661.52," Fox News criticizing Trump, isn't going to go against Fox News. They're going to go against"
3661.52,3664.64," Trump. They're going to go against Fox News. They're then likely to go into social media,"
3664.64,3667.04," which is far, far worse because nobody is holding them"
3667.04,3670.88, accountable they're completely anonymous so all of their hearts significantly amplify on their side
3670.88,3675.12, of the aisle i literally explained this in my speech they had no engagement whatsoever but
3675.12,3679.6, lastly i just think that some ideologies should not be portrayed at all every single time you
3679.6,3682.48, want to talk about blm under there's not the aisle you need to have someone talk about white
3682.48,3686.64, lives matter you need to assume that some people might actually opt into the anti-vaxxers if their
3686.64,3690.48," experts are actually good, that is their best case, that the representation is good. At the"
3690.48,3693.6," end of this debate, we are the only side that keeps the government in check. We are the only"
3693.6,3696.96," side that gives you the information you actually need. For all those reasons, oppose."
3701.76,3705.0," Great. I thank the speaker for the very fine speech. Call him upon, God will reply."
3705.0,3706.0," Hear, hear."
3718.0,3722.0," At the end of the day, I'm very unclear as to what opposition thinks about choice."
3722.0,3726.72, At first they say that the government is forcing a choice down their throat and people have the ability to choose for themselves but in their
3726.72,3730.08, second speaker and third they said oh choice doesn't matter as long as they're a net utility
3730.08,3734.16, good but what exactly is it right why not just regulate to the best ideas possible yeah because
3734.16,3738.16, like they said it's extremely hard to determine what is good and if the government cannot do it
3738.16,3741.68, why not just expose people to ideas and let them choose for themselves this is the principle the
3741.68,3744.72, principle from the very beginning right that choice is already being limited limited by the
3744.72,3747.2, wealthy limited by the corporations limited by the elite it's time
3747.2,3751.2, for the government to actually step in and put people back to a moderate point of viewpoint
3751.2,3755.36, which you can see both sides and determine clearly based on their own preferences i'm going to do two
3755.36,3758.88, things first about the principle and secondly about the quality of news but first a bit of
3758.88,3762.4, a clarification why is the pronoun regulation is just a massive knife and why do we not have to
3762.4,3766.4," deal with it right i think if the fcc is biased, they will find ways to make objective viewpoints"
3766.4,3767.4, subjective as well.
3767.4,3770.86, In order for this debate to work if they use regulations on their side of the House to
3770.86,3773.98, the SEC has to have some form of legitimacy accountability and if it's if we don't have
3773.98,3776.8, to defend for a corrupt system or else this debate wouldn't happen in of itself.
3776.8,3780.02," So moving on what happened in this debate, firstly, we talked about the principle right"
3780.02,3783.78, we told you how corporations have the incentive to solidify viewer base and through radicalism
3783.78,3786.12," and bias right, they can be seen as moderate to gain avenue."
3786.26,3791.2," They can be seen as this, but they can be selectively biased because the people at the top can selectively filter things out."
3791.44,3792.28, What did oppositions say?
3792.48,3795.64," They said that, oh, they're one click away, so choice isn't actually limited."
3795.88,3797.68," But secondly, that we are also infringing on choice."
3798.06,3807.82," Not only have we pointed out multiple times why this doesn't engage with the nuance of our case, we're getting nuance as to why it's not one click away. And when people are opting into this news source like Fox or BBC, they're going to go down or"
3807.82,3812.3," spiraling in terms of going to be more radical, going to view the other side as lesser because"
3812.3,3816.32," of this polarization, because of this little forms of bias that they can pick out. They can't really"
3816.32,3819.72," pick out because it's so small. And we told you why people's choices are being expanded,"
3819.9,3823.5, not infringed by the government. I think it's very funny for them to say that government is
3823.5,3826.8, shoving choices down their throat when we literally expose people to more and more choices
3826.8,3827.98, as to what they can choose
3827.98,3829.14," and let them choose for themselves,"
3829.14,3830.44, not being forced into one.
3830.44,3832.36," Their whole response is to use intuition pumps,"
3832.36,3833.58," but this doesn't actually work, right?"
3833.58,3834.76," Like people with liberal views,"
3834.76,3836.66," they can still read on the reviews if they want,"
3836.66,3837.86," they can still expand their choice,"
3837.86,3840.12," but for a large majority of the news sources,"
3840.12,3842.08, we tell you that it's a principal obligation
3842.08,3843.24, to show both sides of the story
3843.24,3844.54, because they influence many people
3844.54,3846.68," and they coerce a lot of them if they don't show both sides, right? Their response to this was also to mitigate, saying that it's a principal obligation to show both sides of the story because they influence many people and they coerce a lot of them if they don't show both sides."
3846.68,3849.66, Right. Their response to this was also to mitigate saying that's already moderate.
3849.66,3853.14," But if it's already moderate, then the harms about why you get more polarization simply don't stand."
3853.14,3856.8, This will probably want to see moderate viewpoints on both sides of the House. That point is out of this debate.
3856.8,3860.16, The importance of this principle is as we gave you a lot of reasons why choice matter.
3860.16,3863.94," They try to like flush it out by saying choice was never explained. But actually, we did explain it to you a lot."
3863.94,3868.6," We told you it's a function of self-identity, what house with discourse, what happens with trust in the government in and of itself, right?"
3868.7,3876.8," Because like they said, if choice really matters and people have trust in the government, then they're more likely to be themselves and to identify themselves in the political spectrum and make that legitimate viewpoint."
3877.48,3883.72," Secondly, then on the question of quality and use point, they had a few minor holes in their argument about poking holes, but none of them were actually proved, right?"
3883.84,3886.62," And we rebutted them, they completely dropped them like for the first point about how"
3886.62,3890.1, funding doesn't decrease these are large multinational corporations guys they're not
3890.1,3893.34, going to be like even if they have a loss in ad revenue they're probably still going to be funding
3893.34,3897.44, and up and running even if that even if people lose them on our side but secondly there are
3897.44,3901.4, existing incentives to show news of national importance so things don't disappear right and
3901.4,3905.62, importantly then we flip their point about how there about how people have to represent on the same things
3905.62,3907.2, and why that leads to a drive of diversity.
3907.2,3908.92, When you can no longer differentiate themselves
3908.92,3910.72," on different viewpoints on an issue,"
3910.72,3912.82, you find more issues to represent in and of itself.
3912.82,3913.98, So you get more representation.
3913.98,3915.62, They never responded to this claim as well.
3915.62,3917.92, So we flipped this claim on why you report on less things.
3917.92,3919.82," Lastly, then a quality news about polarization."
3919.82,3921.04, This was a 30 second extension.
3921.04,3923.68," I find it obvious that they tried to blow it up and whip,"
3923.68,3924.82, but it doesn't actually work great.
3924.82,3928.0, We told you how radicals get worse naturally on yourselves due to existing
3928.0,3931.84, incentives and structural issues within the system but secondly we told you why people still opt into
3931.84,3935.36, these large news because of quality because of legitimacy other things that they never responded
3935.36,3939.2, to as well but thirdly we told you that even if news is already moderate then the extremes probably
3939.2,3942.8, won't be that large of a thing right and lastly about the point about how some views don't get
3942.8,3947.84, to be represented i find this very under explained we told you why exactly these views if they're so problematic wouldn't be
3947.84,3952.0, explained in the first side but even if they are that helps to engage in discussion and debate and
3952.0,3955.44, actually is probably going to be more fostering to actual representation and catering towards
3955.44,3959.2, policies and engagement and rebuttal in and of itself i want to point out that at the end of
3959.2,3962.96, this day we have so proved our principle of why you have an obligation to show people different
3962.96,3965.94, parts of the spectrum and give them a choice. If you force them into a corner
3965.94,3967.54," and force them to believing something,"
3967.54,3969.28," you have the option to give them another chance,"
3969.28,3971.5," another point of what they can believe in,"
3971.5,3972.66, not to force them into one.
3972.66,3975.26," For all these reasons, we're very proud to propose."
3980.36,3981.62," Okay, amazing."
3981.62,3982.94," Thanks so much, everybody,"
3982.94,3985.12, for what was Adrienne's good round.
3985.12,3986.26, Stop recording.
