0.0,10.66," And assuming all judges and speakers are ready, without further ado, I call upon the first speaker of side's position to deliver their speech."
11.56,13.54, Cool. I prefer POIs verbally.
14.22,15.4, Can you time this?
17.24,18.18, Can you time this?
18.6,20.06," Wait, I think you're unmuted."
21.74,22.1," Okay, cool."
22.44,23.0," Not bad, sorry."
23.8,24.28, No worries.
24.64,29.34," Okay, I'm going to start in three two one in a world that's"
29.34,34.32, overwhelmingly negative and hopeless on critical issues positive political fiction can be a beacon
34.32,39.2, of hope never been proud to propose a few points are set up first this is a narrative motion i
39.2,43.04, even think that political fiction is extremely powerful it influences thought ideology and is
43.04,48.22," extremely important but why is political fiction narrative setting? Why do people actually buy it? Number one,"
48.22,52.6," because it's fiction. They tend to make it exceptionally realistic, meaning to say characters"
52.6,56.96, are often based on real life rules and issues are often based on real life issues that people
56.96,61.58," can relate to. But secondly, art is a huge narrative setting. People often internalize"
61.58,68.96," things that they watch on TV shows, especially because they don't have any other avenues to refer to for like that's inside source of politics. They tend to"
68.96,73.28, make this their notion of government. This is unique as compared to the news or other forms
73.28,77.84," of media where political news is direct and maybe not as entertaining and influential. But thirdly,"
77.84,81.36, we say that political politics here refers to like democratic issues. We're not talking about things
81.36,87.28," that are entirely fictional, but with regards to the spirit of the motion, this takes place in like things like liberal democracies. But fourthly,"
87.46,92.08," positive fiction refers to fiction when change is possible, where people can get better outcomes."
92.48,96.48, This usually looks like a bad beginning when people are in like a mess and certain protagonists
96.48,100.98," make huge changes. This is either internal, like people within the office are brave and great and"
100.98,104.7," they make structural change and they change like corrupt structures, or this is external, where"
104.7,107.76, there's like revolutions. a new government is voted in people
107.76,111.76, taken in their own hands who change the way the government works either way it sets the narrative
111.76,115.68, that you are positive and optimistic and no but panel there'll still be some like some level of
115.68,119.52, negative fiction on our side as well first argument then on how we get better political
119.52,124.56, spheres is that when your image on the inside of the government is based on the art that you consume
124.56,125.62," the following manifests if positivity positivity is on the art that you consume, the following manifests."
126.06,132.18," If positivity is displayed, you believe that people within the governments are good people that are willing to make change."
132.46,134.98, It gives people the potential possibility of change and happiness.
135.22,138.78," But it's important to note that in the status quo, the political views are kind of sad."
139.06,145.58," The kinds of negative narratives that opposition will talk about already exist. Because people see huge issues, right? They see cultural divides in India."
145.58,148.1, They see structural issues in places like the US
148.1,150.58," in terms of like prisons and things like that, right?"
150.58,151.74, And they see no reform.
151.74,154.38, And there's far more voter out there
154.38,155.82, because of things like the bystander effect
155.82,157.36, where you lose faith in the ability
157.36,159.02, for yourself to influence outcomes.
159.02,161.74, Like we see media currently being extremely negative
161.74,162.86," in the case of like climate change,"
162.86,164.8, like racism that are virulent in society.
164.8,169.1, And we think the harsh reality of the status quo paired with negative tv shows inspires nihilism
169.1,172.84, meaning to say people see that the governments are even worse than they thought they were they
172.84,176.64, internalize these worst images of the government and are therefore likely to go further into their
176.64,180.44, rabbit holes on like nihilistic politics where they have no faith in the government this is
180.44,184.0, extremely harmful because number one it means like less government scrutiny because people think that
184.0,187.12," there's less they can do to change political outcomes. And in bad governments,"
187.12,190.48, it means that there's a risk of governments cementing their power where fewer people vote.
190.48,194.72," But secondly, it just means less social progress on movements like Black Lives Matter or climate"
194.72,197.84," change, which are seeming to be less achievable at the point where people think that movements"
197.84,202.88," are unlikely to be hopeful or likely to change. We prevent all of these harms in three ways. First,"
202.88,209.04, we glorify politics. We show them that political systems like these political systems in a positive light through these political
209.04,214.48, fictions number one glorify views you're far more likely to be enthralled by things like voting
214.48,219.12, elections and democratic processes these seem boring in the status quo and is further demonized
219.12,222.72, on their side of the house when you feel that you can't make a change but secondly you have good
222.72,228.64, realistic people playing politicians the sense to mitigate existing views or even trump them it instills that faith in
228.64,233.04, people this is the same like effect as like the movie maricom in like india bringing faith and
233.04,237.2, attention to sport of boxing in india it shows them that there's it shows them like a positive
237.2,241.2, light such as this it can incite the same kind of impact inspires hope the impacts here is that
241.2,244.4, people can actually think that their vote is far more meaningful when they realize that their vote
244.4,246.96," is more likely to incite political change, given that fiction"
246.96,251.64, instills these positive mindsets and less the kind of hopelessness that a status quo news bubble kind
251.64,257.32," of brings. But secondly, we build optimism. We tell you that political fiction often places a"
257.32,261.74," large focus on changing large systems that have been in place for a long time, right? These are"
261.74,265.44, large governmental systems. for example um like the
265.44,268.32, negative media fiction like the positive media fiction book they may even go to like the
268.32,273.2, transition from autocratic controlling government like a far more democratic one this is not an easy
273.2,276.88, like transition to for ordinary people to do you're literally changing the way governments
276.88,281.04, work you're literally having to carry out protests inciting revolution things like that this means
281.04,284.64, that people who read these kinds of books are far more pessimistic about actually being able to
284.64,287.28, achieve these political outcomes but on the comparative by
287.28,291.52, virtue of being like positive and optimistic you inspire people to act you show success stories
291.52,295.2, about ordinary people like readers were able to create a positive impact they can see that they
295.2,299.12, aren't like a tiny drop in like a large ocean but there's a narrative that real change can take
299.12,303.2, place as it stresses on the potential for positive outcomes and um note that opposition can't come
303.2,306.96, and say this isn't realistic because we already disproved that in framing the impacts here are massive right we
306.96,310.56, want to nuance the impacts of these in accordance with the different areas and actors in this debate
310.56,314.8, first in areas that require huge delta these are areas of where the government is a corrupt where
314.8,318.96, people have no faith positive positive shows you the following things in these areas number one we
318.96,322.8, think that even if they we don't get the delta in terms of social change in these places it's still
322.8,326.28, better to have cause positive content because people require distractions
326.28,327.94, from the troubles within these areas.
327.94,331.0," A happy, fun image is far more likely to serve this cause"
331.0,333.14, than something that reminds them of their harsh reality.
333.14,335.5, Even the art source of distraction on our side
335.5,337.22," for these people as some sort of escape,"
337.22,338.96," but on their side, it reminds them of sorrow"
338.96,341.54, and instills further loathing of the systems around them.
341.54,343.8," This is also likely to impact the way they view,"
343.8,345.16," the way they actually lead their lives, right?"
345.16,347.1," On an individual level, they're still what's up."
347.1,348.84," But second, in areas where the government faith"
348.84,349.8," is relatively good,"
349.8,352.04, these are areas where like people see problems
352.04,352.88," in the status quo,"
352.88,354.64, but they're not entirely like distorted and nihilistic.
354.64,356.46," This is where we get definite Delta panel,"
356.46,357.58," because here, number one,"
357.58,359.68, you have more hope within existing social movements.
359.68,361.44," You get more traction, but secondly,"
361.44,362.8," you have a more positive view on like,"
362.8,364.3," actually your involvement in the system, right?"
364.3,367.56, You're far more likely to opt in and actually um want to change the system
367.56,372.6, before I move on to my third mechanism I'll take a pure one for a white person in the US when are
372.6,376.92, they more likely to be alarmed into action by watching parks and rec where everyone gets along
376.92,381.36, smoothly and politicians are just inherently lovely or in the king where for insulated people
381.36,385.44, you see the harms of nepotism we characterized what this um what these
385.44,389.92, positive political fictions look like in our setup right we told you that there's a change um like
389.92,393.76, first of all parkster is a comedy right it's not political fiction it's a sitcom but we told you
393.76,398.48, that um there's a progressive change from someone who sees there's a like a difficult situation in
398.48,401.52, the status quo and want to change it both internally externally i already said that
401.52,407.92, so now how we get better and more embedded critique of politicians side opposition is going to argue that negative political fiction is a form of art that
407.92,412.4, criticizes the system and keeps it accountable this is extremely flawed panel as the impact of
412.4,416.8, the show by itself is very minimal there are other more impactful means of criticizing the system
416.8,421.12, like media news and legal proceedings so the real impact stems from whether it's able to galvanize
421.12,425.58," people to critique the government on these matters we We employ to judge the debate by this metric,"
425.58,426.72," because as mentioned before,"
426.72,429.18, people have far more likely to become more complacent
429.18,430.78," because of negative political fiction, right?"
430.78,432.12, Even if it does a great job
432.12,433.7, at bringing to light structural issues
433.7,434.96," in the political system of government,"
434.96,437.06," it does not manage to get the crucial stakeholder,"
437.06,439.98, the viewer excited enough to want to critique the system
439.98,440.98, or do something about it.
440.98,442.36," This is because of the reasons we gave you, right?"
442.36,444.56," We told you that negative fiction, political fiction"
444.56,446.4, is often shown that in order to actually critique
446.4,447.44," and bring about change,"
447.44,450.36, several uncompromisable hurdles and challenges
450.36,452.76," must be faced, which disincentivizes the viewer,"
452.76,454.8, especially given like the status quo liberal bubbles
454.8,456.82," that tell them that the world is not doing that well,"
456.82,459.26, tell them that the world is hopeless.
459.26,461.16, Apart from viewers that are getting generally more interest
461.16,463.0," in this system, they're also gonna want to believe"
463.0,466.96, in the potential for achieving these positive outcomes. but viewers are far more likely to have higher
466.96,471.76, expectations of the current political setup and look to compare current governments or political
471.76,475.76, processes with ones that they have seen fictionally of course it's like rooted in reality as viewers
475.76,479.04, are like rational enough to distinguish from impossible fiction and reality but this results
479.04,484.16, in like more and like more better and more active critique right viewers are far more invested in
484.16,489.36, the first place in in like the political system secondly viewers are far far more likely to set higher expectations
489.36,492.96, for the political system and want to attempt to achieve it either through like voting or
492.96,497.2, best activism it's just like if i see president tom kirkman and like designated survivor being
497.2,500.88, able to pass bipartisan policies through compromise and reasoning i hold president
500.88,504.72, biden to a much higher standard to achieve the same thing and these higher expectations are
504.72,507.54," always better than lower expectations in a political system,"
507.54,510.72," even if they're unrealistic, as long as voters are engaged enough with a political setup."
510.72,514.24," When on our side, we get governments and politicians forced to live up to higher expectations,"
514.24,517.88, making it much harder for them to push on propaganda and campaigns and discuss minor
517.88,518.88, issues.
518.88,522.24," We get greater bipartisanship, which is far more achievable as positive fiction often"
522.24,526.24, has a potential for arriving at solutions rather than the impossibility of it never been prouder to propose
530.08,552.6," thank you Hi, just checking that I'm both audible and visible."
553.38,553.68, Yep.
554.4,554.96, Amazing.
557.36,558.4," Georges, all set?"
560.48,560.92, Excellent.
561.7,565.64," So thank you to the first proposition speaker for their speech, and you may begin whenever"
565.64,566.64, you are set.
566.64,568.56," Yeah, just give me one second start."
568.56,600.38," Karthik, you need to move your sheet a little bit please. Speaker, when Donald Trump launched an insurrection on Capitol Hill on the 6th of January, we"
600.38,601.38, called it Orwellian.
601.38,607.08, We analogized it to the manipulative Frank Underwood's impeachment from House of Cards.
607.52,614.38, We think that this emphasized its villainy. It helped us communicate it and made the deliverance of justice swift and effective.
614.8,617.24, That is the world we support on our side of the House.
617.62,621.3," Two arguments on Team India. First, on why we create more political engagement."
621.7,629.3," And second, on why this engagement translates to beneficial outcomes. Before that, what's our stance on this debate? First, on optimism. What does this look"
629.3,633.92," like? We think they broadly need to understand and push three things. First, a presumption that"
633.92,639.12," democracy is fairer. It will all work out. So we think that in shows like Parks and Recreation,"
639.18,643.98," where the main character is played by Amy Poehler, saying that city government is amazing, come over,"
644.06,649.68," you'll always be heard. Even if these are sitcoms, fundamentally, these are political fiction, at the point at which"
649.68,653.86," they fictionally describe politics. Like, I don't get where they were going with that POI response"
653.86,658.58," at first. Second, we think that these shows are often lighthearted in nature. So necessarily,"
658.78,663.52," they are things like sitcoms like Beat, West Wing, and Parks and Rec, at the point at which they need"
663.52,670.08," to be positive, at the point at which they need to be optimistic and lighthearted by virtue of emotion. Third, it idealizes politicians"
670.08,675.78, and feeds utopic pictures of the world. Women in office despite the context of the real world.
676.14,680.14," Politicians being showed as benevolent, running for your communities and for the right reasons,"
680.38,687.82," where everyone works together at the end of the day. What is the comparative on pessimism? Before I explain this, one important response to gov."
687.82,690.98, Our case is the only unique way of spreading this narrative.
690.98,691.82, Why?
691.82,693.78, Because of the analysis first proposition gives you.
693.78,696.48," That is to say, fiction serves a really important purpose"
696.48,697.98, in terms of spreading a message.
697.98,700.82, And therefore this is the unique way to do it.
700.82,702.18, What does our policy look like?
702.18,705.6," First, if you show democracy, showing it as being broken fran"
705.6,710.0, underwood in the house of cards seeing the dirty game of politics where he horse treats issues he
710.0,715.12, campaigned on and arm quests the senate it characterizes politicians as fundamentally greedy
715.12,719.6, and power hungry but second it shows authoritarianism and overreach this looks like
719.6,725.26," george orwell's 1983 which tells you big brother is watching. Crucially, it emphasizes in the plot"
725.26,730.72," two things. First, that you devolve into evil because of inaction. There's an initial conception"
730.72,735.44," of good when you have good states, but at the point at which we let evil fester and don't take"
735.44,740.2," action against it, you end up with these terrible scenarios. Second, we also often just show you"
740.2,744.8," working within broken systems. And yes, these are dark stories, we're sure. You don't end up with"
744.8,749.2," the system being fixed perfectly, but we end with you opening your eyes and recognizing that the"
749.2,754.16, system is unjust like you do in black mirror before i move on with my case a few bits of
754.16,760.4, engagement first i want to deal with the big thing that they tell you in stance that people change
760.4,768.96, corrupt structures and fix all these problems because like look i think that their conception of this round is wrong because if these movies show you massive successes yeah
768.96,774.3, then they're optimistic however you can't glorify political system its first proposition once and
774.3,778.7, be overwhelmingly positive at the point at which you have to establish the brutality that you are
778.7,783.12, moving away from at the point at which you show the first bad point of authoritarianism in the
783.12,789.2, first place that means that the system has to be bad and you can't push infallibility i like the fact that their speaker
789.2,794.16, is nodding along to my speech i like that they understand this on the first argument look we
794.16,799.6, think that you end up glorifying politics on their side of the house that's the analysis that you get
799.6,804.64, from them government takes on the burden of glorification crucially this is terrible why
804.64,806.3, because it shows that it's infallible.
806.42,808.26, There's the presumption of benevolence.
808.36,809.96, At the point at which first proposition
809.96,812.2," characterizes this to you as being powerful,"
812.5,814.38," as carrying on into the real world,"
814.52,816.48, that's the point at which you don't get accountability
816.48,817.56," on their side of the house,"
817.78,819.68," especially because their words, not mine,"
819.9,821.2, you glorify the system.
821.62,824.04," Second, like their benefits on fun and escapism"
824.04,824.74, are symmetric.
824.88,825.2, There's lots
825.2,831.44, of other genres that you can engage with but the last flip to this look false optimism is toxic
831.44,835.92, why because minority groups push on and on for change on their side of the house they're told
835.92,841.2, to be optimistic but they never get it because of unjust systems and the power asymmetry the problem
841.2,849.92, with their side of the house is that it pushes the onus onto you you feel like you are at fault for not getting change lastly on the second argument on setting higher expectation
849.92,855.04, look personal position flip-flops and how realistic this actually is but if i see social
855.04,859.52, movement say you know what i saw on netflix that you as a political party can be better
859.52,863.92, that's the point that which social movements are called stupid that's the point at which they are
863.92,868.24, villainized and delegitimized and their ability to get change goes away when you start comparing
868.24,873.06," real-world governments to fictional governments from designated survivors. On the first argument,"
873.68,878.06," why do they worth the engagement on their side of the house? A few reasons this is true. First,"
878.6,884.12," positive shows have a sense of inevitability. That is to say, democracy will always work itself out."
884.34,889.48," At the end of the day, there will always be a happy ending. This fundamentally takes away agency from individual"
889.48,894.2, voters because you don't think your vote matters because it always works out at the end of the day.
894.2,898.6, That is bad because that means you don't vote but crucially here's the important mechanism
898.6,903.6, lots and lots of people don't vote and that creates a collective action problem where I am
903.6,908.4," less likely to march, where I'm less likely to protest and vote. That makes engagement with politics and accountability"
908.4,913.96," worse. But second, we think that these shows are unrelatable to people because as press propositions"
913.96,918.78," themselves concede, the real world isn't as perfect. That means you can't picture yourself"
918.78,924.5, in these shows with the perfect representation of women and minorities in governments and
924.5,925.76, benevolent leaders
925.76,930.4, that means you drop this book you switch the tv channel and you decide to watch something else
930.4,935.52, instead this is terrible because if both sides in this debate agree any political fiction is a good
935.52,940.48, in and of itself that's why both sides by virtue of this motion are fine with the other side showing
940.48,944.88, either positive or negative fiction in the minority this fiction is good because it creates
944.88,949.12, interest and awareness about politics but when you don't engage with the genre at all on
949.12,954.8, their side of the house you can't get any benefits whatsoever on comparative why are we far better
954.8,959.68, voter turnout concrete what they say increases on our side of the house why because and the
959.68,964.16, collective action problem is fixed because you are more likely to vote and participate in democracy
964.16,969.66, when you are motivated by fear why because this is inherent human nature this is why the most
969.66,974.64, prominent form of campaigning in democracy is fear-mongering the reason why we had the highest
974.64,979.5, political voter turnout in the US in 2020 was because people were scared of another Trump
979.5,983.7, administration we think that we fixed the collective action problem because these books
983.7,986.92, show how society has led these problems faster and it's been ignorant.
987.12,989.78," That forces people to action. Before I move on, yeah."
990.98,999.06," So you talk about voting through fear, but on our side, we tell you that you're essentially telling people that even if you vote, there are going to be negative consequences to that vote."
999.3,1008.48," Whereas you give an example of Trump, whereas people had the belief that they could remove Trump from office, which does not happen in negative political. So what we're saying is that at the point at which you didn't vote,"
1008.48,1012.48," that's how you end up with Frank Underwood. That's how you end up with terrible politicians,"
1012.48,1017.2," a cycle of ignorance. On our side, you recognize that you don't have to be ignorant and that when"
1017.2,1021.52," you step in, you can prevent these horrible politicians from coming to power in the first"
1021.52,1025.5," place. Let's then move on to the second argument. Look, to make"
1025.5,1030.78," politics seem optimistic, you can't show the depressing idea of women being labeled, quote"
1030.78,1036.02," unquote, not electable. The reality of politicians like AOC being called slurs when they're allowed,"
1036.32,1040.64, never being taken as seriously as your male peers. You can't show African Americans being
1040.64,1044.28," gerrymandered because that's, quote unquote, pessimistic. That's showing that there's a"
1044.28,1046.0, glaring issue in the system.
1046.0,1050.0," That means you end up with shows like Weep and Parks and Rec where you gloss over sexism,"
1050.0,1054.0," where you add love traps and minimize the scale of harm because that's how you're positive,"
1054.0,1059.0," that's how you're happy. In our side, you have shows like Queen, 13th, and The First Lady"
1059.0,1063.0, that show how structurally disadvantaged minorities are in politics in the first place.
1063.0,1066.04, We think that that means we fundamentally on our side of the House
1066.32,1069.48," finally, finally, finally have an acknowledgement of these problems."
1069.48,1072.92," This acknowledgement of problems is the most important thing in this round,"
1073.0,1075.4, because at the point at which you don't acknowledge these problems
1075.56,1078.92," in the first place, you can never actually hold people accountable."
1079.04,1081.72," At the end of this round, we've proven to you a few things."
1081.96,1086.44," First, that you make accountability far better and that you increase political participation"
1086.44,1087.28, and engagement.
1087.28,1089.08," For all of those reasons, vote off."
1091.88,1148.84, Thank you. All right. Could I ask Team India if you could keep your camera on? Did you miss any part of the speaker just now?
1148.84,1151.84," After this speech, I think."
1151.84,1152.84," Okay, yeah."
1152.84,1153.84," Okay, you're fine."
1153.84,1154.84," Hello, apologies."
1154.84,1155.84, Can you hear me?
1155.84,1158.84, I think my internet connection just died.
1158.84,1167.98," Okay, I didn't miss any part of the speech."
1167.98,1168.74, So we're good.
1175.62,1177.12, OK.
1177.12,1179.88, Give me one second so I can reset something
1179.88,1207.68, in the connection. Can you hear and see me?
1208.58,1209.28, Yeah.
1210.04,1211.08, Yes? Okay.
1215.34,1217.68, Excellent. This should be okay.
1220.5,1221.74, Yeah. Okay.
1222.42,1223.64, Are judges ready to proceed?
1227.0,1237.0," Cool. I'll ask if possible, I'm not sure if this is an issue with my internet, but Team India, if you could have your camera on throughout the duration of the debate."
1237.0,1240.0," Oh yeah, I'm so sorry about that. It's back on."
1240.0,1247.2," No worries. Thank you. All right. In which case, we thank the speaker for the speech and call upon the second speaker of Team Proposition to deliver the news."
1251.44,1261.96," I'm going to begin in three, two, one. Panel, if Parks and Rec is a positive political fiction, the office is about business and administration."
1262.48,1265.18, It is by definition a mockumentary. We think
1265.18,1270.66, Team India constantly takes us at our worst and you cannot let them get away with it. Here's the
1270.66,1274.84," thing, right? We think the key difference is this. Their speaker opens with an example about an"
1274.84,1281.44," impeachment. Impeachment can also happen on our side, but its results are fruitful. On their side,"
1281.44,1286.46," even after an attempted impeachment, Frank Underwood is still president."
1286.76,1291.76," That's the key difference. That's what happens. Three questions we ask on team proposition. One,"
1291.76,1297.3," which side gets more social change? Two, which side deals with issues better? And three,"
1297.56,1302.9," which side gets more toxic spheres? One then, on which side gets more social change? They constantly"
1302.9,1310.56, take us at our worst. Parks and recreation is a mockumentary. Not all positive fiction is lighthearted. My first speaker gives
1310.56,1315.28, you this insight up. Why do people watch this fiction? We tell you that fiction or like whether
1315.28,1320.56, it be in the form of a book or in a movie still likes to be realistic in order to maintain consumer
1320.56,1330.62," basis. Meaning to say you have realistic people, you have realistic issues, and you have real problems. Except on our side, you're able to overcome them. That means we can"
1330.62,1337.02," still have sexism, we can still have gerrymandering. It's just that on our side, we're actually able to"
1337.02,1341.62," overcome them by portraying good, healthy governments. But let's take them at their best"
1341.62,1345.54," here. Let's say we do have, say, even some lightheartedness."
1345.54,1360.04," We think even then, when you are lighthearted about problems like sexism or about problems like gerrymandering, it is more likely to actually people are more likely to internalize them as problems rather than on your side when they are desensitized to them."
1360.28,1372.58," Why is this the case? Because on our side, when you when you showcase something as satire, people are more likely not to notice it, but they are subconsciously, you instill in them that it's a problem and a problem that they might address in the future."
1372.84,1381.96," But on their side, people are constantly desensitized to things like sexism. Black people themselves are desensitized to racism because the unfortunate reality is this."
1381.96,1388.14," They encounter it in all spheres of life. You still address the problem better, even if it is addressed lightheartedly."
1388.46,1393.2," Now, why do we say that nihilism is more likely on their side than inspired change?"
1393.46,1396.48, There's one mech that both sides rely on in this debate.
1396.78,1398.72, What actually happens in the status quo?
1399.06,1401.04, They seem to think that the status quo is this.
1401.3,1402.32, People love the government.
1402.32,1404.04, People think the government is lovely.
1404.16,1404.96, The government is great.
1408.74,1413.84," And on their side, they expose problems. They inspire change. This is simply not true. The status quo is in short of problems. People know that governments are power"
1413.84,1419.2," hungry, like they suggest they are. People know that governments want authority. Fox News constantly"
1419.2,1424.46, reduces government trust. I think this is what both sides have their impacts resting on. Except
1424.46,1430.34," here's what happens on ours. On our side, you compare the image of a negative government that already exists,"
1430.5,1435.86, and you take it with the one of a positive. You're able to internalize a utopia that you think is
1435.86,1440.28," realistic simply because there are realistic characters, realistic people, good people"
1440.28,1446.1, playing those roles. You are more likely then to actually think that it's possible for you to make change
1446.1,1449.36, rather than for you to succumb to the harsh reality
1449.36,1450.56, that their side poses.
1450.56,1451.88," On their side, we tell you this."
1451.88,1453.86, You go further into your rabbit hole.
1453.86,1455.96," You are further, you're more nihilistic"
1455.96,1457.58, than you ever have been because you
1457.58,1461.56, lose faith in the political system of your nation.
1461.56,1463.34, The politics is already bad.
1463.34,1464.7, Their side demonizes it.
1464.7,1465.6," They make it worse. Very crucial note. bad, their side demonizes it, they make it worse."
1465.94,1470.7," Very crucial to note. Now, which side actually deals with issues better? Now, if you want to"
1470.7,1475.98, take us at our absolute worst and assume that all political fiction is parks and rec and all
1475.98,1481.4," negative fiction is like literally only about politics, here's the thing. We deal with issues"
1481.4,1494.1," better in places where abusive governments exist. Meaning to say, even if we are unable to inspire Delta, we make it easier for people to deal with authoritative governments, meaning to say people in these areas are constantly distressed."
1494.1,1505.02," People in these areas need a sense of distraction. They would like rather to see political fiction. They are more likely to see it, to want to watch it, and therefore internalize it subconsciously,"
1505.24,1510.72, than to watch something that literally reflects the harsh reality of their situation. Meaning to
1510.72,1517.12," say, if I am in a real-life situation that resembles that of House of Cards, I am more"
1517.12,1522.2," likely to want to watch parks and recreation, because it is something that distracts me from"
1522.2,1528.32," real-life issues. It acts as an escape for me. And in that process, I am more likely to internalize things."
1528.36,1530.0," Whereas when I'm watching House of Cards,"
1530.04,1534.44," all it does is pushes me further down the rabbit hole, and it makes me upset"
1534.48,1537.92," about my surroundings, upset about the people around me."
1537.96,1539.48, This makes things very difficult
1539.52,1544.12," on an individual scale, because as a person, it reduces contentment."
1544.16,1545.78, You're less likely to like not only
1545.78,1551.04, not vote even on a general scale you're less likely to do things like obey laws because you
1551.04,1556.42, you lose trust in the government entirely this is very important panel because even if none of us
1556.42,1562.96, get social change we like we deal with issues and trauma importantly better now which side
1562.96,1565.56," deals with bad politics better? But before that,"
1565.68,1573.14," I want to take a POI. Look, why can't we emphasize the scale of problems by doing things like talking"
1573.14,1577.32," about how something is our well-being, thus communicating the idea that it's terrible and"
1577.32,1582.3," evoking emotion because fiction is uniquely accessible? Fiction is uniquely accessible,"
1582.3,1586.0, and both sides of fiction can actually showcase the problem.
1586.0,1594.0," On our side, you can still have people being sexist, people troubling black people, except on our side, the government does things about that and change is made."
1594.0,1599.0," And on your side, people are pushed further down the rabbit hole and people lose faith in the system."
1599.0,1603.0, That's the key difference. We both showcase the problem. Only one showcases the solution.
1603.0,1605.76," Now, how do we normalize bad politics?"
1606.08,1609.28, How do you normalize or denormalize bad politics?
1609.5,1611.2, This is an independent path to victory.
1611.44,1614.12, Assuming that voters are really engaged with the political system
1614.12,1617.04," and are somehow still interested in democratic processes,"
1617.42,1619.42, negative political fiction is still bad.
1619.6,1623.32, Why? Because it helps desensitize or internalize bad politicians.
1623.62,1625.38," Meaning to say, on House of Cards,"
1625.52,1631.26," impeachments and bad precedents come way before Donald Trump did, right? This means that people"
1631.26,1636.62, have a very low bar for political politicians to actually cross. They are willing to allow
1636.62,1641.3, poor policy decisions or inappropriate actions at the cost of democracy itself because they are
1641.3,1645.04," used to seeing people that they actually like, TV show characters that"
1645.04,1650.16," they relate to, they think are humanized because of the TV shows, and when those same people are"
1650.16,1654.88," reflected in real life, you do not have that much of an issue with them. This looks like excusing"
1654.88,1659.92, Donald Trump's sexual offenses and potentially even marveling about it because you are used to
1659.92,1664.98," see leaders behave this way on House of Cards. This is a very, very crucial comparative panel"
1664.98,1665.36, because you
1665.36,1670.0, are on you're able to vote in politicians that are bad you're able to vote in politicians that
1670.0,1675.04, you ideally wouldn't but on their side because you are normalizing a bad overview of politicians
1675.04,1679.6, because you are internalizing this image you feel that it's normal you feel that it's somewhat
1679.6,1684.0, acceptable this is a harsh reality one that we are not willing to accept we tell you that
1684.0,1690.28, politicians are only able to get away with cheap mistakes and errors because it has been normalized through this kind of fiction.
1690.54,1694.64, The voting populace has largely given up on the potential for a good leader.
1694.92,1710.04," This is why we see voters being increasingly lenient with the age of leaders, the past history of leaders and even corruption. It leads to things like this. They are unable to equate these actions with relevant consequences as pop culture normalizes it for them through negative TV"
1710.04,1714.9, shows. The same way you normalize rappers taking lives in real life because of movies that
1714.9,1721.04, showcases that they do. You normalize politicians being inherently bad people. You let them get
1721.04,1727.68, away with it. You treat politicians as a restaurant where like every single meal in the buffet is that of a bad individual.
1728.0,1732.52," You tend to normalize it. Now, I'm sorry if I nodded in my speech."
1732.86,1736.62," It's just that when things are asserted, my neck tends to hurt. So proud to propose."
1740.54,1770.46, Thank you. Thank the speaker for their speech and now call upon the second speaker actually no sorry
1770.46,1772.12, judges are you good apologies.
1772.12,1778.3, yeah yeah yeah excellent cool thank you for their speech and call on the second speaker
1778.3,1797.0," side position to deliver there. Okay, can you hear me?"
1797.0,1814.36," Yeah. Okay, I'm going to start my speech in three, two, one, go."
1814.78,1819.32," Team UAE in this debate is very, very sneaky because they keep saying things like,"
1819.7,1827.0," imagine this utopia, imagine this perfect world in which democracy and the world is everything and there are no problems."
1827.0,1835.0," The reason they only stuck to this language is because that utopia just does not exist, and that utopia is something we'll never achieve."
1835.0,1845.32," And we would love for their next speaker to actually talk about what actually happens, because instead their second speaker decided to make their entire speech about being desensitized to harm. Now,"
1845.4,1850.58, I don't think people are watching five to six or like even 10 to 12 political movies. I think the
1850.58,1854.18, vast majority are going to stick to probably one or two. So that doesn't mean people are going to
1854.18,1859.28," take to the streets on either side of the debate. Instead, we think people on our side and movies"
1859.28,1864.58, will create movies that are often dystopias that make people feel bad about the fact that these
1864.58,1869.3, political situations arise and that we actually have to take action. We don't think that there are any
1869.3,1873.56, movies that second proposition realistically thinks this debate's about where people are
1873.56,1878.24, just desensitized to racism and democracy crumbling. What movies are they even watching
1878.24,1883.38," on their side? Two questions in the speech before my argument on how this is actually a bad thing,"
1883.38,1888.5," even if we take the absolute best case that you aim for idealism, firstly on change, secondly on engagement."
1888.92,1893.8, Firstly on change. What I want to do in the speech is I want to break the likely deadlock that will
1893.8,1897.9," exist between the two sides, because their side is saying that you're likely to hold politicians"
1897.9,1901.98," to a higher standard and higher expectation, and you're going to demand change. And our side is"
1901.98,1909.02," saying that you're going to notice that your politician is becoming more like the very villains in these dystopias. And as a result, you're likely"
1909.02,1914.3, to push for change. Why do we think we win this particular clash? The first reason is that they
1914.3,1918.76," themselves concede that on their side of the house, they're glorifying political institutions,"
1919.06,1923.8," they're glorifying politicians, that you should believe in these politicians because they're good"
1923.8,1925.42," people inherently. If that is the case, I do not think that you should believe in these politicians because they're good people inherently."
1930.48,1934.38," If that is the case, I do not think that you would reasonably be questioning the interests of the incentives of these politicians on your side of the house or think that they are horrible"
1934.38,1938.28," people. And as a result, we actually don't think that you're going to push for as much change as"
1938.28,1943.44," you will under our side of the house, because our side tells them that you should be skeptical"
1943.44,1945.36," of these individuals, whereas their"
1945.36,1951.34," side doesn't. But secondly, we explained to you why the force of paranoia, the force of the power"
1951.34,1956.1," of being risk averse, is something that is inherent to human nature. That is, under our side of the"
1956.1,1961.4," house, the moment you see your politician slipping and sliding into what is someone like Big Brother,"
1961.68,1970.32, that is when you are likely to do things like say oh my god this particular politician is becoming worse and worse and we cannot let that situation arise that
1970.32,1975.6, happens because people are inherently risk averse in society their side of the house relies on
1975.6,1981.44, optimism but optimism often comes with diminishing marginal returns that is every time a politician
1981.44,1990.38, does something better it doesn't feel that it doesn't feel like that additional benefit that that politician or like the additional policy that that politician passed is that good.
1990.38,1996.4, So you're not going to pressure that politician as much. You're more likely to do it in a world where you're more risk averse under our side.
1996.68,2009.52," But three, their side is devoid from reality. Tell me what politician out there or what political systems out there in the world that just have people who just love politics who just love the people who are not corrupt who are not inherently selfish we think"
2009.52,2013.76, the sad reality of the world is that there there are there are these people that overwhelmingly
2013.76,2018.8, exist so on the on the basis of reality we think it's much more better to have media that tells
2018.8,2022.16, them the truth that tells them that this is something that could get worse rather than lie
2022.16,2029.28," about it their side their second speaker thought that it was good to have their cake and eat it too, that Black people will apparently be"
2029.28,2034.96, desensitized to things like sexism. But the problem with this particular argument is that
2034.96,2038.64," on their side of the house, in a world where you're glorifying things like optimism, what"
2038.64,2043.12," inherently happens is that in a movie, even though you're talking about the problem or the thought"
2043.12,2048.64," that government systems aren't working, you need to structurally devote more time for the optimistic elements of"
2048.64,2053.68, the movie than the bad or the sad parts of the movie which means you simplify things like racism
2053.68,2058.16, you make it very easy um to like overcome which we think is actually kind of offensive so if they
2058.16,2061.84, really cared about making sure that these movies were sensitive to different groups of people
2061.84,2067.98, we don't think that they're all sensitive under their side where they simplify the problems when we actually think the problem of racism deserves
2067.98,2073.34," more time. And we think that, yes, it is something akin to dystopia that we need to address and not"
2073.34,2079.86, let occur. Second question in the speech on engagement. Their side basically says that
2079.86,2083.56," people will like voting, they'll glorify the process, they're more likely to engage in it."
2083.78,2090.16, Our side is saying that if you don't vote or if you don't take action this dystopia is likely to arise why do we
2090.16,2095.2, think that we win this particular clash here the first here is that you are more likely to take it
2095.2,2099.76, seriously under our side of the house because they conceded that the types of shows that will occur
2099.76,2104.32, that will exist on their side are things like sitcoms that make politics easy that don't make
2104.32,2108.38," it something that really impacts people's lives, because it's just something that like in deep,"
2108.56,2113.38," the politician can laugh to. On our side, we make it something that can really affect people's lives"
2113.38,2119.1," in bad ways. And as a result, the fact that this cost is really high, means that your cost benefit"
2119.1,2123.24," analysis of not voting or not acting is glorified under our side of the house, which means you're"
2123.24,2130.32," more likely to vote on our side than theirs. But second, we think success is much more measurable, right? So success"
2130.32,2135.08," on our side of the house is preventing dystopia, preventing Trump from getting elected into power."
2135.28,2140.16," That is something that is a clearer goal that you can conceptualize and get than like, I don't know,"
2140.38,2145.54," have the US, have they, I don't know, the Indian, you know, government become that of Finland. We"
2145.54,2150.82, think it's very hard to like get there than it is to like prevent a dystopia from happening. So we
2150.82,2153.9, think people are more likely to engage in this because they just think that it's something they
2153.9,2157.7," can do. And they're not going to be like, I'm never going to reach this idealistic world. It's"
2157.7,2161.64, there's no point in actually achieving it. So we think we're more likely to have momentum because
2161.64,2167.66, we actually say that this change is something that is reasonable and something that you can actually achieve. But the third way in which we break this
2167.66,2172.4," is that we've explained that on our side of the house, no thank you, dystopias, or rather not just"
2172.4,2177.06," dystopias, but just broken political systems or struggles are more relatable to people than"
2177.06,2181.9, idealistic worlds. And the reason for this is because people always complain that their government
2181.9,2186.64," isn't doing anything, unless their side believes that governments are just, you know, doing everything perfectly."
2187.02,2196.08," The fact that people know that there are problems with their governments means that on our side of the house, they're more likely to do things like actually relate to things, to dystopic films."
2196.08,2200.46," On their side, when you spend more of your time glorifying the idea, no, thank you."
2200.6,2208.0, You're not likely to believe that this is real. You're likely to believe that this is fantasy world or as they said utopia and you're not going to engage with it as much you're not
2208.0,2211.76, actually going to think politics is the same way we think that the state of the world is that
2211.76,2216.4, there's more populism the there's democratic black sliding in places like poland so we think our
2216.4,2220.88, films are more relatable and we'll have more engagement i'll take that poi if dystopia is
2220.88,2232.84," relatable why do you need it for skepticism the reason you need it is because of the fact that you need movies that actually bring people into caring about politics in the first place, right?"
2232.96,2238.2," These movies, as you yourself blared out, have unique benefits in actually making people care about the political system."
2238.5,2242.84," Those films capitalize on that. On your side, no one watches these films the way they do on our side."
2242.84,2245.12, Why do we think on um our third
2245.12,2249.68, argument here is taking them at their absolute best case why do we think aspiring for idealism
2249.68,2254.24, is bad there are three reasons for this the first is that often idealism is westernized right so
2254.24,2258.64, it's concepts like democracy which we don't necessarily think um work in like the vast
2258.64,2264.08, majority of contexts and and and many other countries but secondly it's often um there's
2264.08,2266.62, just never going to be an idealistic world.
2266.62,2267.88, There's never gonna be a perfect world
2267.88,2270.38, because there are always trade-offs that have to be made.
2270.38,2272.72," But three, we don't often think that it's possible"
2272.72,2275.0, or pragmatic to have this form of idealism
2275.0,2277.6, because it's just impossible to achieve it in some cases.
2277.6,2279.44," So in places like Africa,"
2279.44,2282.32, we know that there are so many different ethnicities in it.
2282.32,2283.96, So it's really difficult to like ensure
2283.96,2288.94," a perfect form of governance. We know this is the case because we've all been working really hard on the Africa motion,"
2289.16,2293.44, which means that you'll never actually aspire or you'll never actually get to idealism in the first
2293.44,2297.44," place, which means you're wasting money, you're wasting time aspiring to it and never getting to"
2297.44,2301.9," it. On our side, at least in our worst case scenario, we prevent dystopia. We prevent"
2301.9,2309.14," governments from becoming worse. We think that's a much better world than getting nothing done at all. For all of those reasons, we're incredibly proud to stand on"
2309.14,2339.28, opposition. Thank you. panel also
2342.64,2346.34, okay we thank you for your speech and call for the third speaker's proposition
2346.34,2365.0, to deliver this. All right.
2365.0,2386.52," I'll take time off. All right. Oh, sorry. Time out. My bad."
2387.86,2394.54, Okay. Yeah.
2396.78,2397.3," Three, two, one, go."
2399.0,2399.3," Ladies and gentlemen, let's understand this."
2404.4,2404.82, Both sides are largely agreeing upon the fact that political apathy is a real problem in the world.
2405.06,2409.56," So the real winner of this debate is the team that's able to prove two things. Firstly,"
2409.56,2413.26," which side is able to get greater political involvement? And secondly, which side is able"
2413.26,2418.66," to get better criticism and minimize desensitization to bad things, to bad behavior and to bad"
2418.66,2424.06," political actions, right? As I said earlier. So really what we need to get from side opposition"
2424.06,2426.18, in this debate is how this idea of
2426.18,2432.94, fear is not just going to trigger people to maybe want to grieve about what's happening or feel bad
2432.94,2438.1," about what's happening, but also how that call for action actually translates into the person"
2438.1,2442.2, actually going and doing something about it. So it's not just about what you think or what you
2442.2,2448.08," feel. Like I may watch like a really sad movie about like, you know, people dying on the streets because of like authoritarian leaders."
2448.36,2452.76, But unless I'm able to actually see something happening to that authoritarian leader that
2452.76,2458.96," results in a positive outcome, why will I want to go and as they say, people are not risk averse,"
2459.26,2463.98, why will I want to go and lay my lay my life down for something that's unachievable. So when they
2463.98,2469.84," talk about the unachievable, well, sure, utopia is that's unachievable so when they talk about the unachievable well sure utopia is not necessarily unachievable what they're essentially"
2469.84,2474.16, telling people is they're living in a dystopia and there's no way out and that is the fundamental
2474.16,2478.6, problem with that opposition stance and this is going to be like increased by this narrative that
2478.6,2483.44, that's propagated by these negative political shows now let's understand some quick clarification
2483.44,2487.46," here right so they give us some big examples up front about what these political shows. Now, let's understand some quick clarification here, right? So they give us some big examples upfront about what these political shows"
2487.46,2492.1," look like on our side, we tell you these positive political shows are any political show that in"
2492.1,2497.22," that may involve like, you know, hurdles that may involve backlash that involve protests and things"
2497.22,2502.0," like that. But eventually, there's a positive political outcome to each episode or to each"
2502.0,2509.64," movie or whatever, right? We think that that positive outcome is what defines whether it's a like a positive political show or not a negative political"
2509.64,2514.22, show is more likely to display some negative outcomes and also the negative characters are
2514.22,2519.78, more likely to remain you know escape scot-free right and i think to some extent both sides are
2519.78,2523.22, arguing to this definition so we don't really want i don't want to spend more time on this
2523.22,2527.26," getting to the first question in this debate, the first area of flash, what about greater political"
2527.26,2531.8," involvement? So they first tell us people are going to want to engage out of fear, right? They"
2531.8,2535.5," say they're scared that if they don't vote, they're going to get this Frank Underwood. And"
2535.5,2539.94," they give us the example of Donald Trump. Now, again, three responses to this. Firstly, no,"
2540.1,2544.3," right? We think that what people see is that despite public voting in House of Cards,"
2544.64,2550.26, Frank Underwood still ends up winning. So they lose faith in the potential of their vote itself so even if
2550.26,2554.02, they are fearing the idea that frank underwood is going to come up or whatever right we think that
2554.02,2558.6, they lose faith in the potential of what they could do in society to actually change that political
2558.6,2564.02, system because despite the actions of characters in house of cards you still have people who are
2564.02,2565.68, potentially sexual sex offenders or people who are potentially sexual sex offenders
2565.68,2570.8, or people who are extremely corrupt still ending up with power and still holding on to that part so
2571.84,2576.8, when when you talk about how politicians are evil and unaccountable what essentially happens is with
2576.8,2580.72, on their side with negative shows you seem to believe that they're continuing they're going
2580.72,2588.74, to still remain even unaccountable and there's nothing you can do really about it right and so when you talk about donald trump the idea that donald trump can be
2588.74,2593.5, taken down is a lot more important than the idea that donald trump is a scary man right we think
2593.5,2597.38, that if democrats did not believe that there are alternatives to donald trump and something better
2597.38,2601.8, than him exists there would be no reason to vote him out we think that on our side with positive
2601.8,2607.94, shows you either show some kind of good role model leaders or you show that autocratic governments can be taken down.
2607.94,2619.26," So if people thought that if people think and when they watch these shows, if people think that there can be some kind of delta that is created in society by individual action, they're automatically more likely to be called for action."
2619.34,2628.04," And that's really what we're standing for here. I don't know why I had to spend so much time on this, reiterating something that my first and second speaker has already explained which side opposition has not understood but"
2628.04,2632.28, coming to another important area right they say creating an idea that democracy is fair is toxic
2632.28,2638.2, but let's understand we're not saying democracy is fair what these shows portray is that democracy
2638.2,2642.34, can be fair because let's understand people are rational enough to understand the difference
2642.34,2648.42, between fiction and reality so they see something extremely like when i see like in the movie rrr people jumping on buildings i don't
2648.42,2652.98, think i can jump on buildings but i'm empowered to believe that you can be strong and you can have
2652.98,2657.12, that willpower right so we think that when people watch these political shows they may not completely
2657.12,2660.7, believe that everything is plausible in the real world but we do think that they're aiming for
2660.7,2669.72, aspects of that utopia in the first place right look when they say when they say that false optimism is creating like bad mindsets for minorities who are told that nothing can be done
2669.72,2674.08, what's actually happening is on their side you're telling a minority wait and watch this racist
2674.08,2678.94, corrupt man still gets part and still holds on to it whereas in positive shows something ends up
2678.94,2683.52, happening to that racist man some i mean if they want to call it humorous or not something ends up
2683.52,2688.48," happening whereby the minority man actually gets something out of it, like the minorities actually get something out"
2688.48,2692.44," of it in the show. So at least people feel a lot better, even if there's no real call for action."
2692.52,2695.84," But coming to this even if case that I want to talk to you about, right? So let's talk about"
2695.84,2700.76, desensitization and criticism. So they talk firstly about how the media should not lie about reality.
2700.76,2709.78," Firstly, very often these shows do kind of exaggerate reality, but let's assume it's exactly as it is. Now, they also tell us that, well, people end up only watching like one"
2709.78,2715.2, or two shows. So the Delta isn't really great. So this really is the case. There are other kinds
2715.2,2719.78," of media that end up scrutinizing and criticizing this reality that they talk a lot about, right?"
2719.78,2725.32," So if in my life, I'm seeing people criticize and seeing sort of this struggle going on around me,"
2725.7,2731.56, why do I want to actually go on to watch even more shows where I'm only going to see more and more of this?
2731.56,2736.52, So all that impacts rests on the idea that you're going to end up watching these shows in the first place.
2736.72,2742.5, And we think that people are going to be tired of seeing the same sort of struggle that other media sources are already portraying.
2742.8,2745.84," Moreover, you are essentially pushing people"
2745.84,2750.64, further down the problem that they're trying to potentially find some alleviation from now before
2750.64,2755.52, i get to like you know how this is an even if case but let's understand this even if voters are
2755.52,2760.32, extremely interested on their side if voters are suddenly going to watch all these shows and
2760.32,2764.56, because of watching these negative shows they're actually going to end up wanting to vote we still
2764.56,2769.52, think this kind of voting is bad because on their side these voters are seeing politics
2769.52,2774.4, that's extremely bad normalized they're seeing sex offenders being normalized in in the leadership
2774.4,2778.56, system right and we get no response from this in the second speaker my second speaker spent
2778.56,2782.72, like five minutes of his entire life on this and we get nothing on that we tell you that people
2782.72,2789.18," should be aware of the fact that sometimes leaders cannot be like this. We think that they need to set higher bars, higher"
2789.18,2793.82," expectations for politics of today. And that not only decreases political apathy, it also increases"
2793.82,2798.32," better voting. So we tell you that on our side, people are watching these good shows, seeing good"
2798.32,2803.2," role model leaders, seeing Tom Kirkman in Designated Survivor and believing that bipartisanship is"
2803.2,2808.28," possible. Sure, they may be able to distinguish between the utopia side of it and the compromise side"
2808.28,2808.82, of it as well.
2809.04,2812.78, And we think that people are likely to create these higher barriers of entry for corrupt
2812.78,2814.5, politicians and for people who...
2814.5,2816.78," Anyways, quick POI, one second to go."
2817.5,2818.08, Which is it?
2818.16,2822.74, Are these movies too realistic that you will basically be able to envision a utopia?
2822.92,2826.88, Are they not realistic at all that you won't actually understand what this utopia is
2826.88,2828.34, and not have any change?
2828.34,2830.46," I mean, I don't want to sit and analyze shows for you,"
2830.46,2831.46," but to some extent,"
2831.46,2833.08, these shows are often grounded in reality
2833.08,2835.74, to the point where it's based on the current political system.
2835.74,2837.94," Sure, as you said, it often describes reality"
2837.94,2839.34," in a slightly fictional manner,"
2839.34,2840.6, but people are able to distinguish
2840.6,2843.16," between things that are extremely impossible,"
2843.16,2844.64," things that are relatively achievable,"
2844.64,2849.52, and they're able to hold on to that achievable side of things and use that as a mechanism for them to
2849.52,2854.32, actually go out there vote and make a difference right so again as i said earlier on our side these
2854.32,2859.6, are they may hold on to aspects of shows and set higher expectations for politics that's happening
2859.6,2864.32, today so let's summarize quickly right we tell you that on our side we're not only getting better
2864.32,2868.12, criticism of politics because of higher expectations set for these politicians in the first
2868.12,2873.46," phase, we're also getting voters more interested, reducing political apathy, because people believe"
2873.46,2878.54, the system can change. So even if people are not fearing the system or fearing the potential
2878.54,2882.7," harms of the system, by itself is something we've contended with, we think that these problems are"
2882.7,2888.4," still displayed in these political shows, we still think think on our side they're likely to see the positive outcomes of those"
2888.4,2892.4, problems and i'd like you to embrace those solutions and actually solve collective action in
2892.4,2896.56, a better manner what they get is worse collective action and with that we win this debate thank you
2898.64,2935.0, thank you you Let me know whenever you guys are ready so I can start.
2935.0,2948.68," Panel, all set? Okay, we thank the speaker for their speech and we'll call upon the third speaker of"
2948.68,2950.68, side proposition to deliver that.
2950.68,2954.18," Hi, I'm Aval."
2954.18,2961.38," Starting my speech in three, two, one."
2961.38,2966.72, Side proposition starts out with telling you this narrative is just so so powerful that
2966.72,2971.68," will make individuals just stop following laws, stop voting on our side of the house."
2971.68,2977.2," But when it comes to actually engaging with the arguments, it's just people just don't buy into"
2977.2,2982.0, this narrative. Like obviously people are so realistic that accountability isn't something
2982.0,2985.04, that you can get on your side of the house much like the voters
2985.04,2990.4, on their side of the house they just didn't want to engage with us so proud to oppose three clashes
2990.4,2995.28, in the speech then firstly just clarifying what exactly is it that each of each side has to
2995.28,2999.76, support secondly which side increases political engagement thirdly which side increases
2999.76,3025.0," accountability first class then i'll just clarify what each world looks like. And at the top of this, I'm just going to have fun quoting them back and proving my point with their words. First notice, you're likely not portraying them as bad politics because you have the glorification of politics on their side of the house. And by extension, that means glorifying democracy, glorifying politicians who just care about you, who want you to succeed in life."
3025.0,3033.0," But secondly, again, because it is a happy, fun image of destruction, you just cannot talk about the struggles that individuals are actually going through."
3033.0,3040.0," Because that's not really soothing, right? That's not really distracting to individuals who don't want to think about hard, serious stuff."
3040.0,3043.0, That's what they told you on their side of the house. That's what they have to support.
3043.0,3048.88," But thirdly, if they believe that just talking about problems means that you desensitize people to problems"
3048.88,3053.44, you just normalize those problems i'm unsure what their competitive looks like and i think that
3053.44,3058.48, means that they just don't talk about problems at all but the political system is just so wonderful
3058.48,3063.52, that everything's going so good that's how you can stop all desensitization of problems on their side
3063.52,3069.36, of the house by their own words so what this means is that they're telling you on their narrative anything you want you
3069.36,3075.44, actually just will be given because politicians care about you they care about your future they
3075.44,3080.8, want what's best for you and sometimes they may make mistakes sometimes they do things that are
3080.8,3089.2, not the best for you but you should trust them because actually they know better than you but let's take them on their best case that somehow you get some level of change
3089.2,3094.08, that is very very superficial let's be very clear what this change will look like is very sappy
3094.08,3098.32, change right because of all of the reasons i've given you earlier it means like for instance you
3098.32,3102.56, know what let's everyone just come together let's hold hands let's recognize that everyone's
3102.56,3105.0," different externally but at heart, we're the same."
3105.0,3111.0, And that's why no sexism exists. That's why black politicians can just easily get into power on their side of the house.
3111.0,3115.0," Even though right now in the real world, they've been struggling for decades to do so."
3115.0,3118.0, That's what the narrative on their side looks like. We're not going to support it.
3118.0,3124.0, Let's then compare this to what we want our narrative to look like and what we made clear about from the very start.
3124.0,3128.96," First, it looks like comparing bad structures and telling you that the reason why this happened why this"
3128.96,3133.76, politician is bad is because of the inaction in the past that you had the ability to change it
3133.76,3137.6, but just because you didn't want to work just because you don't want to come out and vote
3137.6,3142.24, that's why you caused this problem in the first place but second in the instance that politicians
3142.24,3151.18," are bad that means that on our side of the house, you need to recognize that politicians just inherently might have some greedy, might have some very power hungry characteristics."
3151.18,3158.4, And that's why you need to be keeping them in check. And recognizing doesn't always have to be unsuccessful. It can be successful.
3158.74,3164.6," For instance, all the lies that we told you about House of Cups aren't just true. At the end of the day, Frank Underwood was impeached."
3164.9,3169.76, And what this means is that on our side of the house we get that much better second class then
3169.76,3174.64, on political engagement before i move on is there any view Morgan Freeman was the first black
3174.64,3179.2, president of the us before Barack Obama do you think that had a greater impact than Kevin Spacey
3179.2,3184.88, actively saying that you know racism is all right i'm unsure we're just dropping names that he means
3184.88,3185.6, that you still aren't
3185.6,3190.0, engaging with a number for all of the responses that we've given you second class tenant political
3190.0,3195.76, engagement and at the top of this clash let's be very very clear right individuals want change
3195.76,3200.32, they want for instance stuff to happen that materially improves their lives that makes it
3200.32,3204.16, easier for them to go about their lives that for instance means that they go up the ranks
3204.16,3208.88, of social mobility recognizing that that's what individuals always want at the end of the day.
3208.88,3213.6," Let's prove why they get that much worse on their side of the house. Firstly, notice the narrative"
3213.6,3217.92," that you get on their side of the house is that this will just happen anyway, right? Because you're"
3217.92,3222.64," so optimistic, because you're so hopeful that the future will always be bright, that's when you are"
3222.64,3229.04," less likely to, for instance, push for change change because why should you have to give up your doing your work to go out on the street and protest"
3229.04,3232.8, why should you have to read about a number of things politicians are doing so you can make
3232.8,3238.32, the right informed choice when other people will do it for you and the act the result will always
3238.32,3242.16, be what's best for you that's what you make individual state and that's when you force them
3242.16,3248.96, into engaging less with their side of the house on comparative we tell you you're able to see what might happen if you don't actually engage
3248.96,3253.28, if you don't actually put in the effort that is necessitated of you to be a part of this political
3253.28,3258.48, structure properly and that means that on our side of the house before we get individuals actually
3258.48,3263.04, trying to get changed on our side and let's be very clear nobody thinks they are the situation
3263.04,3268.64, of no return right now rather they think they're in a situation in which the problem of no return will be caused right now
3268.64,3271.92, because of two reasons one because people can see there are certain good things in their life
3272.72,3276.72, it can get much much worse in the future but second social justice movements exist they work
3276.72,3281.2, in tandem with this narrative they're pushing you to act change to act now or act never that's what
3281.2,3288.88, the climate change movement literally tells you what this means is that our side of the house it pushes you to actually act change on our side but setting up
3290.0,3294.24, figure out the differences between politicians let's be very clear you just won't see that sort
3294.24,3298.56, of political drama in the first place because if you just want a distraction why not watch a rom
3298.56,3302.88, com on netflix we think you come to political dramas to find relatability to find yourselves
3302.88,3307.92, represented in the political systems they're talking about you don't represent them you think they're not realistic that means you don't
3307.92,3312.32, get them watching these political dramas at the end of the day at the end of this class i want to
3312.32,3317.52, do a couple of pieces of being firstly notice if both sides can change the difference on our side
3317.52,3321.36, of the house is that you get more urgent change you can push for much more change much more quicker
3321.36,3328.0, because you're scared of where it can actually become worse but secondly notice we can trade this off with a third clash because of the fact that it
3328.0,3332.56, doesn't matter if you're all showing up voting to just vote blindly that's why accountability matters
3332.56,3336.8, you actually grant legitimacy to really terrible governments on their side of housing the best
3336.8,3341.28, case but second you end up prioritizing the sorts of politicians you see the role models they want
3341.28,3347.68, to talk about they'll always just end up being charismatic and give you sympathetic stuff because that's what the movies can make more money off that's
3347.68,3351.76, one more related to the characters and guess what those sorts of politicians look like in real life
3351.76,3355.84, so they're actually populist co-politicians that don't want to talk about policies just make lies
3355.84,3359.12, about their personalities those are the sorts of people you get them voting on on their side
3359.12,3363.68, of the house law question and accountability let's be clear we told you you showed racism
3363.68,3368.58, you show struggles of sexism and arch at the the house. This was called desensitization. That means they're
3368.58,3372.54, much more happy to not never show this. But let's then actually prove to you why this
3372.54,3375.94," will never cause desensitization. First, you have an incentive to show problems that have"
3375.94,3379.6," never been covered before. That means that you're giving them the first idea, first way"
3379.6,3383.86, of covering them because the fact that every show wants to differentiate it from itself.
3384.16,3388.88," Let's say, for instance, how I got Got Away With Murder talking about black abortions very specifically in the political"
3388.88,3392.88," system. Those are the sorts of things that you can get to attract viewers in the first place. Second,"
3392.88,3397.6, showing one TV show doesn't make you think that anything that is bad is no longer bad. They claim
3397.6,3401.2, that apparently black people will become decentralized to racism now something that affects
3401.2,3408.24," their lives so significantly. Even after the house we can much more likely talk about the deep implications of these problems. So for instance, when you talk"
3408.24,3413.04," about a documentary about for instance a politician sexually harassing someone, that's when you're"
3413.04,3417.6, much more likely to hold Donald Trump accountable because you can see firsthand the victim's trauma
3417.6,3421.44, and you feel much more sympathetic to them. That's when on our side of the house you get people
3421.44,3428.0," being much much more accountable. But on the other hand, you can see that they don't get accountability when they told you they just want to glorify politicians"
3428.0,3431.68, this means that you actually don't get change that you need on their side of the house but
3431.68,3434.96, second even in the best case we just get accountability and not political engagement
3434.96,3438.08, that's still something we're willing to take because what this means is that once you get
3438.08,3441.44, changed right now in the long term you can get individuals much much more engaged in
3441.44,3446.8, the political system i have never been more proud of to oppose.
3447.64,3469.8," Thank you. Hi, just checking that I'm both audible and visible again."
3469.8,3472.76," Yep, just give us a minute."
3472.76,3473.76, Yep.
3473.76,3482.24," Panel, all set?"
3482.24,3488.12," Cool, cool, cool. Excellent. We thank the speaker for their speech, and"
3488.12,3496.92, I now call the Opposition Reply Speaker to deliver those.
3496.92,3507.0," Speaker, first and second proposition in this debate spend far, far too long providing the one example of parks and recreation."
3507.0,3510.0, They repeatedly say they don't have to defend sitcoms.
3510.0,3520.0," But if you take a second to read the info slide, unfortunately for them, the examples the CA team gives of optimism is sitcoms, is shows like West Wing."
3520.0,3525.68," Crucially, panel, the reason they were afraid of defending sitcoms, the epitome of optimism and"
3525.68,3532.56," positivity in political fiction is because they daunted the seriousness of systemic subjugation,"
3532.56,3538.32," because they make it impossible to mobilize. At the end of this round, the teen UAE has to buy"
3538.32,3543.36," a bullet that they just did not want to bite down the line, that they just never properly engaged"
3543.36,3545.02," with. Bearing that in mind,"
3549.98,3550.12," two questions in the speech. First, on which side gets greater political engagement? Second,"
3554.86,3555.44," on which side gets greater consequences from that engagement? On the first question, look,"
3561.42,3570.0," people only engage with fiction when they see themselves in it and find it relatable. Both sides then, in this debate, agree on one thing. That is that political fiction in and of itself, regardless of whether it's positive or whether it's negative, is valuable."
3570.0,3576.0," That's why, to an extent, the motion makes us support positive portrayals and makes UAE support negative portrayals."
3576.0,3582.0," Therefore, here's what that means for the round. On their side of the house, if people aren't watching these shows, that is terrible."
3582.0,3589.18," Because if more people are watching the genre and even becoming slightly more aware on our side of the house, we take it over them"
3589.18,3594.32," because people are disillusioned by unrelatable shows on their side of the house. Whereas on ours,"
3594.48,3599.14," they're even slightly more engaged, that is a good in and of itself, the fact that they're engaging"
3599.14,3604.56," with the genre. That's very important weighing. But second, we think we need to take a second to"
3604.56,3606.9, just engage with them on this narrative being strong.
3607.06,3609.18," Because crucially, this is a narratives debate."
3609.42,3611.34," So to a large extent, we don't think the delta"
3611.34,3614.56, and the impacts are as big as they claim they are.
3614.78,3616.12, That was what the first point proved.
3616.34,3617.78, This is going to be very charitable
3617.78,3620.6, and take them at their best like we've done down the line.
3620.78,3622.06, Let's assume this narrative is strong.
3622.46,3623.5," On our side of the house,"
3623.5,3629.92," the fear of the consequence of inaction motivates you to vote, motivates you to do things but come out and act,"
3630.06,3634.42, which is fundamentally the point at which we can get things like greater political engagement.
3634.78,3639.38," On comparative, you think everything will work out. It will inevitably just be fine. Democracy"
3639.38,3644.84, will fix itself. That's the point at which you crucially create inaction. On the second question
3644.84,3645.28," then,"
3645.28,3648.88, the first thing that I want to note is that winning on political engagement gives us an
3648.88,3653.52," independent path to victory in and of itself, but I'm going to prove the second question to give us"
3653.52,3659.28," one more. First, we think that they have toxic political optimism on their side of the house,"
3659.28,3663.92," because let's make one thing clear. As Hathisha explains in her third, Black people are not"
3663.92,3665.7, desensitized to racism when
3665.7,3669.9," it is visceral, when they have to deal with the harms of it literally every single day"
3669.9,3670.9, of their life.
3670.9,3673.68, But what is the analysis that I gave you at first?
3673.68,3677.6, The fact that they're disillusioned in Gov's world and they are immobilized at the point
3677.6,3679.24, at which they're told to push through.
3679.24,3682.98," They will all just like be all right at the end of the day, but at the point at which"
3682.98,3688.56," it isn't, Speaker, that's the point at which you feel that you are locked into structures that you cannot change that is"
3688.56,3693.84, crucially terrible in terms of getting any change whatsoever on their side but second we think that
3693.84,3698.0, they necessarily need to downplay political problems on their side of the house the reason
3698.0,3702.8, that is true is because the only way to push overwhelmingly positive and happy and optimistic
3702.8,3705.36, narratives is by doing things like ensuring those
3705.36,3709.84, narratives are pushed because let's make one thing clear and quote first propositions themselves
3709.84,3714.16, this debate is one about glorification on their side of the house that it's terrible because it
3714.16,3720.24, makes any semblance of accountability whatsoever literally impossible the third and lastly we've
3720.24,3729.04," told you down the line that fiction is dramatic. The fiction is accessible and evokes unique senses of information. That's why on our side of the house, you can uniquely draw"
3729.04,3733.68, parallels between things like increased state surveillance via the Patriot Act and call that
3733.68,3737.76, Orwellian. That's the point that you can communicate the scale and how drastic these
3737.76,3743.28," ideas are. We win both clashes in this debate. To conclude, I sympathize with Second Prop's"
3743.28,3745.28, neck problem. I just love the fact that he
3745.28,3749.84, nods along to his teammates and finds them assertive too much like we do on team india
3750.4,3775.0, oppose thank you I'm going to begin.
3775.0,3776.0, One second.
3776.0,3777.0, Sorry.
3777.0,3778.0, No worries.
3778.0,3779.0," Panel, all set?"
3779.0,3780.0, Yep.
3780.0,3781.0, Yep.
3781.0,3782.0, Yep.
3782.0,3783.0, Okay.
3783.0,3791.4," Whenever you're ready, feel free to begin okay"
3791.4,3801.18, i'm going to begin in three two one panel when it was convenient for them team opposition needed
3801.18,3805.76," skepticism and then when it was convenient for them, negativity was relatable."
3806.28,3812.26," Their third speaker says this themselves, right? The problem of no return is visible. People"
3812.26,3818.34, already know about it. Yet all they want to do is inspire people to actually know about issues.
3818.64,3823.66," If it's relatable in India, if people already think you might get no return, that means people"
3823.66,3825.56, are already skeptic you've
3825.56,3830.98, shot yourselves in the foot the framing is this you have optimistic shows this looks extra this
3830.98,3835.32, is like this looks like solving problems right the motion says that this are like the motion says
3835.32,3841.08, optimistic shows they talk about west wing right west wing is a political drama the other example
3841.08,3846.46, is that of Fahrenheit that's a book about how a person overcomes problems within a political system.
3846.72,3851.12, It's one thing to strawman us. It's another thing to actually strawman the motion.
3851.42,3854.9, There are three independent parts to victory for Team UAE in this debate.
3855.18,3858.76, First on government trust. This is entirely unengaged.
3858.76,3865.54," I tell you this, that even if on our side you have things like parks and rec it serves as a distraction"
3865.54,3870.72, from actual problems because the reality is what steam india sometimes understands and sometimes
3870.72,3876.48, doesn't is that that reality is harsh political systems are flawed and problems are widespread
3876.48,3881.52, right on our side you distract yourselves from those problems at the very least even if it's
3881.52,3890.0," something like parks and recreation you get a form ofcapism, you're able to deal with those issues better. On their side, they demonize the systems around them."
3890.0,3894.56," They tell them, they give them more reasons to loathe the society that they live in. People go"
3894.56,3899.68, further down the rabbit hole. People are more nihilistic. We win on government trust because
3899.68,3903.84," on our side, because of this, people are more likely to actually do things on the individual"
3903.84,3909.12," level, let alone voting. People are likely to respect the people around them on our side because they're"
3909.12,3915.28, able to find another form of escape on their side escape from bad politics becomes people with who
3915.28,3921.12, drive rashly people that don't follow laws people that incite violence the very capital invasion
3921.12,3925.28," that they do talk about we find escapism in other forms. At our very least,"
3925.54,3930.1," this is what taking a person at their best looks like. Now, toxic spheres, right? We tell you that"
3930.1,3936.06," on our side, on their side, you normalize bad politics. Why? Because you already have bad people"
3936.06,3941.04," being the protagonist. Yes, Frank Underwood was impeached at the end of House of Cards,"
3941.4,3945.32, but viewers felt bad for him. Why? Because he was the protagonist.
3945.76,3950.14, He was the person that they watched in House of Cards for five seasons. He was the person that
3950.14,3955.24, they did connect to. That happens in real life because you've fallen in love with a person that
3955.24,3960.82," is inherently a bad human being, that is inherently bad for democracy. You accept the same reality"
3960.82,3966.48," when an official sex offender, past sex offender runs for election, you let that slide"
3966.48,3972.16," that makes the political sphere toxic. It means victims are rendered useless, victims are rendered"
3972.16,3976.64," worthless. We don't have that on our side. Two independent parts, both of these largely"
3976.64,3981.68, unresponded to. What do they actually respond to? A win that we don't need but we get anyway.
3981.68,3985.52," We get political involvement, right right we glorify people panel and"
3985.52,3989.92, glorifying means we make the system look more glamorous but you don't think everything will
3989.92,3994.0, be fine note that this comes up only in their reply by the way which is way too late but we
3994.0,3999.36, preempt this in first we tell you because you know how prevalent issues are in the status quo
3999.36,4006.0," you may become more hopeful of a good future meaning to say in amer in America, if you're showing someone, this is what"
4006.0,4011.42, my third speaker's POI actually meant. It wasn't just name dropping. If you're watching a movie
4011.42,4017.6," about Morgan Freeman, a black person becoming president, it incites hope in you. It incites,"
4017.88,4022.78," it broadens your imagination to the extent that when it does become a reality, you know that you"
4022.78,4030.6, had a part to play. You know that the film had a part to play because it opened people up to the possibility. That's what we get on our side of the
4030.6,4035.58," house. When you see something on a cop show, where a cop makes things okay, you don't assume that the"
4035.58,4040.8," cop exists in real life, but you have faith in doing so yourself. You have faith in the system"
4040.8,4045.2, and you know that someone will do this anyway even for parks and rec panel at the
4045.2,4051.84, very least the racist man is mocked on their side the racist man wins so proud to have won the debate
4055.52,4060.24, thank you thank you to all the speakers in the debate i will now pause the recording
