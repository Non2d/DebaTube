0.0,6.08, recording first okay excellent hi everyone my name is stages i will be your chair for the round
6.72,11.6, um and i'm joined by three other wonderful judges i would appreciate if you could
11.6,15.92, introduce yourself and the order that you appear on the draw
21.76,29.08, i don't think that would assure you uh she yeah. I just kind of assumed that you would go first because I know we're David
29.08,33.24," and Devita, but I just assumed you would go first. I don't mind going first, that's completely"
33.24,34.24, okay.
34.24,37.88," Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, I just thought because finalists go first."
37.88,41.52," Okay, the order in the draw is Devita goes first, so you can go first."
41.52,49.12," Okay, okay. Thank you for the clarity, Tejas. Hi name is davida gender pronounced you are i'm going to be punished for this wrong but just come to refer"

65.0,71.0," Okay, awesome. In that case, if we could just go down the room and get introductions from all speakers."
71.0,75.0," You are free to disclose your pronouns, but that's completely your choice."
75.0,78.0," However, you are required to disclose your name and speaking position."
78.0,81.0," So on the proposition, could we know who is speaking first?"
83.0,88.24," All right. Hi, I'm Kassar. I'll be speaking first and also do reply. My pronouns are she"
88.24,89.24, her.

127.84,129.52," Thank you so much, everyone."
129.52,134.6," So just before we start one brief note, is any of the other judges willing to time?"
134.6,137.36, I am really quite bad at timing because I take notes on a computer.
142.64,143.68," Yeah, I could try."
143.68,144.36," OK, awesome."
144.36,149.0," So if you could just post 178 and 815 in the chat, that would be perfect."
149.0,152.72," Okay, apart from that, before you begin your speech, I would appreciate if you could state"
152.72,155.66," your POI preference again, just so it's very clear."
155.66,158.7," If a preference goes unstated, assume POIs go in the chat."
158.7,166.4," In that case, we welcome the first speaker of the proposition to open the debate."
170.14,171.04," All right, just to confirm audibility and visibility."
172.06,172.14," All right, great."
173.64,174.0, Let me just set up my timer.
176.08,178.22, I'd appreciate my POIs in the chat or I will flag on my fifth minute.
178.6,179.62, Let me just set mine up.
183.92,190.64," Okay, starting in three, two, one."
190.64,195.92," Panel affirming that this house would ban free to play video games, three very important"
195.92,196.92, points of framing.
196.92,202.52," Firstly, we think this debate is not a debate about how essentially video games are really,"
202.52,203.52, really bad.
203.52,206.28, This debate is not about us banning particular
206.28,211.82, video games this debate is about banning this kind of financial or that monetary kind of service that
211.82,217.66, comes within these video games this looks like as per the info slide the free to play videos
217.66,223.14, video game service this looks like um sort of having costless video games or the ones where
223.14,225.46, you can pay up front So it's not about that
225.46,231.0, Fortnite is bad or Minecraft is bad. That's not the debate. The debate is about when or when
231.0,236.7, particularly can people or when would they actually subscribe to either paying upfront or having a
236.7,243.98, costless video game as opposed to actually playing three levels of the game and then paying for the
243.98,245.68," later stage, right? right but even secondly it's"
245.68,250.56, very important for us to actually look at status quo we think then the gaming industry is currently
250.56,255.28, expanding i mean the gaming industry today is considered an esport and we had just a recent
255.28,261.04, tournament in 2021 in tokyo where the gaming revenue and you know it was like in billions
261.04,269.6, of dollars so we think because of that expansion it's very important to have this concept because later on when i start talking to you about the kind of significance we
269.6,274.32, would have at the end of the day in terms of economic benefit this context would play a very
274.32,280.0, key role right but even secondly it's also important to note that these games are always
280.0,284.32, developing so that means that games don't essentially just have one season and that's it
284.32,288.48, most games do but the ones that we're going to be discussing today we think that they have that
288.48,293.12, longevity and it's very important to preserve that longevity of the game this looks like fortnite
293.12,298.72, not only having one season but 21 seasons that last for a period a short time period for like
298.72,303.44, 10 to 12 weeks right and the third point of context and really important here right
303.44,325.6," the nature of video games essentially is very addictive, right? It's very important for us to understand because of this addictive nature, how then do gaming developers and these kind of updates and then free to play actually come into play and become very much unjustified later on in the case but it's also important to understand that that intuition"
325.6,330.32, prompt you have when you start playing fortnite and you're only able to access three levels and
330.32,334.8, then you sort of are really psyched about sort of moving to the next level and then suddenly there's
334.8,340.24, that one tree cost that you have to incur what we think that opposition needs to justify is then
340.24,349.92," when you put in let's say 12 hours of hard labor and you're playing those three levels and because you want to advance to level four, why then is it justified to start paying that?"
350.02,356.24," Why then don't we just have it as a costless one or on a comparative have an upfront payment, which is essentially important?"
356.32,359.82, And I'll show you why. Right. But then let me tell you what I'm going to be proving in my speech.
359.82,365.18," Two things. Firstly, why would people sign up to either have an upfront cost for paying this or even"
365.18,370.18, cost us and i think in our case when we're banning these free to play games we'll focus more on having
370.18,375.6, the upfront cost and why essentially it's better but even secondly how then do we benefit these
375.6,381.12, gaming developers right so for the first point we think when you have the free to play games and the
381.12,390.18, way that metric works as i explained to you you play three levels before you even are able to upgrade to level four you have to have a costume upgrade and all those are in real
390.18,394.5, time cash they actually have to put your debit card or credit card number and actually incur
394.5,400.12, those goals right so in principle we think then that essential metric is just a marketing strategy
400.12,406.08," which is morally unjustified why two levels Two levels of analysis. Firstly, we think because you know"
406.08,412.7," games can be addictive, you already know that once people get hooked onto the three levels and they"
412.7,418.02," essentially really like your game, then they will be forced to actually pay for that upgrade to go"
418.02,422.34," to level four, right? The reason we think that this is going to be highly unjustified, especially"
422.34,429.84," when you have that free-to-play metric, is because at the end of the day the funny thing becomes that you are forcing or coercing these"
429.84,434.96, people to actually upgrade right maybe even if it's indirectly because you're using that addiction
434.96,439.68, that they've got or that kind of utility and satisfaction the dopamine effect they get from
439.68,445.52, playing those three levels on that on that game to essentially force them and coerce them to start
445.52,450.56, playing for uptis right on a comparative what do we think happens right because on your side when
450.56,456.08, you have the free to play you actually target the rationality of this consumer and because this what
456.08,461.04, this consumer is actually going through that dopamine effect because you know competition
461.04,466.26," competition and reward is an inherent you yourane metric, right? Because of all these"
466.26,469.98," things, right? What happens in a comparative when you actually have to pay an upfront?"
470.28,474.68," Why is that essentially going to be much better, right? But before I move into that comparative"
474.68,480.48," and give you those two strings, it's important to understand why we care then about the rationality"
480.48,485.1," of these players, right? Because understand, number one, the kind of demographic that we're"
485.1,489.98," dealing with is essentially young. And even if it expands to people being 40 years old and playing,"
490.1,497.26, we don't care. But the idea is half or even 50 to 60% of the demographic that plays video game
497.26,501.92," is essentially young, right? That means the progressive cost that you need to be upgrading"
501.92,508.76," or you need to incur in order to play just one season of Fortnite is essentially harmful for that consumer, right?"
508.98,515.34, We then tell you it is so much better for you to pay your $3 for 10 levels of Fortnite
515.34,520.22," upfront before you go to level three, get hooked, they use your addiction against you,"
520.42,524.52," and then you start paying even if it's $2, moving to the next for an upgrade and actually"
524.52,529.6," pay $5, right? you and then you start paying even if it's two dollars moving to the next for an upgrade actually pay five dollars right so we think then those costs on a progressive level at the end of the"
529.6,535.2, day because that consumer is irrational and you know hooked on that game essentially we think then
535.2,540.64, it becomes unjustified right so we think then moving on to the second comparative we think
540.64,546.28," having that upfront pay essentially means that firstly, they don't bait you into your addiction, right?"
546.36,548.32, So they don't use your addiction against you.
548.44,551.18, What essentially happens is they give you the demo of the game.
551.24,552.88, They tell you this is how the game looks like.
552.92,554.18," If you're up for it, go for it."
554.3,555.54, And this is the initial cost.
555.54,562.6," We think that is so much better and that is so much more principally justified because number one, your addiction is not being used against you."
562.9,570.88," Number two, you are ensuring that the gaming developers get their profits so this is this means that fortnite will only be profitable"
570.88,576.24, if people move from level three to level four but something like minecraft is going to be profitable
576.24,580.32, the minutes the user starts playing from level one what are the outcomes of this i'm going to
580.32,586.18, specify but before i move on i'll take that POI too. Would you ban companies like
586.18,591.82, Netflix offering free trials before paid subscriptions? Understand what I've told you
591.82,597.0, that this isn't like something like a trial or stuff like that right and even if it is like a
597.0,602.14, trial what happens in video games is essentially so much different than what happens later on
602.14,605.1, because as I told you that addictive nature of
605.1,611.24, these games essentially hurts these consumers and what happens then is that metric of baiting and
611.24,615.88, hooking them to actually start playing these video games but then don't get an opt-out mechanism
615.88,620.96, because then you have that dopamine effect and you so you know you still have to go and go to
620.96,625.06, the next level right but what happens on a comparative as i explained earlier what are
625.06,630.26, the outcomes of that and why are they significantly much better firstly for the consumer you do not
630.26,635.8, have to incur that progressive cost which we think because it impanes your rationality you do not have
635.8,640.44, absolute choice which is really really important when it comes down to you actually taking money
640.44,645.64, out of your pocket and spending it on video games which essentially then later on leads you to
645.64,652.2, you know incurring a lot of costs just able to pay or play one kind of season right so we think
652.2,657.98, then at that particular point it's better to have an upfront payment because number one you take away
657.98,663.0, that vacuum space of profit and you actually give this developers that profit and you still have
663.0,667.16," longevity of the game minecraft until today only has upfront payments,"
667.16,669.4," and we still have longevity of the game, right?"
669.4,671.74, That is an essential and very strategic example
671.74,673.9, because you do not use the addiction
673.9,675.56," against these specific people,"
675.56,677.16," but at the end of the day,"
677.16,679.56, you're allowing them to play the game
679.56,681.6, and giving them absolute choice
681.6,683.34, as to whether they would like to progress
683.34,684.82, from level one to level two.
684.82,689.8," But even lastly, and most importantly, we think the commercialization of the gaming industry,"
689.8,696.4," which is going to be extended upon my second speaker, is essentially very, very important. Proud to propose."
696.4,732.0," Thank you for that speech. We now welcome the first speaker of the opposition. Hi. Hi, can I be seen and heard clearly?"
732.0,733.0, Yep.
733.0,762.16," Okay, great. My most wholesome memory of prepping for WSDC this year was when Chanithu played us the"
762.16,765.0, Minecraft theme song on his piano and that
765.0,771.3, made Humed start crying. That proves to you just how important and meaningful video games are
771.3,777.38, to the lives of the vast majority of people. And we think that getting rid of the free-to-play model
777.38,783.66," restricts a large proportion of people from ever being able to access the happiness, the joy and"
783.66,785.7, the friendships that video games provide.
786.14,787.44, That is why we are boards.
787.66,792.96, I want to make it clear that we agree with them that the scale of this industry is massive and growing
792.96,796.86, with billions of dollars being poured in and hundreds of thousands of people employed.
796.86,802.2," But I also want to make it clear that the vast, vast majority of video games in the modern day"
802.2,803.84, are via the free-to-play model.
804.1,805.18," Companies like Tencent,"
805.32,810.74," Blizzard, Ubisoft and Epic Games that make games like Fortnite, like Team Fortress, not Team Fortress,"
810.86,816.3," yes Team Fortress, make games like Dota for example. All of these games are ones that are"
816.3,821.02, free-to-play that are the biggest forms of gaming in the modern day and these are the ones that the
821.02,830.14," vast majority of people depend on for their employment. People who work in games development, people who play these games professionally, people who stream these games on platforms like Twitch."
830.52,846.0," On proposition, this is a new policy that they have to implement on current games, which means that on their side of the world, games that you were playing for free before, now you have to pay a higher amount for. In contrast, our counter model is one where we allow free to play games to exist,"
846.0,852.08," we do not ban them, but we impose regulations on forms of games or factors within games that we"
852.08,857.36," consider to be bad. This already exists in the EU, for example, where they placed a ban on the loot"
857.36,862.72, box system in the game Overwatch. The reason why this is likely is that we are just extending
862.72,870.0, pre-existing regulations on online gambling and cross supplying them to gaming without banning the game itself.
870.0,876.0, Very good in a characterization. What is it that people pay for on our side and why do they pay for it?
876.0,880.0," The reason that people so on our side, people don't pay for initial access."
880.0,889.6, They pay for two kinds of things. The first is cosmetic purchases purely for clout and a marker of dedication highly valuable collectibles so things like skins for your guns capes in minecraft for
889.6,893.92, example so minecraft isn't actually a fully upfront game there are ways in and there are mods
893.92,898.08, of minecraft that you pay for free and then you need to pay for things later on down the line the
898.08,903.04, second is things like competitive advantage which is where you are able to pay for certain things
903.04,907.0," like boosts we think here there's already a checking mechanism in status quo,"
907.0,911.0," where there is an incentive to make sure that if players work hard enough,"
911.0,913.0, they are able to access it already.
913.0,917.0," For example, in Clash of Clans, you can earn gems by paying money,"
917.0,919.0, but you can also earn them by mining in-game.
919.0,924.0, The reason for this is that there's a huge stigma about games becoming pay-to-win
924.0,925.28, and people moving away.
925.52,929.84," We saw this with the game Halo Infinite, for example, that relied too much on people having"
929.84,933.56," to buy lots and lots of stuff in order to progress. And therefore, people just stop"
933.56,937.44," playing the games. There's an incentive against that. Before my arguments, I want to very quickly"
937.44,942.38, deal with their argumentation on addiction. The first thing here is that this is not a motion
942.38,948.06, they implement from the start of time. They make it much worse for addicted people because those same people who are addicted
948.06,952.74, on their side of the house now have to pay even more because they now have to pay the upfront
952.74,958.14," cost of this game that's now been compounded. But second, a lot of other media has the same effect."
958.14,963.46," For example, Netflix and free trials. We don't think that this is a form of coercion. In fact,"
963.5,969.12, we think that their side is more coercive because by their own logic you would not be able to provide someone with a taster
969.12,974.12, of a good or a game because that acts as a form of addiction we think it is actually a less valid
974.12,978.44, choice on their side of the house because you have less information about the game that you are buying
978.44,984.18, and therefore it is comparatively more unjust on the same basis you would also have to ban games
984.18,985.74, entirely because when you play
985.74,989.68," one game, you get addicted to the process of gaming and thus that compounds your cost in buying"
989.68,994.42," other games, for example. We don't think this logic really stands in this debate and isn't what"
994.42,999.74," this debate is about. Even at its best case, we can prove much worse harms. Before my arguments,"
999.86,1008.64," I'll take a point. All right, so you talk about the kind of information or the lack thereof because you're"
1008.64,1013.04, actually putting them on upfront cost don't you think there's so many other avenues like youtube
1013.04,1017.12, reviews live streaming applications that would still give you the best quality of the game and
1017.12,1021.76, you know what you're paying for uh no because the point is that you give them less information or
1021.76,1028.08, student deal with the point that you force the same addicted people to take on a higher cost first argument as to why this hurts the gaming
1028.08,1033.28, economy the reason why this important is that the esports and gaming industry is a multi-billion
1033.28,1037.76, dollar industry that hundreds of thousands of people are dependent on first level of this
1037.76,1045.28, argument that you hurt games developers games development is very expensive because there are high startup and maintenance costs.
1046.0,1050.12," Maintaining servers, graphics, paying developers, etc."
1050.8,1054.7, And the market is extremely saturated with a high number of developers.
1055.22,1058.14, This means that the other two possible models are unprofitable.
1058.52,1061.44, Totally free games are unprofitable because there is no income whatsoever.
1061.94,1069.02, And pay-to-play is unsustainable because it requires users to make a speculative video for example in fifa you can only play as barcelona versus
1069.02,1073.32, madrid in a demo you do not know whether that is the full extent of the game the impact of this
1073.32,1078.34, policy is thus that you hurt smaller games developers who rely on free-to-play as a way
1078.34,1082.86, to make a brand name for themselves small developers like valve that had to rely on team
1082.86,1085.26," fortress true which was a free-to-play game,"
1090.2,1090.46, were then able to create a brand name for themselves that allowed them to enter the market and create games like Half-Life.
1094.26,1094.9," On their side of the house, they limit job opportunities for many people."
1101.88,1102.16," But even if that is not true, what happens when you are less profitable is that inevitably these companies are going to start having to get rid of their bottom line."
1107.24,1111.5," This means that even if you keep having the same number of games, you'll fire a large number of people that work specifically on free-to-play games. Second level of this argument is that you hurt esports leagues."
1111.88,1116.7, The majority of esports economy is based on free-to-play games because these games are the
1116.7,1121.68," most competitive because they are the most easily accessible. PUBG in India and Valorant in Korea,"
1121.82,1125.1, for example. These can't be costless because they are high
1125.1,1130.18, quality and require a large amount of investment. People thus are dependent on these games for their
1130.18,1134.74, livelihoods. Game developers who spend their entire lives creating these games. Professional
1134.74,1139.18, players for whom this is their only source of income. Streamers who rely on streaming these
1139.18,1145.28, games online in order to get money. All of these people go out of a job and likely won't be able to switch on
1145.28,1150.96, their side of the house. Developers can't switch because of the transferable skills really
1150.96,1155.44, aren't there to other forms of coding. Having to switch between a free-to-play game to another form
1155.44,1159.36, of game is different because the way the code works. The second is that professional players
1159.36,1163.92, can't switch because in terms of the sports skills that you learn they're not really transferable.
1163.92,1167.62," The reason that all of this is true is because when you ban free-to-play games,"
1167.62,1173.0," you increase the barriers to access, making it much worse for a large number of people"
1173.0,1176.26, in terms of entering the market and therefore hurting this esports.
1176.94,1182.3, Second argument then as to why you worsen the outcomes for people who want to play games.
1182.78,1185.12, The first level of this argument is why gaming is a
1185.12,1190.16, legitimate pursuit this is because it's a source of fulfillment it's escapism interaction and
1190.16,1193.84, community with other people who are friends that you're able to make and a source of achievement
1193.84,1199.2, you're able to gain in your life even if these companies don't in unemployed people the only
1199.2,1204.56, way for them to make up for this is to include all these costs upfront which make an extremely high
1204.56,1205.02, cost to
1205.02,1210.14," people who want to buy the game. Thus, people who play this game purely for fun lose out because"
1210.14,1213.94, they cannot spend and do not have the ability to spend. And people who do things like buy upgrades
1213.94,1218.0, have a higher cost because they now have to pay for everything rather than just specifically the
1218.0,1223.4," one thing you want lead to a much higher cost on their side of the house. Secondly, game developers"
1223.4,1226.0, have no incentive to update old games
1226.0,1230.56, because there is no revenue stream that comes from in-game purchases what this means is that games
1230.56,1235.52, become a lot less accessible to poorer people who cannot afford to update their servers if i'm
1235.52,1241.44, playing halo on an xbox 360 on their side of the world i'd have to upgrade and buy a ps5 in order
1241.44,1245.6, to be able to now play that game because of the fact that there's no reason to do
1245.6,1250.16, that even if i bought the game there's no reason to update previous games all of this just proves
1250.16,1254.24, reduced access to all the benefits that gaming can provide and the wealth of
1254.24,1257.76, happiness that it can bring people for all of these reasons we oppose
1260.72,1290.86, thank you for that speech we now welcome the second speaker of the panel. Okay.
1290.86,1290.96, Okay.
1300.0,1305.98," Okay, I'll start my speech in three, two, one."
1306.44,1309.96, Just to clarify a couple of things at this point in the debate.
1310.26,1313.26," Firstly, what we're saying is we're not saying all games are going to be free."
1313.4,1317.82, We think you'll still be able to choose whether to charge on your game or whether to have your game free.
1318.06,1320.62," But secondly, we're not saying we're going to stop addiction."
1320.82,1329.0, We're just saying the difference is our side of the world does not capitalize on this addiction to make money I think an important thing to understand is that games are very
1329.0,1334.34, addictive and cows already characterized that to you we think free trials and games are not similar
1334.34,1339.44, in any way and the information there info slide already talks about you know a sizable portion
1339.44,1344.3, of the game being available we think being part of a game and having rank competing with your friends
1344.3,1345.04, and whatnot is very different from watching one movie we don't think they can you know bring that availed we think being part of a game and having rank competing with your friends and what not is
1345.04,1349.6, very different from watching one movie we don't think they can you know bring that sort of uh try
1349.6,1353.44, to make those things seem like they're on the same level right firstly i'm going to talk about uh
1353.44,1357.28, rebutting their case a couple of things that i talk about before i move into my substantive right
1357.28,1361.52, so they bring this whole idea on accessibility and how they feel like they do it far much better
1361.52,1368.5, in their side of the world we think it's okay in status quo this already exists for you to give me a reason to pay for something or a reason to buy
1368.5,1373.62, something we think that's already okay but we think free game free games already exist in society so
1373.62,1378.06, if you're going to talk about accessibility if i cannot buy something i will go for the alternative
1378.06,1382.54, so if i cannot pay for this game i will you know access a free game and we think that's okay we
1382.54,1390.88," think that's how status quo works right we don't think if you can't afford these particular games that will change in your side of the world,"
1390.88,1394.72," we think you'll just be more likely to pay. We think in your scenario, you'll be more likely"
1394.72,1399.12," to trade off certain things that would be necessary. For example, buying books for school,"
1399.12,1403.44," for you to pay for a particular game. We think you're more likely to call us kids especially,"
1403.44,1408.22," because that's the target market when it comes to game, to pay for this particular game, we think you're more likely to call us kids, especially because that's, you know, the target market when it comes to game to pay for this particular stuff. And we think"
1408.22,1412.98," that's harmful, right? We think when you talk about removing bad parts of the game, that's not"
1412.98,1417.36," what we are talking about in this debate, right? We think the most important thing to understand,"
1417.42,1421.82," and we both concede to this, is that games are already addictive. So the problem in this debate"
1421.82,1433.38, is the fact that they are capitalizing on this addiction in order to make sure people will stay hooked and locked into the game and pay for those sort of upgrades that they wouldn't necessarily do if they were able to make rational decisions.
1433.64,1448.08," Then when you talk about this whole idea on less information, we are saying that it's unjust to keep using a gamer's love for the game against them and using their irrationality against them. But even if this was not true, we think there's sniper wolf, we think there's game reviews,"
1448.18,1452.36, we think you can still be able to be objective on whether you're going to pay for something
1452.36,1454.2," or not, and that becomes valuable."
1454.42,1459.22," But even if that was not true, we think being able to rationally decide to play a game or"
1459.22,1463.4, not is the best side of the world where we're able to make you as objective as possible
1463.4,1469.14, in how you're spending your money and that becomes beneficial. On this whole idea on them you know hurting game developers
1469.14,1473.86, and whatnot we think firstly competition is okay we think that's how the market works it's fine to
1473.86,1477.74, have competition and for this competition to affect you we think it just makes you want to
1477.74,1482.6, have more quality and we think production costs already go into the money that you charge anyway
1482.6,1489.34," so you would still have profit but even if that not true, we think new companies are likely to make themselves free at first,"
1489.34,1495.5," and then after that, maybe later games, they'll charge on later games. We think that they'd be"
1495.5,1500.6, more likely to do that. We see that in status quo when products keep getting expensive as people
1500.6,1504.64," keep using them and quality increases. We think that's okay. But even if all that was not true,"
1504.84,1508.88," we think just by principle, you shouldn't use someone's addiction to make profit. We don't"
1508.88,1512.38," think you should defend such a world, right? I'm going to talk about a couple of things in my"
1512.38,1517.04," speech. I'll flag when I'll take any POIs. Firstly, rationality versus irrationality and how we"
1517.04,1523.38," promote that in our side of the world. Secondly, why inequality is not fair. Then I will just"
1523.38,1526.5, compare both worlds. Now on this idea of rationality
1526.5,1530.82," versus irrationality, we think other than, you know, people who have money, the more likely"
1530.82,1535.32," target market in ops world is those who don't have money, right? So they're going to buy into this"
1535.32,1539.78," free level, whatever, and just get into that world. We think this looks like, you know,"
1539.8,1544.54, the example I gave of choosing not to buy books or choosing not to buy things that you need in
1544.54,1548.72," order to get a new character. A few reasons we think this is true. We think firstly, e-cursor already"
1548.72,1552.74," characterized the nature of the gaming industries and how, you know, the hook it has on its"
1552.74,1557.44," consumers. But second and most importantly, we think, and here is the, you know, the scenario"
1557.44,1560.82," that we are trying to create. We think when you're already part of a game, because that's what"
1560.82,1564.8," happens when you play the beginning parts of the game for free, you're already part of the game,"
1567.62,1571.24, you already have a rank and you already have said said you're already actively participating in this game. We think there'd be more incentive for you to spend this
1571.24,1575.72, money. That's why we are saying it's not fair for you to compare this to free trials in society.
1575.72,1579.68," We think just the nature of the gaming industry makes that different, right? We think this is"
1579.68,1583.76, then compared to our world where you have rational and objective decisions. We think you choose to
1583.76,1585.16, pay for necessary things.
1585.38,1590.02, We think I'd still choose to go on vacation just because that's quality that I'm willing to spend on.
1590.22,1593.48, We think just being able to be objective like that becomes important.
1593.48,1601.0," We think in our world, quality plays a bigger part because now the producers will want to have more quality games"
1601.0,1604.0, so they can have better buy-in or more people spend on these games.
1604.22,1608.84, And we think that's okay. We feel like it's better than a world where they're depending on you to be
1608.84,1612.88," hooked on this game for you to spend on this game. We think just by principle, that's not justified."
1613.18,1618.08, We think then it's unlikely that the consumer can evidently quantify how much of an investment
1618.08,1621.78, they're making in a game in their side of the world. We think if you're going to progressively
1621.78,1627.44," keep paying for something, you're very unlikely to quantify how much you're spending and because of that you're very likely"
1627.44,1631.2, not going to make a rational objective decision right because you're not going to know how much
1631.2,1634.8, i'm spending on this game because all i want is to get a new costume to get a new character
1634.8,1637.52, and we don't think that's valuable i'll take any pure at this point
1639.2,1645.1, would you ban in-game transactions that don't have an up in games that don't have an upfront cost
1645.1,1652.22, sorry would you ban in-game transactions in games that are free to play because they don't have an
1652.22,1659.12, upfront cost i think having an upfront cost is better because then i actively make the decision
1659.12,1663.68, to pay these upfront i think at the point where i'm able to actively know i'm paying this amount
1663.68,1668.42, of my money upfront that becomes more valuable than progressively spending on something and I
1668.42,1672.64, don't know how much I'm spending. Moving on to inequality in the games. We think if you pay for
1672.64,1677.26," a game, you're still at the same level because you all pay. And we think if you don't pay for a game,"
1677.4,1681.04," you're still at the same level because it's free for everyone, right? So we think in those words,"
1681.26,1684.64," in one side, everyone who's playing this particular game has paid. And another side,"
1684.74,1688.08, everyone who's playing this particular game has not paid side everyone who's playing this particular game has not paid we think at that point we have
1688.08,1693.6, equality but in this particular world that op is creating we think the determining factor of
1693.6,1698.48, success then becomes who has money and who doesn't have skill and we think when we were brought for
1698.48,1702.96, the influence that we were clearly told that we are talking about a sport and we need to understand
1702.96,1709.0, that the most important thing to the gaming industry especially now when it's becoming a sport you know in the mainstream is to make
1709.0,1713.32, competition fair in the best way possible and i think at the point where we are able to have hard
1713.32,1718.34, work being the determining factor and not something like money because in their world the people who
1718.34,1722.88, have the ability to access characters have the ability to access certain you know clothes and
1722.88,1725.16, whatever then become the people who have the advantage.
1725.42,1726.5, And we think that's not valuable.
1726.7,1728.14," I think when we compare both worlds,"
1728.24,1730.44," in our world, we are able to protect consumers"
1730.44,1733.1," who become very vulnerable in this particular time,"
1733.16,1734.3," not only because they are kids,"
1734.52,1735.62, but because they're already hooked
1735.62,1736.54, to these particular games
1736.54,1738.2, and they're going to ask their parents for money.
1738.26,1739.9, They're going to spend money on this game
1739.9,1741.36, when they could have done other things
1741.36,1742.52, or they could have been more rational
1742.52,1743.6, in that decision they're making.
1743.82,1747.22, We're not saying they shouldn't play video games. We're just saying at
1747.22,1750.36," the point where you're able to know I'm paying this much for a video game, then that's what"
1750.36,1754.06," you're making the active choice to spend that money. And that's okay. We think on their side,"
1754.16,1757.62, they use the addiction of these people against them. And that's already principally unjust.
1757.88,1762.58," But we think then quality stops being the determining factor easily, because then what"
1762.58,1768.32, you're looking for is to get people hooked to your game so they can spend money and not necessarily having a good game and just don't
1768.32,1774.56, think that's a valuable word thank you thank you so much for that speech we now welcome the second
1774.56,1816.32," speaker of the opposition actually i'm so sorry i'm going to go grab a sip of water. Just one second. Okay, I'm back."
1816.32,1881.72," Second off, you're good to go when you're ready. Hi, can everybody hear me yep okay uh i'll take pure as in chat please three areas of analysis in this speech first on whether a ban is justified secondly on facilitating"
1881.72,1886.0," the development of the gaming industry thirdlyly, on increasing access to video games."
1886.0,1888.0," First, on whether a ban is justified."
1888.0,1892.0, Let's for a moment revisit the principle of side proposition.
1892.0,1900.0," Their claim is this. Games are addictive because game developers are able to offer you a few levels that creates a dopamine rush,"
1900.0,1904.0, which means that you are coerced into buying the next few levels.
1904.0,1908.44, Now let's take this analysis and see where else we can apply it.
1908.44,1913.12," Let's imagine that Netflix offers me a free subscription, a trial for one month."
1913.12,1916.44, And I enjoy using the service because I think that the interface is designed
1916.44,1919.38," well, the content is something that I enjoy watching."
1919.38,1924.48," After that one month has expired, I decide that based on my experiences with Netflix,"
1924.48,1925.3, I want to now pay for
1925.3,1930.66, the service. But let's apply this even more broadly. If I buy any product and that product
1930.66,1937.5, creates a positive reaction because dopamine in my brain is something that is generated as a result
1937.5,1943.18," of using that product, would proposition claim that any company that creates a dopamine reaction"
1943.18,1949.78, in the minds of its consumers are somehow coercing us into giving up our money in order to facilitate the success of the company
1949.78,1954.02, alone. The point that I'm trying to make is that their principle is not a principle against
1954.02,1958.54, addiction. It's a principle that would prevent companies from being able to operate and sell
1958.54,1963.66, their products to consumers on the basis that any way in which you improve a consumer's life
1963.66,1966.94, by creating a dopamine rush is a form of coercion.
1967.24,1973.3," The question in this debate is not whether or not these products create pleasure, because that is true of any successful product."
1973.3,1980.82," The question in this debate is whether the threshold of addiction is so significant that this actually causes a tangible harm to consumers,"
1981.06,1988.6, which would justify the addiction being so great that the state ought to intervene to create a ban. We don't think that the addiction to video games is something that
1988.6,1993.9, perversely hurts the quality of life of individuals. People don't spend exorbitant sums of money to the
1993.9,1998.44, vast majority of people don't spend exorbitant sums of money at the cost of things like their
1998.44,2003.02, living expenses to pay for in-game purchases and neither do we think that all companies are
2003.02,2009.28, necessarily responsible for the addictive nature of consumers why is it that even the companies that are not intentionally trying to
2009.28,2014.32, manipulate consumers that haven't created a fundamentally addictive gaming interface ought
2014.32,2019.52, to be punished by a punitive ban on all free-to-play games these questions are still unclear
2019.52,2023.44, to us so that's the first response that i want to make which is that the principle is inconsistent
2023.44,2032.3," the second response that i want to make is that this principle only applies in instances where the vast majority of free to play games actually restrict access to a few levels,"
2032.6,2038.42," as opposed to restricting access to things like cosmetic products, which don't have an effect on your actual gaming experience."
2038.68,2043.34," I would point out that there are structural incentives not to want to limit access to the number of levels available,"
2043.62,2046.48, given that this is not the model that most free-to-play games use.
2046.82,2050.5," Firstly, there's an incentive to maintain a large base of users, given that this is"
2050.5,2052.9, what you can use to market the game as being highly successful.
2053.28,2057.52," Secondly, games with a larger user base are generally more competitive, and that is part"
2057.52,2058.86, of the appeal of many of these games.
2059.0,2063.2, So you have an incentive to ensure that even if there are some power-ups or boosters that
2063.2,2069.52," people can buy, that hard work can always compensate for that within the game itself thirdly many games want to avoid the"
2069.52,2074.4, stigma of being paid to win which means in general the content overall and all the different game
2074.4,2078.24, modes are accessible it's largely things like cosmetics that people buy because they want
2078.24,2083.44, greater social capital within the game or want to feel like a part of a unique clique of individuals
2083.44,2085.0, who only have access to that content
2085.0,2089.78, that the gaming industry and games developers rely on. The third response that I want to make
2089.78,2095.42, is that their world is not one in which they improve the lives of addicted people. This is
2095.42,2100.42," for two reasons. Firstly, their world is one in which games developers rely exclusively on"
2100.42,2105.32," pay-to-play games. This is far worse because on their side of the house, based on their own"
2105.32,2109.72," principle, they also can't have things like demos for games given that that would also be coercing"
2109.72,2115.02," consumers into buying the game itself. This means that on their side of the house, if I ever make"
2115.02,2120.88," the decision to pay for a game upfront, I do so with less information because I have never actually"
2120.88,2129.52," played even something that is a version of that game. This is far, far worse. If they claim that consumers are irrational, you can always become a more rational consumer and"
2129.52,2133.92, have and take greater control of that. What you can't account for is the fact that you have never
2133.92,2138.08, played a game and don't have access to information in the first place. This is where things like the
2138.08,2142.64," watchdogs debacle, for example, where pay to play games deliberately market themselves as being"
2142.64,2146.1," better than they actually are become more likely in the world of the proposition,"
2146.38,2149.26, because consumers have no information about the game that they are buying.
2149.38,2151.4, It's entirely a speculative judgment that they make.
2151.64,2154.7," Relying on reviewers, as the previous speaker suggested, is insufficient,"
2155.04,2159.5, given that we know that companies like Microsoft pay off reviewers like Kotaku
2159.5,2161.24, to give their games positive reviews.
2161.56,2163.38," Finally, I want to take them at their best."
2163.38,2168.96, Let's concede that there is a small minority of people that are so addicted to this game that they're giving up large quantities
2168.96,2173.12, of money to it i would point out that this is not a this house prefers motion which would change
2173.12,2177.6, from the beginning of time but a policy that the government implements in present if currently you
2177.6,2182.8, are somebody who is addicted to playing a mobile the likelihood is even after it becomes pay to
2182.8,2185.36, play you continue to pay the additional upfront
2185.36,2190.48, cost because you are so addicted to the game that you have no option but to do so so overnight the
2190.48,2194.4, costs to those that are addicted increase massively because they now need to pay for
2194.4,2199.84, the complete game upfront this also means that games developers have an incentive to further
2199.84,2204.64, exploit the most addicted players because you now you can no longer rely on casual consumers
2204.64,2207.74," and players who only buy one or two cosmetic items,"
2207.74,2209.24, because those people wouldn't want
2209.24,2211.5, to pay the large upfront cost of the game itself.
2211.5,2214.64," It means that the game design, the marketing of cosmetics,"
2214.64,2217.1," becomes far more aggressive in the world of the proposition,"
2217.1,2219.38, because you are relying on a smaller consumer base
2219.38,2221.84, to pay you a higher quantity of money.
2221.84,2224.12," And because you need to account for the lost consumers,"
2224.12,2229.12, because casual gamers have exited the market. Finally want to be this we think that there are intrinsic benefits
2229.12,2233.84, from gaming the sense of fulfillment that you get from achieving things within years the escapism
2233.84,2238.64, the access to a wholesome community that many individuals use to make friends and above all
2238.64,2243.52, the costs to the industry the people whose lives depend upon being able to market free to play
2243.52,2248.96, games and being able to develop those games which they massively hurt so even if there are a small minority of people who
2248.96,2255.12, are addicted on a utilitarian basis we prefer to prioritize the vast majority of people who benefit
2255.12,2259.76, from the industry finally on facilitating the development of video games industry they say that
2259.76,2266.08, on their side of the house they can maintain the longevity through play to break play to play
2266.08,2270.48, pay to play games rather firstly i would point out that this massively restricts your consumer base
2270.48,2275.12, you lose casual gamers and people that only buy a few cosmetic items thirdly we think that there
2275.12,2279.36, is no response as this is crippling to our argument about the growth of small games developers these
2279.36,2282.64, are the people who are most reliant on free to play games given that they do not have an established
2282.64,2287.44, brand image these people cannot find a way to pay for free-to-play games because they now also can't
2287.44,2292.32," charge in-game transaction. Finally, this leads me to the third and final area of response which is"
2292.32,2296.8, also my substantive about reducing the quality of games. I would point out that there is no response
2296.8,2300.8, to our arguments about access but in addition there is an exclusive benefit on our side of the
2300.8,2309.88," house which is that gaming culture becomes more equitable and less sexist. Historically, games have largely been marketed to male audiences, which has meant that"
2309.88,2314.82," over time, video games developers have become more sexist and video games have an incentive to appeal"
2314.82,2318.74, to the male case. This looks like the hyper-sexualization of female characters in many
2318.74,2324.34, games and also things like hostile chat rooms and video game chats that are explicitly sexist in the
2324.34,2325.2, worst ways. Why do
2325.2,2329.92," you think that the rise of free-to-play games reduces this sexism? Firstly, games developers"
2329.92,2334.56, have an incentive to broaden their audiences. They know that they are now no longer relying on just
2334.56,2339.84, the small dedicated group of largely male gamers who are willing to pay for games but also people
2339.84,2344.0," who just casually game on their mobile phones, people who access free-to-play games because they"
2344.0,2348.56, recognize that they don't have to pay anything at all this is more likely to mean a diversification
2348.56,2352.64, of video game audiences which means that the incentives of games developers become far far
2352.64,2357.2, better there is a mainstreaming effect which increases the scrutiny on games developers
2357.2,2361.68, which means that more people are able to enjoy games where previously they were locked out due
2361.68,2366.72, to sexist barriers this is an additional part to victory because it means that games become less sexist
2366.72,2369.88," and more enjoyable for more people, which leads to greater fulfillment."
2369.88,2371.48, So all of these reasons oppose.
2374.32,2426.0," Thank you for that speech. Just give me one. you Okay, thank you so much for that speech and I welcome the third speaker of the proposition."
2426.0,2480.42, Could I just have a few more seconds to compile my notes. Takk for ating med. Okay.
2480.42,2490.96," I prefer to take my POS verbally. I'm going to start my speech in three, two, one."
2491.86,2493.58," Okay, so the opposition opened the argument"
2493.58,2496.04," by speaking of how important games are to society,"
2496.32,2498.14, how the emotional value behind games
2498.14,2499.22, and the culture behind them
2499.22,2501.88, really shapes how our society goes and looks at.
2502.72,2505.5, Opening with how people playing the Minecraft theme song
2505.5,2508.46, in WSDC was a really impactful and emotional moment.
2508.46,2509.96, And we concede to that.
2509.96,2512.88," We know that there is a value to games in the community around them, which is why we"
2512.88,2519.54, stand so passionately behind being for this motion and not and banning free to play games.
2519.54,2526.08, Certain arguments such as the exploitation of addicts and how this makes a worse environment later on which we're
2526.08,2530.16, going to get into our speech what i'm going to justify to you is where our side wins and actually
2530.16,2535.28, provides a better environment um for gaming that actually stays true to those principles of
2535.28,2539.52, equality that gaming needs of a sports and just maintains that whole environment so what i'm going
2539.52,2543.76, to do in my argument is i'm first going to be addressing some rebuttals restoring the arguments
2543.76,2548.8, that some of them have tried to take down and then I'll move on to my points of clash and analysis so first on my
2548.8,2552.56, rebuttals of the opposition's argument um the first thing that they brought up is that free
2552.56,2556.64, to play games make it worse for people with addictions because now they have to pay up for
2556.64,2561.04, cost um which is higher for them um the one thing that they really miss out is that they don't seem
2561.04,2565.2, to understand the argument how exactly addictions work and the logical link
2565.2,2571.12, between um how people getting a sizable access to the game in free to play leads them getting a
2571.12,2578.0, worse addiction um the first so to then make that connection for them i'm going to compare to
2578.0,2583.12, alcoholism which is an act also an addiction it's that when someone who is an alcoholic who is
2583.12,2588.68," chronically addicted to a certain thing gets a taste, then it's harder for them to avoid the second drink, and then"
2588.68,2591.84," they drink the second one, it's harder for them to avoid the third one. The thing, the"
2591.84,2595.26," case that we're making is that in the info site, it says that free to play games give"
2595.26,2599.92, a sizable portion of the game available to people. So now what this looks like for someone
2599.92,2604.16, who's addicted is that they have a sizable portion available. This is different for a
2604.16,2608.96," demo, because a demo does not give a sizable portion of the game there isn't that addictions are worse when"
2608.96,2614.48, free to play games simply because that one word sizable you give them more taste of the game which
2614.48,2620.0, leads them um more into that trap of spending more money um and why they actually do spend more money
2620.0,2624.16, in these free to play games so our second speaker brought up is that it's harder to realize when
2624.16,2629.2," you're spending money if you spend a little bit a little. If you're only paying $20 for a skin once,"
2629.2,2634.48," $20 for disability in the game and you're doing that over a period of weeks, it's so much"
2634.48,2640.4, easier to far by far exceed the amount that you'd have spent if you're just doing it upfront. I'm
2640.4,2645.6," going to pay $70 for this game. So overall over longevity, it's a higher cost"
2645.6,2648.02, because it's harder to realize how much you're spending.
2648.02,2649.3," One, because of the addiction and two,"
2649.3,2650.66, because it's a more gradual one.
2650.66,2653.52, I'll take my prayers at the fifth minute.
2653.52,2655.64," So then now to build off of that,"
2655.64,2659.1," it's that on the second point,"
2659.1,2660.3, they said that gaming producers
2660.3,2665.6, wouldn't be able to monetize their games now if we ban.
2670.64,2671.04," We do admit that co-revenue, large, large amounts of revenue,"
2673.02,2674.88, but we believe that the reason we should ban this is because they do that in an unethical way.
2674.92,2678.02," If we talk about the characterization of having people who,"
2678.46,2679.88, or building off of people's addiction
2679.88,2681.22, stopping an important thing.
2681.46,2683.2, One claim that they made in their argument
2683.2,2685.84, is that these portion of
2685.84,2690.16," people that are addicted under status quo are so insignificant, or at least in amount, that they"
2690.16,2695.2, should not be considered in this debate. And one thing that that view fails to realize is that
2695.2,2701.04," that's simply not true. These are really, really, really big issue about addiction to games. And"
2701.04,2706.48," although not all cases are extreme, that level of addiction exists among a very,"
2706.48,2710.56," very large number of people. It may not be the majority, but the fact that that exists in a"
2710.56,2715.68," significant amount of people makes it very, very important for whoever to win this debate to prove"
2715.68,2720.64," that they cater to that group of people. Because although they might be a slight minority,"
2720.64,2732.0, upholding that for those people is more important because then you end up defending people who have a vulnerability versus the convenience and enjoyment of people who would have been perfectly fine otherwise.
2732.0,2735.0, That's why it's more important for them to defend them in this debate.
2735.0,2749.68," So the first point I'm going to make on that is that free to play is the only way games make revenue isn't by consumers paying them directly. You have things like ads and games, which actually tend to be the best way some games monetize them if they're free to play."
2749.68,2757.4, And this is really common in the mobile game space where you have games with ads and they are actually able to monetize themselves.
2757.4,2765.36," And if you're looking at the small game developers that they were talking about earlier, if they do want to use this model then it would be more practical and more ethical in this"
2765.36,2771.92, way to make a free game that has revenue through ads or through any other things such as sponsors
2771.92,2778.08, donations um this is having a free to play game isn't the only model of monetization um nor is it
2778.08,2784.8, the most effective and for them to claim that it's the only way because it's unethical to play off
2784.8,2785.8, of people's addictions
2785.8,2790.32, as we've already proved in our argument and free to play games are still monetizable and
2790.32,2794.3, in addition to that upfront payment games are still monetizable a company is going to
2794.3,2799.12, charge the amount that it needs to charge based off of how much it's spent developing
2799.12,2803.46, a game and the reason that this is at one point that there is is that if we have people
2803.46,2805.62, doing that always it's always going to be more expensive
2805.62,2808.32, and we're going to exclude a certain amount of people.
2808.32,2811.38, And I'll get into accessibility later in my speech.
2811.38,2814.04, One way to mitigate that is that
2814.04,2816.96, all games are still looking to have a high demand.
2816.96,2818.34," If you're a gaming company,"
2818.34,2820.66, as of any company is still looking to have a high demand
2820.66,2822.94, because high demand means higher profit.
2822.94,2825.72," It's a really impractical model, unless"
2825.72,2831.52," you're a luxury company, to have high demand or to have high prices and low demand. So"
2831.52,2837.26," they're going to be incentivized to keep the game as possible, which aids in accessibility."
2837.26,2855.0," So the first point, yeah, my first point in accessibility before I got into weighing is that you still do have people in like more casual gamers being able to access this information you look at things like YouTubers casual gamers are still able to watch YouTubers that actually"
2855.0,2866.56," talk about those games, and you know now make the decision based off of where they want to play it based off of the things that they hear um and the second way is that casual gamers still have access to"
2866.56,2875.76, free to play games we don't limit the information that they get on that um yes so we don't restrict
2875.76,2879.52, people from having information because this information is still available we haven't
2879.52,2883.92, restricted demos because demos don't give a sizable portion as in the slide says they give
2883.92,2890.4, a little bit so not on to weigh my argument um i've already proven to you that one we cater to people with addictions
2890.4,2893.92, more because then to put them in this place with actually tasting what they're addicted to
2893.92,2899.76, makes them more likely to spend at a larger rate because then they don't have that reasonability
2899.76,2904.48, to see okay i'm spending a thousand dollars in a year rather than me spending fifty dollars once
2904.48,2908.64, in a year because i'm spending twenty dollars every week. The reason that that's more important
2908.64,2913.76, than that it's more important that we've been on our catering to people with addiction is because
2913.76,2917.76, of how vulnerable these people are. In the beginning we characterize these people as being
2917.76,2922.4, you know predominantly younger people who don't have as much income as those who are older. So
2922.4,2930.08, it's more important for us to make sure that we create a society and a system in which that is upheld and that we just put them in the
2930.08,2934.08, best position possible. The second part is that the kind of environment that we create
2934.72,2940.72, is really important. If we have pay to play games and there's kind of that distinction based off of
2940.72,2944.56," how much money you have, then that kind of system that we're talking about in the beginning where"
2944.56,2953.0," people are really into the culture of the game, that kind of starts to break down when you have this distinction based on how much someone can play the game."
2953.0,2969.04," The reason that we win on that clash is because we maintain people being seen as being good at the game, not because they have money, but because they're just genuinely good. It better upholds that culture on the game which is really important because then we able to we're able to maintain that really valuable thing that op was talking about in the"
2969.04,2977.04, beginning um yes so we best provide for the gaming community we think we win in that clash um and
2977.04,2982.24, it's more important that we win on accessibility as well because we still have people having this
2982.24,2988.8, access to the information and being able to make more rational choices and we are the only side that provides rationality
2988.8,2996.06, people being able to pay for these games thank you um that's my eight minutes thanks for
2996.06,3005.28," that speech we now welcome the third speaker of the opposition Hi, just to check if I'm audible and visible."
3005.5,3006.5, Yep.
3006.8,3022.9, Awesome.
3027.48,3032.46, I just want to point out at the top of this speech that they have virtually no response to Chanidu's third argument and our argument on broad economic harms to individuals such
3032.46,3033.46, as smaller developers.
3033.46,3038.72, Now maybe this isn't a big issue to Kenya but I want you to weigh what these harms look
3038.72,3039.72, like.
3039.72,3044.4, Maybe on their best case someone has to pay 10 extra dollars for a few levels in a game
3044.4,3046.02, but to a small developer
3046.02,3051.64, it's their entire livelihood and it's their job on the line if they don't get this and if they
3051.64,3057.26, can't develop within the industry so prop 3 conceiving that maybe these economy harms may
3057.26,3062.66, occur is pretty devastating to that case just because they don't engage with it doesn't mean
3062.66,3069.56, this content is not important i want to know that these are independent paths to victory by virtue of the fact that they are unresponded to.
3069.88,3071.56, Two things I'll talk about in this speech.
3071.94,3074.84," First, on addiction and why it gets worse in props world."
3075.2,3079.24," Second, I'll talk to you about broader social impacts such as the economy and diversity."
3079.7,3080.82," First, then, on addiction."
3081.32,3085.44, I want to note that we have made the intuition pump as to why free-to-play
3085.44,3091.18, games are like any other services companies provide you. I want to note then that the extra
3091.18,3097.04, step I will take in this speech is pointing out that their argument is hung on consumers being
3097.04,3101.52, able to be hyper-rational when it comes to purchasing games where you have to pay the
3101.52,3110.5, upfront cost. Here's why this is not true. It three reasons first in a world in which companies can't allow people to play a sizable portion of
3110.5,3115.48, the game they're more likely to turn towards exploitative advertising that hooks and reels
3115.48,3120.16, people in like advertising business for most products that are sold in the status quo they
3120.16,3125.22," needed to explain why they can't do it for games where you pay the upfront cost. Second, reviews"
3125.22,3132.96, can easily be manipulated by companies. The point is the moment at which a company's profits are
3132.96,3138.68," reliant on everyone paying an upfront cost, that's when the incentive to manipulate people such as"
3138.68,3146.56," streamers, pay them to publish good reviews exist and progressesors within society and to these individuals it's probably"
3146.56,3151.72, very profitable to be paid by companies given that they can give you mass amounts of revenue
3151.72,3157.46, but third reviews are just insufficient because you may get mixed reviews like just because you
3157.46,3162.78, listen to someone talk about how a game was you can never gauge what that game was like for yourself
3162.78,3170.16, which is a reason as to why you want that experience by your own personal view which is why reviews are insufficient for information
3170.16,3174.08, so i would note that people would still be addicted to games on their set the house but
3174.08,3179.28, i'll prove why it becomes worse so the thing they hang on which is information is insufficient
3179.28,3185.28, however what is required to clean up this debate is a breakdown of the different types of stakeholders
3185.28,3192.18," who pay free to play games. Three types of people. First, people who pay for some of the upgrades in"
3192.18,3196.66," the game. So you don't buy all the levels and all the skins, but you buy some of them. Second,"
3196.88,3201.78," people who pay for everything. But thirdly, people who just play the game and don't pay for anything."
3202.3,3205.04, What I want to do before moving on to the analysis on
3205.04,3211.36, each individual stakeholder is to frame that the upfront cost of a game is likely to be extremely
3211.36,3217.2, high this is because companies now give you the game at an upfront cost and give you access to
3217.2,3226.24, all levels and skills and skins but the aggregation of the individual cost that is required to produce those extra levels those
3226.24,3231.2, extra seasons of this fortnite battle pass the additional cost of all the skins that are made
3231.2,3237.28, available with the upfront costs are all aggregated and that is what you pay for in propositions work
3237.28,3242.08, so this is a massively high cost as opposed to the progressive one and i'll deal with that a bit
3242.08,3251.04, later the response we hear in prop 3 is there are other ways to monetize free to play games free to play games that is advertisements two responses
3251.04,3257.6, to this first companies wouldn't necessarily want to advertise on games on games to pay the upfront
3257.6,3262.24, cost because they're not sure whether consumers will buy these games given that the upfront cost
3262.24,3266.42, is so high but second less people are going to play
3266.42,3271.0, games if you're going to be spammed with ads every three minutes that you play the game.
3271.28,3276.2, So it is either that companies have to cut down on the quality of games in order to make them
3276.2,3282.82," affordable or companies have to charge exorbitantly high prices for games. Based on that, let's move"
3282.82,3286.54, on to the stakeholder analysis first people who pay for
3286.54,3291.7, everything within a game I would note that this stakeholder is pretty symmetric given that they
3291.7,3296.68, will pay the upfront cost for this tool so all their harms are the most addicted also apply to
3296.68,3301.72, their side no response to this by the way second it's people who pay for nothing within the game
3301.72,3309.92, because either they're rational and they just don't care to buy more things or they can't afford it i don't know that you completely lock these individuals out
3309.92,3314.72, from paying the game playing the game when they have to pay the upfront cost as opposed to being
3314.72,3319.6, able to just play the sizable portion of the game this is where we directly engage with their
3319.6,3325.88, argumentation on this skill versus money difference because for the people who rely on only skill they
3325.88,3331.7, can now not play the game at all versus being able to play the game on asset of the house but finally
3331.7,3336.98, it's people who pay for some of the things within these games and upgrades as opposed to everything
3336.98,3342.68, I want to know that this is the majority stakeholder given that even if we want to buy
3342.68,3346.28, everything within a game there are other checks and balances within our life.
3346.62,3351.68," For example, they say that a majority of stakeholders in this debate are children."
3352.08,3358.58, Why parents are going to allow their child to pay an exorbitantly high progressive cost is extremely unclear to me.
3358.78,3364.6," Why the other checks and influences you have in your life, such as the tangible harm you feel from going hungry,"
3364.6,3370.0, if you buy a skin instead of eating lunch or dinner is also a check within your life.
3370.0,3374.88," I would note that on our side, people who pay for some of the upgrades within games"
3374.88,3379.28," have the choice as to what upgrades they want to pay for. In opposition's world, they have"
3379.28,3386.3," to buy literally every single thing that is the aggregate of the upfront cost. However, let's assume that addiction"
3386.3,3390.48, exists in our world and is such a prevalent issue like opposition makes it out to be.
3390.74,3394.44, What I want to note is that addiction becomes far worse on the asset of the house.
3394.82,3399.32," First, individuals who are already addicted, given that is an implementation of the motion,"
3399.32,3407.8, will have to pay upfront costs. But the second thing I want to note is that producers now want to exploit
3407.8,3412.76, individuals who are already addicted because casual gamers will move away from the game
3412.76,3417.24, because they don't want to pay the exorbitantly high upfront costs. This is analysis trying to
3417.24,3421.82," give you that they never responded to. So for example, increasing the prices of games because"
3421.82,3429.74, you know that the most addicted will always buy them is exploitation that happens in their world. No one ever responded to this analysis even though we
3429.74,3434.26, brought it up in second and that is crippling to that case. The second clash then is on broad
3434.26,3439.64, economic harms but before that I'll take that POI. Don't you think you're likely to spend more money
3439.64,3444.7, in your world and even worse you don't know you're spending more money? I've already given the analysis
3444.7,3448.66, as to why you have the choice of how much money you want to spend in our world versus having
3448.66,3453.74, to pay the entire upfront cost of every upgrade in the game second thing then on broader economic
3453.74,3458.6, and social harms look no response to chandigal's third argument on women and the reduction in
3458.6,3464.4, sexism within games i want to note that that still stands however two reasons as to why the
3464.4,3466.3, gaming development and world is harmed.
3466.58,3471.66," First, less people can play free-to-play games because they can't afford the exorbitant upfront"
3471.66,3475.96," costs, but they can afford to play a sizable portion of the game or pay for some upgrades."
3476.02,3478.62, So less people participate in free-to-play games.
3478.62,3483.0," But second is if companies try to make it affordable, they have to cut down on quality"
3483.0,3486.24, and people don't want to play extremely bad games.
3486.44,3494.76," It's the same reason why I'm okay with playing Fortnite because I can play a sizable version of the game as opposed to like Subway, which is completely costless and a pretty bad game."
3495.04,3499.54, I would note then that all our argumentation on how you heard esports development comes into play.
3499.76,3507.5," First, small developers who can't rely on the existing popularity free-to-play games have."
3507.5,3511.46, I would note then that our argumentation on how big companies like Epic Games
3511.46,3515.3, unemployed people to make up the loss in consumers also exists.
3515.58,3519.58," For all these reasons, given that they haven't responded to our macroeconomic harms"
3519.58,3521.42," and our social harms, of course."
3522.4,3526.06, Thank you for that speech. We now welcome the opposition to apply speaker.
3547.84,3552.9, Can I be heard?
3557.9,3558.54, So I'm going to start this reply by analyzing different paths to victory for the opposition in this debate.
3559.32,3561.5," But first, I'll look at the propositions paths to victory."
3562.0,3565.44, The proposition mainly in this debate has one part to victory
3565.44,3569.52, to prove that the rate of addiction or possibility of addiction is extremely high
3570.16,3576.32, and therefore this means the threshold for a ban we on opposition strategically proved that we have
3576.32,3582.0, multiple parts to victory we can either prove that the rate of addiction or the threshold of addiction
3582.0,3586.58, isn't such that it meets the quantity required for a ban.
3587.14,3593.1," Two, we can prove that this creates other active harms to industries and people that far outweigh"
3593.1,3598.7," any harm of addiction, even if it does accrue. And three, we can prove that we on our side are"
3598.7,3603.86, the only side that can actively make the gaming industry better by proving the importance of
3603.86,3608.62," free-to-play games. And I'm going to go through those one by one. So firstly, in terms of dealing with this idea"
3608.62,3614.22, of addiction and why it doesn't meet the threshold for banning. The main way in which we analyze
3614.22,3619.16, whether or not something meets a threshold for a ban is by looking at other instances and comparing
3619.16,3625.5, it to other products. Here's where our intuition pumps and our comparison to things like Netflix and free
3625.5,3627.64, testing comes into play.
3627.64,3631.62, Because it was there that we proved that their principle is not a consistent one.
3631.62,3635.24," And even if it is consistent, isn't enough to apply to this instance."
3635.24,3640.12, Because simply because something produces a dopamine rush isn't enough to prove that
3640.12,3644.86, it is a level of addiction worthy of being able to restrict people from accessing that
3644.86,3645.92, kind of game
3645.92,3652.32, at all for this reason on even if you are able to prove that there is some degree of addiction
3652.32,3656.88, that addiction isn't up to the threshold where we're able to say that the state is justified
3656.88,3661.6, in intervening so it's one path to victory that takes out the propositions part of victory i
3661.6,3668.2, understand why that might not be sufficient that might not be enough even if sufficient to neutralize this debate to give it to the opposition. So here's
3668.2,3673.24, the other parts to victory that win it for us. The first is that we flipped their argumentation
3673.24,3676.96, and addiction and proved why these companies become more exploitative on their side.
3677.3,3682.16," Exploitative advertising, easily manipulating people who do things extreme and review."
3682.58,3688.88, The fact that reviews are insufficient all show that on their side of the house you have less information about this and thus make less of an
3688.88,3694.8, informed choice and therefore it is more unjust to ban than not to ban and who makes analysis using
3694.8,3699.6, the analysis we get early on stakeholders is important here because the biggest harm then
3699.6,3704.8, is that you lock out people who are poor from being able to play these games at all and restrict
3704.8,3705.36, them from any sort of happiness that these games at all and restrict them from
3705.36,3709.88, any sort of happiness that these games could provide them which is a unique harm for people
3709.88,3714.94, who buy some of the upgrades we've proven that on their side they have to pay a much higher cost
3714.94,3721.22, and for these people it is simply not worth it all of this then proves that the people who you
3721.22,3729.12, care about in this debate people who play these games but their analysis of caring for these addicted people have it much much worse off because either they have to pay up
3729.12,3734.4, front or these companies increase prices proving that things get worse off but extraneous to
3734.4,3738.64, editing on addiction we have unique paths to victory that have been this for us first in
3738.64,3743.6, terms of why their side of the house makes it much worse for women gamers or women in the industry
3743.6,3749.56, generally because of chanidu's analysis of how to shrink the consumer base to a point where you just keep relying on
3749.56,3754.08, previous consumer bases that are entirely male a unique part of victory that realizes that stands
3754.08,3759.32, in this debate completely unresponded to that we can use to win secondly the fact that the gaming
3759.32,3764.04, world is worse off because these companies now have a less substantial form of income because
3764.04,3770.2, of my analysis in first that was still unresponded to as to why the pain to play model isn't as profitable and as
3770.2,3774.92, a result you are more likely to either cut down on quality or lay people off both of which are worse
3774.92,3779.68, thirdly the fact that you heard esports development and shun this growing industry
3779.68,3785.04, that is giving rise to incomes for a large number of people and ruining their lives.
3785.04,3787.32, We think all of these paths to victory prove
3787.32,3790.66," that maybe even if we have to buy some degree of addiction,"
3790.66,3793.06, that addiction is not worth the huge cost
3793.06,3794.42, that comes to all these people
3794.42,3797.46," that have their livelihoods dependent on this industry,"
3797.46,3800.36, that they take away on-site proposition.
3800.36,3801.8," For all of these reasons,"
3801.8,3806.98, free-to-play games have to save for my sanctity and for the sanctity of the gaming world entirely.
3808.26,3811.92," Thank you for that speech. And to close the debate, we welcome the proposition to apply speaker."
3818.48,3821.42," All right, just to confirm, audibility, visibility."
3823.28,3836.64," Great, let me set up this timer cool starting in three two one panel when i began my speech from the first and from the get-go i"
3836.64,3842.56, gave you the most important clash the clash was whether a progressive cost on playing games
3842.56,3846.06, versus an initial cost or even like literally no
3846.06,3851.24, charge at all for a particular game would either be justified or would either have a
3851.24,3857.56," lot of harms, right? Then I think those two strains came down to the idea of sort of having"
3857.56,3861.52, two actors here. Those are the consumers and these small developers that later came into
3861.52,3868.48," the debate where we're talking about accessibility versus addiction, that we have profit and longevity, right? Those all play into the"
3868.48,3872.64, goals of these industries. What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you exactly what
3872.64,3878.02," proposition case looks like and how, even if we use just the first speech and the material"
3878.02,3883.12," you gave from the first two substantive speeches, it is enough to rebuttal the whole of Upbench,"
3883.12,3885.14," right? Firstly, when we come to tell you we"
3885.14,3889.58, heavily analyze why there's a necessity to actually ban these games right we give you
3889.58,3894.58, three very important points firstly we tell you other alternatives do exist and that is the model
3894.58,3899.46, right either you don't pay anything for a game and you can still play these games right or secondly
3899.46,3904.58, if the game is of higher quality or something that is trending and essentially requires you
3904.58,3909.6, to pay an upfront cost you can pay the upfront cost right then the clash points came in here when they
3909.6,3914.72, started talking about the fact that if you start paying an upfront cost is essentially going to be
3914.72,3919.36, so much more expensive you're not going to have accessibility and suddenly a very ridiculous
3919.36,3929.56," analysis of the idea of you know desexualization that actually comes with a free-to-play. Let me point out firstly, the idea of having a free-to-play game in of itself, from the"
3929.56,3933.48," name itself, is clickbait because it's not supposed to be free-to-play."
3933.6,3937.26," It's free-to-play to a certain level or for some, you know, for some users."
3937.26,3940.06," Because at one point, you do have in-app purchases."
3940.44,3944.68, You do have to upgrade to a certain degree in order to become competitive and actually
3944.68,3950.22, start earning off the game right but even secondly here we already talked to you about the idea of
3950.22,3956.56, equalization if you have costless games then their their analysis on accessibility and representation
3956.56,3960.76, is literally thrown out of the debate because essentially you're not paying any cost and you
3960.76,3968.96, can still access these games right but even if we take their best case which we did from the second speech right we told you even if you have an upfront cost why essentially
3968.96,3974.16, was that important michelle talks to you about the idea that comparative of a progressive cost
3974.16,3979.36, versus the initial cost and also links that to my speech where i talk to you about the rationality
3979.36,3984.0, of these consumers which brings me to the second point where we're talking about these consumers
3984.0,3985.94, being able to make the right decision.
3985.94,3991.12, I need to remind the panel that from the first speech I gave you a discrepancy that there
3991.12,3994.06, is absolute choice and then there is relative choice.
3994.06,3999.22," When you have the free to play games, you essentially just have relative choice."
3999.22,4003.84," That means you do coerce in somewhat way, even through playing three levels or having"
4003.84,4005.8," in-app purchases or play to win or whatever kind, you are coercing in somewhat way even through playing three levels or having in-app purchases or play to play"
4005.8,4011.58, to win or whatever kind you are coercing these users what we tell you on our side is when you
4011.58,4016.44, have this absolute choice even if you have very limited information we think we buy the bullet
4016.44,4022.34, and say that it's fine but at least you know that you're not you're not necessarily addicted to this
4022.34,4025.42, game and you're still able to decide whether or not you
4025.42,4030.74, want to play right which essentially then points out the inconsistency and logical flow in their
4030.74,4035.7, case they can't tell you that at a point where you have costless games or you have to pay up front
4035.7,4042.26, essentially then you hurt small developers panel if people are not able to pay or are not able to
4042.26,4045.64, pay uh the free to play games right when you reach level three and you're
4045.64,4050.34, supposed to make an in-app purchase and you're unable to do that then that is the same metric
4050.34,4056.56, that will apply if you can't pay for the upfront games right so there's no no correlation on the
4056.56,4061.52, idea of inaccessibility because at the end on both sides of the house you do need to spend money
4061.52,4068.3," the clash becomes whether you spend it initially or progressively. And we already point out to you the harms of actually paying it progressively, right?"
4068.48,4074.54," But then even later on, we give you a very huge distinction on the idea of having demos"
4074.54,4076.54," on that sizable portion of the game, right?"
4076.72,4081.08," We already tell you that at the end of the day, from our side, it is so much logical"
4081.08,4086.0," to either have it cost less or have that initial payment, because at the end of the day,"
4086.0,4087.72, those benefit both the consumers
4087.72,4090.72," and ensure absolute profit to these small developers,"
4090.72,4093.56, something that on the comparative does not even compare.
4093.56,4094.4, Thank you.
4095.3,4096.6, Thank you so much for that speech.
4096.6,4098.44, Thanks everyone for the debate.
