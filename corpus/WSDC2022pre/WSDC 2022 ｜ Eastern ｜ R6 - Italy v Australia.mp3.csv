0.0,7.58," Try. Amazing. So we're recording. Amazing. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask them now."
8.98,28.0," And if not, I call upon the Hon in 321 panel during this debate."
28.0,37.0," We must focus on 2 different concepts of election, the positive political fiction and the negative political fiction as positive political fiction."
37.0,46.92, We mean those with a moral at the end. So this means that political positive fictions show trust in the future as it can be changed and there is still a redemption.
46.92,54.18," For example, in Fahrenheit 451, there is a big teaching that books are fundamental as well as culture."
54.76,61.9," On the other side, negative political fiction pessimism is widespread."
62.42,65.64," In those fictions, there is no hope in the future because the reality"
65.64,72.48, is shaped by the humans and humans cannot change for example in 1984 there was no way to escape
72.48,80.52, from the regime therefore the only solution was to be submitted something to it during this debate
80.52,86.3, our team believes that both positive and negative political fictions are important and
86.3,92.72, necessary for the spectator and for the reader but they are not equally important personally we
92.72,97.88, recognize in fact that good in both categories of categories of fiction in positive political
97.88,107.76," fiction we find the representation of teaching spreading trust in future and hope. We see the spread of an eager to strive for change,"
107.76,109.68," to work and fight for something,"
109.68,111.9, and to rely on institutions.
111.9,113.3, While the positive aspects
113.3,115.86, on the so-called negative political fiction.
115.86,116.7, Point of information.
116.7,118.82," Representation of, one second, please,"
118.82,121.18," representation of injustices, inequalities,"
121.18,123.5," of problems of the real world,"
123.5,127.5, of helping and stimulate critical thinking and it
127.5,131.7, leaves a clear memory in the spectator about something negative that could happen in the
131.7,138.54, future and that has to be solved I'll take the pui do you think more people attend protests
138.54,147.0, out of pure happiness or anger about um do people attend protests due to happiness or anger?
147.0,155.0," Oh, protest is by definition something negative to protest against something."
155.0,162.0, And otherwise there would be simply a manifestation of political thinking.
162.0,167.24, But we're not talking about this now. So I told you that we recognize
167.24,173.38," good in both categories of fiction, but at the same time, both categories of fiction have shown"
173.38,179.16," their limits that need to be overcome. As an example, positive political fiction may be"
179.16,186.74," interpreted as a false reality in which everything ends well, in American superheroes and an illusion of or an"
186.74,191.96, illusion of living in a world without national issues. On the other side negative political
191.96,199.44, fictions might lead to distrust in political institutions to fascisms to an extremization
199.44,206.04, of reality or might bring to fear that the world in which a fear of the world in which we live in.
206.34,211.44, Those limits can be actually overcome by juxtaposing the two one another.
211.9,216.98, It is so needed that the two categories exist and are largely distributed to the public.
217.3,220.58," But however, they must not be distributed equally."
221.06,221.32, Why?
221.88,226.24, Because we believe that it should prevail a positive and truthful vision of the
226.24,233.3, reality and not that disorder and untruthful vision of reality. To exemplify what I have just
233.3,238.76," argued, I would like to compare medieval times and the renaissance. During medieval times,"
238.76,244.44," a negative, pessimistic, fearful vision of the world prevailed. People were afraid of death,"
244.64,246.12," of God, of his judgment"
246.12,251.64, and they did not have hope to achieve their goals in life but only to satisfy God's requirements to
251.64,257.22, reach heaven we believe that if a negative political fiction were to prevail the common
257.22,262.92, mindset would have would be that of a pacifism in action leading people not to strive for what
262.92,265.94," they believe in by comparison on the other side,"
265.94,271.58," during the Renaissance, so a positive time, this fear was overcome, allowing people to"
271.58,276.14," have confidence in themselves, to trust their rulers, to act for their beliefs."
276.14,282.8, Think about the inheritance of these two years. Medieval times are remembered as dark and
282.8,286.32," horrible ages. Whistle,naissance evokes a luminous"
286.32,293.28, serenity and gives us hopes in humanity we prefer our word actually as in political fiction in which
294.4,301.2, no thank you in which political uh optimism uh prevails for what we believe that is optimism
301.2,308.56," that we thrive positive political fiction in, must prevail over the negative fiction to keep"
308.56,312.84, trusting in the future and to keep people stimulated to work for it.
312.84,316.24, And this is my first argument.
316.24,322.3, Negative political fiction are filled with stereotypes and extreme examples of society.
322.3,327.92," As an example, we find in 1984 complete media control forced speech"
327.92,335.48, Catastrophes unreal uh political mechanisms and because of this readers and spectators start to
335.48,346.36, recognize no thank you those extreme examples in life even when they are not actually present. This means having the feeling to live in a simulation
346.36,353.02, or in a negative political fiction in which all institutions are evil and are egoistic.
353.02,359.56," As an example, I'd like to bring you one of the War of the Worlds in the 1930s,"
359.56,365.0," a radio transmission by the Columbia Broadcasting System,"
365.92,369.2," so in the region of Columbia in the United States,"
369.2,373.32," in which fiction, political fiction,"
373.32,378.32, that regarded also an invasion of Earth by aliens
378.52,382.02, was set up and distributed to people.
382.02,384.92," Due to this negative, actually, this topic,"
388.34,397.64," fiction that talked about, as I said, an invasion of aliens in the region of Colombia that was shown as a news broadcasting"
397.64,428.16," television moment, we saw that people actually had reactions in their own lives. People started to panic, people started to have fear to leave their homes, people started to view in another way the reality. hours in which we live in but actually still media and still fiction both we can watch and both we"
428.16,435.0, can read have a huge impact on our lives that we have to consider so as by definition negative
435.0,441.24, political fiction don't find a solution to reality because it is too flawed to be saved if readers
441.24,467.56," bring those thoughts into everyday life the direct consequence would be a lack of interest in changing the mistakes in our community life, because this is what those books and those films told them to do. positive view of institutions of policies of politicians to soak their stories and for members"
467.56,475.72, of institutions by doing this they also brings a positive representation of the ending of an
475.72,486.24, unsolved issues so the motivation for people to fight for a problem to fight for a certain battle to strive for something and this
486.24,491.64, is what we believe in that positive political fiction must prevail because they stimulate to
491.64,499.2, work to fight to strive for something and not only and not mainly have a negative representation of
499.2,508.0, reality they have a good one they motivated people and they must prevail over the negative for people to actually
508.0,513.92, have a triple and a good representation of reality this is the end of my speech
513.92,515.2, so thank you for the attention
521.68,524.96, i thank the prime minister for their fine speech uh could the
524.96,529.24, rest of the panel please signal if they're ready?
529.24,532.88," Amazing, thank you."
532.88,537.66," So if everyone's ready, I call upon the Leader of Opposition to bring in a speech that doesn't"
537.66,538.66, exceed eight minutes.
538.66,582.08," Hear, hear. you Hi, welcome."
582.08,598.04, Yes you are.
598.04,601.94," Opposition throws a false strand of hope into the wind, ready to be crushed by the iron-fist"
601.94,602.94, reality.
602.94,604.44, Optimism breeds apathy.
604.44,605.52, Pessimism creates action.
605.88,607.7, Because the reality of our world right now
607.7,610.18," is that abortion is being denied in the United States,"
610.44,611.92," democracies continue to backslide,"
612.2,613.44," and governments continue to fail,"
613.72,615.38, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
615.56,617.56," That is the reality that this opposition must confront,"
617.82,619.56," and that's why we stand for more,"
619.88,621.4," for not optimistic texts,"
621.5,622.82, and instead we stand for the pessimism.
623.12,624.34, So what do we stand for in this debate?
624.56,627.0," We can still have optimism, but in political texts,"
627.2,629.64," because political texts specifically, we think this is helpful"
629.64,631.64, for the reasons that we're going to outline in this speech.
631.64,634.36," But broadly, what do we think of the features of optimistic texts?"
634.52,635.2, There are two.
635.2,638.44," Firstly, we say that they have political problems where they exist,"
638.52,642.0," have easy and fast solutions, as we can see in TV shows like The West Wing."
642.12,644.2, And the second feature is that we think that governments
644.2,648.0," and political institutions can broadly be relied on, trusted to fix those problems."
648.24,650.88," By contrast, pessimistic texts are the opposite of that."
651.08,653.72," We think that in those worlds, those are the ones that we stand for."
653.88,655.92, So two questions I'm going to answer in this bit.
655.92,657.4," But first, let's do a bit of rebuttal."
657.4,658.32, They have two key claims.
658.32,661.16, Their first line of attack is to say that people become fundamentally
661.16,662.68, distrustful of governments.
662.68,663.84, There are two responses here.
663.84,667.32, The first thing to say that we don't think it makes you inherently distrustful. It means that
667.32,670.6," you're more likely to hold those people to account, and that is something that is necessarily"
670.6,674.72," beneficial. It means that when you see something go wrong, you're more likely to take action against"
674.72,678.26, it because you don't see that as a one-off scenario. You see it as a broader problem that
678.26,682.32," needs to be fixed, and that is what we get under our side. But the second thing to say here is that"
682.32,687.96," even if it does make you distrustful, it's unclear why that's a huge harm in this debate, but we would rather urge on the side"
687.96,691.92, of caution because the harms of not being cautious are enormous. That is totalitarian
691.92,696.02, states. That is letting people get off with things that they shouldn't. And that is necessarily a
696.02,699.98, harm that this opposition must face that they have not engaged with. The second line of attack that
699.98,704.4," they say is that people feel hopeless. Again, two responses. Firstly, no, we say this actually"
704.4,708.26," strengthens your will to fight to the point where you can recognize how big those problems are,"
708.46,712.4," because you can't rely on other people to fix them, can't rely on the institution to do everything"
712.4,716.2, for you. You have to do that yourself. That necessarily means you're more likely to fight
716.2,720.72, harder. The second thing to say that if you're actually more likely to feel hopeless under this
720.72,724.64," opposition, if you think that's a bad thing, for the reason that you think that everything is okay,"
724.92,727.86, but when you are confronted with morality morality that hope is crushed and it is
727.86,732.68, even worse so with that in mind two questions i'm going to answer in this speech first how does it
732.68,737.28, affect the perception of politics and second how does it affect readers suffering firstly how does
737.28,741.94, it affect the perception of politics because recognize that opposition texts encourage people
741.94,747.66," to look through the world through rose-tinted glasses rather than confront the world that actually exists, which is one that is often bad?"
747.88,751.94, Note that clearly there are immense problems with politics this opposition does not recognize.
752.18,752.8, That is polarization.
753.28,753.88, That is corruption.
754.2,758.22," That is misinformation, which currently happens and means that democracies continue to fail."
758.42,760.42," With that in mind, we think there are three parts to this argument."
760.74,765.24," Firstly, optimistic and political fiction sabotages true structural change that can"
765.24,769.22," happen under our side. Firstly, because it denies many of the problems that exist in the first place,"
769.44,773.08," which means that in political TV shows, often they don't talk about corruption existing,"
773.36,777.08," even though that is something that we should know about, even though that's something that happens"
777.08,781.66," right now. But secondly, where these problems do exist, many of these texts assume that they can"
781.66,787.3," be fixed without change. That's in the same way as in the West Wing, they can solve the conflict in the Middle East in three episodes,"
787.58,790.16," even though in real life, it has not even fully finished"
790.16,793.08, and it's continued to go on for decades and hurt more and more people.
793.32,795.48, That is the sort of thing that happens in optimistic texts
795.48,796.78, that prevents real change.
797.0,798.98," People going out, they're actually making a difference"
798.98,800.82," because they realize that problems are continuing,"
801.12,801.8, they need to be solved.
802.04,804.62," The second part of this argument is to understand that by comparison,"
808.42,812.36, pessimistic fiction encourages structural change because it warns people what could happen and tells people about the reality that happens right now. There are three reasons
812.36,816.02," why this is true. Firstly, because people feel obligated to make this change because they"
816.02,819.68, recognize the magnitude of the problem. They can't say that other people are going to do it for them.
819.96,823.98, Every vote matters. Everything that you do matters. And that is necessarily why we get more change
823.98,825.86, when the problem is perceived to be bigger.
825.86,831.18," But secondly, we say that you can see, you can understand on our side that the system cannot fix itself."
831.5,836.08, You cannot rely on politicians to hold each other to account. You cannot rely on having blind faith.
836.18,840.3," And instead, you have to do things yourself and make change from the ground up through the grassroots."
840.66,848.7," But the third thing to say that we feel that you feel more attached to the suffering in those pessimistic texts, and that's simply for the reason that it plays upon our own empathy,"
849.0,852.72, which means that you're more attached emotionally to these characters who have gone through that
852.72,856.32," suffering, which means that you're more likely to take action. The final part of this argument"
856.32,861.06," is why do we think that our change on the outside is likely to be far more sustainable? Firstly,"
861.28,868.72," because we say that under a proposition, the realization of the magnitude of the problem does not exist. They can say that it doesn't really happen. They can say, and they can"
868.72,872.88, ignore the real problems that happen in our world. And we think that's actually far worse. But
872.88,877.58," secondly, because our side is far more sustainable, because you can see role models from those texts"
877.58,881.14, continue to fight the problem. And that is something that you're likely to follow if you're
881.14,888.74, someone who believes in those texts. The final thing to say is that it grants the ability to use many symbols from these pessimistic texts that mean you are able to use
888.74,892.54, them to shorthand for many of the problematic things that exist in our world. That is in the
892.54,897.36, way that people use Big Brother as a shorthand for government overreach from 1984. That's when
897.36,901.48," people can point out the fact that problems do exist, and they can see that through the texts"
901.48,905.4," that exist right now, and people can look at that. Why is that so important in this debate?"
905.6,908.72," Because we think that what that looks like is that under our side, we can trigger real"
908.72,909.42, action occurring.
909.68,912.7, That means that people finally turn up to the ballot box because they don't think the
912.7,913.86, system will fix itself.
914.02,917.28, That means that people turn up to protest because they realize the magnitude of the
917.28,920.22, rights that are being denied to women and people all across the world.
920.22,929.18," It means that when you see a corrupt politician, you don't see it as a one-off problem. You see it as a problem that must be fixed by the institution, cannot get rid of that"
929.18,933.34," one politician and say that the day is over. You have to continue fighting for real change,"
933.4,936.68," and that's what we get under our side. I'm going to move on to my second argument now,"
936.8,943.8," but before that, I'm happy to take a point. No, I'll continue with my second argument."
943.8,945.92, How does this affect religious suffering? Because
945.92,950.14," given the reality the problems that do exist, that is we pointed out in the first argument,"
950.14,954.28," we say that it's important for opposition to deny and patronize those sufferings, tell"
954.28,957.82," them that their problems can be easily solved, when in reality they can't. There are three"
957.82,962.62, parts to this argument. The first is to recognize that many people in these political systems
962.62,968.88, are treated incredibly unfairly and there's no remorse for them in the status quo that is in turkey three quarters of the world's journalists
968.88,974.32, are in prison but second that abortion is being taken away in places like the us and women's
974.32,978.56, rights are being constantly stripped back that is the reality that exists right now and this is what
978.56,982.64, opposition has to confront and look at that through rose-tinted glasses even though that is
982.64,988.46, something that's incredibly important but the second part of this is to say that people who read these texts and are told optimistically
988.46,993.7," that they are solved easily, incredibly suffer under that side for the reason that they're"
993.7,996.3," told that it can be solved easily when in reality, they can't."
996.46,1001.2, It means that people are told that it's their fault that they haven't fixed these problems
1001.2,1003.78," yet, and they're therefore not doing enough to help themselves."
1004.0,1011.1," That is incredibly patronizing, but more so it is harmful to the mental health of those people who are told that it is their fault that they haven't found a solution yet."
1011.24,1014.6, The final part of this argument is to recognize why you must weigh this story heavily.
1014.88,1017.5," But before that, I'll give this opposition one last chance to take a point."
1020.2,1021.06, No? Okay.
1021.24,1022.64, On to the final part of this argument.
1023.04,1048.92," Recognize why this is so important, because we say that any of opposition's material which they might try and claim about happiness from this fiction is unlikely to be particularly unique, because you can still read optimistic text from non-political text, but instead just pure fiction like sci-fi, whereas under our side, the specific harm that occurs to people from their experiences of suffering are incredibly important. That is, a woman being told that they haven't done enough to continue fighting for their rights"
1048.92,1053.18," when something can be solved in one episode of TV. That is incredibly harmful to them,"
1053.36,1056.92," and that is something that this opposition has to recognize. To the extent that they do not,"
1056.92,1061.14," that is not only a specific harm, which only comes from these pessimistic texts,"
1061.42,1067.06," sorry, from these optimistic texts, but also we think that any of the benefits they try and claim on terms of optimistic texts,"
1067.06,1069.18," in terms of making people feel happy,"
1069.18,1071.28, clearly are not exclusive to this debate.
1071.28,1073.52," At the end of this speech, what do you know?"
1073.52,1076.24," At the end of this speech, optimism breeds apathy."
1076.24,1078.82, It is only under outside where you get real change
1078.82,1080.12," from the people who are suffering,"
1080.12,1081.46, the people who realize the problems
1081.46,1083.02, and the magnitude of them
1083.02,1084.78, that actually causes them to take action.
1084.78,1086.72, And that's what happens under outside project close
1094.16,1097.92, i thank the leader of opposition for their fine speech is the panel ready
1099.36,1105.84, can we proceed amazing thank you uh i swear everyone's ready i call upon the deputy prime minister to present the
1105.84,1116.16, speech not exceeding eight minutes here here okay can you hear me i'll start in three two one your
1116.16,1121.52, partner there are actually two main uh points that we have to analyze before entering my constructive
1121.52,1130.46," to show you that actually the opposition team is lacking today under our analysis of the motion. Indeed, when we are talking about pessimistic politics fiction,"
1130.8,1136.44," we're actually talking about series TVs, movies, books, and that actually have to spread a message"
1136.44,1141.56," in which there's a problem, an issue to fight. But on the other side, actually, we cannot only"
1141.56,1145.92, report the problem without taking consideration and actually not in all the
1145.92,1152.0, parts of the world the possibility to produce and to report and to spread also to publish a
1152.0,1157.2, political fiction that actually is negative would help also population in those countries
1157.84,1162.96, indeed we have to take into consideration that actually uh when we don't we are talking about
1162.96,1166.32," for example a negative political politics fictions, we"
1166.32,1169.72, have to take into consideration that maybe people would be less encouraged to challenge
1169.72,1175.32," issues, and also the writers or the publishers would have less opportunities to report problems"
1175.32,1177.78, into the worldwide audience.
1177.78,1182.12," I think that's actually very important to analyze on the other side of the question,"
1182.12,1190.24, the example brought by the first speaker of opposition when he was talking about 1984. indeed we have to take into consideration that actually george orwell
1190.24,1196.4, was an english writer that was criticizing through a negative a negative point of view
1196.96,1202.88, the uh the russian uh political government policy government that was actually something different
1202.88,1210.98," to report and to criticize for example a problem a political issue that is written by, for example, a writer inside its own"
1210.98,1216.02," countries. For this reason, we think that it's actually very important to prevail and to have"
1216.02,1225.2, more political good fictions because they actually would have the opportunity to report in a different way the possibility all the issues
1225.2,1231.76, inside a country without being without being uh opposed by the censored chancellorship for example
1231.76,1236.8, let's take another important and relevant example about for example the chinese uh government
1236.8,1242.16, actually the chinese fantasy books sometimes which are hidden beneath something that actually
1242.16,1249.12, describes a word in which there are politicians that tries to make something different and they have different laws rules and citizens
1249.12,1253.92, are sometimes struggling but at the same time the opportunity and the resilience to face the
1253.92,1260.0, problems without uh openly criticizing them to the fact that when we are talking about negative
1260.0,1266.08, politics fictions usually we are trying to make something that actually is very uh clearly to
1266.64,1272.96, to describe the fact that actually for example the politics the politicians the the buildings
1272.96,1278.4, in which politics exercise actually are demonized and are described as the worst part of the world
1278.4,1285.4," in which where the problems uh are created and spreads uh for this reason, we think that actually"
1285.4,1288.16, fictions are still increasing their popularity
1288.16,1289.86, among the audience all over the world
1289.86,1291.98, due to the fact that they are very silly
1291.98,1294.32, which makes them as likely as possible
1294.32,1295.4, to happen in reality.
1296.32,1299.68, Both books and movies are made by scriptwriters
1299.68,1301.66, who have the main purpose to attack only
1301.66,1303.86," through the exaggeration, no thank you,"
1304.1,1306.4, of characters in events to exploit their outrage and only through the exaggeration no thank you of characters in events and to exploit
1306.4,1311.04, their outrage and only towards the characters themselves but also the role that the characters
1311.04,1316.48, covers the proposition team believes that more negative political fiction than positive would be
1316.48,1321.2, an issue for our society because the negative political fiction may not be based on reliable
1321.2,1325.92, and true effects and their purpose may not be to inform people who watch them
1325.92,1330.48, but to exploit their inner instincts and representing politicians and diplomats as dark
1330.48,1336.16, mysteries and negative moments indeed negative politician fiction are merely based on these
1336.16,1340.56, two main features which are extremely important to give to them the opportunity to reach as many
1340.56,1346.16, people as possible however we should take into account the bond created between the audience and the plot
1346.16,1347.22, for two main reasons.
1347.4,1349.86, The first one is actually negative politician fictions
1349.86,1351.58, are based on fictional elements
1351.58,1353.72, and events cannot be taken as a right depiction
1353.72,1355.68," of disturbed reality, for example,"
1356.02,1358.24, in which specific crimes and misconducts
1358.24,1359.48, are organized in a plot
1359.48,1361.6, in which casualties and plot twists
1361.6,1366.8, brings to always the worst possible scenario and the second main
1366.8,1372.0, point is that the main purpose is to exploit inner instincts of the audience which are embodied by
1372.0,1377.28, politicians and the third of corrupted and colluded politicians becomes more popular and
1377.28,1382.16, they also would get used to recognize mechanically that a politician will be always like the double
1382.16,1385.44, man for example in dr jackson mr hyde we cannot we
1385.44,1391.68, cannot bring to the table this type of fictional uh fictional representation in which actually
1391.68,1397.28, everything is always bad and there's nothing to do to solve the issue due to the fact that also
1397.28,1402.48, when we are only criticizing without proposing something that actually is positive and has the
1402.48,1409.28, opportunity to construct to build something new actually we only criticizing without without having the opportunity to bring to the table
1409.28,1414.72, something that actually would implement situation inside and outside for example our country which
1414.72,1419.6, actually there's a political issues and for this reason going on to the comparatives and then i
1419.6,1427.62, take the pui if we compare three main actually uh strategic keywords inside the political fiction on our side
1427.62,1432.9, with positive political fiction that actually are preferable for us characters are not for sure
1432.9,1438.36, perfect self-made men but at the same time they will not automatically be recognized as negative
1438.36,1442.44, features like happens on the other side when we're talking about negative political fiction
1442.44,1449.76, to the effect that characters are described as corrupted dark and criminal-like behavior the most of the time and then the second important
1449.76,1454.72, point on the comparities is that actually the political buildings like for example a president
1454.72,1458.96, a presidential palace are considered and represented as the symbol of progress and
1458.96,1466.12," protection of the citizens in our case while on the side, if we prefer to bring to the table and to go forward"
1466.12,1471.76," with this negative view of the question, the political buildings are for example seen as the"
1471.76,1476.92," hell hidden to the people, where the power is exercised without the possibility to know actually"
1476.92,1482.62, what hampers for the people. And then the third main point is that actually politics itself recalls
1482.62,1485.64, the corvette that stands at the basis of democracy for
1485.64,1491.22, example in our side of the house while on the other politics is heavily put under pressure
1491.22,1496.62, by a controversial description that makes it look like the gravitational center of corruption
1496.62,1501.9, criminality and sins it is described like something that takes control over the men and the
1501.9,1507.36," women that try to exercise it so how we talk go with the fight, for example, in our political issues"
1507.52,1511.16," when we are the first one that attacks actually the role, the body"
1511.16,1514.88, which has the opportunity in the issues and also the burden to fight the problem.
1515.16,1519.92, It does not make sense because we are somehow we are condemning politics
1520.28,1522.68, and its role that actually is not perfect.
1522.68,1526.24," But at the same time, we try to as the opposition team is"
1526.24,1533.2, proposing we are trying to uh depict it that depicted it depicts it as the problem and then
1533.2,1539.2, also has the possibility to solve the issues itself but actually it cannot work because it
1539.2,1565.04, would be a controversial for this reason what stands at the basis of this that actually will not have
1565.04,1570.0," the opportunity also to be represented as the men, as the women that would have the"
1570.0,1575.24, opportunity to face the problem and then try to find a solution that would actually implement
1575.24,1578.52, the situation for all the citizens in a country.
1578.52,1586.18," But it would be at the same time, the responsible and the ones that actually would have the burden to solve the"
1586.18,1590.68," situation under a political point of view. And actually, this is a controversial fact"
1590.68,1595.42, that cannot be proposed by the position team due to the fact we are not going to show that
1595.42,1601.48," actually politics is not always bad, but has also very positive views that actually can"
1601.48,1605.04, help us to implement it to make our work better thank you
1618.72,1625.48, I think that Deputy Prime Minister for their fine speech Is the panel ready to proceed?
1627.2,1628.1," Amazing, thank you. So if that's the case,"
1628.1,1630.22, I call upon the deputy leader of opposition
1630.22,1668.64, to present their second speech here. Am I audible and visible?
1670.14,1670.86," Yes, you are."
1671.76,1672.16, Perfect.
1673.2,1675.16," Once again, PYs in the chat, please."
1679.88,1681.58, I'm going to do three things in this speech.
1681.88,1688.08," Firstly, I'm going to prove why these stories are representative of the world as it is and why that is crucial in this debate. Second,"
1688.22,1692.5," I'm going to prove why these stories bring about greater mobilization and change. And then finally,"
1692.6,1695.88, I'm going to bring you a substantive contribution about how we get better and more representative
1695.88,1700.62," art and why that is an alternate path to victory for us. On the first question, are these stories"
1700.62,1706.46," representative of the world? They make two big claims here. Firstly, they say pessimistic stories don't have morals."
1706.76,1709.04, This is empirically and structurally untrue.
1709.36,1711.98," Point to the fact that in order to pursue a certain storyline,"
1712.34,1714.28, these authors often have to take moral stances.
1714.68,1717.46, The thing to note is in what context they pursue these morals.
1717.6,1721.28, That is like being the underdog and being willing to exist in a system
1721.28,1722.28, even though you are different.
1722.28,1728.92, Being willing to create some sort of change even if you don't actually access it. Those are all incredibly important moral stories
1728.92,1733.26," that exist structurally within these stories, and it's just an empirical observation that we can"
1733.26,1739.06," make. They do have takeaways. Second, they say they stereotype and exaggerate. Firstly, we reject"
1739.06,1743.0, this in and of itself. Just because things are uncomfortable doesn't mean they are untrue.
1743.44,1749.68," Recognize the nature of the status quo. That is, when Margaret Atwood writes the Handmaid's Tale, she observes that every"
1749.68,1755.52," single thing that includes in that story is taken from the status quo, right? She made absolutely"
1755.52,1759.76," nothing up in that book about how women were treated, but actively took examples from different"
1759.76,1764.4," regimes and different societies. It is empirically untrue, although uncomfortable, that these stories"
1764.4,1769.54," are representative of what the status quo looks like. Secondly, point to the fact that 1984 is"
1769.54,1773.74," just a representation of what communist society looks like. But secondly, even if it is an"
1773.74,1778.88," exaggeration, that is to pursue a very simple artistic message, which is to say, to exaggerate"
1778.88,1782.54," things to get people invested, to get people reading, to get people watching, to get people"
1782.54,1788.84," to understand how it connects to their life. Obviously, it is difficult for individuals to connect with make-believe"
1788.84,1793.24, characters in a make-believe place. But if you can exaggerate things to a point where they can
1793.24,1796.48," connect with them and it is representative of something they recognize in their own life,"
1796.6,1800.52, that is how you get individuals to buy into these stories. Why is this incredibly important when
1800.52,1808.12," weighing this round? Firstly, because side Italy notes there is an imperative for truth. We would tell you that these are the most truthful stories because they represent the"
1808.12,1812.4," horrors and the uncomfortable truths of the status quo. But secondly, we would tell you there is a"
1812.4,1816.94, benefit in immortalizing these stories. These are individuals who have experienced huge plight in
1816.94,1820.96, different societies under different regimes. It doesn't need to be true that every single woman
1820.96,1824.7, has existed in a society that Margaret Atwood would write about. It just matters that they've
1824.7,1828.32," experienced plunder, they've experienced an unjust world, they deserve to have"
1828.32,1832.4," that experience immortalized through text. Secondly, it's through a platform. That is,"
1832.4,1836.32, there is an accessibility of the story and there is a catharsis for victims who can share what
1836.32,1840.88," they've had happen to them, or they can share what needs to be changed about the world. Which means,"
1840.88,1848.92," regardless of immobilization, regardless of either side can actually prove that we make the world a better place, we win this debate on the fact that we tell the truth,"
1849.12,1852.54," we make individuals informed about the nature of the status quo, and the benefits of that"
1852.54,1857.04," are principally important in and of themselves. Second question then, which side brings about"
1857.04,1863.0," mobilization and change? They make one big claim here, all of their benefits underlie an assertion"
1863.0,1865.04, that these stories encourage hopelessness.
1865.28,1869.6," That is, that the apathy that results from an unwillingness to act and a disinterest in any"
1869.6,1875.38," further action. Why is this untrue? Structurally, we would tell you that apathy stems from comfort."
1876.04,1880.24," That is, you are only apathetic if you are complacent in the world around you. Let's"
1880.24,1886.7," compare them stories. Firstly, note that these optimistic stories always have a positive resolution."
1886.7,1888.96," That means that individuals, when they consume this media,"
1888.96,1890.96, always think that things are going to work out.
1890.96,1892.26, That is how you get comfort.
1892.26,1894.08, That is how you get complacency.
1894.08,1896.56," But second, there is an anger and a frustration"
1896.56,1897.7, in the stories we tell.
1897.7,1899.72, A frustration in the fact that you can recognize
1899.72,1901.64, that this character is experiencing something
1901.64,1903.44," that you experienced and that is unjust,"
1903.44,1904.44, that is illegitimate.
1904.44,1908.92," Why is this incredibly important? Firstly, because it just means that we get less apathy,"
1909.2,1913.7," and we get less hopelessness. But even if some experience hopelessness, why can we still win"
1913.7,1918.72," this debate? Because firstly, it is hopelessness in a specific condition. Simply because you can't"
1918.72,1923.08, solve the problem in its entirety doesn't mean you can't take specific actions to get there.
1923.22,1929.7," That is to say, no social movement is trying to disassemble things like racism or sexism. They're trying to make simple"
1929.7,1933.4, changes in order to change that world. You don't need to have a belief that you can change
1933.4,1937.78, everything. You just have to have a belief that some change is sufficient. That is what underlies
1937.78,1941.74," most of these stories, that individuals can make an impact even though that they are one."
1942.0,1948.34," Let's compare action then. That is, if you assume that you can get change under both sides, and we don't think you can because they are more likely to"
1948.34,1953.48," foster complacency and things like that, why can we still win this round? Firstly, because there"
1953.48,1958.02," is a greater investment in the cause. That is because, firstly, you have a relatable connection"
1958.02,1962.78," to these characters. Their only response is to say that they are bad, they're corrupt. Obviously,"
1962.88,1968.18," there's a mischaracterization. Some characters within these stories are, but they're not the ones you connect to. Those are not the"
1968.18,1972.9," ones who are positioned to fight for and those who you want to do well. Obviously, Big Brother"
1972.9,1976.26," isn't a great actor, but the fact that you read about Winston and you're like, wow, I really want"
1976.26,1980.18," that guy to succeed. In fact, my life is similar to his. I probably experienced some of the fights."
1980.28,1984.32, You are fighting for that guy. He's not bad. He's not corrupt. These characters exist. That's not
1984.32,1985.5, the point.
1985.5,1987.54," Secondly, we get commitment."
1987.54,1991.62, That is important because what exists in these optimistic stories is a narrative which says
1991.62,1995.44," there's a big problem, but there is a very easy solution that is structurally inevitable"
1995.44,1997.6, within these stories because they need to be marketable.
1997.6,1998.6, They need to be accessible.
1998.6,1999.6, They need to be somewhat short.
1999.6,2006.04, It's impossible for a story written by George Orwell to deal with how to take down communism in every way.
2006.32,2009.96," But obviously, they're going to take the easy way out in terms of finding an easy solution."
2010.1,2028.16," This is incredibly important because it means individuals, when they attach themselves to these movements and they get mobilized and do not receive that happy change, happy, easy change, because actually the status quo is one that's far more difficult, they're more likely to opt out of the system because they think it is not as easy as they like others tell them it is so they're less likely to be engaged their only response is to say there's"
2028.16,2032.56, an exploitation because finding solutions isn't that easy that is like literally what we stand
2032.56,2037.6, for under our side optimize uh optimistic stories ultimately trivialize the issues that these people
2037.6,2041.84, face note there the principled harm that exists that's something we called toby that wasn't
2041.84,2053.0," adequately responded to the fact that how it is incredibly dehumanizing if you tell an individual that actually the fact they live in an unjust world is not because of structural like the system that needs to be broken down, but because they haven't taken an easy step."
2053.0,2060.0," We will tell you that easy step is not one always accessible, but it is under our side at the point at which we can mobilize people to make specific changes."
2060.0,2068.88," I'll take a PY if you have one. If not, I'll move on. What is for you the difference, the real difference between positive political fiction and negative political fiction?"
2069.56,2073.32, Positive political fiction is one where the system itself fixes itself.
2073.58,2077.98," That is, all of those stories have an ending without a huge structural change."
2078.3,2083.0, Point to other stories which necessitate individuals from the outside actively coming in and changing that system.
2083.28,2088.76," That is the fact that 1984 Big Brother isn't broken down from within. It needs an external change, point two things like"
2088.76,2094.06, the fall of the Soviet Union that is representative of what that external change looks like.
2094.36,2098.26," Finally, on their claim about CCP censoring, obviously that is outside of the debate,"
2098.26,2102.12, given that neither side can actively change what censored governments are willing to do.
2102.34,2106.0, It is not a fair burden to set on us that we need to like get stories through
2106.0,2108.92, that communist or dictatorial governments
2108.92,2110.14, are likely to benefit.
2110.14,2111.92," What do you know that at the end of this clash,"
2111.92,2113.9," we get people easier mobilized,"
2113.9,2115.62," we get better change, that's enough."
2115.62,2116.94," One point of substantive then,"
2116.94,2118.94," how we get better, more representative art."
2118.94,2121.22, Some of the most effective and important art
2121.22,2123.36, is that which describes the world as it is.
2123.36,2128.84," Why do we get more of this art under our side? Firstly, because there is a norm which says art is valid and art is legitimate,"
2129.28,2134.54," and it can be if it criticizes the status quo and if it tells the story like it is, that there is an"
2134.54,2138.98," audience for this art. Secondly, that artists are more likely to create this fiction because they"
2138.98,2143.0," know this audience exists. But thirdly, that accessibility in terms of distribution is also"
2143.0,2148.68," easier. Why is this important? Firstly, just the simple aesthetic benefit that more people get their stories told, that"
2148.68,2149.22, is a net good.
2149.58,2152.16," Second, the catharsis and connection comes about from this."
2152.22,2156.04, Different communities being able to share their political experience through means such
2156.04,2157.5," as art, which is more accessible to them."
2157.7,2160.58," Thirdly, the commentary and discussion which exists on the establishment itself."
2160.88,2168.0," That is, it is much easier to talk about the White House when you have the connection of art which which like condenses it into a message that is accessible."
2168.0,2172.0, At the end of this round we gave individuals what mattered the truth up to up.
2172.0,2205.38, That was most important. We oppose I think the deputy leader to present their speech.
2213.08,2214.16," Do you hear me? Yes, you're doing. Okay, I'll start my speech in three, two, one."
2220.14,2220.92," By first starting my speech, I would like to express what the other team has misunderstood."
2226.18,2231.28," In my POI, I have shown that the other team that didn't really understand the crucial difference between positive political fiction and negative political fiction. A positive political"
2231.28,2238.36," fiction may report, as they say, a social sexist racist classist problem whilst also solving it,"
2238.36,2245.76, whilst a negative political fiction reports it and tells you that nothing can be done about it that is the crucial difference
2245.76,2252.08, if we have a political positive political fiction it tells you that something can always be done to
2252.08,2257.36, solve problems whilst the negative one will always tell you that you cannot do anything if we think
2257.36,2267.72," about 1984 we see that mr smith wasn't able to um to fight against and to defeat the regime, the big brother,"
2268.04,2273.86, but eventually had to submit to it. The opposition team argued that pessimistic and negative political
2273.86,2279.78," fiction creates action, stimulates a will to change things that is simply not true. They"
2279.78,2290.84," misunderstood the meaning of negative political fiction, because just as political fiction, it shows and reports a problem that afflicts a society politically. The difference between"
2290.84,2294.64," positive and negative is that a positive political fiction has what we call a happy ending,"
2295.12,2300.02, and the characters actually succeed in fighting the problem. It's that negative political fiction
2300.02,2306.6, ends with the impossibility of solving the problem. Not even hope remains. And that hope
2306.6,2313.96," is a crucial, important word. Let us think, as I said, about 1984. At the end, Winston Smith"
2313.96,2319.46," conforms to the regime without being able to fight against it, forgetting even his love for Julia,"
2319.84,2328.88, without being able to fight against it for getting um uh enhanced the story ends in fact with a pessimistic
2328.88,2334.64, negative outcome where people are left disillusioned and without hope how can optin assert
2334.64,2339.76, that these kind of fiction works stimulate action when they actually let us understand how deeply
2339.76,2346.36, corrupted our system may become we see the potential of negative uh of negative political
2346.84,2352.06, fiction and we told that since the beginning we said that it's important to have both of the two
2352.06,2358.72, we see how crucial and how vital negative political fiction is because it tells the problems and it
2358.72,2366.0, tells that not always we win against against problems but we think that we must have a majority
2366.0,2368.24," of positive political fiction,"
2368.24,2370.4," because we believe that only in that way,"
2370.4,2372.8, we will be able to form a society
2372.8,2374.74," in which problems are tackled,"
2374.74,2376.2," and which people have hope,"
2376.2,2379.3, and which people act to do what they believe in.
2379.3,2380.92," Instead, in their world,"
2380.92,2383.94," in which negative political fiction prevails,"
2383.94,2386.08, we have people that are without hope they
2386.08,2392.8, do not know how to respond to problems because they see that in the majority of cases things
2392.8,2398.72, don't go as they should that it is impossible to succeed that the good always fails but that is not
2398.72,2405.92, a message that we want to promote we want to have a society in which people are actually able to change things and
2405.92,2411.6, the other team is telling you the same thing telling that negative political fiction can do
2411.6,2417.2, the same but it actually cannot because negative political fiction shows that nothing can be done
2417.2,2430.3," and they didn't even understand that so how can they win this debate um So another thing that they misunderstood, that they mistaken, is that they"
2430.3,2438.74," say that fiction can be true. They criticized my second speaker, telling that he did not demonstrate"
2438.74,2447.24," that fiction is something that is actually false, but fiction is for itself something that is actually false. But fiction is for itself something that is created by the mind"
2447.24,2452.94," of an author. So we cannot say that fiction is reality. Orwell, of course, inspired himself on"
2452.94,2458.8," reality, but we cannot say that 1984 was actually something that happened because it was a work of"
2458.8,2466.0," art. So what we wanted to say is that, and what we have demonstrated actually is that if we have a message"
2466.0,2473.6, if we have a fiction work we actually are uh even exaggerating some details that may cause in the
2473.6,2478.64, reader uh some ideas that are not actually true that did not actually happen we are not talking
2478.64,2485.7, about documentaries historical documentaries we're talking about fiction and for example many uh many conspiracy
2485.7,2492.18, conspiracy theories were based on the fact that they uh I'll take that in a moment uh were based
2492.18,2498.3, on the fact that exploit books such as 1984 to assert that their institutions were systematically
2498.3,2505.04, lying to them you cannot possibly say that this is not a risk of negative political fiction. You can go.
2510.64,2515.42," Obviously, this is fiction. Fiction can still mimic reality. It can still tell stories that matter. Why isn't that sufficient? No, well, that is sufficient. We think that"
2515.42,2520.96," fiction can tell things that matter. And in fact, we are producing both negative and positive"
2520.96,2528.0, fictions. And we think that a majority of positive fiction is better than a majority of negative fiction.
2528.0,2531.96, But we believe that negative political fiction
2531.96,2534.82, may also have a way of seeing the work
2534.82,2536.32, that is not always true.
2536.32,2537.6," And as I have just said,"
2537.6,2541.64, conspiracy theories used 1984 to say that countries
2541.64,2544.62," lied to them systematically, but that is not always true."
2544.62,2545.92, You cannot say that just
2545.92,2550.48, because you read that in a book that is your mindset and that you see everything that way
2550.48,2556.24, but there is a risk of negative positive negative political fiction but and political fiction that
2556.24,2561.68, is positive or negative can show a problem and uh the difference as i've said many times is that a
2561.68,2568.0," positive uh political fiction shows you how to solve the problem, whereas the other says that you cannot solve the problem."
2568.0,2572.0, So. Why do we win this debate? Why?
2572.0,2576.0, What do we have? We understand that they did not.
2576.0,2585.76," Is that the fact that the the true problem is that the negative political fiction has, of course, some some things that are good for society but it has"
2585.76,2592.3, many limits and to overcome these limits we need to have a majority of positive um political
2592.3,2598.6, fictions because only in this way we can have the both the good things and cover and overcome the
2598.6,2607.96," limits of the two things so we believe that the negative political fiction produced in the society some risks, for example,"
2607.96,2614.26," exaggerate some details, it exerts, extra, extra, extremizes some political views."
2614.26,2620.5," And so it also tells people how to interpret some reality, some situation in the reality"
2620.5,2632.92, and may orient them in a negative way of interpreting them. Whilst a positive political fiction allows you to understand the problem and also to
2632.92,2639.22," have the hope, the will, to strive to change it, to have the force, the strength to do"
2639.22,2640.22, something.
2640.22,2642.74, And that is what misses in the negative political fiction.
2642.74,2645.12, And that is what the other team didn't understand.
2645.12,2648.56," Because if we do not have the hope, how can we change things?"
2648.56,2652.1, You cannot say that a negative political fiction gives you hope.
2652.1,2653.88, It just gives you sadness.
2653.88,2659.6," It tells you that the world cannot be changed, that us humans are actually the worst animal"
2659.6,2662.12, of the world if we think about Orwell's works.
2662.12,2665.76, But we do not have to show only this side of the problem. We
2665.76,2671.2, have to show even the positive side. We have to give hope to people if we want actually to succeed
2671.2,2676.8, in fighting these problems. So we are the team that actually solves the problems because we have
2676.8,2682.64, both the advantages of the positive and negative political fiction and we also overcome the limits.
2682.64,2686.32, The other team is that is only getting the worst part and is only overcome the limits the other thing is that is only uh getting the worst
2686.32,2692.08, part and is only having the negative risks and consequences of a majority of negative political
2692.08,2715.22," fiction thank you I thank the government for their fine speech and if the panel is ready, you can, thank"
2715.22,2717.06, you.
2717.06,2735.78," Then I call upon the opposition whip to deliver their speech. Hear, hear. I'm assuming that everyone can hear me."
2735.78,2737.3," If not, please signal."
2737.3,2753.74," I'll take my POIs in the chat, just for clarity. Starting my speech in three two one optimism breeds apathy and pessimism breeds action"
2753.74,2758.94, there was a reason why women who were protesting the lack of abortion rights throughout the world
2758.94,2766.0, used the habit from gilead as a signal of their oppression. There was a reason why people who were protesting
2766.0,2771.56," the poor treatment of the vast bulk of the American lower classes, while the rich allowed"
2771.56,2776.94," tax exemptions, used the phrase, all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."
2777.2,2783.26, It was because literature and art that reflected upon the problems of the societies that we lived
2783.26,2785.84," in were not only dealing with reality,"
2785.84,2790.4, they were dealing with change and it's on those grounds that we took this debate. I'm going to
2790.4,2795.36," ask three questions in this speech. The first is a question of setup, just clarifying what this"
2795.36,2800.16, debate is about and therefore burdens are on each team. Then I'm going to bring a question of what
2800.16,2804.88," does this world look like, but we've had a lot of pushback from side Italy. And thirdly on the most"
2804.88,2809.6, important clash is about who best fixes social change in regards not only to action but
2809.6,2815.68, who can provide solace to those who need it on the first question about setup we give you from first
2815.68,2821.2, who things which will distinguish an optimistic text from a pessimistic text because optimistic
2821.2,2826.3, texts need you on net be more happy than pessimistic by the very nature of their
2826.3,2832.08, name. This means any problem they point to in the political institutions at the moment must be solved
2832.08,2837.46," within 300 pages or within a season. That is inherent to the nature of them, which means either"
2837.46,2843.26," these institutions solve themselves or people solve them, but it is so easy and quick to do"
2843.26,2845.88, that it is no longer compelling a problem
2845.88,2851.58, noting once more all their analysis about why optimistic heart has morals while pessimistic
2851.58,2856.98, God doesn't why optimistic God has nice characters pessimistic art doesn't clearly does not deal with
2856.98,2862.2, the actual framework in which this debate stands therefore moving on the definition that you must
2862.2,2865.82," use to adjudicate this debate is whether art that is on net,"
2866.16,2872.64," like pointing in an optimistic direction, that proves that political issues can be solved quite easily,"
2872.64,2874.84, is better than those who prove the reality.
2875.38,2878.68," Moving on from there, the question of what this world looks like."
2878.8,2883.42, We've had interesting pushback from Italy about what the actual state of the world is right now.
2883.66,2891.04," They tell us that we are no longer living in medieval times. like okay, but the world is still a pretty bad place. We would say it is"
2891.04,2896.24," nothing but offensive to suggest that the world is okay when the US Supreme Court, apparently the"
2896.24,2901.68," bastion of democracy and equality, just took away women's rights to abort a child even if they're"
2901.68,2910.4," about to die, that they're now considering whether gay people should be able to marry the person they're in love with, when democracy continues to backslide"
2910.4,2915.12," and genocides continue to happen, it is insufficient to say that is not the world"
2915.12,2920.32," we are dealing with. Three points that you have to weigh this debate on. First of all,"
2920.32,2929.16," we think therefore, because we have proven such a big problem in the status quo, that any kind of art that truthfully reflects on this is the art he must prioritise."
2929.16,2933.92," Secondly, even if it is an exaggeration at their best case, we still think that it brings"
2933.92,2934.92, people buy-in.
2934.92,2939.68," So for example, we are not pigs, but the message of animal farm is still important to people."
2939.68,2942.94, You don't have to live in a world in which the government literally has a rag around
2942.94,2949.02," your throat to not think that their overreach is important. And third of all, even if you think the world is perfect, I take"
2949.02,2953.5, these messages as still important. Because if people being slightly skeptical of a government
2953.5,2958.44," that starts to increase their powers, this is a perfect government, it's probably a good thing."
2958.6,2962.52, Because to hold it into the states that we see in these books is something that is not a good thing.
2962.52,2970.16," We never want. At the end of that point, you know know the world is in a pretty bad place and even if it isn't what what's important is stopping"
2970.16,2974.4, it from getting there in the first place now i'm going to prove why we're the only side that
2974.4,2979.36, achieves this the main push we hear from site italy here is to say that negative political
2979.36,2985.84, fiction denies solutions who responses first of all they never made it clear why you need a solution
2985.84,2990.8," in a text to believe that you should do action. For example, as I flagged in my introduction,"
2990.8,2996.08," the symbol of Gilead of the habit, people using that in protest, 1984 making people angry,"
2996.08,3000.48, it doesn't mean that they now think that they shouldn't engage in politics if that's the reason
3000.48,3009.76," they're protesting. I'm going to illustrate this in the way that it actually works in a trade-off because art that shows that problems are massive, that must contend with the"
3009.76,3015.12," fact that perhaps they deal with less solutions because as I flagged, like solving the problems"
3015.12,3020.72, in the Middle East like the West Wing does in like three episodes does not make sense. Those solutions
3020.72,3029.36," are the things that minimize the problem and therefore minimize the will of people to take action. It is on those grounds that even if you do not provide a solution, you have an"
3029.36,3033.84," intention to act. This is the reason why people, if they are in dictatorial states who are being"
3033.84,3038.72," abused by the government, are in a spot where they are most likely to have a revolution to mass"
3038.72,3044.0," mobilize. That is why when people are faced with massive challenges, young people don't think"
3044.0,3046.8," climate change is going to be solved in the next decade,"
3046.8,3048.42, it does not mean they don't act.
3048.42,3050.62, It is providing a compelling reason to act
3050.62,3053.22, that is the way that action actually happens.
3053.22,3056.7," Then therefore, let's deal with how optimistic texts work."
3056.7,3059.8, So Italy claims they breed hope and therefore action.
3059.8,3060.78, Three responses.
3060.78,3064.44," First of all, having hope that you'll be able to solve"
3064.44,3065.7, problems in the Middle East in
3065.7,3070.46, the foreseeable future through one conference is not a good thing if that hope can easily be dashed.
3070.66,3075.24," Having hope that these problems can be solved quite simply rather breeds apathy, because if"
3075.24,3080.44," there is not a problem that seems so grand, almost insurmountable, there is no longer a need or"
3080.44,3085.28, imperative for you to do anything in the first place and thirdly note the way that we must
3085.28,3089.92, bring to quote because obviously if you have more texts that are quite hopeful people have less
3089.92,3095.04, connection to them if they are scary that is to say fear is a pretty big motivator that is the
3095.04,3099.12, reason why italy says that it's like you're in upon people's instinct that is the reason why
3099.76,3103.6, texts always have a challenge in the middle of them because that's what makes them interesting
3103.6,3105.5, that's what make you want to think about that character
3105.5,3107.0, and to empathise with them.
3107.0,3110.0," Therefore, on that basis, what is most important"
3110.0,3114.0, is proving there is an issue and proving that there is such a problem
3114.0,3116.0, as if a need to solve it actually exists.
3116.0,3118.0, I'll take a POI if you have one.
3122.0,3123.0," If not, all good."
3123.0,3127.92," Now, moving on to why we therefore are able, thirdly able to give solace"
3127.92,3131.92," to those who are currently suffering at the moment. What we bring here is firstly, the"
3131.92,3136.3," optimistic art is incredibly patronizing. That is to say, by simplifying solutions,"
3136.48,3140.18," they make it seem like if only there was a conference about the Middle East, it wouldn't"
3140.18,3149.1, have been this bad. If only one woman decided to protest and knock at a parliamentarian's's door that it therefore would have stopped. That is incredibly condescending. What we say rather
3149.1,3153.26," is to reflect on a world which is quite pessimistic, that is quite a good thing. And"
3153.26,3157.36," even if that is a small number of people, providing solace to those number of people,"
3157.58,3162.04, providing catharsis to those who are being screwed over by the system is a pretty important thing in
3162.04,3165.96," the context of this debate. At the end of that clash, what are we likely to see?"
3166.08,3170.36," We think that negative political fiction, although it must deny solutions"
3170.48,3174.04," by aside Italy's definition, is a world which presents a problem"
3174.04,3175.84, that is necessary to be solved.
3175.84,3179.08," It is seeing the problem, seeing it as something that needs to be solved,"
3179.2,3181.64, seeing that this has such an insurmountable imperative
3181.76,3185.92," that doing nothing is not an option, is the way that art makes the world"
3185.92,3190.32, seem like a world in which you must protest and that was the most important metrics on which to
3190.32,3194.72, judge this debate because if more people were showing up to protest because they were scared
3194.72,3198.88, of the government invading their privacy all the time that was a world in which the government
3198.88,3203.44, itself was scared of invading their privacy all the time because a world in which people the women
3203.44,3205.44," of the us are scared of themselves turning into gilead Because a world in which people, the women of the US are scared of themselves"
3205.44,3206.74," turning into Gilead,"
3206.74,3208.36, is a world in which they are more likely
3208.36,3210.38, to vote against the Republican party
3210.38,3213.2, that wants to see a shift to Christian theocracy.
3213.2,3215.88," At the end of this debate, make no mistake,"
3215.88,3218.74," the world is suffering, people are suffering,"
3218.74,3220.4, and change is necessary.
3220.4,3223.48, The only side that gives people enough of an imperative
3223.48,3232.0," to act is a side of pessimistic art that shows them the truth of the world, and a world, even if it is not there quite yet, will devolve into it quite soon."
3232.0,3255.0, It would be on those constructive part of this debate.
3255.0,3266.96," And if the panel is ready, I call up on the opposition reply speaker"
3266.96,3268.94, to conclude the debate for team opposition.
3269.36,3269.62," Hear, hear."
3287.0,3290.0," Am I on? Yes, you are."
3290.0,3310.94," There are two questions in this reply. First, who helps politics more? And second, who is better for"
3310.94,3315.14," the readers who are suffering? First, who helps politics more? And I'm starting with this because"
3315.14,3319.44," it's the clearest way for us to win the debate, because it explains why in a world where politics"
3319.44,3323.7," is imperfect and incredibly problematic, and that is the reality this opposition must face,"
3324.04,3328.46, our side is the only one that is able to deal with their problem because they start this debate with a bit of a red
3328.46,3332.3, herring by saying that politics doesn't have the same problem as we point out but we point out the
3332.3,3336.68, fact that abortion rights are stripped away in the US we point out the fact that many politicians are
3336.68,3341.36, corrupt we point out the fact that many states are pretty close to being totalitarian that is
3341.36,3348.82," a harm that this opposition must face and this notably deals with their key claim on truth, because it explains why our side is actually the one that represents our reality."
3349.06,3353.46," But even if you don't believe that's true, given that the problem exists, our side is the only one"
3353.46,3357.5," that's able to adequately deal with it. Because change is something that is necessary, and we give"
3357.5,3361.72," you three mechanisms on the ways that it works. Firstly, that it recognises the problem's magnitude,"
3361.72,3367.5," that is only when you're able to get people to protest, the ways that people actually act, rather than stand by and allow things"
3367.5,3368.5, to happen.
3368.5,3371.98," Secondly, we explain that readers attach to role models who continue to fight, which is"
3371.98,3374.98, exactly why they will continue to do under our world.
3374.98,3378.5," But thirdly, because we explain that we have the ability to use symbols from these texts,"
3378.5,3382.86," to say things like big brother, point out things that are all well in the status quo,"
3382.86,3385.1, and use that to gather emotions to fight back.
3385.88,3386.1, What is their response?
3388.18,3388.36, Their only response here is to talk about hopelessness.
3389.74,3389.98, We give you four things down the bench.
3391.1,3393.24," The first is that we explain is that this actually creates more impetus to act,"
3393.5,3394.9, not total hopelessness.
3395.16,3396.32," But second, we explain that"
3396.32,3397.96," because protagonists continue to fight,"
3398.28,3399.16, readers will follow that
3399.16,3400.74, because they have that emotional connection.
3401.12,3402.72," But third, we explain that it doesn't mean"
3402.72,3404.04," that there's inherent hopelessness,"
3404.04,3408.0," but it means that you're suspicious of the actions under the status quo, that you're able to take off"
3408.0,3412.76," the rose-tinted glasses and look at the world as it is, the dark modern modernity that often fails"
3412.76,3417.76," us. But finally, we explain that the absence of a solution in a text does not mean that there is no"
3417.76,3422.0," solution at all, which is to say that simply because it does not happen in that specific text"
3422.0,3425.06," doesn't mean that you as an individual can't do anything,"
3426.2,3426.44," that you can't turn up to protest,"
3427.58,3429.46, that you can't choose to vote and make that even a slight bit better
3429.46,3430.84, from the darkness that exists.
3431.22,3433.58," And note, this is clearly what this debate must be weighed on,"
3433.76,3435.08, because this is the highest impact.
3435.36,3436.48, Because it's only under our world
3436.48,3438.52," where we turn that apathy into action,"
3438.72,3441.02, where we get people to turn up to the ballot box
3441.02,3442.74, because they know problems that exist
3442.74,3444.2, and they know what they must do.
3444.2,3448.72," Do not turn a blind eye to the problems in politicians, the problems in politics, and"
3448.72,3450.16, walk away with blind faith.
3450.28,3453.66, To turn up to protests because they know that is the way that they'll be able to garner
3453.66,3457.04, action and be able to create the action that will save ourselves.
3457.46,3462.08, Any benefit we get here is clearly better than all opposition who does literally nothing
3462.08,3463.72, to the people who are suffering right now.
3463.94,3468.48," That is clearly the metric by which this debate must be judged on. Even if we don't sort of solve the problem,"
3468.76,3472.92, clearly it is better than this opposition who has not been able to give a reason why people are
3472.92,3478.22," likely to take specific actions when they can say that the world is already fixing itself,"
3478.46,3481.92, when they can say that the world is something that's going to be fine if you do nothing.
3482.28,3488.64, So the second question in this debate is who is better for Reddit? And this is important because this goes almost entirely unresponded to by this
3488.64,3492.56, opposition. Because we explain all down the bench that the most suffering right now are told
3492.56,3496.44," patronizingly that their problems are easy to solve, that the war in the Middle East can be"
3496.44,3500.5," solved in three episodes of the West Wing, that women, if they tried a bit harder, they could fix"
3500.5,3504.66, the structural problems and discrimination that they face each and every day. That is the exact
3504.66,3508.8, sort of thing that opposition tells the most oppressed right now we told you that from first
3508.8,3513.36, understand the way here because any benefit they want to claim in terms of optimism is clearly
3513.36,3517.68, outweighed by the unique harms that they bring to this special set of people who is now forced
3517.68,3522.56, to relive and suffer over and over under their world without people realizing recognizing the
3522.56,3528.32," suffering that they have had meaning that even if you buy that there is some benefit of optimistic texts, we have pointed out that"
3528.32,3532.24," you can have optimism outside of political texts, which grants that same benefit, but"
3532.24,3535.56, the suffering that this opposition brings is one that is specific and unique.
3535.84,3539.36," At the end of this debate, this opposition throws the false strand of hope into the wind"
3539.36,3541.44, for it to be crushed by the iron fist of reality.
3541.82,3545.96," Optimism breeds apathy, pessimism creates action. That's what we stand for."
3553.14,3554.82, I thank the opposition reply speaker.
3554.82,3555.84," And if everyone's ready,"
3555.84,3558.64, I call upon the proposition reply speaker to conclude.
3560.8,3562.52, Am I audible?
3562.52,3563.7," Yeah, all fine."
3563.7,3564.54, Okay.
3565.12,3572.08," Dear panel, the core issue of this debate stands in the controversial problem to prefer positive political fiction than negative ones."
3572.44,3578.34," It is not a debate about protests, about abortion, about women's rights in America, about genocide, about Middle East."
3578.64,3581.62, That is what the opposition talked for much of their time.
3581.82,3585.8," Talking about things that matter, both sides of the house actually agreed"
3585.8,3588.28, on the fact that political issues actually exist
3588.28,3589.52, and must be challenged.
3589.78,3592.04, But what makes the two sides different
3592.04,3593.68, is the role that both positive
3593.68,3595.58, and negative political fiction have.
3596.06,3598.34," The three main clashes of debates are,"
3598.72,3600.08," the first, the role that negative"
3600.08,3601.72, and the positive fiction have.
3602.1,3603.94," The second, how they work"
3603.94,3605.46, and how they can
3605.46,3611.7, uh report political issues and the third is that how the impacts on the society are which basically
3611.7,3617.46, the audience for which the fiction is made starting so from the first that the first so
3617.46,3621.84, the role that fiction has on our side of the house we have proved to you that the negative
3621.84,3649.36," fictions tend to criticize openly a political issues, but at the same time, they are created in order to exploit the inner sense of the audience who audience a positive message in which politicians, politics and institutions are demonized,"
3649.36,3670.24," not demonized, but depicted as common people, as common things, with their problems to overcome, but also with the strength to face problems for which they have been voted by people. On the other side of the house, on opposition, opposition tells us that negative political fictions have been depicted as the universal solution to all the political and"
3670.24,3676.0," issues social spread within the world, but without taking into consideration that the negative"
3676.0,3680.8, political fictions are less likely to be published and spread in all those countries where the
3680.8,3684.96, problem actually exists. That is caused by the presence of the censorship and excessive
3684.96,3687.66, aggressive attitude that the authors lead towards the
3687.66,3691.7," political system itself, which should be the protagonist which has the burden to improve"
3691.7,3696.8," the environment. This last part leads us to the second main point of flesh in this debate,"
3696.8,3701.98, how the positive and the negative political fictions report the political issues. On our
3701.98,3706.54," side of the house, we firmly believe that by preferring negative fictions"
3706.54,3707.76," over positive ones,"
3707.76,3709.56, we should only make it more difficult
3709.56,3711.9, to report political issues in the status quo.
3711.9,3714.5, The main reason why relies in the way
3714.5,3717.24, in which the two types of fictions approach the problem.
3717.24,3720.64," The positive fiction, this pulls the censorship"
3720.64,3722.16, by presenting alternative words
3722.16,3724.94," in which the problems are presented under a filter,"
3724.94,3729.9, which allows the creator to not criticize directly who causes the issues on the other hand the
3729.9,3734.7, negative political issues and the narrative political fiction tends to make it more difficult
3734.7,3740.28, to shift the problem on another level of narration for example making the censorship more easily to
3740.28,3745.52, criticize and less likely to reach as many people as possible. The last point of flash deals
3745.52,3750.08, with the impacts that these two types of political fiction would have on the audience through which
3750.08,3755.76," it is created. On our side of the house, we have proved to you that positive political fiction"
3755.76,3760.72, would have the advantage to report a problem but at the same time giving to politics to be
3760.72,3770.52," extorted in its best ways and putting under the spotlight the core principles which are its pillars. On the other hand, negative fictions would only focus on the downside effects"
3770.52,3776.9," of policy, making it different kind of crimes and issues that only push people to lose confidence"
3776.9,3782.68, in the government and in the institutions which are actually the ones on which the society should
3782.68,3786.0," rely. In conclusion, dear panel, we can not only"
3786.0,3790.32, justify the preference of negative political fictions because they have the main purpose
3790.32,3796.56," to demonize and to present the problem under a steric way, but what we should take into account"
3796.56,3802.02, is the way in which the political message would be a vehicle to the audience and as we have proved
3802.02,3805.2," to you during the debate, preferring positive fictions to negative"
3805.2,3810.4, ones we would achieve such a huge goals for all of this reason i beg you to propose thank you
3819.44,3823.76, i thank all the speakers for what was an engaging debate which was fun to watch
3823.76,3825.2, uh now you can stay in
3825.2,3830.32, the room shake hands socialize since we're still not together find out about like the
3830.32,3835.52, base in your countries and if i could ask yeah also i would stop recording now uh
