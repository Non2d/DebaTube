125.8,131.6," Okay, and please leave the chat box only for timing and also POI function as well."
131.6,145.06," I'm going to indicate time at 1, 7, and 8 as well, but sometimes I may have some kind of time lag, but just serve as kind of indication of rough indication of time. Okay, we're debating under the motion"
145.06,146.24, this House prefers a world
146.24,148.4, where instead of charging tuition fees
148.4,150.66," to students up front,"
150.9,153.78, universities collect a portion of the income
153.78,155.84, of each of their graduates upon graduation.
156.12,158.46," Okay, without much ado, Prime Minister."
161.52,162.9," Hey, just checking to see"
162.9,164.3, if I'm both audible and visible again.
164.98,165.0," Yes, loud and clear. Amazing, cool. Hey, just checking to see if I'm both audible and visible again?"
165.0,168.0," Yes, loud and clear."
168.0,172.0, Amazing. Cool.
172.0,177.0," Speaker, for a middle class family in Kenya, university is not an investment."
177.0,186.0," It is a dream, where they are forced into a choice to either not get educated or be crappled or be saddled with crippling debt on our side we make it an"
186.0,190.96, investment because you are no longer a financial burden to your family when you go to university
190.96,195.36, because you're an investment university who are finally forced to care about you and because
195.36,201.76, families finally have a shot at social mobility on proposition for the first time we make university
201.76,205.48, accessible to the people who need it the most. What's our stance
205.48,212.42," in this debate? As a university graduate, you paid back your student fee proportional to your income."
212.8,217.26," That's to say, for the next predetermined set of years, as built into a contract between you"
217.26,222.44," and your university, you pay 1% royalty on all your future earnings to your university"
222.44,225.48," in that set time period. Obviously, we support"
225.48,230.14, the continuation of public funding to university. The way in which this works is governments give
230.14,235.08," public guarantee loans to cover the startup costs of this policy, such that in the long run,"
235.18,239.88," you are securitized and you are stable and you have a cushion. On comparative, the world that"
239.88,245.74," Australia needs to defend is the terrible status quo, when you are forced into high startup and"
245.74,250.56," front costs, when students have to pay for tuition, where they have to pay for expensive housing,"
250.8,254.94, and where they are forced to pay for food that they cannot afford on university campuses.
255.4,260.28," Bearing that in mind, two arguments from Team India. First, on why we uniquely make universities"
260.28,270.02," more accessible, and second, on why we are great for the quality of education within universities and future careers of grads. On the first argument, what is the problem right now?"
270.42,276.48, University today's speaker has massive upfront costs. You are met with insanely high tuition
276.48,282.42," fees, massive payments to dorms and really, really expensive food and cafeterias. The reason this is"
282.42,285.44, true is because universities right now want to maximize
285.44,289.68," their profits. That's because at the point at which they can do that, deans can maximize their"
289.68,293.84," salaries, administration can maximize their salaries. That gives them additional money"
293.84,299.04, to quote-unquote beautify their campuses. We think this is terrible because it forces people into
299.04,304.16," three terrible choices. First, this is due to the massive financial burden which means you don't go"
304.16,305.0, to university.
305.0,310.0, This is terrible because any society which places an emphasis on university and glorifies it.
310.0,314.0, We think that this is when you are stopped at when you apply for a job.
314.0,319.0," This is when you are told to go and flip burgers. Instead, this is when no one takes you seriously."
319.0,345.04," We account for that. Second, we think that universities as they are right now, especially in parts of the world that are in Australia, especially in parts of the world that are in the US, are terrible for women, terribly inaccessible, because families don't think that they should university and because of the high startup cost"
345.04,349.68, we think that it being free for that daughter to go to school is the tipping point for when you
349.68,354.48, start actually sending your daughter to university in the first place we think that this is massively
354.48,359.36, important in terms of giving women access to an education which in the long run gives them access
359.36,364.4, to financial stability the freedom to do things like have their own bank accounts and leave abusive
364.4,365.28, relationships but second we think that our policy is also uniquely good for the most marginalized stability the freedom to do things like have their own bank accounts and leave abusive relationships
365.28,370.4, but second we think that our policy is also uniquely good for the most marginalized stakeholder
370.4,375.68, in this debate in terms of actors like women because after your daughter graduates on our
375.68,380.32, side of the house uniquely you have to let her work why because that's the point at which you
380.32,388.8, can pay back her contract to this university what that means is that women on our side of the house are incentivized to get work experience are allowed to go to jobs are allowed
388.8,393.52, to engage in the workplace which means one they have a far larger level of freedom than they do
393.52,398.48, on comparative and on our side of the house uniquely have access to a large network and
398.48,403.92, support system but the third choice which is also crippling is people have to take on student loan
403.92,406.16, debt in order to get access to universities.
406.52,411.26, This is terrible because the way in which interest rates work is they pile up and they compound.
411.6,416.64," What that means is that the end of your life, you are forced into a debt which you cannot pay back."
416.64,422.26," But second, the reason student loans specifically are so bad is because they are punitive in nature."
422.6,426.1," For a middle class student at the point at which you can't pay your loan back,"
426.1,429.12, that's when your parents who co-signed on your loan's house
429.12,429.96, is seized.
429.96,432.04," That's the point at which your credit score tanks,"
432.04,433.98, which means you are screwed in the future
433.98,436.0, because you no longer get access to loans
436.0,437.6," to do things like start a business,"
437.6,440.0," to do things like buy a home and own property,"
440.0,441.34, which gives you stability.
441.34,443.44, We think that that is actively debilitating
443.44,445.12, to be most vulnerable individuals
445.12,451.44, in society on comparative why are we far better first there are no upfront costs that's the point
451.44,455.04, at which your parents are more comfortable doing things like sending you to university
455.04,459.2, plus you are more comfortable going to university you don't feel guilty because you don't feel like
459.2,469.0," a financial burden you know that at one point in your life you will pay it back. But second, crucially, only on site proposition do universities start doing outreach."
469.0,475.0," You go towards things like poor and marginalized communities, so you can find weekend kids within them."
475.0,486.8," You find poor kids for marginalized communities, and you build them up, because if and when they're wildly successful, you have massive rates of profit off of that on their their side of the house, universities don't even look at the favelas of Brazil"
486.8,488.68, because they can only dent their coffins.
488.76,490.8, There's no benefit to them from that.
491.0,492.48," Before I move on to my second argument,"
492.78,494.94, there are two possible things all schools see to this.
495.2,497.9," First, they can't fix inaccessibility with scholarships."
497.9,500.5, The first reason is because schools just don't give them
500.5,503.98, on a very large scale because it is money outpost.
504.08,505.52," That is to say, it is free money you are"
505.52,509.52, giving away there's nothing that you are gaining back from it we think that that's really really
509.52,515.12, hard to pitch to your board of directors second only the richest universities can actually afford
515.12,519.84, to give out scholarships these are the hardest of the world they're not universities that middle
519.84,524.88, class people go to but second quarantine will be tell you we think that universities actually
524.88,525.16, take more kids on our side of the tell you we think that universities actually take
525.16,529.98, more kids on our side of the house because we think that even if you have one success you make
529.98,535.12, massive amounts of money that's why you try and be as accessible as possible because that increases
535.12,540.3, your probability of a massive payoff even one or two of the most accessible people for your
540.3,545.36, university can be used to cross subsidize for the rest of your class. That's why universities are
545.36,551.36," uniquely way more accessible on gov. Before I move on, yeah, Australia. While the upfront value of"
551.36,556.0," uni fees is far more concrete, portions of earnings are far more speculative. In this case, how can you"
556.0,562.48," say that universities won't, you know, won't confidently balance their books without overcharging in their degrees?"
563.92,565.8, The first thing to note is that you can't
565.8,570.12, overcharge for your degrees at the point at which there's no fee whatsoever. That is to say on our
570.12,574.32," side of the house, we are more accessible at the point at which we uniquely don't have fees."
574.72,579.36, I don't see where you're going with that POI. You miss our case. Adapt to it at LO. On the second
579.36,584.74," argument, why are we great for students' quality of education and careers? First, universities have"
584.74,587.04, incentives to ensure the long-term success.
587.04,590.24," That is to say, I as a university can only pay my dean,"
590.24,594.68, can only beautify my campuses if I get paid back well by my students.
594.68,599.08, That's the point at which I have an incentive to do things like build strong alumni networks
599.08,602.8, so that my graduates can get good jobs and therefore pay me back.
602.8,605.16," On comparative, the reason you are unlikely"
605.16,609.96, to do this is because it is very very expensive to maintain and coordinate things like alumni meetings.
609.96,615.24, Very very hard to do things like build reunions and the reason that's true is because you don't
615.24,619.44," profit from it. On our side of the house, arts is the tipping point in doing things like building"
619.44,624.54, strong alumni networks which are both important in terms of ensuring long-term career success but
624.54,629.24, also in terms of creating a cohesive university environment where people are happy because they can do things
629.24,635.14," like learn from the mistakes of their predecessors when they can share stories. Second, we push a"
635.14,639.28, massive incentive for universities to care about you over the long term. That means that they're
639.28,643.0, more likely giving you career guidance. They're more likely to help you work on your resume.
643.34,648.02, They're more likely to polish you before you apply to job interviews because that's the point at which they get paid back.
648.32,652.44," On comparative, they think this is a relationship that lasts for four years. That's when the"
652.44,658.28," obligation is finished. But lastly, we think that despite anything they tell you on the possible"
658.28,662.88," quality of this education, at the point at which more people are actually getting access to"
662.88,668.8, university and therefore finally have chances at social mobility we will always take it over Australia in this debate for all
668.8,688.68," of those reasons proposed Okay, are judges ready to move on?"
688.68,689.68, Thank you so much.
689.68,693.24," Okay, thank you, Prime Minister for verifying speech."
693.24,696.12, Now we'll be moving on toward the leader of opposition.
696.12,697.12, Thank you.
697.12,705.12," As a reminder, I'd like my pois in the chat please and assuming that i'm audible"
706.56,714.8, i'm going to start my speech in three two one to put it simply team india does not understand what
714.8,719.68, kind of debate this is because when the motion says you have to analyze what kind of world you
719.68,725.34, prefer they do not get to say that they suddenly increase the amount of government funding going to universities.
725.34,730.94, This debate has to be a comparison between the status quo where students cover the cost
730.94,735.04, of universities by taking out loans which are paid back incrementally over the course
735.04,739.96," of their working lives, over the idea that they're being charged upfront upon graduation"
739.96,741.88, by some kind of rate of their income.
741.88,746.24, Team India could not assert that they got any more support on their side than we get on our side.
746.24,748.24," One question in set up, what do we support?"
748.24,749.5," As I outlined in my introduction,"
749.5,750.82, we support the status quo
750.82,753.44, where students pay their fees up front of the university
753.44,755.26, and the vast majority of students fund this
755.26,757.0," through some sort of student loan scheme,"
757.0,758.98, noting particularly that in most countries
758.98,760.1," or in many countries,"
760.1,762.12, there exists some government funded scheme to do this
762.12,763.42," where there is no interest,"
763.42,764.76, unlike the punitive interest rates
764.76,769.0," the Team India want to claim they existed, like under our side in the status"
769.0,775.42," quo. So, on to my first point of substantive as to why this policy will far worsen the operation"
775.42,780.98, of universities. It's important to analyse what tuition fees actually pay for in either world.
781.22,785.44," They largely pay for the salaries of academics and administrative staff. Broadly,"
785.44,789.92, labour is the largest cost of any business. We think this is still true for tertiary education.
789.92,794.72, The second thing that they largely pay for is any existing loans which the university has taken out.
794.72,798.64, That might look like loans they had to take out to construct buildings and facilities or mortgages
798.64,802.96, and rent that they have to pay on the land that they use for their campus. Note that in both of
802.96,805.36, these cases they are pre-existing costs. That means that they have signed contracts that they use for their campus. Note that in both of these cases they are pre-existing costs.
805.36,808.8, That means that they have signed contracts that they will pay back this money. They have made
808.8,812.96, commitments that they will pay it back. That was incredibly important for the analysis as to how
812.96,817.84, they then change their fee structure. Because note that they cannot escape the costs which they have
817.84,822.96," committed to. They must commit to being able like to these loans in order for them to operate, to"
822.96,829.68," have staff to teach their classes, to have classrooms to teach those classes in. So the specific change here is that in the status quo,"
830.14,834.98," students pay for the service they receive from universities before they receive that service,"
835.22,839.86," whereas now they pay upon graduation, meaning they have already received the three or four"
839.86,850.34," years of university education before they have to pay for any of that. That means that when universities charge students in the current year, they have to estimate the cost they're going to"
850.34,854.76, have over the coming years and the potential increase in what those costs might be in order
854.76,860.52, to be able to continue to fund their institution. Now I'm going to outline why the estimate of what
860.52,864.74, those costs might be is always going to be far higher than whatever they charge in the status
864.74,868.78, quo. Note how this is directly responsive to all the analysis we hear from Team India
868.78,873.2, about stakeholders like the middle class in Kenya and the women who can now afford university.
873.38,876.64, We think it's actually going to be far less affordable because whatever the rates the
876.64,881.46, universities charge will be trying to create a greater amount of money incoming to them.
881.46,885.34, That means that the vast majority of people will be paying more than they
885.34,890.22," do under the status quo. Why was that? Firstly, because as I already kind of alluded to, this is"
890.22,894.86, a far higher risk for these universities to take on. Because unlike when they've already paid the
894.86,898.86," cost and they can already look at exactly how much they need to charge, they have to include"
898.86,903.66, preparation for any future costs in the estimate of what they have to charge. We also think that
903.66,906.18, it's likely that they're going to be incredibly cautious when making
906.18,910.7, these estimates because being slightly overcautious means charging slightly too much.
910.7,912.38, That's not really a harm for the universities.
912.38,915.94," Being undercautious means defaulting on their loans, means they're never going to have another"
915.94,917.62," loan, means being unable to operate."
917.62,921.98," That was a far, far too large a risk for them ever not to be super overcautious."
921.98,925.04," And within this, they had to estimate things like inflation increases,"
925.36,929.52," like the increase in the cost for them to produce their service, like the interest rate rises on the"
929.52,933.6," loans that they've already taken out, like the wage growth rises of their staff that might occur"
933.6,938.96, due to market shifts or a change in union action. All of these economic factors increase the cost
938.96,943.46, of these universities substantially. Look at around the world where inflation forecasts are
943.46,949.44," reaching rates of 8%, 9%, 10% per year. Unis have to be able to pay the salaries of their staff that means they"
949.44,953.76, have to overestimate what that inflation might do to wage growth they have to overestimate what it
953.76,958.64, might do to their costs that meant they had to charge a really high proportion of graduate salary
958.64,962.72, income so that they could collect a large amount of money to cover all these costs on the whole
962.72,968.96, that made the university for the vast majority of people paying what we can assume would be like quite a high rate out of their
968.96,973.92," income, this would be a massive expense to push on them. Notice in the response to the POI we gave"
973.92,977.48," where we alluded to this, their only response was that, oh well, the government is going to"
977.48,982.44," subsidize it. Obviously, that doesn't stand in a debate where they don't have any power to change"
982.44,988.8, the way the world operates and change the way government funding operates that meant you cannot credit that response and at the moment it stands
988.8,992.8, that university fees are going to be far more expensive before i move on to why courses are
992.8,1000.4, worse um i'll take a poi if there is one yeah if you get a model in this round wrong you are not
1000.4,1006.94, charged a set fee after university rather you just have to pay back a proportion or a percentage of your earnings for a specific
1006.94,1007.64, period of time.
1008.04,1008.84, This mitigates your entire pay.
1008.84,1010.58," Oh yeah, I understood that part perfectly."
1010.84,1014.86, So the part that I tried to explain is why that rate is going to be really high.
1015.1,1019.54," It is, for example, extremely inequitable if you charge people 80% of their graduating"
1019.54,1022.86, salary in order for universities to cover their financial costs.
1022.86,1024.88, That was a super punitive amount to charge them.
1025.04,1026.28, That was going to be really prohibitive in the way they were going to cover their financial costs. That was a super punitive amount to charge them. That was going to be really prohibitive
1026.28,1027.58, in the way they were going to live their lives.
1027.74,1029.6, That was going to make university way less accessible.
1029.92,1031.38, We totally understood what you were saying
1031.38,1033.82, and we also understood how damaging it was going to be.
1034.16,1036.64, So how did this make university courses worse?
1037.18,1039.98," When universities wanted to minimize financial risk for themselves,"
1040.12,1042.02, they had to ensure as much as possible
1042.02,1044.76, that they got as close to 100% graduate employment
1044.76,1048.68," so they'd have something to charge from, and that those graduate employment salaries were"
1048.68,1050.34, as high as they could possibly could be.
1050.7,1053.1, What do they suggest this will mean for university action?
1053.42,1057.86, They say things like strong alumni networks and sort of training for interviews that they
1057.86,1058.74, don't really explain.
1059.0,1061.64," We think that those are, first of all, really nebulous ideas."
1061.92,1068.56, It's difficult to understand why a university would want to take on even more risky operations given the financial climate they're about to enter but secondly we
1068.56,1071.2, think there are just things they're far more likely to do because they're easier because
1071.2,1075.76, they can implement them straight away that looks like changing the course types to prioritize more
1075.76,1080.08, employable courses like commerce like medicine like engineering and de-prioritizing courses
1080.08,1084.16, like teaching like history like archaeology giving them fewer places making them harder to get into
1084.16,1087.92, because those rates were lower but within courses it also looked like prioritizing elements and
1087.92,1092.8, topics that push for high paying specialties like tax law over human rights law this was super
1092.8,1096.48, damaging to students who are now limited in the courses that they could choose to do that were
1096.48,1100.0, not given the chance to express themselves in the university degree that they always thought
1100.0,1103.84, they would be able to that meant that those industries and sectors within society slowly
1103.84,1109.84, died out as their employee pool shrunk to a tiny size this had massive societally ranging effects
1109.84,1114.8, that were incredibly negative on the ability of people to enjoy their lives moving on to my second
1114.8,1119.12, substantive contribution about how this dangers the accessibility of universities know that the
1119.12,1123.2, entirety of this point will be directly responsive to all the material they gave you about making
1123.2,1128.54," easier for people in vulnerable financial situations to go to university. So firstly, I think I already"
1128.54,1133.0," outlined how university fee structures will change to become way more expensive, and that is obviously"
1133.0,1137.8, a huge harm for affordability. But it's also important to notice when this policy occurs.
1138.16,1142.94," Because when you take a massive amount of someone's income as they are employed on a graduate salary,"
1143.12,1145.04, that's probably the most financially vulnerable
1145.04,1149.6, time in their entire life. Because if you have a student loan like we propose would be the better
1149.6,1154.56," way, that is a loan which stays at the same amount while your income grows over your lifetime."
1154.84,1158.64," Unlike a loan, which is a much shorter time scale that occurs at probably a pretty low income point"
1158.64,1161.94," for you, that also meant that this was less affordable when you analyzed it over the course"
1161.94,1165.24," of your lifetime. But additionally, universities are way less accessible"
1165.36,1169.48, because they had no incentive to omit students from a low socioeconomic status.
1169.72,1173.44," In a status quo, student loans mean that these students can pay back loans"
1173.44,1175.2, because those costs are distributed over time
1175.2,1176.88, and universities don't have to worry about it
1176.88,1179.04," because either way, it's a bank responsibility."
1179.04,1180.88," Also, universities have far greater certainty"
1180.88,1182.84, because those fees are being paid ahead of time.
1182.84,1189.6," In their world, universities want to actively disadvantage, they are actively disadvantaged, sorry, by picking people of low"
1189.6,1193.84, socioeconomic status because it was a greater risk because they had lesser likely of being
1193.84,1198.0, employed after graduating and because they had a higher dropout rate that meant they were going to
1198.0,1202.96, actively cut out people from being able to go to university just because of their low socioeconomic
1202.96,1208.16, status. That was a massive harm for inequality and a huge principal burden the team india had to defend against once they
1208.16,1248.0," could reconcile with what this debate actually had to be a comparison between so proud to oppose Thank you. Okay, we thank the Leader of Opposition for a very fine speech."
1248.0,1252.18," Now if judges are ready, we'll be moving on toward Deputy Prime Minister."
1252.18,1257.02, Thank you so much.
1257.02,1269.64," Yeah, can you hear me?"
1270.1,1271.68," Yes, loud and clear."
1274.08,1280.42, Team Australia in this debate is incredibly proud when they say student loans are the better way.
1280.42,1290.0," I want to start off by characterizing that the United States, a developed country, has over $1.2 trillion worth of student loans."
1290.0,1300.0," That is a world that cripples some of the people who cannot pay back these loans, that condemn students after university to lives that they would never want to live in the first place."
1300.0,1305.58," My substantive push in this argument, in this speech, is about why we help the quality"
1305.58,1311.68," of education for the most vulnerable people, but before that, two areas clash. Firstly, on access."
1312.12,1317.58," Secondly, on students' choice. Firstly, on access. The big push that we get from their side is that"
1317.58,1323.08," universities don't have funding. I want to flag that their entire case relies on this assumption,"
1323.34,1325.84, and if we're able to disprove this in our speech
1325.84,1331.44, we think the vast majority of their case falls because when they say that we can't have a world
1331.44,1336.56, in which governments support universities because this house prefers motion i want to give them
1336.56,1341.76, something that really clarifies this debate universities still make a lot of money from the
1341.76,1345.26, royalties that students pay over a predetermined number of years.
1350.1,1355.5," All our side's doing is just covering up the upfront costs that a lot of smaller universities have. That we think governments can do, because if their side is relying on governments supporting"
1355.5,1360.0," people on their side of the house, then why can't the government help people on our side of the"
1360.0,1364.18," house when it's presumably cheaper, because universities are already able to take care of a"
1364.18,1369.44," lot of these costs in the first place, which means that we will be able to have universities that have access"
1369.44,1374.24, to this money fundamentally but their broader point in this debate is that it's much worse to
1374.24,1380.16, pay royalties to universities over a long period of time than it is to be saddled in loans i want
1380.16,1384.4, to be very clear about the two reasons here through weighing why we think it's much better
1384.4,1389.88, to pay back your university even if the royalties are slightly higher in our worst case than to pay back loans.
1389.88,1397.94," The first is that the interest rates of loans increases as time passes. That is, every year that passes by, you need to pay back more and more."
1398.22,1405.28, The thing about the royalties on our side of the house is that it's not on that basis. is if your income decreases you pay less because it's
1405.28,1410.72, two percent of that less income loans do not just loans do not give you that benefit so we think
1410.72,1415.92, you're fundamentally worse off second it's much better to owe university over the long term this
1415.92,1420.48, money than it is to owe something like a bank or like the person who's giving you these loans
1420.48,1425.44, because if you um default on this on their side what fundamentally happens is that your credit
1425.44,1430.72, rating goes down which locks you out of uh the ability to access money in the future we think
1430.72,1434.88, it's significantly better to like pay back a university even in our worst case scenario if
1434.88,1439.28, it is slightly more expensive than to pay back student loans that will never be paid back on
1439.28,1443.52, their side of the house so through weighing we think we're much better at the end of the day and
1443.52,1448.56, we don't think universities have no funding on our side of the house i want to bring back up our argument
1448.56,1453.52, here because they said that uh the universities cut out poor people more vulnerable people they
1453.52,1457.12, don't want to admit them um because they are afraid that they won't make that much money
1457.12,1461.84, after university but here's a little bit uh here's what we brought you in contrast what we said is
1461.84,1468.4, that universities are likely to do things like outreach programs right because universities often want to do things like offer scholarships because they
1468.4,1472.72, think that there are really talented people from minority communities who can do really well at
1472.72,1477.68, university and get their jobs universities don't go to those people to begin with because it's a
1477.68,1481.52, cost to them giving them scholarships making it accessible to cost they're not getting anything in
1481.52,1485.0, return on our side they are so how do you weigh between these two arguments?
1485.0,1488.0, Why do you think universities are likely to do more outreach?
1488.0,1495.0," The reason is, on their side, a lot of these people don't even apply to university to begin with because it's not seen as an option for them."
1495.0,1499.0," On our side, these people at least apply to universities to begin with."
1499.0,1504.0," So the burden is placed on the universities. That is, when lots of minorities, women, are applying to universities,"
1504.0,1508.4, it's harder for a university to deny them admission into their university because they
1508.4,1512.64, can be called racist that's the reason why a lot of universities are flagged that way because they
1512.64,1517.2, at least apply we think the burden is pushed on universities to take in more diverse groups whereas
1517.2,1520.8, on their side they can be like oh it's not our problem they didn't apply to begin with there's
1520.8,1527.68, nothing much we can do which means at the end of the day access is significantly better for some of the most marginalized people we'd love for their site
1527.68,1532.64, to respond to that i want to now talk about the second classroom speech on students choice
1532.64,1536.96, because the big push that they had here is that universities are likely to deprioritize
1536.96,1541.76, uh departments like archaeology and uh like liberal arts because they're not that high paid
1541.76,1548.56," outside of the fact that this is also hung on them proving that universities are substantially underfunded, which was their case, I want to take this a step"
1548.56,1553.84, further and say that these fields on the status quo that they have to support on opposition
1553.84,1558.8," are dying too. That is to say that archaeology and other fields like liberal arts are dying,"
1558.8,1562.96, and the reason they're dying is because students on their side don't even want to take up these
1562.96,1568.88, fields to begin with because they're saddled in student loans tell me why do you think so many university students are ending
1568.88,1573.2, up in finance because they have no option they need to pay back these student loans so they have
1573.2,1577.36, to enter into those fields on our side they don't have that burden right that means it's easier for
1577.36,1581.6, them to demand their university to offer things like humanities departments because they're not
1581.6,1587.6," under that pressure to pay back those loans and we think that the way here is on their side, they're saying universities will not"
1587.6,1589.76, like fund these departments because it's not profitable.
1590.06,1593.04, We're saying universities will fund these departments because students are asking for
1593.04,1593.16, it.
1593.32,1595.82, The way to resolve this is that students are asking for this.
1596.36,1599.68," Universities have to fundamentally do this because students are saying, I will want to"
1599.68,1603.2, attend the university where I can choose what I want to study rather than have to be condemned
1603.2,1604.74," to a horrible, horrible job."
1607.92,1612.28," We also think universities are more pressured to make a lot of humanities skills more employable by connecting them to fields like consultancy, by doing things like"
1612.28,1616.56," teaching them the transferability of these skills. On their side, these fields are only"
1616.56,1621.34," dominated by the most privileged people. That is, a privileged person wants to study sociology at a"
1621.34,1628.4," university because they don't see themselves, you know, entering into a really high- a really high paying job on our side universities try to make these fields more employable which"
1628.4,1632.24, means that more poor people who want to study african-american studies get that on our side
1632.24,1637.36, so we're fundamentally better in that regard at the end of the day we respect students choice we
1637.36,1641.52, are better for this field as ivan flips on his head before i move on to my substandard point
1641.52,1647.82," i'll take your poi if you 70% of a student's graduating salary,"
1648.0,1650.54, would that be a lesser amount than what they would have to pay back?
1650.86,1654.46, We don't think the vast majority of universities are going to be charging 70%
1654.46,1659.04," of, you know, $100,000 or $50,000 income from people, right?"
1659.1,1662.8," When your tuition fees are like, when university tuition fees are like generally $50,000,"
1663.04,1668.08," we think it's over 10 years, 20 years where they're charging two percent tell me what university is doing that in the status"
1668.08,1673.6, quo okay my argument is why why we improve the quality of education look we think we are debaters
1673.6,1678.56, are often in the lead bubble where we think that we attend really big universities a lot of poorer
1678.56,1684.32, people are often at often attend for for-profit universities so universities like kaplan trump
1684.32,1686.68," university arizona arizona university and these universities often target these people because often attend for-profit universities. So universities like Kaplan, Trump University, Arizona University."
1686.68,1689.08, And these universities often target these people
1689.08,1691.2," because they say, if you come into my university,"
1691.2,1692.3," I'll give you a cheap degree,"
1692.3,1694.08, which allows you to get access to a job.
1694.08,1695.5, Why do we think these universities
1695.5,1698.24, are able to fundamentally charge students a lot of money?
1698.24,1699.26, There are three reasons.
1699.26,1701.0," The first is that they can be coercive,"
1701.0,1703.1, that they can use things like advertisements
1703.1,1708.56, and make people believe that a university education is something they need to get secondly a lot of these people don't have
1708.56,1713.12, alternative universities to go to so it's often these only for profit universities that remain
1713.12,1718.24, the option the third reason that they can often do this is because of the fact that they um because
1718.24,1722.32, they can lie to students and say that we've given a lot of people degrees look at our success which
1722.32,1725.6, means that what happens is universities can charge
1725.6,1727.42, lots and lots of money from students
1727.42,1729.16," through this coercive narrative,"
1729.16,1731.68, which means I wanna flag here that any response
1731.68,1734.08," that they give on like universities can make it cheaper,"
1734.08,1736.12, doesn't hold true because they're inherently able
1736.12,1737.82, to make it expensive on their side.
1737.82,1738.9, Why is this harmful?
1738.9,1741.4," Because universities are charging very, very high amounts"
1741.4,1743.38, of money for like just a simple degree
1743.38,1744.84, that students can get.
1744.84,1749.1, The problem with that is they don't make these degrees high quality because there's no incentive to do that.
1749.26,1757.44," That is, I just need a computer science degree from Stephen University that just teaches me theory instead of algorithms to be able to land a job in McDonald's."
1757.44,1761.46, And the problem with just getting a degree like that is that I just don't progress in my field.
1761.84,1766.06, That means that the degrees don't have that much value. The alternative is a world in which universities
1766.06,1767.88," get money through quality education,"
1767.88,1769.62, which means these degrees are of high value
1769.62,1771.76, and you don't have to charge that much money to people.
1771.76,1772.96, We help the most vulnerable.
1772.96,1774.5, We help improve quality of education.
1774.5,1796.7," We're incredibly proud to stand on King's proposition. Okay, we thank DPM for a refined speech."
1796.7,1801.24," It seems both judges are ready to move on, so we'll invite DLO."
1801.24,1819.0, Thank you so much.
1821.0,1827.84, Just checking that I'm visible and audible. you are very clear awesome starting my speech then in three
1828.48,1834.64, two one team india walks a fine line in this debate which is to say on the one hand that the
1834.64,1839.68, status quo is one where universities charge huge costs but there's no way they're going to charge
1839.68,1844.24, huge interest rates in their world that in their second speech they employ incredibly coercive
1844.24,1848.74, tactics but there's no way they will offer punitive punishments in the same way banks do.
1849.24,1853.64, Observe how they run away from what our world actually looks like. Perhaps they know they
1853.64,1858.18," can't win there. We oppose. Two things I'm going to do in this speech before substantive. First,"
1858.64,1862.46," I'm going to prove why our side gets universities to be more accessible. And second, I'm going to"
1862.46,1869.06, prove why we get a higher quality of education. the first I think the biggest thing to note is that the majority of stakeholders
1869.06,1874.1, under the status quo take out student loans let's talk then about why they are preferable to this
1874.1,1878.18, model they say they are bad for two reasons firstly that there are interest rates we reject
1878.18,1881.84, this we've noticed that most government-led systems aren't those with interest rates but
1881.84,1889.14," even those that are I'll deal with later secondly they say that they are punitive. Humane responses here. Firstly, I think it's likely that these are not"
1889.14,1893.98, at all exclusive to these student loans. That is because universities are profit incentive. In our
1893.98,1898.7," first speech, we outlined why universities charge exuberant amounts under our side. If that is true,"
1898.74,1902.94," it must be structurally true that what they want to do is not just provide people with educations,"
1903.12,1909.4, but provide people with educations and make huge profit. That is why side proposition can point to a problem under the
1909.4,1914.34," status quo. What we would tell you, though, that even if the status quo isn't good, they make it"
1914.34,1919.36," actively worse. That's for a few reasons. Firstly, because we reject the idea that universities are"
1919.36,1923.74," just good actors. It doesn't make sense to me that they wouldn't do things like punitive punishment,"
1924.06,1928.88, i.e. take capital that these individuals have if they aren't able to fulfill these loans.
1929.04,1932.3, These are businesses. These are businesses with huge amounts of capital.
1932.66,1936.5," Point to universities like Harvard, which have literally billions of dollars of university and stipends."
1936.82,1938.7, They can do things like punitive punishment.
1939.08,1941.78," But secondly, note what actively gets worse on their side."
1941.78,1947.78," That is all of the mechanisms we give you a live speech about why they are less certain that they're able to get the money because of market volatility,"
1948.06,1951.8," which means they are likely to overcharge because they cannot be certain. But secondly,"
1952.1,1957.74," and this is crucial, even at their very best case, even if student loans are to some extent worse,"
1957.74,1962.74, we would say this is still preferable for the crucial reason that it's easier to conceptualize
1962.74,1965.06," and easier to understand. That is,"
1965.4,1969.42," when individuals are faced with a specific cost, and they know that that's what they're going to"
1969.42,1974.04," pay, and they know the mechanisms exist which allow them to pay it, that is preferable to"
1974.04,1978.58, universities coercing individuals with jargon about percentage rates and a time frame. Because
1978.58,1982.66," let's be clear, Team India has not given a time frame for this policy yet. It means that these"
1982.66,1986.48, individuals are going to be less able to understand how much money they're giving up.
1986.48,1988.54," That is a moral hazard that you need to wait,"
1988.54,1990.94," even if you can take India at their best, best case,"
1990.94,1992.4, which probably doesn't exist at all.
1992.4,1993.52, What does this mean then?
1993.52,1995.24," It means firstly, that all of their harms"
1995.24,1997.06, about upfront costs fall down.
1997.06,1999.78," That's firstly, the students who do pay upfront,"
1999.78,2002.1, probably pay regardless.
2002.1,2004.48," It is worse on their side because there isn't clarity,"
2004.48,2008.16, but also it's proportionally probably more because these are individuals who are probably going to have
2008.16,2012.72, high income jobs for a number of years this is worse then but secondly that those who have to
2012.72,2017.44, deal with the cost of student loans are rather this policy is it actively worse because universities
2017.44,2022.08, overcharge and they cannot conceptualize what that means to them secondly then on access for women
2022.08,2028.0," and other excluded groups they say firstly that this allows them to send women to universities, and secondly, that allows them to let them work."
2028.0,2032.0, I think this is an active mischaracterization of what norms about miscarriage is.
2032.0,2039.0," That is to say, and POI is in the chat, please, that the reason women can't access education is specifically because of norms that should say that women deserve to stay in the home,"
2039.0,2043.0," that the role of the woman is one of childbearing and is one of, like, raising a family."
2043.0,2048.88, Those are the norms which actively lock out individuals from accessing uh employment and accessing uh university in that way you don't
2048.88,2052.88, defeat these norms with this policy and secondly note the principled harm that exists with this
2052.88,2056.8, policy for women specifically that is there is a wage gap that means that women are more likely to
2056.8,2062.08, be disproportionately affected by a policy which targets their income if they want to stand by
2062.08,2068.28," women they have to lose this debate because of principled hazard that exists there there. Finally, on outreach, they give you a weird mechanism here,"
2068.32,2071.72, which is to say that it doesn't apply under the status quo because the university has no burden
2071.72,2078.1, to enable these individuals to succeed and to access these people. This is a lie. This actively
2078.1,2081.94," gets worse on their side, at the point at which universities know that the people they need to"
2081.94,2087.92," actively get in and the people they need to educate are ones who can be highly employed and get high incomes. That is to say, universities"
2087.92,2092.06, are now given the direct incentive not to allow low socioeconomic people in because they are
2092.06,2097.0, structurally disadvantaged in a way that people from high income families are not. That is all
2097.0,2101.54, of the material and lived speech. But why things like nepotism and cronyism means that universities
2101.54,2105.04, are less able to allow individuals to go into university. What do
2105.04,2109.06, you know then at the end of this point? You know firstly that student loans are better because
2109.06,2113.76," individuals are A, able to conceptualize what it means for them, but secondly that the ability for"
2113.76,2117.74, universities to hamstring these individuals through inflating costs because of things like
2117.74,2122.28," market volatility is way less likely under our side, but finally they actively worsen things"
2122.28,2127.94," for women because of the pay gap and the disproportionate effect it has on them and it actively worsens outreach. Second question then,"
2128.18,2132.38, which side gets a higher quality of education? They say that universities have incentives now
2132.38,2136.5," to make individuals as employable as possible. If that's a claim they want to stand by, they lose"
2136.5,2141.3," this debate. Firstly, because of the impacts on courses. They say that the arts are dying because"
2141.3,2147.8," they are low paying, but also that individuals will ask them under our side whether the payment they receive is actively worse because of this policy."
2147.88,2150.88, What that means they have to stand by then is a world in which arts courses
2150.88,2154.48," just are, A, less employable just because of the nature of the status quo,"
2154.48,2157.72," but B, that universities start to take them away because they're not as employable."
2157.8,2159.28," They do not deal with the structural factors,"
2159.28,2161.56, which means that the arts are disproportionately affected
2161.72,2168.56," by things like capitalism, which just means that universities are structurally incentivized to make sure that they don't offer these courses in the same way second"
2168.56,2173.84, on the impacts to behavior and care what this policy does is by their own analysis make these
2173.84,2178.64, individuals just mechanisms of a machine that they can pull out to make them money that means that
2178.64,2182.4, they have the direct incentive to make sure they're in as many classes as possible learning
2182.4,2187.92," as much content as possible but specifically content that can make money. That's contract law and commercial law, not human rights"
2187.92,2193.12," law. That means that universities are likely to jeopardize things like care and pastoral events,"
2193.12,2197.2," things like debating, which is a huge cost that exists because they know that it's time that these"
2197.2,2203.44, students should probably be spent studying. That's a harm. On to finally whether or not these degrees
2203.44,2215.4," are coercive. This was a strange push because they say that things like computer science, and I'll take a POI in a second, are more likely to be impacted on these, like more likely to be coerced into things like computer science."
2215.4,2227.02," This is a lie for all of the mechanisms we've given you at Live in this speech about why universities perceive things like computer science to be highly employable and will likely push individuals into them. Before a one point of substantive about how this worsens the experience of universities,"
2227.14,2231.82, I'll take a point. Is it worse to be in debt to student loans that have increasing interest rates
2231.82,2239.14, or have to pay a fixed one or two percent royalty over 10 or 20 years of time? I think the fact that
2239.14,2243.74," you said 10 or 20 years time is probably indicative that your model is far worse, A, because individuals"
2243.74,2248.32," can't understand it, but B, because that PO py is completely unresponsive to all of the material we give you"
2248.32,2252.4, at live about why universities are likely to inflate what that percentage is that is to say
2252.4,2256.88, there is absolutely no reason in any of your speeches why it would be one percent why it would
2256.88,2261.52, be five percent because universities by your own analysis are money making so obviously they're
2261.52,2268.08, going to do things like maximize their profits obviously in that world these loans are better one point of substantive then about why this increases the
2268.08,2271.6, impediment of experiences at university and know that some of this material was dealt with
2271.6,2276.72, in rebuttal firstly the fact that the primary purpose by team india's own analysis is speed
2276.72,2280.88, and specialization that is getting individuals into the workplace and getting them into workplaces
2280.88,2289.2, which are high paying that means that they are no longer focusing on things like experiences and things like clubs and other activities that's crucial because what universities
2289.2,2292.96, do for individuals is help them to self-actualize help them to work out what they're passionate
2292.96,2297.52, about what they want to do note how fundamentally important it is for individuals at universities
2297.52,2301.12, not just to study what they want but to try different experiences so they know where they
2301.12,2308.62, can direct their lives once they leave university. Note crucially the wealth of evidence that exists vis-a-vis books and studies which say
2308.62,2312.4," that individuals who are happy, individuals who care about their courses, individuals"
2312.4,2316.84," who are able to self-actualize do better, which means we co-opt all of their analysis"
2316.84,2318.48, about why universities make students better.
2318.48,2321.92," At the end of this speech, we get universities more accessible, we get a better quality of"
2321.92,2354.46," education we oppose. Okay, we thank Diallo for verifying speech."
2354.46,2359.56, Now let's move on to Government Whip to try to summarize the case on the proposition side.
2359.8,2360.2, Thank you.
2360.84,2391.5," Give me 15 seconds, please. Hi, am I audible?"
2393.08,2394.38," Yes, you are. Very clear."
2395.48,2397.24, Great. Do you guys
2397.24,2398.24, want to do it for me?
2401.76,2403.38, I'm putting up my
2403.38,2403.66, timer.
2410.32,2417.36, Starting my speech and three two i don't know what opposition thinks of universities because they might be profit
2417.36,2422.3, incentivized but they aren't stupid so you know what let's take them on their best case
2422.3,2425.2, instead of one percent they charge five percent
2425.2,2431.92, of the income but it's very very definitely not 70 or 80 percent of incomes of people because
2431.92,2436.96, guess what people will literally starve on the ground nobody will actually end up going to the
2436.96,2442.56, university when the electricians for their life will have no money to afford anything in their
2442.56,2445.92, life right that's to be clear universities are rational
2445.92,2452.24, actors will make sure that this income is actually properly divided recognizing that two classes in
2452.24,2458.0, this speech firstly on the access to education secondly i would say increases quality of
2458.0,2464.24, education first touch done on access to education here persons deal with this argument that come
2464.24,2465.2, comes from their side of
2465.2,2470.64, the house it is just much more risky for colleges and they end up costing significantly more one
2470.64,2475.68, let's be very clear throughout all of their speeches they have just chosen to ignore our
2475.68,2481.44, model right if you only charge a percentage of your income so let's get for instance the
2481.44,2485.6, universities end up wanting to charge more if for instance they are charged
2485.6,2490.0, two percent three percent five percent of your income it still doesn't cost you that much because
2490.0,2494.64, that means that your income increases as well for instance it means this is stuff that these people
2494.64,2500.08, can afford to pay back but secondly on this idea even if they overcharge it's just significantly
2500.08,2510.0, easier to pay back money on our side of the house because of two reasons one because this is spread out instead of upfront you can pay it over 10 years 20 years that just means it's easier for
2510.0,2515.52, individuals to pay back but secondly and this is to be very crucial this response directly to a lot
2515.52,2520.0, of their analysis that people know better because let's be clear the people they claim know better
2520.0,2526.86," are literally 17 18 year olds that are heading up from high school to college. On our side, it's the side that people know better"
2526.86,2530.94," because now you are a college graduate who understands how the real world works,"
2531.12,2533.88," who has actually worked, for instance, part-time jobs in college,"
2534.16,2537.14," has some safety, and that means you're much more likely able"
2537.14,2541.92, to make financial decisions for you than the literal 17-year-old ever was going to be able to be.
2542.4,2544.5, And let's then compare this to what we told you.
2544.7,2545.02, And this was a comparison they never really wanted to able to be. And let's then compare this to what we told you. And this
2545.02,2550.58," was a compact they never really wanted to contend with, student loans. And let's not pretend that"
2550.58,2555.28," student loans are any good in the status quo, right? All of us know what's happening in the US"
2555.28,2560.3, where literally people are dying and not able to pay back their student loans at the point which
2560.3,2566.0, those prices are significantly high. You're doing so well in med school yet you have no money
2566.0,2570.8, left over to be able to do the things you want to do because you're still just stuck in debt because
2570.8,2575.76, of their standard house and why is this just much much worse because of compound interest and they
2575.76,2579.84, can't just come up here and tell you interest doesn't exist because guess what panel that's
2579.84,2585.2, how loans work interest does exist and that means all of their analysis but oh you can't
2585.2,2589.74, conceptualize how much you have to pay doesn't work because you can't conceptualize how much
2589.74,2593.8, you have to pay either on their side of the house and actually it increases because interest rates
2593.8,2599.34, are significantly more volatile than your income secondly it takes away property it's punitive but
2599.34,2603.3, third when you know that individuals aren't able to pay back that means you create bad credit
2603.3,2608.32, scores and that's when individuals are less likely to for instance create businesses able to have startups because
2608.32,2612.8, you can't get the loans you need to because you're still suffering because of your student debt but
2612.8,2617.2, let's then deal with the second claim that comes from your side of the house you just end up not
2617.2,2622.48, paying or just hiring minorities a couple of responses first we think we change universities
2622.48,2625.28," incentives you want the most talented person,"
2625.28,2630.24," you want the most meritocratic person, because that's the person who can do best in jobs."
2630.24,2634.72, That's the person in these companies who will do amazing and make sure that gets these companies
2634.72,2639.12, most profit. And that means the companies have an incentive to hire the person who is
2639.12,2643.92," the best. And let's be very clear, anyone can be the best. And that's why for instance,"
2643.92,2645.04, they don't care if you have a
2645.04,2649.44, rich dad when you're working for a company they care if you're able to do what they need you to do
2649.44,2654.4, that means companies hire those that are the most talented and that means that on our side of the
2654.4,2659.2, house universities also have the incentive to do this but secondly we told you the problem right
2659.2,2664.72, from the beginning was that minorities self-select out of coming to these universities and recognize
2664.72,2665.36, this is really
2665.36,2670.0, really crucial because universities do have incentives to have minorities outside of this
2670.0,2674.08, one because you're getting diverse representation of thoughts into things like research which a lot
2674.08,2678.88, of universities do focus on but second let's be clear we live in a pretty liberal world there's
2678.88,2683.04, massive pressure by social movements to make sure that the only people that are there in a
2683.04,2688.46," university aren't only white people however on, on their side of the house, universities can just actually"
2688.46,2692.6," not face any of that accountability, face any of that backlash, because they can claim,"
2692.84,2696.48, I am not the one at fault. It's these individuals who are not applying to their universities.
2696.86,2701.06, They're the ones at fault. That means you just significantly worsen health for minorities.
2701.3,2704.74," But lastly, on this idea that they claim in their second point, why do you just get less"
2704.74,2707.52, money and that hurts cross-cultural activities like the bearing
2707.52,2712.32, two responses first more people coming in needs more money when you have more people applying to
2712.32,2716.88, colleges that means just on an average level you're getting more money coming in but secondly
2716.88,2720.48, there are always going to be individuals that just become really really successful
2720.48,2728.36, they just by coincidence become really really rich and for those people a one% or a 5% percentage of their income is going to give you massive
2728.36,2731.96, amounts of money that can make up for the loss any other individuals are giving you.
2731.96,2734.52, That means that we do get the bidding better on our side of the house.
2734.52,2737.52, Let's then talk about what we told you went unresponded to.
2737.92,2742.04," Firstly, we told you poor just cannot afford loans on their side of the house, feel much"
2742.04,2749.04," more comfortable when going into part time jobs because they can't afford to go to universities. But secondly, notice you hurt women on their side of the house feel much more comfortable when into going into part-time jobs because they can't afford to go to universities but secondly notice you hurt women on their side"
2749.04,2753.44, of the house and there were two responses to this let's deal with this one the women who don't
2753.44,2757.84, access education either on either side of the house is symmetric this is nuanced about women
2757.84,2762.08, who for instance do want to access education just don't have the resources to do so because their
2762.08,2767.92, families won't prioritize it but secondly on this idea that gender based gap i don't know what you look at but a lot of companies do hire
2767.92,2772.8, them and 50 of the population is not just some that goes unemployed but lastly we told you for
2772.8,2776.8, instance you will get increased outreach that is massive for all of these reasons we get much more
2776.8,2782.24, vulnerable people coming into these universities give them an actual chance at life before i move
2782.24,2785.12, on is there any DUI?
2785.12,2789.16," As a team, you have not been able to provide a consistent rate or timeframe. If you can't"
2789.16,2793.48," conceptualize these factors, how can a uni student or someone of low socioeconomic status?"
2793.48,2798.64," First, we think, sure, if you want a consistent amount of training, we'll give you 10 years,"
2798.64,2801.88," guess what? That's okay. Second, we think universities are able to make rational decisions."
2801.88,2808.58," If they can choose how much fees to give, sure they can choose like a number of years so our government can regulate that like I don't know"
2808.58,2812.78, where that's going second second flash there on quality of education first here this argument
2812.78,2817.1, that you just won't never talk about humanities and their center house I have three responses
2817.1,2821.42, to this first it makes no sense for universities to do this because if everyone's getting a
2821.42,2826.76, financial degree what happens then well guess what The job market for finance gets oversaturated
2826.76,2828.52, and you need people with no jobs
2828.52,2830.28, because more and more people might coming up
2830.28,2832.64," into that degree, the number of jobs remains the same,"
2832.64,2834.12, you get more people unemployed.
2834.12,2835.8," Second, people going into finance"
2835.8,2837.08," when they didn't want to go into it,"
2837.08,2838.52," wanted to actually study, for instance,"
2838.52,2839.96," African-American history,"
2839.96,2842.0, aren't gonna be doing well in finance.
2842.0,2843.36, These are the people who are likely stuck
2843.36,2844.88, in the least paid jobs in finance
2844.88,2848.72," because they didn't want to do finance, didn't specialize in it they're probably not"
2848.72,2852.96, good at it but thirdly notice these are the people who ended just going to another college that does
2852.96,2857.2, give them that liberal arts degree we're unsure why that works but secondly notice we think
2857.2,2861.28, actually colleges do have the incentive to prioritize humanities for the two reasons one
2861.28,2864.56, because these are fields that are becoming much more and more lucrative because of things like
2864.56,2865.0," creation centralization being demand but second again minorities self-select them out of their One, because these are fields that are becoming much more and more lucrative because of things"
2865.0,2866.0, like racial centralization being in demand.
2866.0,2867.0," But second, again, minorities self-select on out of their sets of house."
2867.0,2868.0, And I say these are the people who demand for these sorts of things because they want
2868.0,2869.0," to do it, can afford to do it because they don't have to be worried about student diplomas"
2869.0,2870.0, and not being able to pay it.
2870.0,2871.0," That means that individuals want to do something, they're actually able to do it much better"
2871.0,2872.0, on our side of the house.
2872.0,2873.0," But lastly then, let's compare this to what we told you."
2873.0,2874.0," Personal and for-profit universities, in the way they can't continue forcing these"
2874.0,2875.0," individuals regardless of what they're doing, they're not going to be able to pay for it."
2875.0,2876.0," So, they're going to be able to pay for it."
2876.0,2877.0," And so, they're going to be able to pay for it."
2877.0,2878.0," And so, they're going to be able to pay for it."
2878.0,2887.9," And so, they're going to be able to do it much better on our side of the house but lastly then let's compare this to what we told you personal for-profit universities in the way they can't"
2887.9,2891.42, continue forcing these individuals regardless of whatever they wanted to believe because their
2891.42,2895.56, entire income scheme changes that means they have to teach them more practical stuff but secondly
2895.56,2899.66, we told you you establish alumni networks you care more about things like interviews you teach
2899.66,2903.16, them more practical stuff like for instance in medical school not just teaching them textbooks
2903.16,2907.28, but actually giving them proper knowledge on the ground it means individuals are just much more
2907.28,2912.16, likely prepared after the real world get much better jobs and do much better in life so so proud
2912.16,2935.04," to propose Okay, we thank government WIP for verifying speech."
2935.36,2937.28, We'll be moving on toward opposition WIP.
2937.52,2964.1, Thank you. Am I audible?
2964.1,2965.18," Yes, you are. Am I audible?"
2965.84,2983.64," Yes, you are."
2986.58,2986.72, The fate of a bloated opposition is dealt by their own blade.
2989.26,2989.44," Because as much as they want to say that unis are profit motivated,"
2992.08,2992.34, that is the exact reason why universities will overcharge.
2994.58,2994.86," And note that it's easier to do that underside proposition,"
2996.86,2997.12," because when people ask why the percentage is so high,"
2999.74,2999.9, unis can say it's because they don't know how much everyone will earn.
3001.28,3001.48, They can say because it's risky.
3003.12,3003.2, They can say that they can justify that.
3004.38,3007.26, And that's why the price goes up. And that's why this opposition eventually loses out on this debate.
3007.46,3009.02, Maybe we're not talking about 80%.
3009.02,3010.84," But in fact, it is enormously greater."
3011.14,3012.8, It was 10% over 20 years.
3013.04,3013.66, It's two salaries.
3013.88,3017.32, And that's obviously far greater than any sort of cost that happens under our side.
3017.52,3020.34, Just because it is a percentage in this debate does not mean it's lesser.
3020.56,3022.48, Don't let side proposition get away with that.
3022.68,3024.58, There are two questions I'm going to answer in this speech.
3024.84,3028.08," First, how does this affect the ability of students to go to university and"
3028.08,3032.96, second how does it affect the quality of education at these universities first how does it affect the
3032.96,3037.52, ability of students to go to universities and this is important because this is what the entire
3037.52,3041.84, opposition case is based on so if we break this down they cannot win the debate their first line
3041.84,3045.78, of attack is to say that more accessible because it's it's cheaper. There are four problems with this argument.
3046.1,3049.02, The first thing to note is that student loans can exist under our side.
3049.28,3052.22, Their response is to say that student loans build up with interest.
3052.56,3054.16," First, in many cases, it is free."
3054.38,3056.82," In the case, like we're not just talking about the US in this debate."
3057.04,3058.4, There are other countries in this world.
3058.62,3062.4, And we would know that education structurally is something that is often politically popular
3062.4,3068.58," for the reason that many people are students, many people benefit benefit from the education and everyone is able to receive that benefit but"
3068.58,3072.36, the second thing to say that is clearly uncomparative to their side which I'm about to
3072.36,3076.68, explain is likely to be substantially worse sorry the second problem with their case is that we say
3076.68,3080.22, that universities can now charge more because universities are naturally more likely to be
3080.22,3083.94, cautious at the point where they can point to this risk and they say that's why we're charging more
3083.94,3088.56, and they have the ability to do that by their own analysis under proposition because in many cases
3088.56,3092.8, there are few universities in specific areas which means that they're able to gouge that price and
3092.8,3096.56, there's unlikely to be backlash for the simple reason that universities can say it's because
3096.56,3100.48, there's more risk but second because they can justify those fees because they can say we don't
3100.48,3104.72, know what you're going to earn in the future which naturally means it's unlikely that this opposition
3104.72,3108.42," can try and stop those prices from rising, which means that this opposition is"
3108.42,3113.1, actually the one that is forcing people to pay more money. But the third thing to say is let's
3113.1,3117.84, take them at their best case and assume that money necessarily is less on their side. We would note
3117.84,3122.3, that money doesn't matter if universities don't accept many of these low FTS students in the first
3122.3,3126.5," way. And we give you this from birth, from Liv,"
3126.5,3128.1," which is to explain that in many cases,"
3128.1,3129.44, they will turn away students
3129.44,3131.52," because for the first time,"
3131.52,3134.24," there's actually a chance of them losing money of students,"
3134.24,3136.24, which necessarily means that they're less likely
3136.24,3137.88, to take on those low SES students.
3137.88,3140.86, Opposition can't rely on the vague words of social movements
3140.86,3142.58," and ignore the reality that in many cases,"
3142.58,3144.26, universities are discriminatory.
3144.26,3148.02," They ignore the fact that in many cases, they're likely to do things like look at your family,"
3148.26,3151.82," see how many of them are employed, look at your past, where you come from, the employability"
3151.82,3156.3," of your neighborhood. And that necessarily means that under opposition, even if in their best case"
3156.3,3161.12," they can prove that their degrees cost less money, we will explain that universities still turn away"
3161.12,3169.24, the people that opposition says that they will help and that also notably explains why their responses about speculative outreach are unlikely to come because
3169.24,3172.54, it's unlikely that universities go into neighborhoods with the hope that they will come
3172.54,3176.38, out with someone who is able to go to that University rather than just putting money in
3176.38,3180.22, students who are rich students who have connections students who they think are going to be most
3180.22,3184.84, employable which means that even in this opposition's best game where they perhaps prove that to some
3184.84,3187.68, extent their degrees are cheaper that is not a reason why the people
3187.68,3191.86, they want to access these degrees will get it. But the final problem with this argument is that
3191.86,3195.94," for the stakeholders opposition talked about, other factors exist other than money. For example,"
3196.1,3199.32," time, for the reason that you might need to do things like work and a family business,"
3199.52,3203.32," you might need to work right now, which means that you cannot do things like go to university,"
3203.56,3208.58," even if this opposition proves that the price is lower. So at the end of that, what do we know so far? It's only"
3208.58,3212.8, under our side where those degrees are cheaper. Even if this opposition can prove to some extent
3212.8,3216.92," that their degrees are cheaper, we have explained that those people who they want to benefit are"
3216.92,3221.6," likely to be rejected by these universities before they even get to the front door, meaning that even"
3221.6,3228.84," in their best case, we win. The second thing to talk about then here that they claim is about misogyny, which they say will stop in education and fathers will"
3228.84,3233.68, send their daughters to university. The reason why misogyny existed weren't because of uni fees. It
3233.68,3237.12, was because they believed that women shouldn't work and should stay in the household. It was
3237.12,3241.58, because they believed that they couldn't work in business and be successful. It's unclear why those
3241.58,3246.26," norms change under opposition, and they haven't explained that logical link at the end of that."
3246.26,3250.44," So what we know so far is that clearly under our side is more accessible, not only because"
3250.44,3254.24," it's cheaper, because universities don't have incentives to reject students before they"
3254.24,3255.68, get into the front door.
3255.68,3259.94, So the second question I'm going to talk about in this speech is how does it affect the quality
3259.94,3260.94, of university education?
3260.94,3263.94," But before that, I'll take a point if you've got one."
3263.94,3267.26, For a poor dad who wants to send his children to college
3267.26,3269.36," but can afford to do so for only one,"
3269.36,3270.66," why would they, for instance, pay"
3270.66,3272.96, six lakhs to send their daughter to college
3272.96,3275.48, when they can just send their son?
3275.48,3278.42, So I have firstly explained that if you're
3278.42,3280.56," someone who is misogynistic, that probably"
3280.56,3281.72, happens on both sides.
3281.72,3282.84, But the second thing I've explained
3282.84,3285.18, is that cost on your side is actually far greater.
3286.54,3288.5," But the third thing I've also explained is that even if you prove that the cost is lesser,"
3288.8,3290.62, many of these people you guys want to talk about
3290.62,3292.46, are likely to be rejected by these universities
3292.46,3293.94, because these universities believe
3293.94,3294.96," that they're not employable,"
3295.18,3296.08," because they don't have connection,"
3296.28,3297.64," because perhaps their parents are unemployed,"
3297.98,3299.56, because of other social factors that exist
3299.56,3301.28, that are incredibly discriminatory.
3301.56,3304.2, The only response this opposition says is social movements.
3304.44,3308.64, It's unclear how that translates into reality. We know for a fact that discrimination exists and this
3308.64,3312.72, opposition must confront it. So how does this affect the quality of university's education?
3312.72,3316.56, And notice that this is crucial because this affects literally every student in university
3316.56,3320.56, and therefore this is a benefit that multiplies to an enormous scale. It means that students who
3321.68,3325.24, want to study philosophy or the arts can no longer do that under opposition.
3325.54,3328.98, It means that law students are forced to things like corporate law rather than humanitarian
3328.98,3330.44, law that they have a passion for.
3330.62,3331.56, There are two points under this.
3331.64,3334.4, The first thing I'm going to look at is courses which will completely disappear.
3334.76,3337.06," And second, I'm going to talk about all other courses getting worse."
3337.34,3339.08," Firstly, on courses that completely disappear."
3339.52,3342.14, And this is an immediate harm that this opposition must confront.
3342.36,3348.42," Their only response is to say that these courses are dying anyway, to which I would note that this is mitigation at best that does not actually"
3348.42,3352.3, respond to the argument and is uncomparative to the extent that we still have these courses
3352.3,3357.36," as we do under the status quo, whereas this opposition doesn't at all. Their second line"
3357.36,3362.56," of attack is that they say that rich courses will become oversaturated, which we would explain that"
3362.56,3368.88," there are other courses which exist other than finance, like law, which these people are likely to be funneled towards, rather than the actual"
3368.88,3372.92, passions that they have that are now denied because these people cannot access them because
3372.92,3376.94, there is no money to go around and these courses are crushed. The second thing that I'm going to
3376.94,3381.34, talk about then here is all courses getting worse. And this is because there is less likely to be
3381.34,3389.2," broad focus in your degree, which necessarily means that you cut out many other important parts of university as we explained at first and second minimal response we"
3389.2,3393.44, explained firstly that there are social benefits of being at university that this university can
3393.44,3397.92, no longer afford we explained secondly that you perhaps lose broader conceptions of learning and
3397.92,3402.08, only focus specifically on employability even though that's something that's not beneficial
3402.08,3406.62, let's deal with their claims here firstly they say that universities will make their students most employable.
3406.92,3409.8, The first thing to say is that we think that opposition has a narrow conception
3409.8,3411.06, of what's good for students.
3411.3,3414.1, Because we would say that if you have less critical thinking skills
3414.1,3417.16," because you only focus on that degree, that is something that's actually bad."
3417.38,3420.76," The average person changes jobs many, many times in their life."
3420.94,3423.42, And that is something that means that opposition cannot rely on
3423.42,3428.68, narrow thinking skills in order to keep these people employable. But the same thing to note is that you don't get
3428.68,3433.38," to grow socially in an incredibly important part of your life. When you're 18 or 19 or 20,"
3433.68,3438.06," under a proper position, you have no capacity to do social activities because universities don't"
3438.06,3441.66," offer that, because they can't say that we have enough money to actually fund this because they"
3441.66,3448.0, don't know the salaries of their students once they finish their jobs. Their final line of attack in this debate is that they say that universities
3448.0,3452.24," care about you in the long term. That is unlikely because a trade-off exists, which is to say that"
3452.24,3456.72, universities would not prioritize speculative long-term benefits over direct benefits of
3456.72,3460.56," funneling money to students right now in the short term, which guarantees them money."
3460.56,3464.72," So at the end of this speech, what do you know? Our side is actually the one that makes university"
3464.72,3468.72, degrees cheaper. But even if you don't buy that and you believe that opposition is the
3468.72,3472.82," one that university degrees cheaper, we've explained that our degrees are not only better,"
3473.1,3476.46, but they're also likely to be accepted by the people that opposition wants to help.
3476.72,3513.38," So proud to propose. Thank you. Okay, we thank OpWeb for verifying speech."
3513.5,3515.64, Now let's move on to OpReply.
3516.6,3518.18," Yeah, since there's no POI,"
3518.32,3519.96," so there's no indication of one minute,"
3520.12,3521.26, but only three and four.
3521.38,3521.96, Thank you so much.
3523.68,3524.16, Perfect.
3526.6,3537.86," Can I get some indication that I'm audible? Yes, you are. Starting my reply in three, two, one. Two issues in this debate. The first,"
3537.98,3541.92," on who made university more accessible, particularly for people of lower socioeconomic status,"
3542.2,3547.92," and the second, on the quality of university, both for the students and the broader society that ended up accepting those graduates."
3548.7,3553.64," So firstly, on the matter of accessibility, Team India opened their case by telling you that this"
3553.64,3557.0," would lower the cost of universities, meaning there would be greater access, and that that"
3557.0,3561.0," would lead to things like greater equality for particularly protected groups, as well as social"
3561.0,3565.6, mobility. But they failed to then sufficiently respond to our analysis
3565.6,3571.06," about the fact that universities have to estimate risk, meaning that they had to charge a higher"
3571.06,3576.6, amount of money in total in any given year because they had to estimate things like inflation rises
3576.6,3580.54," and interest rises, that they were likely to overestimate those things because of the high"
3580.54,3589.12," risk that had greater consequences than underestimating, and because they had fixed commitment costs that they simply had to meet that meant that they were always going to have"
3589.12,3593.68, to charge a greater amount and that even if they didn't have to they were always going to anyway
3593.68,3598.08, meaning that the vast majority of people in propositions world were charged more
3598.08,3603.12, their main response to this which was that this is not as bad as student loans which have interest
3603.12,3609.04, rates and cumulative consequences should these not be paid. We responded to this entirely at second when we told you that because
3609.04,3613.52, universities and businesses they operate on the exact same set of incentives as banks do and that
3613.52,3617.36, they were just as likely to have policies like interest rates to have policies like punitive
3617.36,3622.4, damages when you were not able or refused to pay back this amount of money. So that was obviously a
3622.4,3629.36," symmetrical harm that they tried to take down this argument with. So at the end of that, student loans not only charged less money in total,"
3629.36,3634.56," meaning that they charge each individual student less on a one-to-one basis, but they also had far"
3634.56,3638.0," less risk involved, meaning that the interest rates they could charge were lower and the"
3638.0,3641.52," repayments they could charge were lower, meaning that overall we were the side that brought you"
3641.52,3648.68, more accessible university. A distinct and separate way we brought you more accessible university was the fact that because universities will not want
3648.68,3654.18," to risk having to give someone a degree for free under a propositions policy, that they will block"
3654.18,3658.28, individuals who have a low socioeconomic status out of admissions and that will exacerbate the
3658.28,3662.94, poverty cycle. India's only response to this was that universities will understand that the world
3662.94,3668.52," should be meritocratic and pick the best person to achieve the highest salary. And in this, managed to ignore almost"
3668.52,3672.6, every structural reason in society that this would simply realistically not be the case.
3672.9,3677.3, We outlined this succinctly at third when we told you that these individuals don't have the networks
3677.3,3681.52, from their school and from their parents. They have higher dropout rates because of the multiple
3681.52,3688.56, obligations that they have in their lives. And that universities have access to statistics like what neighborhoods people live in and what kind of parental income
3688.56,3692.56, they have that mean they are likely to make decisions on the discriminatory basis but even
3692.56,3698.0, if india is correct and they will actually be willing to take in some of those people we think
3698.0,3702.88, we explained to you down the bench why they were going to over commit themselves to pay this money
3702.88,3705.2, when an absolute loan always meant their financial
3705.2,3709.44, situation would be better because it was a clear amount at the end of that no matter which path you
3709.44,3714.24, took to get there we were the side that gave you more accessible university lastly on the secondary
3714.24,3718.8, issue of the quality of education they tell you that when universities have an incentive to teach
3718.8,3722.56, degrees to get graduates employed they will make their degrees more employable and this will be
3722.56,3728.96, better they also you like this same incentive analysis is used by us to prove that now universities only offer
3728.96,3733.36, employable course types and within those courses only offer very narrow subsets of what that
3733.36,3737.76, education can be and we explain why that's so damaging for individuals mental health to
3737.76,3743.04, increasing dropout rates the professions dying out within society and creating worse learning overall
3743.04,3748.06, their response to this if the universities will instead make courses employable. We tell you that universities will
3748.06,3751.94, likely take the easiest road out and that looks far more like cutting out programs and adding
3751.94,3757.12, new ones. They also tell you that market saturation will fix the specific industry problem. But as we
3757.12,3762.1," tell you down the bench, even if that pressure exists and changes what kind of industry it is"
3762.1,3765.6," focusing on, the pressure nevertheless exists for graduates to do something"
3765.6,3768.56," which they are not interested in, which they are not necessarily skilled at."
3768.72,3770.72," That was incredibly damaging for their mental health,"
3770.84,3772.84, and it was harmful to society's productivity
3772.84,3775.12, when individuals weren't going into careers that they were good at
3775.12,3776.08, or interested in.
3776.08,3779.44," At the end of that, they also lost any aspect of the student experience"
3779.6,3782.88, when universities only had an incentive to focus on graduate employment
3782.88,3783.72, and salary.
3783.72,3789.18," At the end of that, we think that our education was one that helped students mental health and help society but if"
3789.18,3792.78, not for that it was one that all people in the world could access and that was practically and
3792.78,3810.76," principally why we won this debate okay uh we thank oppositionly for fine speech. Now let's invite last speaker, Government Reply, to close the entire debate."
3810.76,3825.16," Hi, just checking that I'm both audible and visible again. Yes."
3825.56,3837.08, Perfect.
3842.18,3842.68," Speaker, all of opposition's case in this debate is contingent on universities having no funding."
3849.98,3854.2," Their argument on not taking minorities, their argument on cutting departments, and the majority of their case depend on this. However, there are very simple responses to that that we've been running since first that they just don't seem"
3854.2,3859.9," to want to respond to. First, we just need 15 to 20 kids from this class to do really, really well"
3859.9,3864.96," because that is massive amounts of money that you get in the form of royalty, money you can use to"
3864.96,3869.68," cross-subsidize for poor students, and it's far greater than money that you'll make off of just"
3869.68,3874.64, random tuition fees we think that we push this down to you down the line and it is appalling
3874.64,3880.32, that this is unresponded to even after we bring it up at first second and third but we think that
3880.32,3886.02," the point of which that is true about that their of their case is just untrue. But second, what is more likely?"
3886.54,3890.78," Governments not stepping in when universities charge 70% royalties,"
3890.9,3894.12," which is quite frankly appalling, wild, and exploitative,"
3894.44,3897.64," or them using all the money that goes towards scholarships,"
3897.96,3899.66," that goes towards subsidies right now,"
3899.78,3903.16, and using them to give universities cushions and security loans.
3903.16,3909.44," This is the model that we've been running since first. It is just appalling that they don't adapt to it. Bearing that in mind,"
3909.68,3914.46," two questions. First, on which side makes universities more accessible? Second, on which"
3914.46,3919.72," side allows the students to gain more out of university? On the first question, our side"
3919.72,3927.36, uniquely gives the most vulnerable students a foot in the door. The reason this is true is because you don't have to deal with the upfront costs.
3927.36,3930.08," And contrary to what they tell you, and as Hitesh Shah says,"
3930.08,3932.96, the reason women aren't being sent to university right now
3932.96,3936.16, isn't because of sexist norms telling them to stay home at work.
3936.16,3941.2," Rather, it is sexist norms believing that their son can probably do more with that degree."
3941.2,3943.76," At the point at which there's no bar to getting that degree,"
3943.76,3947.92, that's the point at which you can also benefit off of your daughter going to uni. That's when you send
3947.92,3952.36," women to school. That's when we are far better for a very vulnerable stakeholder, as Hitesha"
3952.36,3957.4," explains. But crucially, at the point at which vulnerable people get their foot in the door,"
3957.78,3961.88, all of the benefits second opposition preaches can only exist on our side of the house.
3962.2,3965.04," Any shot of social mobility, as we've told you down the case, can only exist on our side of the house. Any shot of social mobility, as we've told you down the case,"
3968.44,3968.86, can only exist on our side because more people are going to university.
3972.02,3972.24, This will wait past literally anything that they tell you in this round.
3975.18,3975.42," Because even in our absolute worst case, if sure,"
3978.04,3980.9," you teach more computer science than you do philosophy, at the point at which people still get university degrees,"
3981.14,3983.76," at the point at which people still have a shot at social mobility,"
3984.02,3990.04," we still take it over their very, very marginal harms. Second, let's just take a second to compare"
3990.04,3996.98," student loans with royalty. What is a royalty? If my income goes down, I still pay my 2% and I am"
3996.98,4002.46," not punished. On a student loan, if my income ever drops, because as we all know, labor markets are"
4002.46,4005.8," very, very competitive, I have my single mother's"
4005.8,4011.8, home seized if I default. My bank won't lend to me ever again because they view me as untrustworthy.
4012.16,4016.62," We think that is punitive, toxic, and deeply harmful to be most vulnerable individuals"
4016.62,4022.44," in this society. On the second question then, I think that winning that one cash in and of itself"
4022.44,4026.6, gives us a massive independent factor victory and puts us above Australia.
4026.86,4029.46, But I'm just going to win on both fronts for the fun of it.
4029.74,4032.02," Second, on universities being better."
4032.52,4034.08," First, contrary to what they say"
4034.08,4036.24," on only rich white people being taken up,"
4036.52,4038.7, we think that the point at which you look at your demographics
4038.7,4041.58," and there's only like top 1-2% white people,"
4041.76,4042.86, that's when you are regulated.
4043.16,4044.2, That's when you are critiqued.
4044.2,4049.42, This is what Karthik tells you in a second that goes drastically unresponded to on their side of the
4049.42,4055.06, house but if anything why are we far better first as I told you in my first speech you are more
4055.06,4060.7, likely to go into poor communities to find diamonds in the rough people who are brown or black who you
4060.7,4067.12, can crucially do things like train and profit offer on the comparative the problem is that you never go into these communities in the first place
4067.12,4069.08, because they can't pay your high fees.
4069.32,4073.7," We think that on our side of the house, we give the most vulnerable communities a foot in the door"
4073.7,4076.32, by crucially ensuring that outreach exists.
4076.54,4079.3," At the end of this round, we've taken the two most important clashes."
4079.62,4082.16, We've proven to you why the premise of our case doesn't stand
4082.16,4085.44, and take it over Australia in this debate vote gov
4093.84,4098.08, thank you all debaters for a highly competitive round and high quality as well
4098.64,4106.36, congratulations on both sides so in the meantime please cross virtual room have handshakes and even if we cannot meet
4106.36,4111.68, each other in person thank you so much thank you so much
4111.68,4116.2, that's great seeing you guys again too do you guys
