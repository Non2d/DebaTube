0.0,7.72, So the motion before this house is this house would allow ex-convicts to apply to join the workforce.
8.24,12.22," And with that, I invite the first speaker of the proposition to open the case for the government side."
12.22,19.46," Hi, just another reminder, I'd prefer POIs in the chat, please. Thank you."
21.68,27.58, For too long have vulnerable communities been terrorized by the police. The murders of George
27.58,32.96," Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many others have shown the depth of this issue. There is a fundamental"
32.96,38.34, disconnect between the communities that the officers have sworn to protect and the officers
38.34,43.18, themselves. It is time to bridge that gap and get a constructive police force that can actually
43.18,50.5," solve crime rather than perpetuate it. Before I move into some points of framing, what is our model? Note that this motion"
50.5,55.58, is simply about allowing ex-convicts to apply. What this means is that they will still go through
55.58,59.44," an application process. This looks like, for instance, having to meet general requirements,"
59.68,63.52," whether that be physical, whether that be about your education background or a psychological"
63.52,68.68, evaluation or just extra background checks in general. This also means you're likely to go through an interview
68.68,73.32, to see your character. So if you're someone who was convicted of racist hate crimes and your
73.32,76.9," general attitude hasn't changed, we think you probably still wouldn't be desirable for the"
76.9,81.72," police force. Secondly, who do we think is going to apply under this motion? We tell you for the"
81.72,88.22," most heinous crimes, think of, for instance, mass murder, your sentence is likely to be too long to the point in which by the time you've served your"
88.22,93.58," sentence, you're probably too old to apply to be part of the police force. Thus, we think it is"
93.58,97.62," generally ex-convicts who probably committed less serious crimes. This looks like for instance,"
97.88,102.98, petty theft or drug-related crimes in which they still have a lot of time after they've gone out
102.98,105.74," of jail. The third point of framing,"
106.06,110.28," why do we think convicts will apply? We tell you this is for two reasons. Firstly, in the status"
110.28,115.1," quo, as an ex-convict, you already have limited options once you've served time, largely due to"
115.1,120.42," social stigma. But secondly, we tell you as an ex-convict, you have incentives to probably want"
120.42,124.16," to help individuals within your community. For instance, it could be kids from your neighborhood"
124.16,126.76," or others who went to high school with you, so we think that there's general"
126.76,131.4," incentives for ex-convicts to want to apply. Before I move into our argumentation, I want to"
131.4,136.92," push two points of framing. Firstly, as side proposition, we believe in the principles of"
136.92,141.64," rehabilitation, that once individuals have paid their debts to society, whether that is through"
141.64,149.86," serving time in prison or facing other consequences, we don't think you should be further punished. The status quo is one in which ex-convicts are still punished"
149.86,154.36," even after they serve their time. We think that is simply unjust. But secondly, we think another"
154.36,159.04, problem with the status quo is that there's just a large disconnect between the police force and
159.04,163.16, the most disenfranchised communities. This tends to look like the most vulnerable communities to
163.16,167.52," committing crimes. This looks like, for instance, more impoverished neighborhoods and what we see happening"
167.52,173.12, is police who tend to implement aggressive and demeaning tactics this looks like racial profiling
173.12,177.84, the whole concept of stop and frisk where you search people you deem as suspicious usually
177.84,182.72, those individuals of color and honest and in general just being demeaning and aggressive in
182.72,185.36, your behaviors talking to individuals within
185.36,190.92, these communities in a condescending manner we tell you that is the problem we as proposition
190.92,197.64, aim to address before i move on i'll take a point on your side of the house ex-convicts are not only
197.64,201.66, just people that have committed a crime but have gone to prison for that crime these are not petty
201.66,210.04," crimes they have to be decently violent in most states. Look, I don't think this is true. In the status quo, oftentimes you likely overpunish someone."
210.26,214.28, You see oftentimes people who have committed drug-related crimes who end up going to prison
214.28,219.68," for way too long. We think that's just, we think your framing is not related to the reality. Okay,"
219.98,224.76," in our speech then, why do we think ex-convicts have valuable contributions to the police force?"
225.08,228.18," Firstly, what are the unique experiences of ex-convicts?"
228.28,229.58, We tell you there are three things here.
229.88,233.9," Firstly, they are more knowledgeable about the reasons why people commit crimes."
234.1,236.7, They have been put in a position where they had to commit crimes.
236.7,243.56," For example, as an individual who grew up impoverished, who are then forced to, for instance, deal drugs within your neighborhood,"
243.76,249.1, you're more likely to understand the psychological reasoning behind why one individual do that.
249.44,254.16," Secondly, we see oftentimes ex-convicts already come from high crime areas where communities are"
254.16,259.54, systematically disenfranchised and disproportionately targeted by police. What this means is they're
259.54,263.68, likely familiar with people already within the neighborhood. They understand the relationships
263.68,269.96," within these communities. Thirdly, we see convict what is what it's like to be on the other side of"
269.96,274.4, the law they've been in a position where they've been labeled as outcasts of society they've been
274.4,278.84, deemed evil by the public they've been told they don't deserve second chances where any last shred
278.84,283.82, of dignity has been destroyed we tell you these people fundamentally understand the mindsets of
283.82,288.04, criminals then why do we think then these skills are lacking in the average police officer?
288.26,289.82, We tell you there are three reasons to this.
290.12,298.52," Firstly, the average police officer have these work incentives to get as many convictions as possible, for instance, for promotion, because they want to get to a higher level."
298.9,302.02," Secondly, we tell you oftentimes there exists a toxic police culture."
302.26,309.02," This is the idea of being as tough on crime as possible. Look at, for instance, in the United States, where you have incarceration rates that continue to grow"
309.02,314.46," like almost exponentially. Thirdly, we tell you due to the current disconnect, as we've established"
314.46,319.0," in a problem push, you're just unlikely to be able to relate to committing a crime or what it's like"
319.0,323.46," to be a criminal to be put in that position. What this means is that for the average police officer,"
323.46,330.82," there is a massive disconnect, but also large incentives for you to treat the average person in a terrible manner."
331.16,335.62, Why do we think then that ex-convicts have very valuable skills? We tell you this is for three
335.62,340.36," reasons. Firstly, they're likely to be more empathetic. Note that even if there is a toxic"
340.36,348.4," police culture, the fact that you have different experiences from these other police means that you're less likely to buy into that toxic police culture this means you're less likely"
348.4,353.92, to charge someone with a small crime this means that you're more likely to be able to approach
353.92,358.32, people with an understanding instead of directly blaming them note that this is what allows for
358.32,363.2, more constructive solutions this is what changes in the tone on how you talk to individuals or
363.2,366.46, even how you treat individuals and such.
366.84,369.0," Secondly, we tell you you're more likely to have insider information."
369.98,375.26," Note that this helps both in the way in which you interact with the community, because, for instance, you may have less of a culture shock."
375.44,379.82," You understand how individuals cooperate or work, but also in finding criminals."
380.2,385.2," But thirdly, note that even if we do not have a ton of ex-convicts in the police force,"
387.92,388.18, you can change other police officers' mindsets as well.
389.08,389.38, This is in two ways.
391.86,392.06," Firstly, note that if your colleague that you see every day,"
395.8,395.94," the person that you share morning coffees with every day is an ex-convict,"
398.06,398.42," but this person has shown you nothing but compassion,"
401.9,402.32, you as a police officer is more likely to change that mindset.
404.36,404.38," But secondly, we tell you that as ex-convicts,"
408.9,412.96, you're probably going to reach a certain point where you also share your story with other police officers or with your colleagues. What this then means is you're also likely to open their minds
412.96,418.7, up to different understandings of why people commit crimes. Why do we think then this is also
418.7,422.68, able to change the perception of the general public? We tell you the general public already
422.68,427.98," has existing trust of the police that tends to be quite strong and difficult to change. But even if you have some distrust,"
428.22,431.92," being able to see that the police continues to function properly, even after this motion is"
431.92,435.76," passed, will probably wash away your doubt. But more importantly, why is this better for"
435.76,440.62," communities vulnerable to committing crimes? We tell you this is for two reasons. Firstly,"
440.8,449.0," there's more trust. As we've already said, the police force is likely to send certain police officers to areas they are familiar with, given that they have a better understanding."
449.0,454.0," For such communities, you're more likely to trust someone that went through the same experience as you."
454.0,461.0, This is important because oftentimes these are the very communities that are most reluctant to report crimes in their area because they fear the police.
461.0,466.42," In our world, when you are in trouble, regardless of which neighborhood you come from, you're less likely to be scared to call the police."
466.62,470.92, You're likely to be more cooperative and more comfortable talking to police during interrogation.
471.34,475.1," Secondly, we tell you for these communities, they'll likely experience less police violence."
475.1,483.08," This is for two reasons. A, because these police officers are just less likely to react violently since they understand about criminals and what it's like to be on the other side."
483.3,489.76," But B, they're also less likely to be scared, which means they're less likely to react irrationally or react in the spur of the moment."
490.08,493.3, Why do we think that these communities are the most important groups?
493.8,500.08," Even at best for proposition in the short term, people may be apprehensive about ex-convict police officers."
500.14,505.32," Even then, we think it is most important for vulnerable communities to improve their relationships with the police."
505.58,508.54, This is because they are the ones who are most likely to interact with the police.
508.78,511.44, These are the ones who need the protection of the police the most.
511.62,512.94, I'm so proud to propose.
517.88,523.6," Thank you, First Speaker, on the proposition and invite the first opposition speaker to present the opposition case."
523.6,565.34, Here you go. and invite the first opposition speaker to present the opposition case. Here. All right. Am I perfectly audible? Awesome. that affect police departments. But it was very unclear to me why hiring a couple more ex-conflicts
565.34,567.18, was gonna solve the structural issues
567.18,569.04, that exists in police departments.
569.04,570.78," The massive levels of corruption,"
570.78,572.32, the endemic levels of racism
572.32,574.74, that were constantly gonna be applied to minorities.
574.74,576.62, They never gave us any structural analysis
576.62,578.32, why these ex-conflicts were gonna be able
578.32,580.38, to internally reform police departments.
580.38,582.38," So if anything, on their side of the house,"
582.38,584.22, it was gonna be business as usual.
584.22,588.28, We're gonna prove to you why the harms they get are going to completely outweigh any of the
588.28,593.28, marginal benefits they get about increasing things like empathy. I want to begin with some levels of
593.28,597.82," framing. First of all, I want to note that this policy is principally legitimate, that in plenty"
597.82,604.0," of other jobs, people use things like background checks and psychiatrics checks to filter out who"
604.0,606.12, actually gets a job. And I think the same thing
606.12,611.18," applies here because ex-convicts have a high propensity to break things like laws, which is"
611.18,615.42, why police officers don't actually hire them to the force. The same thing applies for things like
615.42,619.76," education, because it's very possible that someone that committed a sex crime could have reformed"
619.76,624.02," themselves. But these are the kind of people that you don't want around children, which is why you"
624.02,625.86, don't hire these people to the education force.
626.28,630.6," Second of all, we don't think that the only job that convicts could get is entering the police force."
630.7,636.2," We supported other means of helping out these ex-convicts, whether that be rehabilitation and job training."
636.54,649.16," Additionally, we think there's a movement across the world in the status quo to push for reforms on law enforcement to solve back for police brutality and ensure things like accountability. Finally, I want to note that they try to like make it seem like, oh, these are just"
649.16,653.8, some people that commit petty thefts. This is not true. Ex-convicts are people that directly go to
653.8,657.9, jail. So we think this actually does include things like serious crimes. It's not just crimes
657.9,662.2," of possession, things like assaults and drug dealing. It has to be people that go to prison."
662.48,667.86," The final piece thing, like the final thing I want to respond to here is they're like, there's going to be things like character checks. I would argue"
667.86,671.7, it's very difficult to evaluate things like character and things like implicit biases.
672.02,676.26, These things already fail in the status quo. Let's respond to their specific claims. The first claim
676.26,681.2, that they gave you is that these police officers would be very like empathetic and less brutal to
681.2,685.16," individuals in minority communities. Number one, I would argue that these ex-convicts"
685.16,687.32," are likely to get corrupted by justice systems,"
687.58,689.12, that they were likely to be pushed on
689.12,690.68," by the people that are at the,"
691.14,692.98," they were likely to get radicalized, no thank you,"
693.1,694.72, which would inherently change them
694.72,697.34, to continue pushing for these brutal policies.
697.54,698.74," If anything, we would argue"
698.74,700.34, that they are likely to overcorrect
700.34,701.54, and act even more abusive
701.54,704.3, in order to get legitimacy within the police department
704.3,709.24, and not be viewed as someone that like is negative against the police department.
709.58,713.88," Second of all, I would argue that these kinds of structural reforms, i.e. how you treat different"
713.88,719.48," people, how you do investigations is not decided by the average police officer. It's instead decided"
719.48,724.1, by like the police lieutenant and the sheriffs. It was very unlikely that ex-convicts were going
724.1,728.94, to be able to get all the way to the top levels of police departments. This was something that was very
728.94,733.74," undesirable. Finally, I think there's other ways of interacting with your community. Plenty of"
733.74,737.54," police departments realize that there's a disconnect with their community, so they do"
737.54,741.46," things like community outreach policies, youth development, different things like that. That's"
741.46,747.78, all possible on our side of the house. The next thing that they tell you is that this will change the minds of police officers. I don't think this
747.78,752.7," is true. Police officers are basically indoctrinated to view convicts as criminals, as people that are"
752.7,757.26," negative and society. No, thank you. Just because they have one new coworker does not mean that"
757.26,761.78, they're like that they magically become less violent against people that are criminals.
762.16,768.1," Finally, I would argue that they make an argument about minority trust. But I think minorities, even if they see that a criminal and a drug dealer is now"
768.1,771.8," in the police force, that doesn't mean they're more likely to trust police officers. They still"
771.8,775.72," view police officers as negatively, as police officers have a history of disproportionately"
775.72,779.66, incarcerating them. It was very unlikely they would solve for this. Let's move on to our
779.66,783.66, substantive material. Our first substantive argument is why ex-convicts are simply worse
783.66,789.66," police officers. What are the powers of police officers? Number one, they have enforcement powers. They control"
789.66,794.04," how laws are being applied and who gets punished. Secondly, they have legal protection, things like"
794.04,798.04," qualified immunity, given they have the purview and they're being glorified. Third of all, they"
798.04,802.08," have direct powers. They have access to things like weaponry, which they can use in self-defense."
802.44,809.34," Why was it harmful then for ex-convicts to be police officers? Three reasons. Number one is corruption. Even after jail, convicts still have"
809.34,813.6," criminal connections. They likely grew up in an environment of crime. And when they went to jail,"
813.6,817.7, they had to join gangs in order to ensure protections. This probably causes them to have
817.7,822.58," obligated debts they have to pay back. No, thank you to criminal groups. This was problematic,"
822.94,829.04," A, because it would lead to complacency. These convicts were likely to fear retribution and let crime pass this was very"
829.04,833.2, problematic in places like mexico and brazil where there were cartels present and people would fear
833.2,838.08, retribution and attacks if they were aligned with their cartel secondly it causes them to cut
838.08,842.0, corners these are individuals that have already broken the law which means they're less likely to
842.0,847.6," have trust for the law and respect for it. That means that when they're solving crimes, they're much more likely to cut corners and do"
847.6,852.36, things like prematurely detain people or falsify evidence. And due to state failure and reasons why
852.36,856.72," prisons cause mental health conditions and they don't provide proper rehabilitation, they're more"
856.72,860.92, likely to be desensitized to things like violence and more likely to resort to violence when they're
860.92,868.86," enforcing crime. The final thing is that the kind of ex-convicts that get hired have perverse incentives. Because at the end of the day, the majority of convicts"
868.86,873.5, distrust the police. They probably don't like the police at all. So who are the people that
873.5,877.02, are likely going to apply to the police departments? It's the people who want power
877.02,882.0," and control, who want to use the police force to punish their adversaries, i.e. these looks like"
882.0,888.52," white supremacists that are joining the police force to go against minorities. So on their side of the house, you saw a massive increase in crime"
888.52,892.62," and a lower quality of criminal enforcement. Before I move on to the second substantive,"
892.76,897.44, I can take a point if there is one. Your very analysis of how ex-convicts will still be
897.44,902.38, committing crimes only emphasizes our points of stigmatization against ex-convicts. How do you
902.38,909.0," solve this problem? I don't really see how it changes anything about stigmatization, right? Like people in either world are still going to be"
909.0,913.62, viewing criminals and ex-convicts as being stigmatized. I'll explain more of this in my
913.62,917.58, second substantive. Our second substantive is about the public reaction. This takes them at
917.58,922.32, their best ground and argues that like what's most important is the perception of the criminal
922.32,928.0, justice system. There are three reasons why people are going to have negative views of ex-convicts being hired to police forces.
928.3,933.64," Number one, there's a stigma of ex-convicts. Convicts are viewed as people who are menaces society and an evil."
933.9,938.64," So in television, convicts are dramatized as being harmful to society and doing very negative things."
938.88,943.46," Additionally, many people have personal experiences with criminals, which is like very traumatic."
943.82,949.58," So, for example, they may have a personal possession that was stolen, or they may experience some trauma due to crime. Second of all,"
949.7,952.92," the types of people that are getting hired are likely well known in the local community,"
953.16,956.86," because as they tell you themselves, it's the same convicts that committed crimes in the community"
956.86,961.26, that are now coming back and serving on the force. This is going to cause people to become very angry
961.26,969.04, when someone that was a notorious gang member or criminal that is now getting on a police force third of all it would lead to media essentially it would lead to the
969.04,974.4, media to cause like more extremism and essentially blow this up because what the media would say is
974.4,978.0, the same people who are robbing you the same people that are getting committing crimes are
978.0,982.4, now getting the guns and enforcing the law so even if there were some success stories the media will
982.4,988.92, dramatize this drug dealer that committed negative things finally being able to get on the force. This was very likely in places
988.92,993.92," like New York and in major cities where crime is rising, which means that hiring people like"
993.92,998.78, ex-convicts was incredibly controversial and likely to cause massive levels of public backlash.
998.78,1004.18," This had two impacts. Number one, it was bad for ex-convicts themselves. Massive levels of public"
1004.18,1008.52, backlash against this effort will cause people to like criminals a lot less and be less sympathetic.
1008.92,1012.4," So number one, you see more draconian measures like mandatory minimums."
1012.56,1018.92, What people actually do is that they keep ex-convicts in jail longer to prevent them from actually getting into the police force.
1019.2,1025.32," Second of all, it causes less societal support for things like rehab and rehiring because of the public retaliation"
1025.32,1029.16," against this measure. Second of all, this is bad for criminal enforcement. If people see that"
1029.16,1033.26," criminals are getting in the police force, they lose trust in the police and the police lose"
1033.26,1037.94, legitimacy. You need trust in the criminal justice system for it to work. You need people to report
1037.94,1042.44, crimes in order for them to get solved. You need eyewitnesses as trials in order to verify that
1042.44,1045.04, crimes actually happen. if you bought at the
1045.04,1048.34, highest ground on their side of the house and you got good officers if the public perception
1048.34,1051.94, went down the criminal justice system could never perform properly thank you
1057.94,1061.54, I'm thank you for speaker of the opposition and invite the
1061.54,1085.84," second proposition speaker to continue the case for the proposition side here hi I'm just going to presume I'm so audible I'd like PYs in the chat, please, as a reminder, and then I'll start my speech."
1088.5,1092.14, Opposition wants us to solve every single problem which has ever existed in the police force.
1092.48,1096.18," Sure, I guess, we concede, we won't solve everything. However, in certain specific"
1096.18,1100.18," instances, since yes, we agree, there will be very few instances in which convicts are likely"
1100.18,1104.08, to be hired by police officers. Those convicts are likely to be the ones that are going to make
1104.08,1108.88, the difference. A couple of things then. first thing in terms of rebuttal three things
1108.88,1112.84, one in terms of the point about it being illegitimate I think this was rebuttal but
1112.84,1116.5, I'm worried that they're going to frame it as an own substantive later so basically they'll say
1116.5,1121.66, it's uh uh illegitimate to hire these people as police officers since they're likely to break laws
1121.66,1126.02, uh the problem here is uh you apply the same standard to everyone. So for
1126.02,1131.46," instance, if this specific ex-convict is more likely than any other police officer to commit"
1131.46,1138.18," a crime, to engage in corruption, do you already have existing tests which try to capture those"
1138.18,1142.8, kinds of things? So it's not like we're going to let any random ex-convict in. It's already in
1142.8,1145.58," first. Note, I do know there's a response there, but I'm going to get to that in a bit."
1145.82,1146.44," But first I want to,"
1146.62,1147.6, because first I want to respond
1147.6,1148.7, to their two substantive arguments.
1148.92,1150.84, The first is about worst police officers.
1151.06,1152.62," Before I go on, I'll take a POI."
1154.54,1155.84," On your side of the house,"
1155.84,1158.58," the checks of, oh, going through an interview process"
1158.58,1160.34, are most likely to weed out people
1160.34,1163.42, who are like perceived more likely to be less friendly.
1163.58,1171.18," For example, minorities in the first place. Your role world is predisposed for people in power with guns um okay so that's completely"
1171.18,1174.14, symmetrical i'm not quite sure how you're going to solve for that on your side of the house but
1174.14,1177.2, also without your biggest impact when you talk about like literal white supremacists who are
1177.2,1181.56, going to now come into the police officer uh police office firstly in terms of worst police
1181.56,1188.12, officers there's three reasons for this the first is about corruption three things here one i think this is going to happen on either side of the house
1188.12,1191.56, the reason why there's going to be corruption isn't because one police officer randomly decides
1191.56,1196.48, they're going to leak information or going to go to change plans or whatever is because like for
1196.48,1201.8, instance the cartel or some kind of gang is going to come up to you and give you a bribe to act in
1201.8,1205.98, some kind of corrupt corrupt way or because in your own personal incentive to do so.
1206.12,1209.98, So we think those kinds of bribes and those kinds of personal incentives exist on either side of
1209.98,1214.04," the house. But secondly, we think it's specifically less likely that these police officers are going"
1214.04,1217.78," to be offered bribes and things like that. Why? Because when, for instance, it becomes apparent"
1217.78,1221.02," that there's a mole in a police department, it's always going to be the ex-convicts which are going"
1221.02,1225.44, to be investigated first. If I'm a cartel or a gang or
1225.44,1230.02," property mafia or whatever, those are the kinds of people that you don't want to give bribes to."
1230.36,1234.3," Thirdly and lastly, I think these officers specifically, because of their own mechanism"
1234.3,1238.74," about having to overcompensate, are likely to be the ones to call out corruption when they see it."
1238.9,1242.06, Because those are the police officers which need to prove that they are the ones which are going
1242.06,1247.3," to be played by the rules, since the existing prejudice will be that they are unlikely to follow the law. So those are"
1247.3,1251.4, uniquely the kinds of police officers who are most likely to call out corruption and to call
1251.4,1255.52," out bad behavior when it happens. Secondly, they say that they are more likely to be violent because"
1255.52,1261.08," you're desensitized to violence while you're in prison. Sure, that's true to an extent, but it's"
1261.08,1268.76, not completely true. The reason that you are desensitized to violence is because it happened so many times to you so sure right now if someone inflicts pain upon you
1268.76,1272.12, that will hurt relatively less than before you went through the experience of jail but still
1272.12,1276.5, it hurts now but more importantly you remember that that experience was it was torture so I
1276.5,1280.4, think people are uniquely less likely to want to be violent explicitly because they've been the one
1280.4,1284.18, on the side of the beatings the vast majority of other police officers come from more privileged
1284.18,1287.44, backgrounds they come from more conservative communities where they've never had that kind
1287.44,1293.04, of exposure to the violence they're committing to people thirdly they say that people who want
1293.04,1298.48, to punish others will be the ones to apply like for instance white supremacists white supremacists
1298.48,1301.76, firstly i think it's unlikely that they're going to get through the checks and balances that we
1301.76,1306.36," give secondly even if they pass those, we think still police officers are unlikely"
1306.36,1308.36, to want to explicitly hire white supremacists.
1308.66,1310.9," Why? Because firstly, that's incredibly bad press"
1310.9,1312.98, for your police office to the extent
1312.98,1314.76," that you're not only just hiring an ex-convict,"
1314.9,1316.92," but specifically someone who's also a white supremacist,"
1316.96,1318.88, which is kind of a hot issue right now.
1319.14,1320.9," Secondly, because apart from the fact"
1320.9,1321.86," that you're just hiring that person,"
1322.08,1324.3," that radically increases the chance that you get,"
1324.4,1326.14," for instance, a number of instances like George Floyd,"
1326.38,1330.46, which led to the police office almost getting defunded across the United States.
1330.68,1338.18," I think there are unique incentives as to why individuals who are uniquely likely to want to cause harm upon others like white supremacists are unlikely to be the ones who are allowed in,"
1338.46,1342.86, even if you ignore our mechanism of how current systems are likely to correct for it already.
1343.34,1345.52," Secondly, they say people will uh"
1349.68,1354.4, will hate them and be very distrustful of the peace uh by the way no thank you to those poys uh the firstly they say two things they say people dislike criminals broadly and the media will
1354.4,1359.2, likely want to blow it up two things here one we think it's unlikely given that they say that our
1359.2,1364.4, impact is incredibly marginal if there are like three ex-convicts in like a state or whatever
1364.4,1365.76, we uh who become part of the
1365.76,1370.48, uh the police office it's unlikely that it seems like media is going to want to blow that up
1370.48,1374.08, specifically because it's very hard to thank you to to find those kinds of incidents and
1375.28,1379.44, in which you can blow it up to a significant issue so blm starts getting traction in which
1379.44,1384.56, there are wide-scale public incidents of police of police abusing black people in america we tell
1384.56,1385.12, you at the moment
1385.12,1389.2, in which the scale is radically reduced to which they do themselves then you get less of these
1389.2,1393.52, instances that means that it's less profitable profitable and likely that the media media is
1393.52,1397.68, going to want to blow these things up secondly we think our best is incredibly short-termist
1397.68,1400.96, so sure in the short run individuals are going to be confronted by the fact that they're
1400.96,1404.48, ex-convicts in the police over the long term it can become something which is normalized something
1404.48,1406.66, which you don't actively think about because it's hard to think about these
1406.66,1410.84, things in every single life and people will grow up and new generations will grow up with this
1410.84,1414.86, being the norm already already and secondly because the media doesn't cover the same story
1414.86,1419.3, stories for months upon months upon some months especially when it has such an incredibly small
1419.3,1424.48, impact as these things lastly in terms of they say firstly this means that when people dislike
1424.48,1425.6, dislike ex-convicts that means that when people dislike uh dislike x
1425.6,1430.08, comics that means that they're less of less sympathy to convicts in general this is strange
1430.08,1434.56, because this is kind of search for reasoning they say people dislike convicts therefore they dislike
1434.56,1440.48, comics in the police therefore they dislike comics in gen in gen in general people who already dislike
1440.48,1450.12," convicts don't see this delta delta then. But secondly, they say they're more likely to want to retaliate against convicts and like, I guess, make prisons even worse. Firstly, I'm unsure"
1450.12,1454.28," exactly why that's going to be the case. Secondly, I'm unsure why this would be such a big issue that"
1454.28,1457.7, people are going to be changing their votes and deciding their votes and polls are going to be
1457.7,1461.94," asking these kinds of questions. So overall, I think this was specifically in terms of operating"
1461.94,1468.56," on a national political level, this was kind of a reach for side opposition. What's what's our case then firstly i want to start with our version of this argument which is"
1468.56,1473.36, significantly better because we don't try to make our impacts too big our case is simply that in
1473.36,1477.6, smaller local communities we're more likely to get ex-convicts who are able to bridge the gap
1477.6,1482.32, between communities their police officers what do they say what do they say they say that uh
1482.32,1485.74, all the other problems as to why communities distrust
1485.74,1492.2, their police still exist firstly we explain in our we explain where this has a crossover effect
1492.2,1497.4, where other police officers are likely to engage in better behavior as well but secondly also note
1497.4,1502.0, that that may be true you may distrust all police officers except the one that you know well enough
1502.0,1507.92, and well enough and are able to connect you on a personal level that still means that you're more confident in calling the police and calling that
1507.92,1512.08, police officer specifically when you need them secondly know that they never engage with the
1512.08,1515.84, mechanism about less police values they just say oh that's a structural problem that you can fix
1515.84,1522.48, the problem here is that hiring police officers is zero sum so police police police officers
1522.48,1527.72, police precincts have specific budgets which are set up by the government so that they can spend on employing police officers.
1528.0,1531.56," That means if they choose to hire one person, that means that they're not going to use that spot for anyone else."
1531.56,1540.36," So when we prove that ex-convicts are uniquely less likely to engage in structural violence, that means that overall we lose a person who would be significantly more likely."
1540.62,1544.76," So in likelihood, we get less police violence in local communities."
1545.28,1550.08," Therefore, we get less distrust. Then in terms of of that certain ex-convicts make excellent police officers"
1550.08,1554.56, all they say is that character character checks are failed in the status quo one we would contend
1554.56,1558.0, this and say that in the status quo they're quite good specifically because there has been a massive
1558.0,1562.16, amount of states to control the amount of people and uh to control the kinds of people which get
1562.16,1566.06," into police officer offices but secondly especially for ex-convicts,"
1566.06,1568.98, there's some extra incentives for police proceedings
1568.98,1571.22," to be extra, extra careful."
1571.58,1573.4, They then say that you're going to overcompensate
1573.4,1574.3, by being very abusive.
1574.64,1575.96, This doesn't engage with an analysis.
1576.34,1578.8," As an ex-convict, you know what it's like to be put through the system."
1579.06,1580.84, You know what it's like to get beatings in jail
1580.84,1582.66, and by the police on the street.
1582.94,1587.74, That's why you're less likely to engage in these kinds of things when you're a police officer. That's why these are better police officers
1587.74,1598.6, than you felt prompt. I turn to the second speaker of the proposition and invite the
1598.6,1648.24," second opposition speaker to continue the opposition case. Hear, hear. Great. Can everyone hear me? Awesome. And again, I prefer verbal POIs."
1648.24,1672.36, Okay. The biggest problem with proposition is their own disconnect from reality of police departments.
1672.36,1677.82," In a status quo, we are seeing a large movement across the world to make police departments"
1677.82,1682.6," less discriminatory and less brutal, especially towards marginalized communities."
1682.6,1689.94," The problem with their case is that they implicitly assume that all of this change, all of the justice that is being done to bring the police that have"
1689.94,1694.66," brutalized and terrorized minority communities to light, all of the actual structural changes"
1694.66,1699.64, and getting rid of protections from police that kill innocent people is coming from within police
1699.64,1708.52, departments. This is fundamentally wrong. All of the changes that they tell you about within police departments to make them better come from the outside.
1709.02,1712.9, They come from community organizing groups. They come from social justice groups.
1713.08,1717.26, The reason why they will never come from the inside and they haven't come from the inside.
1717.5,1725.28," And I'll note, I'll challenge the proposition to give us one example of a police department from their own despite the unions despite the pushback and"
1725.28,1730.0, despite the hero worship to create their own structural change is that anything that they
1730.0,1734.72, tell you about is immediately never going to happen because of the high likelihood that
1734.72,1740.08, anybody that joins the police force is going to fall into the same corrupt practices if they
1740.08,1750.6," wanted to access any of their impacts they should be encouraging encouraging ex-convicts who know the system, who know what it's like to be convicted and to experience the dark side"
1750.6,1754.5, of the justice system to join these groups and to make change from the outside.
1754.5,1756.4, They're never going to do so from the inside.
1756.4,1757.4, Crowds will post.
1757.4,1759.36," Two things in my speech, then the third substantive."
1759.36,1764.04," First on how they make police less effective and just, and second on how this worsens the"
1764.04,1765.2, view that communities and
1765.2,1770.4, societies have of both police and ex-convicts and why that is so bad given but given that
1770.4,1775.12, first on how this makes police less effective and just within their communities we get three
1775.12,1779.12, statements from the proposition they tell you one that these convicts are going to be able to change
1779.12,1783.44, the mindset of police two they're going to be able to bridge the disconnect between the police and
1783.44,1792.0," the community and three that they're going to be able to bridge the disconnect between the police and the community. And three, that they're going to be able to mobilize insider information as an ex-con in order to solve a bunch of crimes and help the police be a lot more effective."
1792.0,1795.0," We have a few responses. First, I'm going to take them at their highest ground."
1795.0,1810.04," Let's assume that the only reason that people are joining after they've been convicted is because they are just genuinely good people that want to like help society. We have two responses. Number one, we think it is very likely that they are going to be corrupted by"
1810.04,1814.54, systemic failure that they spent like eight minutes in the Prop 1 telling you about that
1814.54,1819.92, already exists within these police forces. They haven't told us how a low ranking member of a
1819.92,1831.36, police force is suddenly going to make all of these like grandiose changes that people have been like trying and failing to make for like the last 20 30 years we think that it's very likely that in order
1831.36,1836.48, to get onto the police force ex-convicts are really really really going to have to pander to
1836.48,1841.76, the people that are hiring them police forces are predisposed to hate convicts because their entire
1841.76,1845.04, job is getting rid of crime meaning that they are not likely to be
1845.04,1850.38," lenient. They are looking for people that are very, very devoted. They are not going to hire"
1850.38,1855.1, somebody that is very open about the fact that they want to completely overhaul and change
1855.1,1859.76, systemic practices within police forces. And these also think that it is likely that they are going
1859.76,1870.16, to overcorrect in order to show that they can be trustworthy meaning that they are going to start following the exact same problematic practices that hurt minority and marginalized communities
1870.16,1874.48, meaning that they're not going to be an ally they are simply going to be another cog in a machine
1874.48,1878.96, this is why they don't fix disconnect this is why they make this is why they're not actually like
1878.96,1883.68, helping change anything in the system but second in terms of like insider information i think this
1883.68,1888.34, is kind of like a bizarre point because we already have things like informants that ensure that people
1888.34,1892.92," that know like the criminal systems really well, and like give the police information to help them"
1892.92,1897.48, like solve big crimes and take down big drug rings without like handing them a gun and telling them
1897.48,1902.26," out to go and protect people. Second, though, let's tell you why existing background checks"
1902.26,1910.72," aren't going to work, why they don't even access like safe people to put in the force why is it so much worse on the proposition because we think the"
1910.72,1915.52, communities that have been hurt by police a lot and the systemic like racism within police forces
1915.52,1920.48, and the justice system don't want to become police to the degree that they claim because they don't
1920.48,1926.0, want to be enforcing harmful policy on their own communities on people that look like
1926.0,1930.8, them that have the same lived experiences of them i don't see the incentive as a person whose
1930.8,1935.52, livelihood has been destroyed by police brutality now wants to like go out on the streets and then
1935.52,1940.08, be brutal right that means that you have two groups of people that are likely to try to join
1940.08,1944.96, one like literal white supremacists or two people that just want to like take advantage of this
1944.96,1949.6, and to the unique power structures that police are given right weapons and institutional protections
1949.6,1954.08, to do harm and pop literally concedes this right they tell you in that last speech that current
1954.08,1958.64, officers are overwhelmingly white and privileged why is this going to change on their side of the
1958.64,1964.08, house it just means that if you're hiring ex-cons it's white and privileged ex-cons at their highest
1964.08,1968.96, ground it's a white and privileged ex-con that has no criminal affiliation and is a non-violent offender but
1968.96,1972.48, that means that they're still not accessing any impacts of bridging communities because those
1972.48,1976.72, ex-cons don't come from the communities that they want to like create connections with the second
1976.72,1981.12, response here is that a lot of departments lack proper resources to conduct quality background
1981.12,1988.64, checks on people not all of them are the nypd to lapd like they don't have extensive resources to ensure that the people that they're hiring is safe they also need people
1988.64,1992.56, right more democracies are backsliding they're expanding their police forces they're willing
1992.56,1996.32, to hire whoever's going to take the job and thirdly we tell you about criminal obligations
1996.32,2000.08, being a lot higher you know people are at risk of public there's a bad prison conditions note
2000.08,2004.64, that they never engage in this why is it so bad is police have unique societal protections that
2004.64,2006.06, no other job grants you it increases the likelihood that they are engage in this. Why is it so bad? Because police have unique societal protections that no other job grants you.
2006.28,2010.62, It increases the likelihood that they are going to do a lot of harm against the community drastically.
2010.96,2014.06," Even if it is one person, right, they try to tell you that this harm is marginal."
2014.32,2020.26," We think that is incredibly bad. On our side of the house, if we can protect just one person, one community from being harmed,"
2020.42,2022.8, we think that that is like inherently a reason to vote for us.
2022.88,2024.82," Before I go on to the second point, I'll take a point."
2029.06,2034.1, The current average police officer is white and quite conservative whereas the current average ex-convict is likely to be a person from a marginal marginalized group
2034.1,2041.06, it comes from a disenfranchised background given ex-convicts letting ex-convicts apply does not
2041.06,2045.22," mean that they are going to be hired. So congratulations, a bunch of people that are ex-cons"
2045.22,2047.48, from marginalized communities suddenly fill out
2047.48,2049.74," an online application to the NYPD,"
2049.74,2052.22," but they are turned away because as you just mentioned,"
2052.22,2054.32, there are structures within the hiring process
2054.32,2057.24, that inherently favor people that are white and wealthy.
2057.24,2059.38," You needed to tell us why that was going to change,"
2059.38,2061.38, why someone was going to see the word ex-con
2061.38,2063.68, and get rid of all of the racism in the hiring system.
2063.68,2068.0," Second then on how communities view, let's get two levels of this. First is the communities that they work in. They"
2068.0,2072.36," say that, oh, communities are going to trust them more. Look, ex-cons are not like beloved within"
2072.36,2076.96," communities because they're ex-cons, right? Like even marginalized communities are not necessarily"
2076.96,2081.74," like really happy to see somebody, especially if they are enforcing laws, especially if they've"
2081.74,2084.96, committed violent crimes in the past. And also it's unlikely they're going to be super known
2084.96,2086.74, because they just spent a lot of time in prison.
2086.92,2091.22, So why do they trust less? Because people don't trust ex-cons. The media is likely to blow this
2091.22,2095.7," up. They like to sensationalize things, meaning that now people don't trust the police either."
2095.98,2099.98, But let's look at the general public then. There's a media sensationalization. People that
2099.98,2105.24," dislike convicts, that don't hate convicts, but don't necessarily want them protecting them with"
2105.24,2110.02," guns, are now no longer going to trust the police. And in exchange, they're going to push for more"
2110.02,2114.52," draconian policy. This is when you get really long mandatory minimums to keep people in prison,"
2114.72,2118.84, because they're going to do whatever they can to ensure that their police forces do not have
2118.84,2123.0, dangerous individuals or people that they perceive as dangerous individuals due to media
2123.0,2127.24, sensationalization that they haven't disproved. Final sentence event on disrupting
2127.24,2128.08, interforce dynamics.
2128.08,2129.36, The thesis here is that it's going to make police
2129.36,2130.24, a lot less cooperative.
2130.24,2133.08," We already told you how police culture is very anti-crime,"
2133.08,2135.72," anti-conflict, and why this is inherent and incredibly"
2135.72,2136.22, embedded.
2136.22,2137.52, No chance that this has changed.
2137.52,2139.02, Why is this bad for the proposition?
2139.02,2140.44, Because the police that exist now
2140.44,2142.48, are not going to welcome them with open arms.
2142.48,2144.6, We're going to see massive amounts of animosity
2144.6,2149.36," and distrust between police and ex-cons that are hiring as police, leading to fracturing in police"
2149.36,2153.12, departments. This is really bad because the police become a lot less productive and a lot less
2153.12,2156.96," cooperative. They're a lot less likely to share information and work as teams, making them not"
2156.96,2161.28," only productive, I mean unproductive, but the cop doesn't access any acceptance by police because"
2161.28,2171.0, they have no interest in collaborating. This is the worst world to less capable police and more alienated ex-convicts power to oppose.
2171.0,2181.0, I think the second speaker of the opposition and invite the third proposition speaker here.
2181.0,2206.64," Thank you once again. P. U. I.Ys in the chat, please. The exact problem with the status quo is the opposition case. The idea that criminals do not deserve a second chance."
2206.64,2208.38, The idea that they are monsters.
2208.38,2213.28, The idea that they can never redeem themselves and that society will never like them.
2213.28,2218.52," On our side of the house, we fix the disconnect that currently exists within the police force"
2218.52,2223.48, and impoverished communities.
2223.48,2249.1," So that proposition is never properly engaged with the real, with the actual, with the status quo, because in the status quo, it is not the case that police officer, like for the vast majority of police officers, it is not the case that they have biases that someone from the inside needs to take out? It is the idea that someone that has been through the system as well can show them how"
2249.1,2251.24, to actually engage with people.
2251.24,2254.86," It is at the moment that that is your colleague, at the moment that you respect them, the moment"
2254.86,2259.22," that that is someone you spend hours with, the someone that becomes your friend, that"
2259.22,2261.58, is the moment that you actually are likely to change.
2261.58,2265.24, We need change from the inside because the outside is not effective enough.
2265.24,2266.88," In the speech, what will I be doing?"
2266.88,2269.5," Firstly, I will be talking about their second argument,"
2269.5,2272.6, namely on how the perception of the justice system changes
2272.6,2274.76," and now onto the more relevant things in this debate,"
2274.76,2277.6, namely on the quality of police officers.
2277.6,2280.14," Firstly, on the perception of the justice system."
2280.14,2281.9, So the proposition brought this argument
2281.9,2283.76, on how this is likely to create a lot of anger
2283.76,2286.96, and media is likely to create a lot of anger and media
2291.84,2299.76," is likely to sensationalize this and that will lead to public backlash. Three responses. Firstly, know that the media sensation is only a best short-term issue. It is not, like, at the moment"
2299.76,2304.48," that this policy is imposed, it is not likely to in the long term be relevant. At the moment,"
2304.48,2305.04," at a certain moment, it's not interesting to read the long term be relevant at the moment at a certain moment"
2305.04,2309.28, it's not interesting to read about it anymore at a certain moment it is simply the new normal so at
2309.28,2314.32, best this is a short-term issue in the long term we still have our benefits but secondly know that
2314.32,2318.4, there's also lots of media that is likely to be positive about this so this is for example more
2318.4,2323.28, left-wing media that supports reforms and actually restructuring the way that the police works
2323.28,2328.46, therefore at best it is likely to counterbalance each other and people that already think that they people should
2328.46,2332.82, deserve a chance are likely to still believe that and people that think that they do not
2332.82,2336.72," deserve a chance would still like to believe that. But thirdly, note that this clash is"
2336.72,2340.8," actually dependent on the other clash. Namely, if the police still functions on our side"
2340.8,2344.66," of the house and does it become a terrible, terrible thing, I think this will actually"
2344.66,2348.48, reflect good on criminals because it shows that that at the moment that the police
2348.48,2352.8, first even can trust them that you as an individual can also trust them that they do deserve a second
2352.8,2357.84, chance it is not likely to completely like even if there's one bad example i don't think that
2357.84,2361.36, this completely shapes people's perspectives because they know that there's also plenty of
2361.36,2369.0," other examples in which this does work thus that means that people are otherwise also more likely to give criminals a second chance, or at best it is a short-term harm."
2369.0,2377.0," I don't think there should be debate waiting. Now let's get on to real debate impact, namely interactions between people, ways to actually impact people's lives."
2377.0,2389.1," What said opposition told you is that this is likely to lead to worse police officers. For this, they've given us three mechanisms. Firstly, on corruption, three responses. Firstly, we talked to you about why we have selection"
2389.1,2393.24," process. That means that we also are likely to look into their background, how much contact"
2393.24,2397.12," they have still with people that are also still, for example, criminals, et cetera, likely"
2397.12,2402.18," to look at what their motives are. I think this is unlikely. Secondly, it is highly uncomparative."
2402.18,2406.32," If anything, I think if you're a cartel and you want someone to infiltrate the police force,"
2406.32,2412.96," I think you're more likely to not do that with an ex-convict, but someone that, for example, might also be criminal that is not convicted yet."
2412.96,2420.12," Therefore, I'm very unsure what the comparative is here. But thirdly, I think it's just unreasonable and actually disrespectful to say that convicts cannot change,"
2420.12,2424.24, that they are always stuck in their past lives. I think that is simply disrespectful.
2424.24,2428.88, They can change. We're very proud to propose about that but secondly tell you they're likely to create
2428.88,2433.04, cuts corners because they have less respect for the law two responses firstly i think this is
2433.04,2437.2, actually far less likely because they felt the effect of not obliging with the law and therefore
2437.2,2441.68, they're less likely to do it the more likely to respect it secondly other officers are actually
2441.68,2448.84, far more likely because they don't actually know thank likely because they don't actually know what the actual effects are of cutting corners.
2448.84,2452.48," So for example, we told you about why they very often have an incentive to at the end"
2452.48,2456.48," of their shift, for example, hand out far more fines, just because they want to reach"
2456.48,2461.38," a certain number of fines, just because that reflects good on them, not really knowing"
2461.38,2464.44, how that actually impacts people's situation at home.
2464.44,2465.36," Thirdly, to tell you"
2465.36,2470.48, that these officers are desensitized to desensitized to violence and are therefore more likely to do it
2470.48,2474.16, firstly i think you could say the same about other police officers so i think that's uncomparative
2474.16,2478.64, they also see violence on a daily basis but secondly sam already told you this no response
2478.64,2482.8, from second off and actually you know the effect because you've been on the other side of the
2482.8,2488.64, violence therefore you know knowing that officers have done that to you what it does to people how terrible it is and that
2488.64,2492.96, you should not do that to other people i think that is a scenario which were more likely to be
2492.96,2497.76, empathetic that is the scenarios which are more likely to know that the other side are also humans
2497.76,2503.28, and what that what you do has weight no thank you i see your pri to the chats okay then they tell
2503.28,2505.76, you yeah but the people that want these jobs
2505.76,2511.04, just want these jobs to have power and so therefore these will be terrible people. They have to
2512.0,2516.88," prove to us two things in order to make this stand. Firstly, that these people will get the jobs at"
2516.88,2523.28," the moment that are people that only want power, but secondly, that only those people apply."
2523.28,2527.02," Firstly, I don't think that these people would get the job. Why?"
2527.2,2532.4," The police force is not openly racist or openly sexist. Maybe these are small biases, but it's"
2532.4,2536.18," not something you're going to advertise with when you want a job. Therefore, it is very unlikely."
2536.4,2540.76," Moreover, people that have records for that are not likely to be hired because they will receive"
2540.76,2546.12," a lot of backlash for it. Therefore, it is uncomparative. But secondly, we talked to you about two incentives,"
2546.12,2549.7," why actually also good people are likely to apply for this,"
2549.7,2551.1," namely because they want to make a change,"
2551.1,2553.26," because they want to do something good for the community,"
2553.26,2555.26, therefore we think there's also very good people applying
2555.26,2557.4, that are far more likely to get the job.
2557.4,2558.24," Before I go on,"
2558.24,2560.2, is why we told the police officers are better
2560.2,2561.94, on our side of the house at PY.
2561.94,2562.98," In your second speech,"
2562.98,2567.92, you tell us that the vast majority of police officers are white and privileged on your side of the house why wouldn't they exclusively
2567.92,2573.28, hire white and privileged ex-convicts look because i think this is a unique chance for them because
2573.28,2578.16, of the specific push for change that you talked about to also get minorities into the police force
2578.16,2582.0, because of that push for change is more likely to actually happen on ourselves the moment that we
2582.0,2588.96, give these people an actual chance because they are now at least allowed to apply to begin with okay onto why we told you that we have better
2588.96,2592.96, police officers we talked to you about what they have crucial skills they have the knowledge about
2592.96,2597.04, deep privilege communities they have seen the other side of the law and that is the knowledge
2597.04,2601.28, that crucially makes them better than other officers we told you that was incredibly important
2601.28,2609.36, because it means that they're more likely to be empathetic it means that they have more insider info and it means that they can change the mindset of others officers know
2609.36,2613.52, that the way that people get into echo chambers is by not hearing any other perspectives at the
2613.52,2617.36, moment that you now for example have these people into the police officers that is the moment that
2617.36,2620.96, you can break through these echo chambers there's a moment that you can show people the other
2620.96,2628.96," perspective some proposition tells you no you can't do, they're too indoctrinated. Panel, I think that is very unlikely. Firstly, not everyone is that"
2628.96,2633.6, indoctrinated. I think there's actual people with also good incentives that aren't blatantly racist
2633.6,2637.52," on a police force that now at least know better how to engage with these people, which on the"
2637.52,2641.84," comparatively wouldn't. Secondly, at least new officers can be influenced by this. I think we"
2641.84,2647.94," have to find more nuanced context about what the police force, what action criminals looks like. Then they tell us, yeah, but there's"
2647.94,2651.6," already a big push to make the police better. And then they tell you, yeah, but we need"
2651.6,2655.28, to do it internally because the push isn't enough. This is the internal change that we
2655.28,2659.56, need because the push isn't enough indeed. We need internal change to show officers what
2659.56,2663.6," they need to do. We do that. They also tell us, yeah, but these officers will also fall"
2663.6,2669.0, into the same traps because they are looking for crime and they will also have these biases.
2669.0,2674.0," No, they know what it feels like. They've been in prison for years. They've been through the system."
2674.0,2680.0," I think that is the moment that just working somewhere doesn't change your experiences, the knowledge that you have, the way you grew up."
2680.0,2688.64, That is something that is exclusive to our sub-house and that will always outweigh any impact beside opposition because we actually have more connection with impoverished communities that are
2688.64,2692.08, not scared of the police and you know on our side of the house there are more likely to keep you
2692.08,2695.12, out of crime people that you can talk to in our house very proud to propose
2701.92,2704.96, i think the third speaker of the proposition and invite the third
2704.96,2708.62, opposition speaker to deliver the last constructive speech in this debate here.
2711.18,2713.3," All right, verbal POIs, please."
2718.5,2725.84, It was demeaning of proposition to assume just because ex-Congress joined the police force minorities would be
2725.84,2732.64, would feel protected minorities are not anti-pro and are not pro-criminal crime does serious damage
2732.64,2737.36, to their communities true but they are also not protected by police officers and that is because
2737.36,2742.88, of historic injustices proposition does not remedy which means in the status quo they are largely
2742.88,2745.34," just without an advocate on our side of the house we supported increasing diversity in the status quo, they're largely just without an advocate. On our side of"
2745.34,2750.0," the house, we supported increasing diversity in the force. But the difference was that on their"
2750.0,2755.38," side of the house, moderates that were not inherently pro-police or was not inherently"
2755.38,2760.44, anti-convict were just afraid of their own communities being policed poorly and being put
2760.44,2764.94, in danger. These are the people that are likely to get scared and enforce things like crackdads.
2768.96,2773.04," These are the people that are likely to reinforce stigmas that already exist but make them way more harmful in their first place. I never, I don't think they engage. With that,"
2773.04,2776.96," three clashes in this debate, but first I'm just going to engage with the argument in their last"
2776.96,2781.04," speech. Essentially, they get a second chance and that's incredibly important. There are a ton of"
2781.04,2785.82," options even in the status quo for good, economically fruitful life after prison."
2786.14,2799.28," Even further, on our side of the house, considering truly how radical this policy is, from the one we told you we improved things like access to other opportunities, job options, options that didn't hand you a gun on the first place."
2799.42,2808.64," Even further, for the people that leave prison, either feel guilty for their actions or just want to improve communities there are a lot of ways they can do this right i think these are"
2808.64,2813.46, the people that are most effective by becoming a political advocate a community or social worker
2813.46,2817.24, right these people that give directly to communities particularly the people that believe
2817.24,2822.3, the police structurally is hurting them and not just a problem from the inside here is the problem
2822.3,2828.72, with their case i think their way of changing police violence was internal. They said you work within a really co-op system and then
2828.72,2833.48," maybe there's a risk that you as an individual are able to change it. We say this was unlikely,"
2833.7,2838.16, but just not really a risk we are willing to take. We say you reform the system by pushing
2838.16,2842.64, against it directly. That is only what you get on our side of the house. We say all the mobilization
2842.64,2848.56, that happened within their force at their very best we say it's better all those people to reform the system from the outside
2848.56,2852.8, we say that it's far more likely to change with that rest this debate first question i want to
2852.8,2857.52, ask is who actually gets in the system in the first place and what does the system self-select
2857.52,2862.0, for first i think it is that people that are previously harmed by police brutality are least
2862.0,2872.0," likely to apply notably considering there are at least some alternatives in the status quo, and our world gets more alternatives, this is not like an option of not having a job or being a police officer right in the first place, right?"
2872.0,2880.0," There are options that exist, even if they're not as important. This is because there is historical harm that has been committed against particularly minority communities, right?"
2880.0,2886.98," I think when they say communities that are predisposed to crime, I think what they really mean are communities that are predisposed to be over-policed, right?"
2887.1,2888.98, I don't think minorities are predisposed to crime.
2889.2,2890.84, They are disposed to being targeted.
2891.08,2893.96," In this situation, it is institutional harm that they face, right?"
2894.18,2897.36, These are problems that cannot be fixed from the inside.
2897.36,2906.92," That is to say, if you have been directly harmed by police brutality, not just will you not be brutal as a police officer,"
2906.92,2909.36, you just will never be a police officer in the first place
2909.36,2912.1, because you fear the institution and everyone within it.
2912.1,2913.98, This is also true that you fear your treatment
2913.98,2915.2," within the police force, right?"
2915.2,2917.9, If everyone around you is someone that is like actively
2917.9,2919.72," hurting your community, it's very unlikely"
2919.72,2921.04, why you would ever subject yourself
2921.04,2923.14, to that kind of workplace in the first place.
2923.14,2924.54, There were other options.
2924.54,2925.36, We said the people that are most likely to be able to fix this system ever subject yourself to that kind of workplace in the first place there were other options we said
2925.36,2929.44, the people that are most likely to be able to fix this system were least likely to apply in the
2929.44,2934.32, first place also mean even if everyone on their side of the house actually decides to like join
2934.32,2939.6, the force and enter the hiring process the process itself self-selected out of this right the whole
2939.6,2944.32, thing is like oh well they're not going to be openly racist fine they didn't need to all they
2944.32,2945.12, needed to do
2945.12,2949.76, was stay on a personality level or say that one like someone that is white that is also an ex
2949.76,2954.08, public had been like more reformed as a person it had changed to a greater degree all these things
2954.08,2958.56, are very subjective criteria which means on their side of the house it's far more likely to get
2958.56,2963.84, people that are ex-convicts that are pro-police and are also white and privileged this is the
2963.84,2965.04, worst combination of
2965.04,2969.12," all factors, right? These are the people that committed a hate crime, but these are the people"
2969.12,2973.36," that maybe went to the Charlottesville riot and got arrested, right, and are sent to prison. These"
2973.36,2977.44, are the people that are likely to end up back in the police force in the first place and doing all
2977.44,2982.8," the harms. Again, the people who are left are the people that are least, are like most disposed to"
2982.8,2989.54," violence, but also like the police the most, which is obviously predisposed to like white supremacists in the first place. Note all"
2989.54,2995.08," of this made every impact about improving community safety much, much worse because the actual acts of"
2995.08,2999.36, police brutality drastically increased on their side of the house. Before I move on to the second
2999.36,3006.04," clash, I'll take your point. Okay, so we already explained that this is specifically symmetrical, the systemic"
3006.04,3010.06," problems in for instance personality tests or whatever, but we explained that stations are"
3010.06,3014.18, more likely to devote resources to specifically ex-convicts because there would be more political
3014.18,3018.04," pressure on that. So at least in ours at the house, we fixed this problem of not enough checking on"
3018.04,3022.86," police officers. Again, it's thoroughly like unclear how you get this like magical increase"
3022.86,3029.66," in political pressure, considering we gave you an entire argument of how you get this like magical increase in political pressure considering we gave you an entire argument of how you get more like um more violence against ex-cons in the first place you"
3029.66,3034.26, get like more public like resentment against them right but on the second argument like fine here's
3034.26,3038.88, the status quo a world in which a lot of people apply that are not ex-convicts and there is still
3038.88,3044.46, a general like preference for white individuals we say this is just this is bad but it's obviously
3044.46,3045.78, less harmful than that
3045.78,3050.62," same system existing in the terms of like people that have actually committed crimes, because then"
3050.62,3055.94," the preference is far more likely, like it's far more, it's like a much greater degree of preference"
3055.94,3060.28," toward people that have like likely committed crimes, but in a racialized hateful setting,"
3060.48,3064.22, they're likely to do that again in the first place. Second argument is on public response.
3064.52,3066.66," Note, this argument came before the argument"
3066.66,3068.76," about what actually happened within the departments,"
3068.76,3071.1, considering even if proposition implements their world
3071.1,3073.8," perfectly, the public will still perceive it"
3073.8,3076.56," as being very, very radical, even if they do it well."
3076.56,3079.72," Note, it literally only takes one instance of someone"
3079.72,3082.38, that had been an ex-convict messing up within the force
3082.38,3084.48, in order for a cable network like Fox News
3084.48,3089.34, to talk about only that instance for a year? And we know this is going to happen because in
3089.34,3094.16," the status quo, people that weren't ex-convicts still make mistakes, still make intentional acts"
3094.16,3099.28," of violence, and that is like obviously exists in the first place. So in their world, you just harp"
3099.28,3103.62," on the instances that were caused by ex-convicts. Why did this matter? It is because moderates,"
3103.88,3105.04, they're alienated uniquely
3105.04,3109.28, from this policy did two things first they were more likely to support things like crackdowns and
3109.28,3113.28, harsh sentences just against people who commit crimes in the first place we know this is likely
3113.28,3117.44, because politicians are already advocating for these policies are on their side of the house
3117.44,3122.88, you just increase their public base of support so those policies and those really extreme politicians
3122.88,3131.46, are more likely to get into office second there is there is a reignited stigma against X crimes. We say the standard of the status quo
3131.46,3136.4," is like slow, but I think it is decent, right? That eventually there is more support for X"
3136.4,3140.62," criminals in the first place. Their side of the house reverses all the progress, makes it very,"
3140.72,3144.82," very difficult for you to get other options outside the police force. Lastly, we said there"
3144.82,3146.06, was less trust in the police.
3146.24,3158.3," Note this was like the same for all communities in the first place, right? And note, this is like, these are communities that need some trust in the police. You need people to actually call the police when say you're experiencing something like domestic violence, where you've been robbed, right?"
3158.42,3165.6," All these need engagement with the police. If you fear that a criminal is going to not come to your service, you will never call, and we do not get any benefits."
3165.6,3169.98," And note, this also applies to all police officers and not those that are actively doing"
3169.98,3170.98, harm.
3170.98,3173.8," Lastly, on policing itself, we gave you a lot of mechanisms here."
3173.8,3176.84, I think really only corruption was covered to a reasonable degree.
3176.84,3181.44, I think our most intuitive argument here was that you put people who have shown more than
3181.44,3188.52," the general public that they are going to commit crimes, you give them the weaponry, and you give them the legal protection of things that say, oh, well, they were acting in"
3188.52,3192.56," self-defense. They're a police officer, so they're going to be in harm's way. This is the sort of"
3192.56,3197.58, scenario in which crimes go up and then more crimes are let free because all the situations
3197.58,3202.96, in which someone has insider information are all reasons why you're just less likely to arrest
3202.96,3208.8," people, less likely to get crime committed. And all of this was predisposed to people that are likely to commit crimes,"
3209.08,3213.4," violence, and particularly against minorities. This is the worst case scenario. We say avoid"
3213.4,3224.04, this scenario at all costs. Very proud to oppose. I thank the third speaker of the proposition
3224.04,3253.24, of the opposition and invite the opposition reply here All right. Can everyone hear me?
3254.74,3255.68," Okay, awesome."
3256.74,3268.82," I want you to imagine if tomorrow the police chief of New York City, a city that has been suffering from devastatingly high levels of crime, stood up and said, we are going to now start hiring ex-convicts to our police department."
3269.12,3273.6," The people that were suffering from high levels of crime, that were concerned about their security"
3273.6,3277.86," for so many months, would not be incredibly excited about this. They were going to retaliate."
3277.98,3282.02, They're going to push back. And conditions for ex-convicts would get worse. The police department
3282.02,3288.4, would get delegitimized. At best on their side of of the house they got a couple more ex-conflict working low-level jobs that was not enough to
3288.4,3293.12, cause the massive societal level change but what's going to cause that change was backlash i want to
3293.12,3297.12, talk about two things the first thing i want to talk about is about public backlash we give you
3297.12,3300.96, three independent reasons why backlash was going to happen first of all people inherently had a
3300.96,3308.6, stigmatized view of criminals second of all's because these types of conflicts were likely to be well known in their community. So people would feel personal grievances.
3308.94,3313.48," And finally, the media would harp on this. This would be an amazing opportunity for growing media"
3313.48,3317.62," groups to sensationalize the fact that in places where crime is increasing, that now they're hiring"
3317.62,3321.66," ex-convicts. Their responses were simply insufficient. First, they said it was short-term."
3321.78,3329.04," That did not matter. Even if it was short- term, people cared about their security, and they were going to rally around policies that hurt"
3329.04,3332.56," ex-convicts, and they were going to immediately lose trust in the police department. Secondly,"
3332.64,3335.9," they told you that there's going to be a left-leaning problem. Pano, left-leaning,"
3336.12,3339.8," right-leaning, it does not matter. It was the moderates that were concerned for their security"
3339.8,3343.92," that even if they were concerned about the police department, were far more scared of crime that"
3343.92,3347.58," were going to retaliate. And finally, they told you that this would reflect the good. No,"
3347.68,3351.98, we told you that this is not in line in the incentives of media groups that want to sensationalize
3351.98,3355.76," failures, that want to show scandals, and therefore would show the fact that it's drug"
3355.76,3359.78, dealers that are getting hiled on to the police department. We outweighed their case. Even if they
3359.78,3365.06," got the most amazing, pristine ex-convicts, it did not matter. We outweighed. Number one is because"
3365.06,3370.04, you got a massive increase in draconian policies that force mandatory minimums and cause ex-conflicts
3370.04,3374.7," to be pushed into crime for longer. Second of all, you got an increase in crime. People were"
3374.7,3379.28, less likely to trust the police department and less likely to report them. This causes a toxic
3379.28,3384.58, cycle where crime continues to increase. People continue to become concerned upon crime and push
3384.58,3385.44, for the tough
3385.44,3390.5, on crime policies that hurt minorities. Public backlash was damning. It clearly won us the debate.
3390.76,3394.4, Let's move on to their case. They banked their case on two assumptions. The first assumption
3394.4,3398.56, was that ex-convicts were going to get reform. Let's take them at their highest ground. The
3398.56,3402.8," ex-convicts are excellent people. There were three reasons why they wouldn't get reform. Number one,"
3403.02,3428.74," they were low-ranking people, so they could not structurally change systemically racist departments. Secondly, because of increasing scrutiny, they would pander to the high-ups and become even more abusive for them to get legitimacy and not get fired. And third of all, even if they applied, what they conceded themselves is that it would be white privileged people hiring them, so it would not be the minorities that would be getting the job, it's the white privileged convicts that would be getting the job, meaning that they get no solvency on reforms. The second argument they"
3428.74,3433.64," give you is about the perception of trust. This also didn't make sense. Number one, people don't"
3433.64,3438.22, inherently like convicts. I think it was demeaning of them to say that minorities just magically
3438.22,3442.4, like people that are criminals. They never gave us any structural reasons why this is the case.
3442.6,3445.88," In fact, minorities are disproportionately affected by crime."
3446.1,3448.74, They would be most opposed to people like convicts getting in the military.
3449.06,3453.18," But secondly, even if you hired a couple of more convicts, you can't change the history"
3453.18,3456.72, of discrimination and violence that has occurred against minority communities.
3456.94,3460.32, They never proved why this would outweigh the structural problems that exist.
3460.52,3464.76," If anything, we told you that crime would be worse on their side of the house, that"
3464.76,3465.06," you get worse police officers, ones that did on their side of the house, that you get"
3465.06,3469.28," worse police officers, ones that did not want to change the system, but want to consolidate their"
3469.28,3474.26, own power and control. People that for clear reasons were more prone to commit things like
3474.26,3478.52," crime, that were more likely to cut corners, and that when they were given a weapon were more"
3478.52,3483.1," likely to use violence. They say that like essentially like people can change, right? Yeah,"
3483.16,3486.18," it's probably great if people can change, but if you're a prison gang"
3486.18,3488.18," and you have obligations to these criminal groups,"
3488.26,3489.08, it does not matter.
3489.2,3490.74, You are obligated to look over crime.
3491.0,3493.14," They also tell you that they get things like insider info,"
3493.28,3494.2, but this does not matter.
3494.5,3496.18, Police departments can always use informants.
3496.38,3497.62, They never told us specifically
3497.62,3499.92, why they had to hire convicts.
3500.02,3502.04," At the end of the debate, the debate is clear."
3502.32,3504.26, Public backlash was completely inevitable
3504.26,3508.38, and any of the benefits they got on reforms was marginal and likely did not happen.
3508.64,3510.2, We clearly took this debate. Thank you.
3514.62,3519.9, I thank the opposition reply and invite the proposition reply to conclude this debate.
3519.9,3525.04," Hi, I'm presuming that I'm still audible. Great."
3525.46,3527.26, Then I will start my speech.
3531.36,3534.32," Panel, I'm going to front load the most important material."
3534.78,3539.7," I'm guessing at this point you're asking what all judges are constantly asking, which is where is all the weighing?"
3540.2,3549.86," So here is in the opposition reply, despite the fact that both the first and second opposition speaker spend significantly more time on the quality of individual police officers."
3549.86,3555.22, They make a big push on the idea of backlash and that being the most important idea in this debate.
3555.8,3566.1, Two mechanisms of weighing since opposition thinks that they're losing on the quality of police officers as to why that's actually significantly more important than backlash. The first is on long term versus short term.
3566.32,3569.36," Because note, in the first and most explicitly in the second speech,"
3569.62,3572.1," we already explained that this is a very short term issue,"
3572.38,3575.62, that over time individuals get used and are raised into society
3575.62,3577.28," in which this is a normalised thing,"
3577.4,3580.16, but also that the media won't like continuously be talking
3580.16,3583.46, about ex-convicts being allowed in the police for 20 years straight.
3583.46,3589.84," So sure, maybe in a short five month span, people are very outraged as this policy gets passed,"
3589.84,3593.86, but opposition was never able to prove why in the long term that would have significant
3593.86,3601.12," enough consequences. So sure, temporarily, maybe police officers or convicts have a slightly"
3601.12,3609.2," harder life. But in the long term, we that our our benefits are continuous you keep getting police officers not very many but still police officers who are ex"
3609.2,3613.52, comics will make significantly better decisions than other police officers the second is on
3613.52,3617.76, prioritization so on the national scale a lot of this policy doesn't matter too much because the
3617.76,3626.06, vast majority of police of police of police abuse doesn't happen in the big flashy stories that you see. It's when everyday police
3626.06,3632.5, officers turn off their body cams to be a teenager on the street. We tell you that when we get police
3632.5,3637.92," officers who are significantly less likely to do so, we significantly decrease the rate of"
3637.92,3642.7," individuals who are unnecessarily harmed. So sure, I guess at our worst, they slightly win on backlash."
3643.0,3647.64," However, such a big idea, I don't think really compares the idea of the average police officer"
3647.64,3650.8, being slightly less likely to randomly kill someone or randomly beat someone up.
3651.06,3655.6," So in terms of the mechanistic quibbles, firstly, in terms of the comparison between the average"
3655.6,3659.58," ex-convict police officer versus the average status quo police officer, because that's"
3659.58,3662.46, the question you have to ask when you think about the quality of individual police.
3662.46,3668.4," And then secondly, about the trust between police and different communities firstly in terms of the comparison between average"
3668.4,3672.72, ex-convict police officers and versus the average police offering the status quo the most important
3672.72,3677.52, thing here is on the criteria that opposition keeps pushing us on so basically we say that
3677.52,3681.28, the current average person who applies to the police officers is white and they're conservative
3682.64,3687.44, whereas the mass majority of average the vast majority of ex-convicts will likely be from
3687.44,3691.52," marginalized backgrounds, from impoverished backgrounds, they will likely be against"
3691.52,3696.08, systemic corruption and against systemic brutality. They're likely to be the ones least
3696.08,3700.0," likely to accept bribes and corruption because they're the ones who get investigated first,"
3700.0,3709.38," which is completely inherent above all questions of what kind of people get accepted. But secondly, they all have unique insights around crime from having personal experience required there."
3709.58,3711.68, That also stands above all other criteria questions.
3712.1,3717.46," They say that police will selectively choose for the most white, most conservative and most supremacist individuals."
3717.46,3723.44," But firstly, they only give reasons as to why that is a broader systemic issue which should exist on either side of the House."
3723.66,3727.88, So that means that on the opposition side of of the house they're selecting that as well what then changes and it's slightly
3727.88,3731.24, more likely that you get individuals from marginalized impoverished and anti-brutal
3731.24,3737.98, and also who are anti-brutality and anti-corruption because the pool changes where the vast majority
3737.98,3743.66, of ex-convicts who apply will look like this and have these kinds of beliefs which we think
3743.66,3748.62, make it significantly more likely that you can't get these kinds of individuals to the offices. In addition to the
3748.62,3752.24," inherent things that we say about corruption, they're less likely to get offered by us in the"
3752.24,3755.88," first place. And secondly, about the insights around crime. It was never about changing the"
3755.88,3760.48, entire system. It's about changing one person at a time. Even if one police officer is significantly
3760.48,3765.6," less likely to commit a crime, we think it's worse. The second clash doesn't"
3765.6,3768.78, really matter too much. It's about the trust between police and communities. And the reason
3768.78,3772.62, I don't make time for it is because opposition creates individual communities with society at
3772.62,3776.74," large. We explain why individuals who are in specific communities might not like crime,"
3776.92,3781.06, but what they do like is police officers who are able to speak to use in that area
3781.06,3788.82, prevention. They have a name with and where they can contact from that that area that's something that we uniquely provide these communities which opposition cannot
3788.82,3790.5, that's why you should vote for proposition
3793.92,3797.7, I thank the proposition reply and I thank both teams for this fine debate
3797.7,3800.58, uh and now I think I can stop the recording
