0.0,3.12, I'm just going to start that now.
3.12,4.68," OK, great."
4.68,8.52, So could I check that my panelists are here?
14.04,15.92, I am here.
15.92,17.2, Yes.
17.2,18.16, I see Jessica.
18.16,21.96, I believe we have one more judge.
21.96,23.32," Yes, I'm here."
28.0,32.0, Great. And I'm looking for
32.0,36.0, I think I'm looking for Evelyn.
36.0,40.0," Okay, well, we'll hold on for a moment."
44.0,46.0," It's possible the draw was updated. I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation. Matt, you can start."
46.0,49.0, It's possible the draw was updated.
49.0,52.0, I'm not seeing Evelyn's name on the draw anymore.
52.0,54.0," Oh, let me refresh."
54.0,56.0, That's totally possible.
56.0,57.0, You're right.
57.0,59.0, You're absolutely right.
59.0,61.0," Okay, great."
61.0,62.0, Then.
62.0,64.0, In that case.
64.0,66.52," Let's start with some quick introductions. So my name's Matt, I'll be the chair."
68.32,71.9, Happy to be judging this round. Congratulations to both teams and welcome to round eight.
71.9,75.26," If we could introduce ourselves, the judges,"
75.26,77.72," just name, if you're interested, pronoun"
77.72,79.92," in the order of the draw, that'd be awesome."
82.32,84.42," Hi, my name is Freddie."
84.42,88.0, I use he or they pronouns. Let's have a good debate.
88.0,98.0," Hi everyone, I'm Jessica and I'm on the panel. Congratulations on making it to the final round and I wish you all the best of luck for the round."
98.0,103.0," Great, thanks."
103.0,106.32, If we could have the proposition team introduce themselves
107.12,112.08," in speaking order. Yeah, so Vincent Gao is first prop in reply. He him."
112.96,117.12, Second speaker Anushka Chihar. Third speaker Max.
124.4,126.0," Opposition? Speaking first for opposition, Mike Papilla."
126.0,129.0," Speaking second, Maxwell DiLorenzo."
129.0,132.0," Speaking third, Nick Bracow."
132.0,135.0," And, replying, Mike Papilla."
135.0,137.0," Great, thanks."
137.0,144.0," I haven't judged at this world schools yet, so let me know if I'm missing anything major procedurally."
144.0,148.0," But final reminder to teams, please speak to time."
148.0,150.4," If you speak past eight minutes 15,"
150.4,151.9, I will simply stop flowing.
152.76,155.48, I will not be sending time signals in the chat.
155.48,158.42," If there is anyone who like really needs time signals,"
158.42,160.4," let me know and we can try to figure something out,"
160.4,162.96, but I'm traditionally pretty terrible at doing that.
164.88,168.56," Offer POIs, accept POIs, be good to each other, and enjoy the debate."
170.2,175.3, There are no further questions or concerns. I look forward to this round. I call this
175.3,178.52," house to order, and I'm happy to invite up the Prime Minister to begin the debate for"
178.52,183.12, Proposition side here. Just checking that I'm audible.
184.58,186.1," And POIs in the chat, please."
186.38,188.02, I'll just accept them when I see them.
193.92,197.48, Millions of ex-convicts serve a life sentence in the world of opposition.
198.04,202.58, These are people who care about justly applying the laws that they were unjustly convicted by.
202.72,210.08," Family members who care about their hometowns that see face police subjugation daily, and individuals who care about improving"
210.08,214.84, the police force but cannot in their world. These millions should not be barred by discrimination
214.84,219.06, and stereotype. They should be free to live the lives beyond a sentence that they've already
219.06,224.48," served. When punishment is levied outside the courtroom, every convict serves a life sentence."
225.44,227.92, Proposition has two arguments to make in the first speech.
227.92,229.68," Firstly, on ex-convicts themselves,"
229.68,231.46," and secondly, on reforming the force."
231.46,232.88," But before that, what is our stance?"
232.88,233.72, Three points.
233.72,236.34," Number one, we think it is likely that individuals"
236.34,238.82, with actively violent tendencies are filtered out
238.82,240.76, through existing selection systems.
240.76,243.56, This looks like psychiatric evaluation simulations
243.56,246.0, that put applicants in non-convicts and distress situations.
246.0,253.0," Training on de-escalation procedures, which we already have in place and mentioned, have increased in the aftermath of BLM."
253.0,258.0," Basic background checks that see if an ex-gang member, for instance, is still in contact with their gang and their agency."
258.0,265.52," Notably, a lot of this already exists for non-convicts so we are supporting a continuation of data second"
265.52,270.0, when individuals are new to the job and this also applies to non-convicts too they're likely going
270.0,274.72, to be put in low risk and low tier jobs such as community outreach divisions or being a patrol
274.72,279.6, or regular beat cop until they get promoted b cops are also often paired with senior officers
279.6,284.0, for instance so in our world there's already effectively a probationary period that screens
284.0,287.28," for things like bad behavior violent violent tendencies, and various reactions."
287.68,299.88," Thirdly and finally, in terms of the people who are likely to apply, we think it will and largely be lower level criminals who engaged in crimes of accusation and nonviolent crime, largely because A, statistically, this is the vast majority of crime."
300.22,307.92," But second of all, if you were locked up for decades by the state because you engaged in violent crime it's probably the case that you hate the police you hate the government and you don't want to join"
307.92,314.32, the police force to begin with first argument then to begin a principle it is morally unjust
314.32,318.48, for the state to punish ex-convicts who have already served their sentence and have been
318.48,323.76, deemed fit to enter society and rehabilitated on an objective level these are ex-convicts who have
323.76,330.2, paid for their sins and crimes and suffered the consequences. This is a perpetual punishment that stays well beyond when
330.2,335.02," a sentence ends. On a more nuanced level, however, we think that this is an excessive punishment that"
335.02,338.96, is disproportional. It's not just the case that these people have already paid for their sins.
339.34,343.24, It's also the case that the vast majority of people engage in non-violent crime that isn't
343.24,348.04," that egregious, as petty as breaking a car window or drug dealing, for instance, especially in the United States,"
348.2,353.9," or crimes of acquisition and subsistence, which constitutes already over half of crimes in most"
353.9,359.44," countries. Moreover, however, under the principle, it is often people of color in their world that"
359.44,363.58," are disproportionately punished, who are more likely going to be locked up, who are more likely"
363.58,368.72," going to be served a guilty verdict, who are more likely going to be carded and overplaced on their set of house."
369.06,373.68," So at the conclusion of this principle, this is a fundamentally unfair punishment. A four-year"
373.68,378.0," sentence should end after four years. It does not in the world of opposition. Second of all,"
378.22,382.98," it disproportionately affects low-level criminals, people of color, in which this policy is a massive"
382.98,388.18, overblown and it's not proportional to what exactly these people did and the crimes that these people committed. I'll take the
388.18,393.48," second of all, second part of the argument. This is just a good opportunity, a solid economic"
393.48,398.38, opportunity for ex-convicts. It's a well-paid job where you get insurance and social benefits and
398.38,402.06, healthcare on the side for your children. It provides security for ex-cons who are often
402.06,408.54, overblown by things like crime and jail. It gives them meaning and purpose since they feel like they're actually contributing to society instead of staying in jail.
408.54,415.62, This is especially important in the context where criminals are often blacklisted from other jobs because of their ex-con status in the world of opposition.
416.06,420.84," So rather than re-offending or joining previous crime communities and circles and gangs out of no alternatives,"
421.24,428.94," this job brings people a paycheck and stability for the most vulnerable groups of minorities in the world. Before I go on, I'll take a pee. Would you allow sex offenders"
428.94,434.74, who have served their sentences to become teachers? No. Let's talk about reforming the force.
435.28,440.32, A central issue with the police in the status quo is that there's a large empathetic gap between the
440.32,445.52, average beat cop and the average convict. The police force is comprised of a body of people
445.52,447.42, who never need to be in circumstances
447.42,448.9, where they have to resort to crime.
448.9,451.4, These are often financially stable white individuals
451.4,453.94, or people of the ruling class who cannot empathize
453.94,457.28, with a black teen in Chicago living in economic destitution.
457.28,459.48," These are individuals who have stable families,"
459.48,461.26," stable financial circumstances,"
461.26,463.7, who don't have to engage with the other side.
463.7,465.4, This empathetic and democratic gap
465.4,470.22, maps onto other issues as well. When the average beat cop patrolling your community in the world
470.22,475.6," of opposition knows about the lived circumstances of poverty and violence, they attribute bad"
475.6,480.64, behavior and violence to the person and not to the circumstance. This leads to a greater likelihood
480.64,488.5," of that cop being violent. This individual and that white cop on their side of the house doesn't attribute bad behavior to the circumstance. They just believe that the individual,"
488.66,493.5," that Black teen, is bad in and of itself. In a high crime community where curfew is 10 p.m.,"
493.5,497.2, a cop who has worked only one shift a day for their entire life because they have financial
497.2,502.34, stability does not understand why a Black man is coming home an hour after curfew late after the
502.34,505.04, third and final shift. when the average union or board
505.04,510.72, member on their side of the house is a 55 year old white man policies do not reflect circumstances on
510.72,514.96, the ground when your patrol partner brutally beats a hispanic teen because they believe they are a
514.96,518.88, drug dealer you don't file a report since you have more empathy for your partner that you've worked
518.88,523.76, with for 11 years rather than the hispanic team because you're a white man we fix this issue in
523.76,525.04, two key ways.
528.92,533.2, The first thing to know is that people who join the force on our side of the house are likely going to have desires to reform the system. These are individuals who have been wronged by the police
533.2,538.16," in the past. But second of all, there are plenty of ex-cons on our side of the house who are likely"
538.16,542.56," to join who are going to be people of color. This is true for two reasons. First, in high crime"
542.56,546.22," communities, people of color are often arrested the most to a disproportionate rate."
546.56,566.06," Look at the United States, for instance, where in a number of inner police because they know a family member who has been arrested, for instance,"
566.3,570.04, where they know that the police has historically been bad for their individual group.
570.52,577.22," What does this mean, then? It means that, number one, empathetic ex-cons and people of color hold positions of power on our side of the house."
577.44,583.58," These are individuals who can climb the forced ladder, who can become regional union officials, who can become precinct captains,"
583.82,588.34," and can make policy reforms such as more stringent accountability measures for police that go out of line,"
588.56,593.3," which charges abusive officers, and measures that enforce the wearing of body cams and more"
593.3,598.08," de-escalation training. Second of all, however, even if they don't get into positions of power,"
598.52,602.98, having a presence in and of itself means that you can check what other people say and feel.
603.14,610.06," If you're in a room with another Black man, for instance, who is a cop, you're less likely to do things like policy reforms that are racist,"
610.28,614.58," and you're less likely to do things like think before you speak. Moreover, it is just statistically"
614.58,619.06, better that we have more beat cops and patrols who relate to people on the ground. The weighing
619.06,623.54, of this argument is simple. The background checks on our side of the house are likely going to be a
623.54,626.62, fair approximation of who is allowed to get into our policy.
626.9,633.62, It is unlikely that the most violent and the most psychiatrically mentally ill person is going to get through our policy and going to be screened by.
633.86,648.58," But what is likely in our side of the house is that we have hundreds, maybe dozens in certain precincts of individuals who are actually empathetic to that person on the ground who's able to relate to the black teenager in Chicago in inner suburbs of the United States because they've been in that circumstance and"
648.58,653.38, they know the realities of circumstances of crime and being extremely poor and living in economic
653.38,659.14, destitution this policy therefore dramatically reduces the likelihood of police forces abusing
659.14,663.34, their power and we allow for individuals to be held accountable if it's a case that they abuse
663.34,669.06," their power when punishment is levied outside of the courtroom, every single convict lives a life sentence."
669.06,679.42, We're very proud to propose.
679.42,683.26, I thank that speaker for their speech.
683.26,689.96," If the other judges are not ready, please let me know. Otherwise,"
689.96,705.52, I'm happy to call up the leader of opposition here. Can everyone hear me? Can people hear me?
712.48,717.44," Panel, this policy damages the effectiveness of the police force and the public's ability to trust"
717.44,721.68," in that effectiveness. For that reason, on to the Mingling, we oppose two arguments in this speech."
721.68,728.88," First of all, on why we are delighted to get bad police officers on the cyber position second on how this damages public confidence in the police and in the second"
728.88,732.72, speech my second speaker is going to talk about how this damages the region within the police
732.72,737.12, force and why that's so damaging first what's our stance inside opposition we believe that we're
737.12,741.36, happy to provide jobs for conflicts we think rehabilitation is important the state itself
741.36,747.28," can provide work to these people if they're good for it the stigma isn't as high isn't as highly recognised for their abilities there. They can work with spire men,"
747.28,751.6," in public transport, utilities, maintenance etc. These provide them with a means of living without"
751.6,756.08, unique risk of making them police officers that side proposition wants to take on and we are very
756.08,759.6, happy to encourage them to make amends to the community in other ways or to use them as
759.6,763.28, informants and get information from them in particular cases we just don't think they should
763.28,768.56, be employed to carry out the roles of a police officer what's our response then to the proposition case so four main
768.56,772.4, areas here first of all with their model i told that there's likely to be extensive screening of
772.4,776.88, applicants to stop violent people getting into the system first this is purely an assertion there's
776.88,781.04, no explanation of why this is the case but second line of response is that this screening doesn't
781.04,789.12, work for non-convicts under the status quo it's unclear how it's going to work for pundits we think it's relatively easy to fake these things there will always be individuals who
789.12,793.2, slip through the facts of the measures they can identify exist for example when cousins are
793.2,797.6, very strong second on the principle they only devoted about a minute so i'm going to deal with
797.6,802.64, it very quickly the first line here is that these people have already paid for their sins first we
802.64,808.56, already weigh the safety of innocent people being more important we think we have the existence of criminal records and those kinds of
808.56,813.84, systems so that society can be protected but secondly they literally can see this entire
813.84,818.96, line of their principle in a pure while and we ask would you employ pdf to work in a school now panel
818.96,823.2, you might think this is an extreme example but know that the principle itself was incredibly
823.2,828.32, extreme there was no explanation of where we might impose restrictions on this principle or where it ought to be limited
828.32,832.64, based on that given that they completely conceded this example with no explanation i think they're
832.64,836.8, going to have to do a little more work if they want to be relevant in this debate but then they
836.8,840.88, say this is a disproportional punishment frankly we think this is an assertion but we do believe
840.88,846.76," one side opposition is completely proportional we think you've caused harm to others in the past, you shouldn't be allowed to cause"
846.76,848.24, more harm in the future.
848.24,850.24," Third, on helping ex-convicts."
850.24,852.24, We don't think this is exclusive to their side.
852.24,856.44," The specific analysis they give can clearly apply to other groups, or even to charity"
856.44,858.44, work specifically targeted at ex-convicts.
858.44,862.44, It's unclear why stability and structure are exclusive to their side.
862.44,863.44, This makes no sense.
863.44,865.72," Fourth, on improving the system."
865.72,869.84," We think that individuals who are empathetic to criminals, or those who want to structurally"
869.84,874.38," reform the police, are not going to be selected to join the force. We'll clash with this later,"
874.38,878.82," but note that this analysis is devastating to their case, because they rest their entire"
878.82,882.48, case on this idea that the people who are going to be selected are going to be those
882.48,888.32," who are very empathetic and are likely to make good changes, but don't think this is true first of all we think it's unlikely that"
888.32,891.92, we're going to get lots of people of color for example applying to join the police if you saw
891.92,895.92, your brother or father go to prison while the white man from the right side of town got off
895.92,900.72, spot three i think frankly you'll likely just want to avoid the police in the future otherwise i
900.72,904.8, don't think the earth would have a peaceful dominated almost entirely by white men but
904.8,908.4," no more will be expanding on later in our case, and this is crucial. The police are clear"
908.4,912.08," incentives to discriminate. First, Crop says they'll have more people of colour, but they're"
912.08,916.4, likely to be discriminated against in the hiring process for the reasons Proposition already gives.
916.4,920.8," But crucially, the police force are only likely to want those who are never going to be perceived"
920.8,924.96," as softer on crime, those who are going to be the most zealous, those who are going to insist that"
924.96,928.64, other convicts pay for their sins so that they can avoid the kinds of reputational
928.64,933.28, harms that people think are damaging. This ultimately leads to more brutality under their
933.28,937.84, side. Our first argument then on why a significant number of ex-convicts are likely to make bad
937.84,941.76," police officers. First question, it was what is special about police officers? Why do we want to"
941.76,948.0, limit entrants to this job specifically? we think police officers uniquely hold an immense amount of power they can detain and arrest individuals
948.0,953.2, they hold a great deal of legitimacy no individual should hold that unless we are certain that they
953.2,958.08, are able to exercise that responsibly if they make a mistake justice isn't done so what are the
958.08,961.92, different groups of criminals who might apply and be selected note that this clash is with the
961.92,968.32," incredibly simplistic stuff we get out of cyber opposition, which is these are nice people who are going to be sympathetic and now want to enforce"
968.32,973.28, the law. Let's engage with their best case. We think the ex-convicts who are most likely to sign
973.28,977.28, up and want to reform and enforce the law are going to be those who are most likely to be
977.28,982.0, overzealous and ruthless. The reason is that these people have been through the system themselves.
982.0,987.92, This means that they have seen firsthand the terrible things that criminals do every day in prisons they might be first-hand victims
987.92,993.04, of crime themselves inside prison and note that even if a wider right in ex-convicts applied to
993.04,997.44, these positions even if the group's proposition talks about applied to these positions the
997.44,1001.68, individuals most likely to be selected by the police are going to be the most zealous and
1001.68,1009.76, violent and tough on crime because the police force is going to be incredibly afraid of selecting ex-convicts who appear to be simply court criminals in case they
1009.76,1014.16, end up being soft on crime and damaging the effectiveness or perception of the police force
1014.16,1019.94, they will not select the african-american man who tells them they need structural reform and to lose
1019.94,1024.22, funding so they can give that to social workers they're going to hire the white guy who was
1024.22,1028.36, caught in a drug deal and is now out for revenge on the gangs he believes want him.
1028.36,1032.28, But the second group is criminals who seem to have performed but actually haven't. Because
1032.28,1036.4," aside from the side proposition of assertion, we think it's actually very difficult to tell"
1036.4,1040.84, whether a criminal has truly become a better person. We think all of these individuals
1040.84,1044.76," and the matter of their incentives have been proven to have criminal tendency. In the past,"
1044.76,1048.88, they've decided to put their own interests in front of the law and morality and they are therefore
1048.88,1055.28, uniquely likely to do so again we agree that the rehabilitation is currently extremely flawed but
1055.28,1060.0, note that this analysis itself come back to bite side proposition because it means these ex-convicts
1060.0,1065.76, are highly likely not to be reformed and therefore to do bad things or exercise poor judgment when
1065.76,1069.68, they're in these positions but even if these people only committed crimes of acquisition or
1069.68,1073.92, desperation note that our analysis still stands they're clearly willing to put their own priorities
1073.92,1078.48, above respecting the law a lot of people are in bad circumstances but we don't think that means
1078.48,1082.48, that everyone necessarily resorts to crime we think these are individuals who have shown that
1082.48,1086.8," if they are put under pressures they will likely be in situations where they're working in the police office,"
1087.1,1091.64, they're willing to make this particular decision. Note the nuance here in our argument. We aren't
1091.64,1095.8, saying that these are going to be people who are necessarily inherently bad or make bad decisions
1095.8,1100.04, in every aspect of their lives. It is far more nuanced than that. We are simply saying that given
1100.04,1104.54, all the framing we gave you at the start of this speech about how police officers are in a unique
1104.54,1105.68, position of power.
1105.68,1108.14, Their ability to do harm in these situations
1108.14,1110.04, massively outweighs any marginal benefits
1110.04,1111.9, side proposition might want to bring you
1111.9,1114.34, from a couple of criminals being able to find jobs
1114.34,1115.54, as police officers.
1115.54,1117.68, We think the impact of this is that you either get
1117.68,1120.88, massive brutality because police force are only hiring people
1120.88,1122.2, who are going to be overzealous
1122.2,1124.62, and who are very afraid of being perceived as software.
1124.62,1127.92," Or you get people who are likely to have links to crime themselves, who are going to be overzealous and who are very afraid of being perceived as software online or you get people who are likely to have links to crime themselves who are likely"
1127.92,1132.08, to make bad decisions or are likely to abuse that power before i want to talk about public
1132.08,1137.44, content in the piece sure you say that experience with crime makes you more overzealous but if your
1137.44,1141.12, experience with crime is being a criminal wouldn't it make you more sympathetic to being in your
1141.12,1145.5," engine i think you've misunderstood our analysis here Our explanation is that when you go into prison,"
1145.6,1147.92, you are very likely to become a part of a gang.
1148.02,1149.4, You are likely to be a victim of a gang.
1149.5,1151.02, You are likely to be a victim of further crime.
1151.26,1153.04, You are likely to see the very worst things
1153.04,1154.46, that criminals do to each other.
1154.64,1155.94, This is going to be incredibly damaging
1155.94,1157.94," because you perceive yourself as one of the good ones,"
1158.16,1160.68," one who has done their time and paid for their sins,"
1160.8,1162.66, but everyone else you perceive as bad
1162.66,1164.88, because you've seen the worst of what criminals can do
1164.88,1168.88," while you're inside prison. Second, on public confidence in the police we think many people are"
1168.88,1173.2, just genuinely afraid of convicts because they have bad experiences and if you know one conviction
1173.2,1176.8, done something where you've read a media story you can get all like that you view them as one
1176.8,1181.6, for multiple negative group this massively harms us if you implement this policy i know this isn't
1181.6,1187.0," contingent on the first point the perception that convicts are untrustworthy exists regardless of how good they actually are. We think in addition,"
1187.0,1191.0, the media is likely to make this perception entirely worse. This is likely to be a point
1191.0,1196.0," of actual policy, so its implementation will be advertised and prominent in public discussion,"
1196.0,1200.0, and the media will sensationalise these stories and make it dramatic. But note that this damage
1200.0,1203.0," has a particular impact on vulnerable groups like women. Now, when you're walking home"
1203.0,1207.44," alone on a dark street and you think someone might be following you, you are less likely to trust a"
1207.44,1211.6, police officer across the road because they could be a sex offender. Or if you're a member of an
1211.6,1217.04, ethnic minority you know that white supremacist ideology is uniquely powerful among white convicts
1217.04,1220.8," because ganders are organised in prisons along racial lines, you're far more likely to fear the"
1220.8,1225.76," police, you're far less likely to report a hate crime. For all these reasons, I'm so proud to oppose."
1231.44,1233.88, I stopped flowing at 8.15.
1233.88,1235.76, I appreciate that speech.
1235.76,1237.6, If the other judges are ready.
1240.48,1241.8, All right.
1241.8,1263.7, Happy to call up the Deputy Prime Minister if you're here.
1264.68,1266.68," Hello, can you hear me?"
1296.08,1296.44," Okay, I'd prefer POIs verbally if that's possible. The Court of England's case relies on an unproven and somewhat unsavory assumption about who ex-convicts are and how they live their lives."
1310.38,1311.0," According to First Opposition, ex-convicts are overzealous and brutal. They're violent. They think a person convicted at the age of 19 for smoking marijuana or something trivial like that is somehow morally equivalent to a pedophile, according to their POI."
1315.14,1315.64, Canada's characterization of ex-convicts by comparison was more realistic and more hopeful.
1319.52,1324.02," That many of these ex-convicts were people who made unfortunate mistakes, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, in the wrong color of skin, and that many of these people wanted to"
1324.02,1328.74," make the world better, or at the very least themselves a better shot a shot at a better life Canada thought"
1328.74,1332.3, this was the least they would deserve that is why we are proud to propose I'm going to talk about
1332.3,1336.62, four things in this speech first of all on who these ex-convicts are likely to be and what their
1336.62,1340.36, incentives are second of all I'll deal with the principal class in this round third I'll talk
1340.36,1344.38, about reforms to the police and then fourth I'll introduce a constructive argument on trust in law
1344.38,1347.76, enforcement will should respond to their second claim. On the first issue
1347.76,1352.32," of who these convicts are, I think much of England's case relies on a mechanism about"
1352.32,1356.88, the hiring process for some reason selecting for bad hard on crime people which is like fairly
1356.88,1361.6, unsubstantiated. I'm actually unsure why it is that police units for some reason want to hire
1361.6,1371.06, more violent people. We think it is far more likely that police units want to improve their legitimacy through hiring people who do not crack down or commit brutality.
1371.38,1376.22," This is actively bad press. In the wake of George Floyd, many police units had funding rescinded"
1376.22,1381.92, across the Western world for committing acts of brutality. And this is an active reason as to why
1381.92,1392.58," you would prefer people who are softer on crime. Also, because even to the extent that people within the police force might be somewhat, you know, have violent tendencies in the status quo for reasons they still don't explain."
1392.82,1395.62, There are also other actors that have effects over the hiring process.
1395.78,1407.72," So municipal governments, for instance, that participate in hiring processes of police officers, people who are police commissioners are at the top of the meat targets for reducing brutality in much of the world. So these are all reasons as to why you are unlikely to pick the most"
1407.72,1412.3," deranged versions of the comics. And even to the extent that you do, presumably you could have just"
1412.3,1415.96, found violent people who happen to not be convicts as well. And I'm actually unsure what the margin
1415.96,1420.98," is here. And then they say prisons are really bad. And there are things like gangs, which convert you"
1420.98,1424.98, into becoming more violent. I think our stance largely dealt with this in the sense that we said
1424.98,1425.58, the worst people
1425.58,1426.66, are likely to be filtered out
1426.66,1428.36," for things like psychiatric evaluations,"
1428.66,1429.22, through simulations.
1429.64,1432.28," And even to the extent that they ended up in the police,"
1432.48,1434.52, we talked to you about how in the introductory stages
1434.52,1435.58," of being a police officer,"
1435.84,1438.26," it is unlikely they are put on incredibly high risk tasks,"
1438.52,1440.26, such as facing an armed robbery.
1440.48,1442.34," And it's more likely that at the beginning of your career,"
1442.56,1444.26, they're put in pairs with other police officers.
1444.58,1447.08, They're forced to observe so that they can see how you react to different
1447.08,1450.84, situations. And so the worst apples are likely to be filtered out in our side. I don't think
1450.84,1454.14," they sufficiently respond to that. We also just give you a number of other reasons, which I don't"
1454.14,1459.5, think get response as to why the majority of people who are ex-convicts are nonviolent criminals to
1459.5,1463.96," begin with, how many of them are from racialized groups, how they're unjustly convicted. And I"
1463.96,1468.24, think second opposition speaker probably needs to deal with that secondly then talking about the principled
1468.24,1472.64, crash our claim from first was this unjustly excludes ex-convicts who had already been
1472.64,1476.64, punished i think they respond with examples and not analysis they say we already hold criminal
1476.64,1481.12, records therefore this means that we prioritize the safety of innocent people over people for
1481.12,1484.72, our conflicts the first thing is that obviously like i think we broadly oppose job discrimination
1484.72,1488.14," against people with criminal records and And secondly, they have this like"
1488.14,1492.14," pedophile example, which they repeatedly like. Let's talk about how we decide whether this is"
1492.14,1497.3, more analogous to a job discrimination or like pedophile school teachers. The first difference
1497.3,1503.58, between these cases is on the likelihood of harm. There's some possibility in any case of employment
1503.58,1506.28, that an ex-convict is going to cause some degree of harm.
1506.36,1509.06, So they say they would make the ex-convicts drive buses instead.
1509.34,1514.5," There's probably some possibility that an ex-convict harasses someone on a bus, for instance, or crashes a car."
1514.78,1519.58," So thus, the question in this round is how likely you are in different situations to be relatively more violent."
1519.58,1524.8," And I think in order for this to be analogous in any way to pedophile, I think to prove an incredibly high threshold of increased violence,"
1527.44,1531.02, I don't think they've done sufficiently in this round wrong the second is in the level of moral sympathy there are probably just zero good reasons for being a
1531.02,1535.7, pedophile and assaulting children by comparison there are many reasonable and under and
1535.7,1540.1, comprehensible explanations for why people would commit crime even if we think crime is broadly
1540.1,1549.3," bad we talked to you about how in many countries the the framework for crime is unjust that, that it artificially punishes things like petty crime or like non-violent drug consumption,"
1549.3,1552.96," which are not in reality moral crimes. We talked to you about racialization of crime,"
1552.96,1556.68, we got very little response. So that is why it's different from pedophiles. And notice the
1556.68,1560.82," intuition behind this claim as well, that we should never deprive someone of opportunity"
1560.82,1568.88," for the significant just cause. It is true across most societies, for instance, that racial minorities are more likely to commit violent crime due to structural economic reasons"
1568.88,1573.12, and racial oppression but it would be absurd to suggest as a result we should bar black people in
1573.12,1577.92, the us from the police force or indigenous people in australians from in australia from the police
1577.92,1582.16, force regardless of whether doing so would have marginal instrumental benefits because to bar
1582.16,1588.2, someone from employment on an arbitrary basis distorts their dignity and entitlement to fair treatment in an unacceptable way. So this is why
1588.2,1593.68," we win independently on the principle. Thirdly, in the speech that I'm talking about, the effects"
1593.68,1597.16," in terms of police culture. And I'm not spending a lot of time here, because I don't really respond"
1597.16,1600.82," to a lot of the arguments we give you from first. In terms of why this alters police culture,"
1600.82,1605.0, on why the violent police culture festers due to the absence of the oppressed people
1605.0,1608.74, in the room. The cops can make jokes about the criminals they've locked up. They can get away
1608.74,1613.04," with harassment in interrogation rooms. In the police car, they can make racial assumptions and"
1613.04,1617.12, get away with it because you have no people who are from the relevant community who are represented
1617.12,1620.78," in that situation. Secondly, we talked to you about racial composition, the fact that people"
1620.78,1624.98, from oppressed communities tend to have less internalized biases and tend to be more understanding
1624.98,1627.92," towards those who are racial groups, and that in communities where the proportion that people from oppressed communities tend to have less internalized biases and tend to be more understanding towards those who are racial groups and that in communities where the"
1627.92,1632.4, proportion of people who have were ex-convicts within a specific racial group is high talking
1632.4,1636.88, about a quarter of people in some black communities in the us it is likely to significantly alter the
1636.88,1640.96, racial composition of peace in a way which negatively affects their ability to execute
1640.96,1644.48, justice fairly before i talk about my constructive argument i'm happy to take a point about this one
1648.54,1652.98," who is a police officer who's been shot up by criminals more likely to employ? A black man who earnestly says there are structural problems with the police, or a man who"
1652.98,1657.84, says he hates all criminals and won't hesitate to pull the trigger? So I don't think there is a
1657.84,1661.42," binary between those two. We think there are like, A, I think I already responded to this when I"
1661.42,1674.6," talked to you for the incentives to reduce things like brutality, and there are probably people in between, or just generally dislike the effects that crime has on the community because they've been through that community, and yet think that there is an ability of people in high crime communities to do good."
1674.9,1685.2," On the third argument about how this improves trust in the police, and I'll just flag at the top of this directly responds to their like minute long second argument on public home law enforcement is impeded not only by its own"
1685.2,1689.96, misconduct by the perception that it is punitive and foreign that is an external force designed to
1689.96,1695.04, compromise harmony within communities we reduce this perception in prop in two ways the first is
1695.04,1698.96, through microscopic interactions that you have with the police please spend quite a lot of time
1698.96,1703.0, with ordinary people they visit schools and talk about their stories in many cases they sit in
1703.0,1705.8," coffee shops alongside families and children, and they know people"
1705.8,1706.66, and their personal lives.
1706.72,1709.8," So when you think of the police, now you think of your neighbor, George, who's from the same"
1709.8,1712.02," high crime area as you, rather than like Derek Chauvin."
1712.4,1716.22, This means that people are exposed to a new version and conception of the police.
1716.5,1719.5," They are conscious that these are people who have walked through the same streets, people"
1719.5,1723.2," have made the same mistakes, and people have lived in the same cramped cells and prison"
1723.2,1723.6, hallways.
1723.66,1728.64," On a macroscopic level, it means that the police are more racially similar to high crime communities that they police"
1728.64,1733.52, as we point out earlier and first that keeping these people out of out of the police meaningfully
1733.52,1737.04, tilts the racial composition of the peace towards white privileged people who have very little in
1737.04,1740.8, common and very little personal connection for the communities they please and the important
1740.8,1745.22, implication is that trust receives full engagement with law enforcement.
1749.38,1749.44, It is scary for a woman of color experiencing domestic violence or a Black kid in the U.S.
1752.96,1754.7, who is mugged on the street to speak to a force that they see as oppressive towards their community and as inadequate.
1755.16,1758.68," A sense of personal connection bridges this gap, and because it means that you have the"
1758.68,1762.84," belief that the officer will not be judgmental towards you, you have some common ground upon"
1762.84,1763.62, which you can connect.
1763.86,1768.72," This means that more victims of crime receive justice and hope in our world, and even on their metric of"
1768.72,1773.26," saving innocent people, we are far more likely to have people have justice delivered towards them"
1773.26,1777.38," after the fact. In opposition, these people are less fearful and silent to speak out. We think"
1777.38,1781.78," that is far worse. When punishment is levied outside the courtroom, every convict serves a"
1781.78,1793.5, lifetime sentence. We're incredibly proud of those those i thank that speaker for their speech the other judges are ready i'm happy to call up
1793.5,1796.46, the deputy leader of opposition to continue the case for opposition side here
1796.46,1812.16, my other books Don't let props slander us.
1812.16,1814.36, We aren't assuming things about criminals.
1814.36,1818.12, We are assuming things about the kinds of criminals who are going to sign up to this
1818.12,1820.42, and the kinds of criminals who are going to be accepted.
1820.42,1821.42, We never made assumptions.
1821.42,1822.42, We gave you incentives.
1822.42,1828.54," First, on top of the principle, then on who is likely to sign up and be accepted and why they're going to make the system worse."
1829.0,1833.52," Then I want to talk about trust in the system. And finally, on why you hurt cohesion within the police force."
1833.7,1838.88," First, on the principle, three responses to this. A, we can hire these people in other ways."
1839.06,1849.52," If the important thing is that we give them opportunities, ultimately, we can provide alternative opportunities that do not have the same level of societal risk we can make them firefighters we can employ them in public transport"
1849.52,1855.12, utilities second response prompt two conceded this class was dependent on the practical she conceded
1855.12,1860.0, in the cases where the risk is sufficiently high that ultimately we don't need to hire these people
1860.0,1868.88," i want to prove why that risk is going to be high on their side in the next clash. Third of all, on the idea of unfair imprisonment, the point here is that if certain people are"
1868.88,1874.32," imprisoned unfairly, the solution to this isn't to abolish old prisons, the point is to,"
1874.32,1879.04," the solution presumably would be to eliminate the points of unfairness. Therefore, the idea that"
1879.04,1884.08, people are unfairly treated at one point down in the criminal justice system doesn't mean that
1884.08,1885.28, everything down the line
1885.28,1889.04, should be affected it means you should improve that specific component of it therefore the
1889.04,1894.16, principle is not in the debate first of all on who is likely to sign up i want to take out the idea
1894.16,1898.8, of the two groups of people who they think are likely to sign up one they think people of color
1898.8,1902.96, are going to sign up and be accepted we think this is wrong because as proposition told you
1902.96,1907.4," the police force is likely to be quite racist, which means they're likely to discriminate against those individuals."
1907.72,1908.52, Prop gave you that analysis.
1908.92,1913.18," Second of all, they say the people who sign up are going to be the ones who want to reform the system."
1913.54,1914.1, That's wrong.
1914.32,1921.2," If you're an individual who was victimized by the police in the past, you don't want to join the police because you hate the police and you hate police officers."
1921.42,1927.68, You don't want to go into your job every day and have to work with people. You don't want to cooperate or be subjugated by the system
1927.68,1929.84, because the chance of you improving the system
1929.84,1932.16, is incredibly small because you are a cog
1932.16,1933.68," within a massive, massive machine,"
1933.68,1935.62, which means people who want to reform the system
1935.62,1937.24, or who have been victimized by the police
1937.24,1939.52, have no incentive to sign up.
1939.52,1940.94," On the other, let's respond to the things"
1940.94,1942.24, they told you about.
1942.24,1944.62," First of all, they say, well, there's external influence,"
1944.62,1946.16," the things like municipal bodies, and that of all, they say, well, there's external influence. I think that you need to both bodies"
1946.16,1947.56, and that ultimately they have incentives
1947.56,1948.84, to appear legitimate.
1948.84,1950.44, The problem is twofold.
1950.44,1953.32," First of all, Black Lives Matter is a minority movement"
1953.32,1956.0," and ultimately the most powerful people in communities,"
1956.0,1958.0, those who are most likely to be relatively wealthy
1958.0,1960.76," and privileged are ones who want to be tough on crime,"
1960.76,1963.8," which means their incentives do not be soft on crime,"
1963.8,1968.96, but ultimately to employ those people who are going to be relatively zealous secondly even if you have some kind of external
1968.96,1973.44, influence police unions are incredibly powerful and are likely going to demand a huge amount of
1973.44,1978.48, power over the system the next thing they say elishka says is well what's the margin on both
1978.48,1983.04, sides of the house they're going to be hiring relatively zealous people the the point is the
1983.04,1985.24, degree to which they're likely to be zealous and abusive.
1985.52,1989.84," On our side of the house, you might hire police officers who are somewhat privileged and who vaguely"
1989.84,1994.3," dislike crime. But on their side of the house, you're going to be hiring people with personal"
1994.3,1999.6," reasons to be incredibly hateful towards criminals. That is to say, they're likely to despise"
1999.6,2004.14, criminals and to want to crack down on them as much as possible. What is the reason for this?
2004.14,2007.5," The reason is the point at which individuals go into prison,"
2007.9,2011.16, the biggest threat to you is not the criminal justice system.
2011.4,2013.64, The biggest threat to you is other criminals.
2013.9,2016.62, It's other criminals who are likely going to force you into joining a gang.
2016.9,2020.06, Other criminals who are most likely to make you a victim of prison rape.
2020.3,2022.58," Other criminals who are likely to murder or threaten you,"
2022.58,2027.2, which means your biggest source of personal hatred is towards other criminals.
2027.56,2035.16," These are people who are going to sign up, and they're likely to be significantly more zealous and abusive than ordinary people you might hire elsewhere."
2035.56,2036.78, That is crucial.
2037.14,2040.5," We think, therefore, at the end of the day, the police aren't going to be hiring moderates."
2040.72,2048.56, They're going to be hiring the ones who are victims of drug deals and therefore want to be incredibly harsh on drug crime the next thing they say is well they're going to filter these
2048.56,2052.8, people out we told you this is impossible for the two reasons my gave you that were not responded to
2052.8,2058.0, a you just can't read someone's mind just unclear how this works but b this filtering clearly
2058.0,2062.48, doesn't work in the status quo given the extent of abuse we already see so it's unclear how they're
2062.48,2065.52, going to be able to apply it to criminals.
2070.08,2073.84," Finally, we think ultimately the people who are most likely to sign up and be promoted within the criminal justice system are going to be the ones who are farcist on crime. These are the ones"
2073.84,2077.92," who are going to be making the hiring and firing decisions, which is an additional reason why these"
2077.92,2082.96," people are likely to be bad. So therefore, in the best case scenario, individuals who are likely to"
2082.96,2088.06, genuinely reformed are likely to be significantly more abusive than ordinary police officers.
2088.36,2090.72," But let's talk about the second group, which wasn't engaged with."
2090.96,2096.18," We think ultimately the rest of convicts, convicts that they hire, you open their wrists to other forms of abuse."
2096.18,2098.82," That is to say, it's incredibly difficult to screen individuals."
2099.12,2109.28," And we think that people may not be fully trustworthy, even if they've proven to have some kind of criminal faculties, i.e. they put the law before themselves. These are two unique groups of people, both of them are worse than"
2109.28,2113.92, ordinary police officers. The second clash is on the idea of the perception of the police and
2113.92,2118.24, criminals. Their argument is that it's good to have relatively accessible people who you can
2118.24,2123.12," engage with. Two responses. A. As Maya explains to you, the dominant prevailing narrative is that"
2123.12,2126.06, convicts are stigmatized broadly in the status quo
2126.06,2127.04, because they're viewed as a threat
2127.04,2128.88, to the fabric of society.
2128.88,2131.14," The second thing is even in these minority areas,"
2131.14,2133.64," if there are incentives for the police to appear legitimate,"
2133.64,2135.74, then they can hire certain minority policemen
2135.74,2137.04, on our side of the house.
2137.04,2139.64, The difference is whether you hire minority individuals
2139.64,2142.56, who have hurt that community by engaging in crime.
2142.56,2145.32," Thus, we think that because you as a potential"
2145.32,2149.6, member of the public cannot tell which people were convicts and which policemen were not
2149.6,2154.0," convicts, you're likely to distrust convicts as a whole, given the extent to which crime"
2154.0,2158.76," hurts these people on a daily basis. Therefore, we think the most vulnerable people, i.e."
2158.76,2162.76," for example women who might be subject to, for example, sexual abuse, are ultimately"
2162.76,2165.68, going to be less likely to be able to or to feel
2165.68,2169.68, confident in calling upon the resources of the state given that they're likely to target the
2169.68,2175.6, entire brush the reason is the immediate story saying that police officers like ex-convicts do
2175.6,2180.64, their job well isn't a big story but if a single ex-convict abused their position it's likely to
2180.64,2185.6," be heavily publicized even these stigma against convicts, which means you massively increase stigma towards the police."
2185.72,2186.24, I'll take a P.O.I.
2187.44,2190.9, So I think you basically engage exclusively with cases of violent crime.
2190.96,2195.46, Why should a person who commits like a drug crime when they're pretty young serves a few months and doesn't.
2196.46,2198.2," No, I gave you this example, right?"
2198.34,2205.04," If you did a drug crime, that means you were a victim of drug dealing, which means you are likely to despise drug dealers and the"
2205.04,2209.52, effects they had in your community which means you're going to be incredibly harsh on drug crime
2209.52,2214.16, okay i gave you that example so why does this hurt cohesion within the police force we think
2214.16,2218.32, cohesion is incredibly crucial in the police the police need to be able to work together to enforce
2218.32,2223.2, the law because it's an intense job where trust is crucial during an investigation when you're in a
2223.2,2229.28," high pressure situation your life will depend upon your co-workers, given that you need to be making very quick decisions."
2229.68,2233.32, Why is there likely going to be mistrust here? We think the police are likely going to have a
2233.32,2238.66, general hatred towards and prejudice towards convicts. We think the police are likely going
2238.66,2242.3," to be individual to hold a relatively high principled view of the law, and are likely"
2242.3,2249.52," to dislike those who break it. But also, we think that police are likely to associate ex-convicts with the people who put their lives"
2249.52,2254.8, in danger every single day. The final reason why these people are likely to be mistrusted within
2254.8,2259.12, the police force is that they have proven poor judgment and that therefore are likely to be
2259.12,2264.16, perceived to have associations with crime. The point here is that this takes out a lot of the
2264.16,2265.2," proposition case because a lot of the proposition case,"
2269.08,2272.72," because a lot of the proposition case suggests that these convicts might get promoted. They might do well in the system. You'll be able to convince other police officers to do well,"
2272.9,2276.16, but that's not going to happen at the point in which they're likely to be mistrusted. They're
2276.16,2280.72," likely to be ostracized. In fact, that's the reason why these convicts are likely to be even"
2280.72,2285.52," more overzealous, because they need to do an overly aggressive job in order to gain the"
2285.52,2290.96, trust of their other police co-workers in order to be perceived as someone who is not a criminal
2290.96,2295.52, and therefore wants to be someone who is harsher on client at the end of the day black lives matter
2295.52,2299.44, is not a mainstream movement the most powerful people in communities have incentives to push
2299.44,2303.6, the police to be harsh on client which means the police are likely to hire individuals who are
2303.6,2307.76, going to be harsher than ordinary police officers that's our margin we're proud to oppose
2316.0,2326.0," okay thank that speaker for their speech if other judges are ready happy to call up the GovWIP. Hello, can you hear me?"
2327.34,2327.86, Great.
2328.3,2330.32, I'll take verbal POIs.
2331.06,2335.08," I'll start in three, two, one."
2336.28,2340.64, Opposition's case and almost all of their material rely on psychological assertions
2340.64,2345.2," of possible reactions to experiences in prison, of possible reactions to experiences in the workplace, and of possible reactions to experiences in prison of possible reactions to experiences"
2345.2,2349.76, in the workplace and of possible reactions from the community what they never give you are
2349.76,2354.8, structural and analytical reasons as to why our best case scenario which we frame from the top
2354.8,2359.76, is the consistent with most forms of crime is a bad thing on our side of the house
2359.76,2364.56, when punishment is levied outside the courtroom every convict serves a life sentence two themes
2364.56,2365.48, in this speech firstly on convicts and life sentence. Two themes in this speech.
2365.64,2368.08," Firstly, on convicts, and then secondly, on policing."
2368.2,2372.02," And I want to talk about our principal first year, because it receives very, very poor"
2372.02,2372.56, engagement.
2372.94,2378.62, The first thing they say in their second speech is that you can hire criminals to other jobs.
2378.7,2380.48," So clearly, they don't have fiat to do this."
2380.5,2384.04, So they have to convince you and give you some likelihood analysis as to why convicts
2384.04,2387.9," are likely to access these jobs. They give you no such analysis, so you shouldn't count this point"
2387.9,2392.04, anyway. But let me give you some reasons why it's unlikely they hire for other jobs. The first thing
2392.04,2397.02," to note is that police is a uniquely undesirable job, right? It's hard. You're walking the beat."
2397.14,2401.16, You're risking your life. You're putting a lot on the line when you're a police officer. That's not
2401.16,2404.74," true of firefighters, and it's not true of public transport drivers, which are the examples they"
2404.74,2407.6, give. And that means that convicts have a unique advantage when applying
2407.6,2412.24," to police jobs, because they don't have to compete with average people who also want jobs. So we"
2412.24,2416.46, think it's unlikely that people are able to get jobs with the state. We think convicts are unlikely
2416.46,2420.2," to get jobs with businesses, because it just looks really, really bad for those businesses."
2420.56,2423.7," The second thing to note about these jobs, as Anushka points out, and they never deal with,"
2423.86,2429.54, is why it's better to have a convict a like public transport driver who's alone with a
2429.54,2433.56, woman on a bus at night why that same distrust and that same potential for abuse doesn't exist
2433.56,2437.22, on their side so this response doesn't make any sense the second thing they say is this is hinged
2437.22,2440.82, on practical risk and then they kind of give a third response which says you should specifically
2440.82,2444.54, improve the unfairness of the system and these are linked together because essentially what they're
2444.54,2448.56, saying here is whichever side proves a more apt solution to unfairness in the system as
2448.56,2452.88, opposed to genuine guilt is the side that wins this debate and i just want to note here that on
2452.88,2456.24, opposition it is their solution that is general because if you look at the motion they're
2456.24,2460.64, disallowing all convicts not just murderers not just rapists not just people who did assault
2460.64,2469.06," all convicts from working in the police force but it is obvious in this round that not every convict shares a same level of responsibility, and some convicts obviously"
2469.06,2472.9," have no responsibility for their crimes at all, given that some innocent people are convicted."
2473.26,2477.56," And so if you recognize that fact, you just have to consider if we would do what they are proposing"
2477.56,2481.96, to do in any other situation in life. Would we prohibit every single African American from
2481.96,2488.06, working in the police force because they are slightly more likely than other populations to be criminals. Of course we wouldn't because we're punishing
2488.06,2492.84, innocent people who did nothing wrong or did very little wrong to protect the community from a few
2492.84,2498.38," bad offenders. And so principally we think, our principle stands, right? We should weigh the right"
2498.38,2502.32," of these people to work these jobs, to not be discriminated against, not to be treated unfairly"
2502.32,2508.92, over even some minor or even slightly significant harms to social safety. So we think we prove our principle and their responses do not
2508.92,2513.3," stand there. Secondly, then, under the theme of convicts on jobs and the comparative, and I think"
2513.3,2517.42, this is another important theme. So we tell you why being a cop is a uniquely good job on our
2517.42,2520.58," side of the house. I've already dealt with why there are no comparative jobs, but I think this"
2520.58,2524.38," also deals with a lot of their constructive material on abuse, because the question they"
2524.38,2525.72," never ask in their speeches is,"
2526.26,2533.74," what are people, even in their best case, what are these overzealous people who hate the state and hate other criminals likely to do if they can't become cops?"
2533.82,2538.68," What's the comparative? Well, these people are already criminals. They're violent criminals, as characterized by opposition."
2538.92,2543.5," And it seems pretty intuitive that maybe they just keep doing crime. I mean, they don't have access to good jobs, as I framed."
2543.8,2547.42, They don't have access to prestige. They don't really have a way to make a better life. Nobody's
2547.42,2551.32, trained them out of their anger issues. Maybe they just do crimes. Why is it better that these people
2551.32,2556.3," are on the force, even if our worst case? Firstly, because they access a steady income. Secondly,"
2556.42,2560.06," because we give them a sense of purpose at the point at which we give them a steady job. Thirdly,"
2560.1,2563.4, because there's a degree of accountability and monitoring that comes with being a cop. You have
2563.4,2568.5," a partner, you have supervisors watching over you. And fourthly, because we give you psychiatric and"
2568.5,2572.86, de-escalation training that can help manage anger issues that often plague violent criminals. And so
2572.86,2576.9," we think on our side of the house, even in their very best case, where they do get these violent"
2576.9,2580.42," offenders on the force and they aren't screened out, we prove a better comparative because we'd"
2580.42,2584.5, rather these people be under watch than be out on the street. I'll take a PY before I move on.
2585.26,2588.56," Given this is a policy motion, we can have the FIAT introduce an alternative"
2588.56,2591.92," and hire these people in other public services, utilities, etc."
2592.3,2595.34," Yeah, we can have FIAT if we say it in first, not in third op."
2595.4,2595.98, What is this?
2596.24,2597.74, Second theme then on policing.
2598.18,2599.48," Firstly, on policing reform."
2599.64,2603.68, We give you a lot of structural mechanisms that are pretty poorly engaged with on their side.
2603.84,2608.9, They essentially give you a bunch of psychological counter-assertions. So the first and key mechanism in their case is
2608.9,2612.74, that people who are criminals are overzealous against other criminals because they go to prison
2612.74,2616.56, and they get hurt. So the first thing we note down bench is this applies in a select number
2616.56,2620.6," of circumstances, namely when A, these people have actually been victimized by other criminals,"
2620.72,2628.6," which is by no means the case in every situation. Secondly, when they value that victimization more highly than their victimization by the state that imprisoned them. And thirdly,"
2628.64,2633.24, when the specific way that victimization plays out in the real world is like this weird act of
2633.24,2637.82, taking revenge on other criminals in some sort of punisher fantasy. We think this is incredibly
2637.82,2641.8," unlikely to affect the majority of cases, and the analysis we give you is much structurally"
2641.8,2648.7," more reasonable. What is our analysis? Very simple. If you are a criminal, you understand what drives people to crime. If you understand what drives"
2648.7,2652.12," people to crime, you naturally understand other criminals. And when you have understanding for"
2652.12,2656.02," someone, you're more sympathetic towards them inherently. This is a simple mechanism that"
2656.02,2660.42," applies in all cases in the majority of crimes of acquisition of non-aligned offenders, of drug"
2660.42,2664.28," offenders, of innocent people. Most people who commit crimes, this logic applies to. We think"
2664.28,2668.16, we outweigh them on that point. And we think we do access our benefits of better policing here right
2668.16,2672.08, we say these people have more empathy for other criminals they encounter on the street it's harder
2672.08,2675.92, for an us versus them mentality to form when you have somebody who has been on both sides of the
2675.92,2680.56, aisle in the convict world and the police world a lot of bad police encounters in fact the worst
2680.56,2684.88, police encounters where things escalate are caused by this us versus them mentality that's not
2684.88,2687.16, something they ever sufficiently respond to on their side.
2687.34,2692.64," Now, they do say that for some reason, no POC or empathetic people will ever be hired by the police force."
2692.78,2693.92, And I just think this is ridiculous.
2694.26,2700.84," The first thing to note is they make this assumption throughout their case that like you come to a job interview and you're like, I want to structurally reform the police force."
2700.94,2702.74, I don't think that's an interview question that's ever asked.
2702.74,2707.98, I think it's probably you hire people generally based on skills and maybe some reformers get on the police force
2707.98,2714.1, and that's fine the second thing they say is that in the cases where criminals did crimes they're
2714.1,2718.3, just always likely to be worse police officers than the status quo we think that's just untrue
2718.3,2722.8, right even though they say they try to frame that like small offenders still committed crimes that
2722.8,2727.4, I think they're above the law we think there are a lot of other compelling reasons to make crimes. You're economically desperate.
2727.6,2731.3, You made a mistake. Maybe you legitimately changed as a person. All of these things
2731.3,2735.74, structurally factor in why they're not likely to be worse than the average person responding
2735.74,2739.76, to situations. And then we give you additional characterization on why they understand criminals
2739.76,2744.46," better and perception improves. And let's talk about perception briefly then. Well, what do we"
2744.46,2748.56," say in our perception argument? It's specific and clear. The community that you are a part of,"
2748.6,2753.3," the high crime community, sees you as a police officer rather than Derek Chauvin. You are more"
2753.3,2757.26, representative and you have personal contact and relationships with criminals rather than being
2757.26,2761.34, this sort of outside force that's imposed on a community. And so we think the actual community
2761.34,2767.7," you are policing is more likely to trust you. So even if they prove some of their perception stuff, which is kind of silly, they don't"
2767.7,2771.68, prove a tipping point because cops only operate in the community that they're actually in.
2771.74,2774.16, So only trust of the cops within a community matters.
2774.46,2776.22," Arguments specific, theirs is very general."
2776.42,2778.18, Why does their perception argument not stand though?
2778.32,2780.98, I don't think it's a tipping point for most people for calling the cops.
2780.98,2784.6," If you think the cops have like some criminals, you're probably more scared of the crime."
2784.84,2787.56, The difference on our side is years and years of police abuse which needs
2787.56,2792.8, to be overcome not this new policy that just came out yesterday we think finally i've been engaging
2792.8,2796.62, with their best case throughout the whole speech we give you very convincing reasons and stance
2796.62,2800.98, why bad people can't join the force to begin with you have to take psyche vows you have to do live
2800.98,2804.66, fire training that tests your reaction and your discrimination you have to have background checks
2804.66,2805.68, you have a probationary period.
2805.76,2806.38, You have a partner.
2806.7,2808.08, You take low risk jobs initially.
2808.32,2812.36, There's checks at every single step of the way to prevent bad people from accessing these
2812.36,2812.66, systems.
2812.92,2816.44, And so we think even though we win on the best characterization and the best case that
2816.44,2820.44," op gives us something they never do the charity of engaging with on their side, we actually"
2820.44,2823.8, prove a big likelihood why these criminals never joined the force to begin with.
2823.88,2826.18," And in that situation, we clearly win this round."
2826.18,2828.8," So for those reasons, please, please vote prop."
2835.82,2838.22, I think that speaker heard their speech.
2839.42,2840.82, The other judges are ready.
2842.72,2862.68, I'm happy to call the opposition whip. You're here.
2864.04,2867.0," Hi, am I audible and visible?"
2867.0,2870.0," Perfect, thank you."
2870.0,2893.28," I'll take your eyes verbally please. When the police are interviewing candidates to join the force, they're not going to employ"
2893.28,2897.86, the black man who earnestly explains how his own poor upbringing led him to be forced into
2897.86,2901.82, crime and how the police force needs to be reformed if we're going to have better practical
2901.82,2907.0," outcomes for everyone. They want to know that when they're in a firefight with a drug dealer,"
2907.0,2910.0, they want to know you're going to not hesitate to pull the trigger.
2910.0,2915.0, You're going to be tough on crime because those criminals are evil and have shot at their friends.
2915.0,2919.0, That's what this debate was about. And Canada refused to engage with that.
2919.0,2922.0," Three points of passion in this speech, firstly on rehabilitation of convicts,"
2922.0,2928.7," secondly, on who gets better policing and finally on trust in the police. First of all, on the rehabilitation of conflicts. And I'm"
2928.7,2932.44," starting with this because I think it is the least important clash in this debate, and it's very quick"
2932.44,2937.18, to resolve through our side. The main problem with Canada's analysis here is that we are never given
2937.18,2942.06, a reason why the only way we can rehabilitate these people is by letting them join the police.
2942.3,2947.72," The first thing they say is that this is a solid economic opportunity for people who are low-level criminals or people of colour,"
2947.92,2949.98, and we'd rather them have this job than re-affect.
2950.32,2953.82," I'm not sure why this is the only job that they are able to do,"
2953.88,2955.96, which gives them money in order to improve their life.
2956.34,2958.44, What's their response to this claim? Because we raised it earlier.
2958.7,2961.58," They say, well, you can't get any other jobs because everyone hates convicts,"
2961.62,2963.1, everyone's scared of them and they're untrusted.
2963.66,2968.24," Hang on, panel, I want to point out here this contradicts with their later analysis when they say that"
2968.24,2972.32, they're going to massively improve trust in police because somehow everyone loves convicts and feels
2972.32,2976.32," safe when they're patrolling the streets. But secondly, we think in the same way that prop has"
2976.32,2981.2," to be up to allow these people to apply for police jobs, we can let them apply for other public"
2981.2,2986.56," service jobs. We pointed this out at the beginning of Maya's speech as the first point in our stance,"
2986.68,2988.42," and we pointed out again in APOI,"
2988.48,2989.46, at which point they concede
2989.46,2992.24, that this does indeed take out their analysis here.
2992.52,2994.48," And all they can say is that we didn't mention this in first,"
2994.62,2996.26, so we can't be at it in third.
2996.48,2999.2," Now, either Canada were not listening to Maya's speech panel,"
2999.2,3001.26, or they are trying to mislead you.
3001.46,3003.56, Either of those is not enough to win them this debate.
3003.92,3007.9," Secondly, they tried to tie this into a principle. They say that they've served their sentence and they've paid"
3007.9,3011.7," for their sins, and therefore we can't continue to restrict them. We just don't think this is"
3011.7,3016.64," empirically true. We think we regularly convict, we continue to have restrictions on convicts"
3016.64,3020.1, throughout their lives. This is why we have criminal records. This is why we don't let sex
3020.1,3024.56, offenders work in schools. And they accept that obviously we should restrict some convicts to
3024.56,3029.28, some extent. They just say we need to prove a high amount of harm in order to restrict them. Recognised that
3029.28,3033.6, in saying that they can see that this principle is entirely practically contingent so I'm not sure
3033.6,3038.32, why then in the next sentence they say that they're able to win independently on it. But we think that
3038.32,3043.2," this does have a massive amount of practical harm. We think giving them a gun, letting them represent"
3043.2,3048.92," the government, putting them in a position where there is massive trust placed in them is obviously a massive risk which"
3048.92,3052.42, we are not willing to take. And we don't think it matters if they were forced into this crime
3052.42,3056.86," out of necessity, because many people are in poverty and they do not turn to crime. And no,"
3056.92,3061.54," panel, that their final genuinely quite insulting response to this is to say that this is morally"
3061.54,3068.96, equivalent to banning Black people from the police force. We don't ban black people from the police force because that is racism. We ban convicts because
3068.96,3073.76," they present more risks to the force, which is obviously not morally equivalent. We can then"
3073.76,3077.44," we clearly take out their principle and show where their analysis doesn't stand, but let's talk about"
3077.44,3081.84," who gets better for policing because this is the most substantial clash of the debate. Firstly,"
3081.84,3085.78, they talk about reforming the force. They say that these people understand the reality of life
3085.78,3086.86, and they're going to be sympathetic.
3086.86,3087.98, They're going to be less harsh.
3087.98,3090.82, And this leads to structural reform in the police.
3090.82,3094.82," Their first response is that we told you that instead,"
3094.82,3096.3, the people who are likely to get these jobs
3096.3,3097.88," are going to be the ones who are overzealous,"
3097.88,3099.12," who appear tough on crime,"
3099.12,3101.74, who have the same attitudes as the police officers
3101.74,3102.64, in their interview.
3102.64,3103.92," Their first response is to say,"
3103.92,3105.64, not all convicts are those overzealous people.
3105.84,3109.8, That's crazy psychoanalysis from Team England.
3110.0,3111.8," Let me be abundantly clear here,"
3112.0,3114.44," panel, because every one of us has responded to this."
3114.64,3117.72, And I can only assume that Canada are willfully misunderstanding.
3117.92,3120.96, It may be true that many ex-convicts are not overzealous.
3121.16,3124.32, It may even be true that most ex-convicts are not overzealous.
3124.36,3129.48, Take a second to note this down. Our burden was to show that the ones who apply to join the police and
3129.48,3133.5, the ones who are accepted by the police are going to be the ones who are overzealous. And know that
3133.5,3137.48, this doesn't mean they're violent criminals. It means that they've been exposed to violent crime.
3137.56,3141.32, It means that they hate the violent criminals that they met while in prison. And the reason why they
3141.32,3147.72, want to join the police force is to do something about it. They say in response that police forces don't have the incentive to employ someone who appears
3147.72,3152.16, harsh on crime. Three responses here. I want you to take a second to think how counterintuitive
3152.16,3157.36, this claim is. The role of the police is to clamp down on crime. Obviously they want to employ
3157.36,3161.92, someone who will clamp down on crime. We think this very much is a question that is asked in
3161.92,3169.92," your interview because it directly relates to how good you are at your job. Secondly, know that simply asserting that Black Lives Matter happened doesn't mean now"
3169.92,3174.34," that the police are trying to employ someone who, in Canada's own words, are soft on crime."
3174.6,3179.04," We think the police force is dominated by people who have spent their entire lives fighting crime,"
3179.04,3183.84," who have been shot at by criminals, who believe that criminals are evil people who cannot be"
3183.84,3185.2, allowed to continue offending.
3185.5,3189.74," This is the prevalent culture within the police force, not that Black Lives Matter and that the"
3189.74,3194.2, police needs to report and recognise that that is the exact structural reason that police brutality
3194.2,3199.58," is a problem in the first place. But I want you to recognise, panel, that even if the incentives"
3199.58,3204.18," to cut down on police brutality do exist among police officers, they probably prioritise their"
3204.18,3205.68, own safety over the
3205.68,3209.76," idea of improving the force. Because even if they believe that racism is bad, they are much more"
3209.76,3214.16," worried about employing someone who may be soft on crime, or who may not pull the trigger when you're"
3214.16,3217.6," under threat. This is a much more pressing issue for them, and something that they're much more"
3217.6,3221.68," likely to consider highly when they're interviewing you. But I want to be charitable, because Canada"
3221.68,3225.06, never was. Let's take them at their best case and say they do get the job.
3228.4,3228.74," Even if they do, once you're on duty with another officer,"
3231.02,3231.22," someone who isn't a convict, and to take their own example,"
3233.52,3233.76," you see a black man walking home after curfew,"
3235.28,3235.52, what do Canada really think happens?
3236.98,3237.22," Because when the ex-convict says,"
3238.98,3239.04," actually, maybe we shouldn't pull this man over."
3240.4,3243.02, I'm sure he's not doing anything bad. Or he gets angry at his colleague for being too harsh on him.
3243.26,3248.5, The biases of his colleague are reinforced. And this person is likely to be dismissed or never promoted in the force in the
3248.5,3251.86, first place. That means their nebulous impacts of them getting to the top of the police force
3251.86,3256.66," and changing policy never stand in this debate. Finally, though, if you don't buy any of that,"
3256.86,3260.04," I'm not sure why this is the only route for these people to reform the police. I mean,"
3260.06,3263.4," they can get into charity work. They can do many other things in social services,"
3263.4,3268.4, which should also lead to this change. Thisbuttal is important this was their most substantial point which they spent the
3268.4,3273.28, fault of their case on and we show why their analysis is incredibly why our characterization
3273.28,3278.0, is much more realistic before i go on i'll take a few lines sure so maybe there's some initial
3278.0,3281.68, suspicion of officers hiring these people but there's six month probationary periods and
3281.68,3285.9, training periods where you can form direct personal relationships and you don't have to rely on these stereotypes.
3286.2,3290.62," During that time, you have an incentive to appear as strong on crime as possible because that's what"
3290.62,3294.66, the people above you want to do. We think that is exactly why they're going to be harsh on crime.
3294.9,3299.2, But also those are the people most likely to apply for these jobs in the first place. We told you
3299.2,3302.78," there are two groups of ex-convicts likely to get jobs. The ones with the overzealous ones,"
3303.0,3307.76," and note we think these groups are the most persuasive ones, these are the people who are being overly harsh, who are more"
3307.76,3312.24, willing to pull the trigger when it is unnecessary. You get all of the bad impacts that a proposition
3312.24,3315.68," wants to talk about. But the second group is those who have not performed, and know that they never"
3315.68,3320.8, respond to the damning impacts of letting these people in who are actively detrimental to policing.
3320.8,3324.32," They never engage with this because they believe their case directly cashed with it, but given that"
3324.32,3327.22," we've shown that our characterisation of these ex-convicts is more realistic,"
3327.5,3331.92," we win on the most important clash of who gets better policing. Finally, on trust in the police."
3332.1,3335.5," I've already pointed out that they contradicted their analysis earlier, so I'm not sure how much"
3335.5,3340.02, more I need to do here. But let's talk about which of our claims is more plausible. They say that
3340.02,3343.28, people will see there are convicts in the police force and so people are going to trust them more
3343.28,3347.44, because people relate to convicts. We say people are much more likely to fear convicts
3347.44,3349.54, and that fear will be imprinted on the police.
3349.54,3351.52, The only analysis they give for that claim
3351.52,3353.66, is that people currently believe that police are separate
3353.66,3354.96, and they have no common ground.
3354.96,3356.9, I'm not sure why you need the police officer
3356.9,3358.8, to be a convict to change this.
3358.8,3360.18, Why can't you have a police officer
3360.18,3361.94, who just grew up in the same neighborhood as you
3361.94,3364.38, and then you also get these impacts of relating to them.
3364.38,3367.36," But in contrast, we told you you're much more likely to be afraid."
3367.36,3368.56, Why is this more likely?
3368.56,3371.92," Because firstly, it plays into the other societal narratives about criminals,"
3371.92,3374.48, because everywhere else in life you're told to fear these people.
3374.48,3377.6," And because secondly, the media are likely to sensationalise these issues,"
3377.6,3379.6, which make you more afraid than you should be.
3379.6,3382.8," That means on balance, Panel, when you're working out which interpretation is more likely,"
3382.8,3384.56, you must side with opposition.
3384.56,3387.68," Panel, we think we show why you are likely to damage trust in policing where you"
3387.68,3391.36, get worse policing and why they lose on principle incredibly proud to oppose
3395.68,3400.56, i think that speaker for their speech again stopped flowing at um 15 seconds
3402.48,3406.24, uh if the other judges are ready i'm happy to call the opposition reply.
3406.24,3407.24, You're here.
3407.24,3412.24, Can everyone hear me?
3412.24,3431.94," Great. Panel, a policy that increases police brutality and destroys public trust will never be the"
3431.94,3435.56, way towards better or more rehabilitative justice system.
3435.56,3436.56, That's why we're so proud of it.
3436.56,3437.56, A couple of things in this speech.
3437.56,3438.56, First question on characterisation and second on trust.
3438.56,3443.56," But first of all, I want to deal with Team Cannabis principle, just to make it clear"
3443.56,3449.36, that it's out of this debate in first we gave specific responses to the two lines of principle
3449.36,3453.6, analysis we get these were never engaged with and it was simply a search down the bench that this
3453.6,3458.16, was an independent path to victory why is that not the case first because the principle of helping
3458.16,3462.72, experts has to be balanced against other principal considerations that's why team canada are happy
3462.72,3468.16, to agree that sex offenders shouldn't become teachers. So what's the actual weighing here between these principles? We were
3468.16,3472.4, very clear that side proposition doesn't give any. We tell you in first that the same deep
3472.4,3477.04, innocent people and their access to justice is more important than the specific and sacred right
3477.04,3481.2, to become a police officer. Then we tell you in third that this principle quickly unravels
3481.2,3486.72, because it's clearly practically contingent. This is just the principle of making life better for ex-convicts.
3486.72,3490.56," If there's massive backlash, harms to justice and harms to the perception of"
3490.56,3494.4," ex-convicts, but it spills into every area of life and hurts their job prospects"
3494.4,3496.96," everywhere, this principle is clearly irrelevant."
3496.96,3500.08," And second, on rehabilitation, we've made it clear throughout this debate that we"
3500.08,3503.68, have equal fear to provide alternative jobs which provide stability and security
3503.68,3508.16," without, as we framed in first, giving them the chance to cause immense and unique harm."
3508.16,3512.88, First question then from characterisation. Our burden on side opposition was never to prove
3512.88,3517.76, that all or most ex-convicts are likely to be bad people or to exercise poor judgment. Team Canada's
3517.76,3522.0," characterisation of ex-convicts who reasoned why they commit crime, the way they're treated by the"
3522.0,3528.64," criminal justice system, is very sympathetic and it's very compelling and it might even be true, but it was never a relevant clash in this"
3528.64,3533.52, debate. Our burden was to prove that ex-convicts likely to apply to and be selected by the police
3533.52,3537.76, are not likely to be ethnic minorities keen on changing the racial composition of the police
3537.76,3542.0, force or earn its former shoplifters who want structural reform for anyone who wants to make
3542.0,3548.16," life better for criminals generally. First on racial diversity, the police force is likely to be incredibly racially discriminatory"
3548.16,3553.2," in its hiring practices just as it is under the status quo, so racial composition is clearly"
3553.2,3557.52," symmetric because that discrimination takes place either way, that argument is out. But let's talk"
3557.52,3561.6, about what these individuals are likely to be like on a personal level. First in terms of who applies
3561.6,3569.0," to these jobs, second who is selected by the police force. You don't apply if you've been a victim of discrimination or police brutality in the justice system, because you're scared of that system."
3569.0,3577.0," You don't want to work with these people every day of your life, and even if you want to see change, you don't think you're sacrificing when you personally change the course of the system."
3577.0,3583.0," But even if you do, the police force don't select you as an officer because these institutions are averse to change and they want to keep the status quo,"
3583.0,3587.3," which is why we don't have structural reform right now, but also because they know there'll be"
3587.3,3591.2, huge backlash if they select anyone likely to be biased or soft on crime.
3591.2,3594.2, So they pick the individuals likely to be the most zealous and the most brutal.
3594.2,3597.86," Note that the response of, but the police have strong incentives to avoid allegations"
3597.86,3599.86," of brutality, doesn't apply either."
3599.86,3604.0," As we explained in third, people view the ball of the police exercising force on behalf"
3604.0,3607.44," of the state, so they're likely to be willing to give the police the benefit of the doubt"
3607.44,3611.34," when they use excessive force in difficult situations, but not when a convict playing"
3611.34,3616.12, into every other negative societal narrative about criminals commits another crime or lets
3616.12,3617.62, another criminal get away.
3617.62,3621.62," Therefore, the incentive to avoid allegations of being soft on crime massively outweigh"
3621.62,3623.62, the incentive to avoid allegations of police brutality.
3623.62,3628.0," And even if you are hired, as we talk about in third, you are pressured by your client leads"
3628.0,3632.72," into being overzealous to prove your loyalty. And note the comparative case, you are far more likely"
3632.72,3637.44, to have incentives to be overzealous as opposed to non-ex-convicts. And that does not just last
3637.44,3642.48," a six-month probationary period, panel, it lasts your whole career because people will always be"
3642.48,3648.72, suspicious for reasons that side propositions concede so you get far more brutality than under the status quo because there are extra pressures
3648.72,3653.12, and extra scrutiny that side proposition is so proud of in their very fine model but note that
3653.12,3657.04, they never engage with our characterization of the group that might not be overzealous but might make
3657.04,3661.36, bad choices that might exercise poor judgment we think that's also important and finally on trust
3661.36,3668.18," we think if we prove our characterization we think this is in fact independent of this argument, but it was never responded to."
3668.18,3671.62," The side proposition never explained to us why we get better trust, they simply asserted"
3671.62,3675.12," that it isn't a tipping point, but given that their own analysis relies on this being a"
3675.12,3678.62," tipping point, I think for the debate to take place, they have to accept that this argument"
3678.62,3682.72, stands and crucially that this policy massively damages the trust vulnerable groups holding
3682.72,3685.36, the police and therefore the ability to access justice
3685.36,3698.02, for all those reasons so proud to oppose. Great I thank that speaker for their speech. The other
3698.02,3710.44, judges are ready. Happy to call on the government reply speaker to conclude this debate here.
3729.58,3734.12," The strategy of Team England in this debate was to characterize everyone in the police force as evil, violent, and overzealous, and point to that as a mechanism and reason on why these ex-cons will be evil, violent, and overzealous as well. This was absurd for three reasons that we told you. Number one, in Anishka, we told you it's untrue. The police isn't great, but they won't just violently commit brutality and abuse individuals. Anishka gave you a host of incentives"
3734.12,3738.8," out of self-preservation, out of perceptions, out of local backlash, especially after the wake of BLM"
3738.8,3743.66," on why this is untrue. Second, we told you that this is not every single police force. Not every"
3743.66,3748.4, single police force and justice system exists out of the US. There are more reasonable interpretations of police that
3748.4,3752.78," they need to engage with. Thirdly and finally, this is important. Even if this incentive to"
3752.78,3758.5," hire overzealous people were to be true, opposition could just hire regular non-convict violent people"
3758.5,3762.3," who, by the way, don't go through our additional screening processes that we've established in our"
3762.3,3769.02," stance. So England, therefore, needed to debate in a non-extremist real world. It is not true that the police overtly"
3769.02,3773.1, and deliberately hires violent people. That is impossible in the real world where individuals
3773.1,3777.3," are realists. Brutality happens because of subconscious biases, stressful situations,"
3777.68,3781.7," and a lack of checks and balances, reasons that we gave you in force, not because the police"
3781.7,3785.66, purposely hires insane and violent people. Let's talk about why
3785.66,3790.56," individuals deserve this policy. Our principle was simple. Ex-cons, who are often petty criminals"
3790.56,3794.56," and people of color and vulnerable individuals, should not be additionally punished by this"
3794.56,3798.72," policy. They say in response, other jobs such as firefighters, which is by the way an abuse of"
3798.72,3803.04," fiat, will be available, which dodged the principle. The moral sin that we characterize"
3803.04,3805.22, stems from this particular job being
3805.22,3809.96, barred and stolen from you as an ex-con. It's independent of other jobs and other economic
3809.96,3815.34," situations being available. If I refuse to hire a woman at my bakery because I'm deeply sexist,"
3815.64,3819.02," she could be a firefighter, she could be a police, she could work at a grocery store,"
3819.12,3823.42, but it is still wrong because it is a principle and moral unjust sin. The better response that
3823.42,3828.0," they give is that public safety is more important. This is inefficient. In Max, we told you that we wouldn't"
3828.0,3831.38," ban Black people, even though they're statistically and historically more likely to be violent."
3831.94,3835.26," Nick responds in third. He says, we don't because it's racism. Like, come on. Like,"
3835.3,3838.88," we can call this prisonerism, right? You're mistreating two bodies of people because they"
3838.88,3842.28," did something in the past. But also, we told you in our principle, this is also racism,"
3842.58,3848.66," because people of color are disproportionately convicted as well. Lastly, we told you that these people need this job. It gives"
3848.66,3852.44," them economic security, social services, a sense of purpose, when otherwise they might return to a"
3852.44,3857.02, life of crime. The weighing of this argument was massive. The relative comparison that you have to
3857.02,3861.46, make is this. Maybe there are some violent criminals who slipped through our 17 screening
3861.46,3869.6," tests and partner system, but there are more ex-cons on their side of the house who live in economic destitution who could possibly re-offend who could return to a life of"
3869.6,3873.68, crime return to their community circles which are probably gangs for instance so this policy
3873.68,3878.8, therefore was deeply unjust who are these ex-convicts then the opposition portrayal of
3878.8,3883.76, these ex-convicts that get accepted is that they are violent and overzealous this is a direct quote
3883.76,3885.04, why was this portrayal a
3885.04,3888.96," lie? First of all, we told you that the vast majority of crimes are nonviolent, such as"
3888.96,3893.3, petty theft and crimes of subsistence. These people are not inherently violent and violent
3893.3,3897.56," to the core. They're poor. They live in high crime areas. They're a person of color. Second,"
3897.94,3902.42, the minority of violent ex-cons remaining are likely going to be filtered out of our selection
3902.42,3909.2," system. The white man who experiences a deep desire to crack down on gangs, their example at minute 615 of the leader of opposition"
3909.2,3913.58," speech, is likely to be filtered out for the same reason why a pedophile in our 7th house"
3913.58,3918.16, won't be accepted to teach. They say that the police is indirect and they want to accept
3918.16,3922.02," violent and adversarial individuals, which we already said was asserted in our intro."
3922.58,3925.96," Last of all, though, we just told you that these individuals were more empathetic."
3926.2,3927.56," It was a very, very simple mechanism."
3927.94,3929.64," If you're a drug dealer in the United States,"
3929.9,3932.96, it's probably the case that you resorted to selling drugs to put food on the table.
3933.36,3935.42, It was absurd for second opposition to claim
3935.42,3938.02, that you hate all drug dealers because of the experience.
3938.38,3940.08, Maybe you were coerced into dealing drugs.
3940.36,3943.0," But if anything, we told you that you understand other people"
3943.0,3945.76, because they were also in the system of coercion as well.
3946.4,3949.9," So on our side of the house, we get more people of color and empathetic individuals hired."
3950.36,3955.12," These are union officials and beat cops and patrol managers who mandate the wearing of body cams,"
3955.34,3961.54, who actually put in place checks and balances systems and let a black teen walk past without carding them or putting them in the back of their road.
3961.74,3967.2, When punishment is levied outside of the courtroom courtroom every single convict serves a lifetime sentence
3971.36,3985.0, great um i think that speaker for their speech um now the judges uh could I'll move to let's say prep room one.
3988.1,3990.08," Yes, 14A I guess."
3990.98,3992.12, And we can chat there.
3993.84,3996.78," Or no, sorry, I guess prep room 14."
3998.12,4000.26," Okay, 14A, 14A works."
4000.26,4001.1," All right, thanks."
4001.1,4003.2, And we'll see you all soon.
4003.2,4004.04, Thank you so much.
4004.04,4009.84," Thanks very much for the debate, Kanada. Thanks, everyone. See see you later so we're pretty cringe and we have an instagram page so do you"
4009.84,4017.04, mind if we i'm going to stop the recording
