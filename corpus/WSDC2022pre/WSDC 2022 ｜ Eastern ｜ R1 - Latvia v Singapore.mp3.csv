0.0,26.82," And then I would like to give the floor to the first proposition speaker to open the debate. Good luck. China's power, Russian imperialism, and US Republicans supporting isolationism is undeniably"
26.82,33.04," like destabilizing the region, and this Asian NATO would help keep the existing fragile border."
33.42,38.02," Now, in my speech, I'm going to have some points of framing, and then three consecutive arguments."
38.72,43.8," Firstly, on why will countries join the alliance? Secondly, on like economic benefits for Southeast"
43.8,45.2," Asian countries? And thirdly, how this will like help safeguard territorial sovereignty of these join the alliance secondly on like economic benefits for southeast asian countries and"
45.2,50.08, thirdly how this will like help safeguard territorial sovereignty of these countries
50.08,55.36, and our second speaker will have an extension on democratic changes in countries right so let's get
55.36,61.28, into framing so who will even join this alliance obviously like first off countries like japan
61.28,69.76, australia us and india right because they're like part of the Quad already. But like likely this like entire organization is like likely to expand and
69.76,74.58," also include other countries like A, South Korea, because they're already like aligned with the West,"
75.18,81.12," B, Vietnam, because of the South China Sea dispute, and C, the Philippines, and possibly also like the"
81.12,87.34," rest of the South Asian countries that are surrounding the China, like the South China Sea."
87.34,89.06, So let's get into our first argument.
89.06,91.28, Why will countries join the alliance?
91.28,93.92," So firstly, like these Western countries are seen"
93.92,96.42," as more trustworthy partners than countries,"
96.42,97.68," again, like China."
97.68,100.8," So A, they're like great economic partners"
100.8,104.4," that don't really screw up their own like neighbors,"
104.4,105.82, as we've seen with the Belt and Road
105.82,111.52, like initiative right be they're unlikely to be aggressors right smaller Southeast Asian like
111.52,115.72, states don't really want to be messed with and they want to run like their business as usual
115.72,121.36, and these um like Western states like the US won't really be as hostile they won't really
121.36,126.8," like manipulate um with stuff like currency which like, which are things that like China has actually done."
126.94,135.64," Right. And see, like Trans-Pacific Partnership already showed like a willingness for some Asian countries to turn away from China."
135.64,140.68, Right. Like in favor of the West. And we've seen this with Vietnam and we've seen this with Singapore.
141.58,147.86," Secondly, right. They have superior they have superior military capabilities. Sure, we all know China"
147.86,153.86," is big, but the US is a military superpower. They have the best equipment. They have boats,"
154.18,158.86," they have airplanes, they have spy equipment. Thirdly, leaders of these smaller Asian states"
158.86,164.28," and smaller Asian countries care about not giving up their sovereignty to China. Plus,"
164.6,165.94, China has become increasingly
165.94,170.24," aggressive. And we've seen that this is like a very big trend in the recent decades, right?"
170.48,176.54," They've literally recently shot at boats, Philippine boats, fishing boats that have"
176.54,181.36," posed no real threat to them, right? Unfortunately, there's already kind of a pro-Western sentiment"
181.36,189.28," there, right? Because historically, a lot of these countries have ties with the West, a lot of times because of British colonialism, which just means that a lot"
189.28,193.36," of people in these countries, they speak English, they already know a lot of things about like that"
193.36,197.76," culture, they probably consume a lot of like Western media and they like agree with a lot of"
197.76,206.0," their like ideological beliefs, right? And also already Western states have helped expel kind of occupation forces."
206.0,214.0, Right. So there is already this experience of the West helping these smaller Asian states with like militarily actually help them.
214.0,219.0," Right. And fifthly, even if even if China retaliates, which is not probably going to happen,"
219.0,225.74," and we're going to explain that later in the speech, more countries will like want to join the alliance at that point,"
225.74,229.82," because they will see that China actually is an aggressor, right? It's not just going to be kind"
229.82,234.0," of like, oh, China kind of has done some bad internal things, kind of outclasses sometimes"
234.0,238.1," as they actually attack, like most of these countries will probably want to join the alliance."
238.1,243.14," And at that point, like Western states will probably make the accession process kind of more"
243.14,246.4," like easier, and they will speed it up at that point."
246.4,248.88," Before moving on to our second argument, I'll take a POI."
251.2,256.0, Will the defense pack be activated if China continues building islands in the South China Sea?
258.08,262.48," Well, China is not going to want to build islands in the South China Sea because they're not going"
262.48,266.76," to want to mess with now these like nuclear, like powerhouses"
266.76,268.38," that defend these smaller nations, right?"
268.38,270.0, They're not gonna want to do that.
270.0,271.76," So moving on to our second argument,"
271.76,275.08," economic benefits for Southeast Asian countries, right?"
275.08,276.82," So before we get into this argument,"
276.82,278.78, we have to understand that this is not only
278.78,280.58," a military alliance, right?"
280.58,284.32, It is inherently about choosing your like strategic partners
284.32,286.0, also for like trade and development.
286.42,287.58, And why is that?
287.74,295.94," Because if countries know that they're guaranteed security, they're more likely to A, make trade"
295.94,300.88," deals with other nations probably that are in this Asian NATO, and B, have long-term"
300.88,302.44, investments put into them.
302.64,306.5," Because economic and defense are very much interlinked,"
306.5,312.24," right? So benefits for countries in the Quad, firstly, just investors are now more likely to"
312.24,318.82," invest in them because they rely on the security guarantees of the West, right? So military"
318.82,325.6, instability hurts a lot of these Quad countries' economies like economies right because as we've seen right
325.6,331.5, now like every time north korea has um like a nuclear test japan's stock market plummets but
331.5,334.94, now they're going to be like maybe in the security quad right that's not really going to happen
334.94,338.72, because there is like this background security and if that is going to happen it's going to be
338.72,344.26, in a much like smaller scale right and secondly like fishing and oil in the south china sea is a
344.26,345.74, very big like issue in the entire region right but now it's like fishing and oil in the South China Sea is a very big like issue in
345.74,350.88," the entire region, right? But now it's like more likely to be secure for these smaller Asian states,"
351.22,355.32," secure like those resources, because they're, again, there's going to be more like U.S. ships,"
355.4,360.16," there's going to be more U.S. equipment, and just like military kind of presence in that area, so"
360.16,369.12," China isn't going to want to mess with them. Thirdly, countries that will experience problems for the Belt and Road Project initiative are now safe, right?"
369.26,372.58, Because it's likely that China won't really want to seize infrastructure
372.58,375.42," and there isn't going to be a Sri Lanka 2.0, right?"
375.66,379.4," And at least the Quad guidelines will tell them,"
379.46,383.12," like these countries, not to give away strategic military targets, right?"
383.32,386.44," And for non-Quad countries, there's still gonna be some benefits, right?"
386.44,388.24, So like third countries will benefit
388.24,390.48," from just investment wars, right?"
390.48,393.2, Because obviously both China and like powerhouses
393.2,395.34, like the US will want to kind of have them
395.34,396.46," join their side, right?"
396.46,398.86, So they will push a lot of investment into these countries.
398.86,400.88," There's gonna be a lot of money flowing in,"
400.88,403.06," like no matter if they join or not,"
403.06,404.46, cause probably that's how they're gonna try
404.46,409.6, to win countries over. Like it's not the 19th century anymore. They're not going to try to like
409.6,416.08," somehow militarily force them to join. It's going to be more like a, you know, who has the best care,"
416.08,420.4, like who's going to give out the best proposal for these countries to join. And we've seen like
420.4,426.4," precedence for this and like the specific Pacific Islands and Taiwan, right? And moving on to our"
426.4,431.16," third argument, how this will, like, help safeguard territorial sovereignty of these countries. So,"
431.24,435.84," firstly, there's going to be nuclear deterrence. Like, countries don't want to go to war with the"
435.84,440.5," U.S. and other, like, Quad nations because they're nuclear states. China doesn't, like,"
440.5,445.04," want to challenge them. And, like, also this kind of protects the rest of the country"
445.04,448.64, that are in the quad since again that means like if china attacks one they kind of mess with the
448.64,451.9, entire thing and they're not stupid they're not going to want to do that right secondly there's
451.9,456.92, just more like troops on the ground thirdly this is not just like a pinky promise it's going to be
456.92,461.76, like an article and like article number five for nato right they're going to be bound by an
461.76,469.52, agreement so there's definitely going to be like this feeling of security in the region right and also like don't let opposition get away with saying that
469.52,473.42, like there is now going to be a bigger likelihood of escalation because that's just not true right
473.42,478.9, China already does stuff like flyers right they send ships through waters that are not theirs
478.9,484.28, like the comparative here is when it comes to like slip-ups on our side right like the military
484.28,485.08, would now just have
485.08,489.66," a lot more experience, they're going to have a lot more like officers that just like know what to do"
489.66,495.34," in these situations that won't let these slip ups happen, right? Like, obviously, like an officer"
495.34,499.2, who has four years of experience in NATO is going to be better than a regular like Taiwanese officer.
499.68,503.9," But be like, even if these mistakes happen, they're not going to escalate. Like everyone's"
503.9,507.88," going to calm them down, there's going to be a major like moderating effect in this region."
508.12,511.16," So panel for countries to prosper, they need to be safe."
511.32,512.36, They need to be protected.
512.6,513.94, And that is what we propose.
524.82,527.88, All right. Thank you very much for that speech.
527.88,533.5," Speaker spoke for 8 minutes, 10 seconds."
533.5,535.82, Just checking that everyone's ready to move on.
535.82,539.5, Then we'll head to the first opposition speaker.
539.5,540.5, Good luck.
540.5,558.94," Thank you. Hi, can I be seen and heard? Sorry about the echo. Yeah."
561.26,595.84," Just a reminder, I prefer my POIs verbally, so please unmute and ask. Thank you. Latvia's case is built on a misconception. They say Asia is aligned with the West. No,"
595.84,603.04," the Asia-Pacific region is dependent on both China and the Quad. The Philippines has zero submarines,"
603.04,605.76," therefore relies on the US for defence, yet"
605.76,613.04," desperately needs China's $24 billion in investment. China is Singapore's largest trading partner by far,"
613.32,619.2, yet our air force is built on almost entirely American aircraft. We will prove that their
619.2,625.84, pact forces nations to sacrifice one of these two essential relationships. What is our stance? We believe the
625.84,631.6," Quad should not create a regional defense pact. Instead, we prefer the status quo, where these"
631.6,636.72," alliances are negotiated on a largely bilateral basis, so countries choose the specific nature"
636.72,642.66, and degree of cooperation with China and the US. So instead of committing to a full-scale defense
642.66,647.74," pact against China, countries like Malaysia or the Philippines can choose to conduct training exercises"
647.74,651.22, or just sign a free trade agreement with the U.S. instead.
651.48,652.6, We have three arguments.
653.0,655.72," One, countries that join face Chinese retaliation."
656.2,659.84," Second, countries that don't join face U.S. retaliation."
659.84,663.78, And my second speaker will explain how they heighten tensions in Kashmir.
664.16,669.84," Before that, some rebuttal. First, they give us a list of countries that will probably join this pact,"
669.84,674.32, like South Korea and Vietnam. I just want to note that this is empirically untrue.
674.32,679.2," Like I framed earlier, many of these states are dependent on both China and the US, so it's not"
679.2,684.4," that easy of a decision. Second, I just want to observe that this list of incentives for why"
684.4,685.04, countries will
685.04,690.24, join doesn't prove anything on its own because they can't just give us a problem of chinese
690.24,695.76, aggression their side needs to give us structural analysis as to why this defense pact will actually
695.76,701.04, successfully stop chinese aggression and solve this problem so it's contingent on the rest of
701.04,705.7, their case before i move on I'll take that point.
711.24,711.4," Given that China backs off when Taiwanese fighters challenge Chinese fighters to Mali,"
714.8,715.64, why would China not back off when forces show now?
720.04,730.92," That's exactly what I was getting into. Your case is contingent on a central premise, that China would cease all aggressive actions, like, for instance, building islands in the South China Sea or engaging in the BRI. Their defence pact would never deter this kind of"
730.92,735.86," aggression because the defence pact guarantees retaliation against a military invasion,"
736.1,741.68," not island building, not some kind of economic exploitation, but military aggression. But if"
741.68,745.28," their defence pact actually forced nations to declare war,"
745.28,752.36," once China makes one aggressive move, like seizing a BRI port, no country would join this pact,"
752.36,757.64, because war would almost be certain for these countries. Countries like Indonesia or the
757.64,762.68," Philippines simply cannot afford to fight a protracted war against a superpower, and war"
762.68,765.22, would be certain if they had to declare war once
765.22,771.38," China flies one aircraft into Taiwanese airspace. So the economic benefits for Southeast Asia,"
771.48,776.54," because investors will be enticed by greater military stability, simply doesn't exist,"
776.72,781.58, because they assume that the regional defense pact will be activated if China pursues any form
781.58,785.52," of retaliation, which is untrue. When they say, for instance,"
785.52,790.0," they protect territorial integrity for Southeast Asia, they also just do not give a mechanism."
790.0,794.24," They assert there will be a moderating effect in the instance of escalation,"
794.24,799.92," whereas the central premise of their case, which has been taken down, shows that this is clearly"
799.92,806.18," untrue. Finally, they try to give one layer of mitigation. They say, but China is already"
806.18,811.82," aggressive in our world, and therefore we don't do anything to stop this. Our case is that while"
811.82,818.28," China does make aggressive moves, China is not maximally aggressive yet. My argument will"
818.28,823.62, demonstrate why China can and will get more aggressive in their world at the point they're
823.62,825.24, provoked by this defence pact.
825.54,830.1," With that, Proposition's case is dead in the water. Second Prop needs to rebuild it from scratch."
830.54,835.48," First argument, countries that join the pact face Chinese retaliation. The thesis of this argument"
835.48,840.76," is that this defence pact sparks greater Chinese belligerence towards states that join it,"
841.04,849.72," rendering it counterproductive. This is true for two structural reasons. One, because it will be perceived as an unparalleled act of aggression. For China"
849.72,855.26," that has already called the Quad and Indo-Pacific NATO, this defense pact will only confirm its"
855.26,860.42, worst fears that the U.S. is attempting to encroach on its backyard. Think about it.
860.42,866.54," If Pelosi, a single U.S. official landing in Taipei, sparked military exercises that amounted"
866.54,873.2," to a blockade, Taiwan joining the defence pact will prompt fire and brimstone. Second, China"
873.2,878.08, will retaliate to deter more countries from joining in the future. Given that the influence
878.08,883.48," of the pact is dependent on how many members it actually defends against China, it has a vested"
883.48,885.24, interest in preventing more states from joining it. This incentiv against China. It has a vested interest in preventing more states
885.24,890.32, from joining it. This incentivizes China to respond aggressively to states that have joined
890.32,897.22," the pact to make other states. We are not saying that these reasons will prompt China to invade,"
897.52,902.32," but there are many other ways for China to retaliate without sparking a war, which their"
902.32,908.58, side doesn't seem to understand. It means trade tariffs that cut hundreds of millions of dollars in export revenue.
908.58,913.14," It means cyber attacks to steal national security secrets, like the hacking of six"
913.14,918.42," US state governments just this year. It means more attempts to meddle in foreign elections,"
918.42,926.24, as it has already done in Australia and New Zealand. This argument wins us the debate by flipping their own impacts of
926.24,931.88, containing Chinese aggression. A pact will only make China more belligerent and bring the region
931.88,938.66," closer to conflict. Second argument, countries that don't join face US retaliation. The premise"
938.66,945.86," is that across the US political spectrum, it has become a top priority for politicians to show off China credentials."
946.02,953.1," No, thank you. Because opinion polls show that 89% of Americans see China as an enemy. This is"
953.1,958.48, why Biden has sustained Trump's protracted trade war and upheld investment bans on Chinese firms
958.48,967.36," like Huawei. Against this backdrop, nations that refuse to join the defense pact will lose the U.S. as an ally for two structural reasons."
967.86,972.12," One, because the defense pact forces a nation to clearly pick a side."
972.48,981.18," While a country can trade or buy arms or receive foreign aid from both the U.S. and China, this defense pact is a uniquely binary choice."
981.5,986.22," You either join it or you don't. Hence, countries must pledge their allegiance to"
986.22,991.62," one and only one superpower on this massive national security issue, which means not joining"
991.62,998.5," the pact will be a direct signal of taking the Chinese side. Second, US politics has a historical"
998.5,1005.52," track record of retaliating against nations on their enemy's side. In the Cold War, the US didn't just retaliate"
1005.52,1012.0, against the Soviet Union. It went after Soviet allies. The CIA mounted operations to depose
1012.0,1017.28, democratically elected leaders in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic because they were left-wing.
1017.28,1025.4," The US not only kept its sweeping embargoes on Cuba, it expanded them in 1999, even after the USSR collapsed."
1031.28,1036.08," Now, the US will probably not assassinate foreign leaders or halt all trade, but when they see a state as a Chinese ally, they will slash developmental aid, they will cut arms sales,"
1036.08,1041.12," and they will reduce the scope of imports. For smaller states that need all the aid they can get,"
1041.12,1046.24," this is a huge blow. In our world, states aren't forced to choose between"
1046.24,1052.56, China and the US by either joining or refusing to join the pact. South Korea can have both its
1052.56,1058.74," exports to China and the protection of US missiles, as it does now. Indonesia doesn't have to pick"
1058.74,1066.6," between its two largest trading partners. Hence, we preserve the delicate balance that many states have currently found between the"
1066.6,1146.26, U.S. and China. A new NATO is ultimately a new Cold War. We go back to the proposition for the second prop speech. Good luck. All right.
1147.76,1148.2, Sorry.
1152.52,1152.96, Okay.
1153.28,1155.58, Let me know if you can hear me and see me.
1156.3,1156.8, It should be fine.
1158.72,1159.24," Okay, great."
1160.64,1161.34, Just a second.
1161.44,1162.06, Just setting my timer.
1168.74,1169.86, All right.
1170.84,1174.5," Starting in three, two, one."
1174.86,1177.3, Side opposition is right about one thing.
1177.3,1183.62, We have entered the second Cold War of democracy against authoritarianism.
1183.82,1187.32, But to not repeat the mistakes of the past panel it
1187.32,1193.62, is time to make allies because alliances are the only way to prevent these hot wars on small
1193.62,1199.2, countries that are within superpower zones of influence and we are exclusively this team that
1199.2,1205.68," provides that before I move on to my own extension about more democratic change in these countries,"
1206.24,1208.1, I'll have multiple areas of rebuttal.
1208.34,1211.3," So firstly, on like Chinese retaliation."
1211.3,1216.02," So basically, opposition says like, oh, China is likely because they don't want to lose"
1216.02,1220.96," allies to respond aggressively through economic terms, et cetera, right?"
1221.1,1224.56," I don't think that this is likely because of like four reasons, right?"
1224.68,1225.02," Firstly, it's because there's already China has greatly lost economically through like etc right i don't think that this is likely because of like four reasons right firstly"
1225.02,1230.66, it's because there's already china has greatly lost economically through like the pandemic right
1230.66,1236.36, secondly they already have a shadow banking like like a problem right they have a housing bubble
1236.36,1242.88, there are tons of these economic factors weighing on china that like greatly minimize the power that
1242.88,1245.88," they can to like you know usurp't know, other countries, right?"
1245.94,1250.14," They don't have that much power in the status quo. They don't have that much money to spend,"
1250.24,1254.98," right? Thirdly, there's a general economic downturn in the world, right? You can't assume"
1254.98,1262.68," that after all of this, after China's economy has already been hurt that much, that they will be able"
1262.68,1265.12, to suddenly slap tariffs on these
1265.12,1271.54," countries. It's not economically viable for them, right? Fourthly, they also have nowhere else to"
1271.54,1275.8," like stash their exports, right? China isn't stupid, right? They know that like Russia is"
1275.8,1280.84," clearly not a good ally, right? North Korea too. I think it's highly likely that Russia will,"
1280.84,1285.28," that China will want to like have these allies in the, in like, you know,"
1285.32,1291.84," in this region, right? Even if these countries align with the US as well, because these are huge"
1291.84,1296.98," growing markets that China does want to tap into, right? So on the question of whether they won't"
1296.98,1301.68," just like, like, I don't know, slash tariffs on these countries, it's just not economically"
1301.68,1307.64," beneficial for them. What we think the more like realistic scenario here is, right, is that we're likely to have"
1307.64,1309.98," investment wars in these regions, right?"
1310.18,1313.52," So in the terms of the countries that have not yet joined this pact, like they like to"
1313.52,1318.38," talk about on OPP, I think it's very likely that both the US and the West and China will"
1318.38,1323.9," want to curry favor with these countries, therefore will compete to fund infrastructure,"
1324.06,1325.44," to fund products, to build manufacturing in these countries therefore will compete to fund infrastructure to fund products to like build"
1325.44,1330.16, manufacturing in these countries these are investment wars and they're very beneficial
1330.16,1335.84, to the countries at hand right and china has an incentive to do so because it's like highly
1335.84,1341.28, unlikely that they will just you know retaliate economically or military militarily because china
1341.28,1347.2," is like a pretty reasonable actor right their? Their whole internal politics is based on, you know, economic"
1347.68,1352.16," upturn, right, on having an economic like being economically successful, right?"
1352.28,1357.6, Slashing tariffs on your neighboring countries by like dozens and dozens.
1357.72,1359.4," Kind of this is economics 101, right?"
1359.4,1361.4, It's not economically viable.
1361.4,1364.6, China is a reasonable actor and they're not likely to do so.
1364.92,1365.14," But presuming then that they're not likely to do so, right? But"
1365.14,1370.38," presuming then that they're like characterization of China getting scared by the West and like now,"
1370.54,1376.06," like, I don't know, retaliating, right? Presuming that is true, I still don't think that it's like"
1376.06,1381.26," reasonable. Firstly, it's because like, if we're talking about Taiwan or something, like, I don't"
1381.26,1389.84," know, what exactly is opposition's character? What will China do, right? Will they have like aggressive flyovers? Will they have like boots on the ground? This is"
1389.84,1394.18, what they have in this status quo when it comes to countries like Taiwan. I think quite clearly
1394.18,1398.24," the status quo is not working, but I'll talk about that in the next area of rebuttal, right?"
1398.56,1403.4," But like overall, I just don't think it's like likely that China will retaliate also because"
1403.4,1407.36," like, you know, like the maximum of what they might do, they already do when it's likely that China will retaliate also because the maximum of what they might do,"
1407.36,1411.52," they already do what is possible in the status quo. But furthermore, I think it's much more"
1411.52,1417.6, likely that China exploits weaknesses rather than strengths. This directly responds to their point
1417.6,1423.04, about Pelosi visiting Taiwan. The problem with that in the status quo is that the US constantly
1423.04,1425.56," backs in, backs out. Why?"
1425.56,1426.88, Because they don't have an alliance.
1426.88,1432.7, They don't have an actual physical agreement that they have to protect this country.
1432.7,1437.32," So what often happens is the US shows some support for Taiwan, then backs out."
1437.32,1440.6, Some support for Taiwan because they don't have an alliance.
1440.6,1442.24, China then usurps this.
1442.24,1443.84, They exploit this.
1443.84,1469.86," As we said, China's a reasonable actor. If they're genuinely outnumbered, if they genuinely see that they're circled in and that their neighboring countries are aligning much more with the West, I think it's more likely, rather than China alienating itself, which is not economically viable in the slightest, I think it's much more likely that China has a genuine incentive to economically benefit these countries, right? But as Gaddafi already told you, even if"
1469.86,1474.42," China retaliates, this is more incentive for the neighboring countries, for these like, you know,"
1474.52,1479.9," quad, for these like future quad countries to actually join the quad, because they now are like"
1479.9,1484.74," see what China, like what that actually looks like. The comparative on side opposition, right,"
1484.74,1490.2," is that either, well, it's either twofold, right? Either you have the U.S. being like somewhat in"
1490.2,1494.72," the region, but not having like actual, an actual agreement, right? Like what we see right now with"
1494.72,1499.54, Taiwan. I want to make it like very clear that when the U.S. and when the West has genuinely
1499.54,1505.34," committed agreements, look at the money that the U.S is pouring into NATO right I think it's very likely"
1505.34,1511.22, that the U.S will genuinely like once they have this strong like ground this alliance it's likely
1511.22,1516.26, that they will actually like follow through with their promises right the comparative as I said is
1516.26,1520.64, that they're going to be in the region but have no strong like you know hold they don't have like
1520.64,1525.2, you know the capacity to I don't know like have their military operations in these
1525.2,1529.44, countries and that's very very harmful because this at this lets china exploit their like
1529.44,1534.32, weaknesses right but then the next area of a model on military protection they tell us oh you know
1534.32,1538.48, whatever is in this like the status quo it's good enough because we have peace talks etc i don't
1538.48,1542.48, think the status quo is good enough and i don't think that for five reasons right firstly it's
1542.48,1545.72, because in the status quo china exploits the weaknesses of the West.
1546.04,1550.06, China sees that the Philippines do not have a genuinely as good of a military.
1550.3,1551.9, They bomb ships in the status quo.
1551.94,1553.38," I don't think that's good enough, right?"
1553.62,1557.34," Secondly, in the status quo, these countries do not have good enough leverage over China"
1557.34,1561.98," because they don't have as good of a military, et cetera, as they would if they aligned themselves"
1561.98,1562.7, with the West.
1562.92,1569.84," And thirdly, as they say, no side wants a war. On our side of the house, when China is faced with nuclear powers, they're not likely"
1569.84,1574.3," to go into military conflicts. They're not likely to do all of those things. Furthermore, on the"
1574.3,1578.36," economic exploitation, it's likely that the West will actually protect these countries because"
1578.36,1588.84," they are trading partners for them. Before I move on, I'll take one POI. If, as you say, China is economically devastated by the pandemic and the housing bubble,"
1589.18,1593.34, how will they engage in investment wars and the hot war you talk about?
1594.42,1597.72," Yeah, so it's just more like it's better economically if you invest in countries,"
1597.8,1599.92, and therefore you're providing the carrot.
1600.18,1601.6, They do have some funds to invest.
1601.7,1602.76, It's a completely different scenario.
1602.76,1607.44, When you slap tariffs on all of your neighboring countries meaning you don't get your exports out right
1607.44,1611.2, that's the comparative they're not likely to do that the uniqueness on our side of the house
1611.2,1615.04, on this military protection is that we have more strategic cooperation with the west and more
1615.04,1618.96, troops on the ground but i'll like expand on that in my extension about more democratic change in
1618.96,1623.68, these countries there are four points here firstly when you have like external pressure uh for
1623.68,1625.4, domestic politics to
1625.4,1629.72, change because the West when they like uh invest in these countries they want some like Democratic
1629.72,1633.86, you know checks and balances right so we're more likely to have like more democracy in these
1633.86,1636.74, countries we're more likely to have more accountability in the militaries of them
1636.74,1641.66, like already explained secondly we're likely to have strategic communication in key areas right
1641.66,1649.18, so a for example in manufacturing the West does not want these countries to be as reliant on China right so it's more likely that they will like set up
1649.18,1653.5, manufacturing stations there B when you have like the West is likely to help with like crime and
1653.5,1657.88, human trafficking and drugs and borders we already saw this happen in NATO uh with NATO where like
1657.88,1662.62, they like like really stop the piracy going on in Somalia thirdly you're likely to have cooperation
1662.62,1666.04, military expenditures and fourthly you have more soft power in negotiation
1666.04,1667.7, when you have a larger seat at the table.
1667.7,1671.12," Panel, this is about like either being against two fish"
1671.12,1673.6," on your own, or at least having one on your side."
1673.6,1703.3, We prefer the latter. Thank you very much for that speech.
1703.3,1705.26, We go back to the opposition for the second
1705.26,1729.54, opposition speech. Good luck. Can I check if I'm audible and visible?
1732.16,1733.06," Okay, thank you."
1743.2,1744.48," So at the top of this speech,"
1744.56,1746.76, I want to be very clear about the context of aggression
1746.76,1747.76, that takes place right now.
1747.76,1752.08," I want to just first point out a couple of lies they said, like China bombing ships and"
1752.08,1753.68, placing troops in nations.
1753.68,1756.44," If they did that, there will be a literal war already happening."
1756.44,1761.44, The truth is Chinese aggression in the status quo does not amount to direct military intervention.
1761.44,1767.7," Often, aggression takes place of things like, for instance, election meddling, like we saw when they meddled with elections of countries like Australia, for example,"
1767.92,1771.84," or for example, the use of digital warfare tactics to increase their ability to control states,"
1771.88,1776.82," or even their own example of the BRI. Our point is that, like they concede, China is a rational"
1776.82,1781.56, actor and will never enter an actual hot war or military conflict on either side of the house.
1781.86,1788.16," That is why the context of aggression that takes place in the status quo is about more moderate forms of aggression, which their pact does nothing to"
1788.16,1793.46," stop. With that, two areas of clash. First, how will China respond to this? Second, how third"
1793.46,1798.2," parties are hurt? First, how China will respond to this? And I think the question we have to ask"
1798.2,1802.42," here is, does their policy actually work in solving any of the problems they talk about?"
1802.56,1809.04," They talk about the BRI, for example. how is a military pact that responds to military aggression going to stop this absolutely no"
1809.04,1813.76, response but second the question to ask you is this how does china respond to aggression and
1813.76,1818.48, potential threats and the answer isn't peace and temperance often it's equally aggressive actions
1818.48,1822.64, and there are two reasons why first because c historically fights fire with fire look at how
1822.64,1826.8," for instance they began constructing artificial islands for example,"
1827.1,1828.12, at the point in which the US
1828.12,1829.88, was increasingly involved within the region.
1830.14,1831.04, Or the fact that literally
1831.04,1832.96," the moment Pelosi stepped foot within Taiwan,"
1833.24,1834.78, they are already carrying out things
1834.78,1836.34," like simulated military drills, for example."
1836.7,1837.74, I think what this suggests to you
1837.74,1839.36, is that China is most likely to respond
1839.36,1841.72, to aggression with even more aggression
1841.72,1842.72, on their part.
1842.94,1844.48," But secondly, as they concede,"
1844.74,1848.14, Xi is risk adverse and he wants to deter other states from being able to join these pacts.
1848.44,1852.86," Therefore, he is likely to use these aggression tactics to therefore achieve this angle. That is"
1852.86,1855.8, why the likely counterfactual on their side of the house is that China will respond to this
1855.8,1859.54, even more aggressively. And that is why all of their harms here are far from the truth.
1860.1,1864.9," Next, they say that China is already maximally aggressive. Why? We think that given the"
1864.9,1865.92, contextualization of how China is a rationalally aggressive. Why? We think that given the contextualization
1865.92,1867.26," of how China is a rational actor,"
1867.48,1869.4, obviously it only engages in aggressive actions
1869.4,1871.62, at the point in which the benefits exceeds the cost.
1871.86,1872.94," And that is why in the status quo,"
1873.14,1874.96," if it's truly economically weak, for example,"
1875.08,1877.14, it is possible that they can increase aggression
1877.14,1878.82, in the future if the economy recovers.
1879.02,1880.8, The point is that China isn't maximally aggressive
1880.8,1882.5, and this is just a lie.
1882.7,1883.68," So obviously in the status quo,"
1883.86,1888.78," obviously if they are prompted to act aggressively, they will do so under their side of the house. Finally,"
1888.88,1894.22," they said, well, but China likes to capitalize on weaknesses. When the US isn't involved in the"
1894.22,1898.52," region, then they will start wanting to engage more. Why is this the case? In the status quo,"
1898.94,1903.4," even if the US isn't fully committed, China wouldn't run the risk that the US could possibly"
1903.4,1908.56," intervene because they know that if they engage in a war with the US right now, they would massively lose or even if they"
1908.56,1912.56," wouldn't lose, they would suffer economically and would destroy their country. That is why even if"
1912.56,1917.12," there isn't an explicit commitment, for example, the possibility and the threat that the US might"
1917.12,1921.52, intervene on either side of the house as Biden in the status quo has already committed to defending
1921.52,1929.32," Taiwan, for example, clearly demonstrates to you that this argument is not exclusive. Finally, they said, well, there will be an investment war to attract"
1929.32,1933.56," these states. Why is this the case? If it's true that China is already so economically impoverished,"
1933.72,1937.88," how are they going to engage in these investment wars? But most importantly, we win this point."
1938.08,1941.64," Because you know when investment wars happen? It's when there's no clear line drawn, when you can"
1941.64,1948.18," still win that country over. On your side of the house, they're literally drawing a clear line that these states are supporting the US and these states are"
1948.18,1952.56, supporting China when they join or don't join the pack. That is when investment wars won't happen
1952.56,1956.02, because there's no additional incentive of throwing you free money if you're just going to ally
1956.02,1960.16, yourself with another country anyways. That is why when the clear line isn't drawn on our side of
1960.16,1963.86," the house, we get more investment and we win the investment war. So this point is honestly"
1963.86,1968.78, nonsensical. Second area of question on how third parties are hurt and i want to point out here
1968.78,1973.08, they completely dropped their first speaker argument here because they said oh no but now
1973.08,1976.96, what happens now is that the region is very military unstable and therefore just a disincentivized
1976.96,1981.38, investment after we point out that this is obviously untrue and that for instance foreign
1981.38,1986.44," direct investment inflows within asia for example has been increasing increasing across the past years, they completely dropped this point,"
1986.66,1991.04, which shows that they concede that this is unlikely to be a significant difference in the debate.
1991.24,1993.62," But more importantly, the argument just doesn't make sense."
1993.86,1997.78," This is premised on the assumption that China is going to invade Asia, for example,"
1997.88,1999.84, and therefore this poses a real military threat.
2000.1,2003.88," This is incredibly unlikely, and therefore the argument just doesn't make sense."
2004.08,2005.12," Before I move on, yes."
2007.74,2013.02," Okay, given the Philippine ships that China bombed this January,"
2013.72,2015.78, isn't it more likely that that wouldn't have happened
2015.78,2019.76, had they known that this nation's army was backed by the West?
2020.52,2022.38," No, and here's a very simple reason why."
2022.84,2024.74, If you are going to activate your military pack
2024.74,2025.14, at the
2025.14,2029.0," site of every single small thing that China does, that would be terrible for your side of the house"
2029.0,2033.5, because your side could literally risk starting a world war because any small act of aggression
2033.5,2037.88," and immediately the US will come flying in with their troops. Obviously, they cannot support this"
2037.88,2041.78, because that's just crazy and will create massive conflict that just really don't want to support.
2041.96,2048.16," So if you want to support that, I think we win with that reading the investment and their argument at first figure that they"
2048.16,2052.42, dropped they cannot bring up bring up again in the next speaker finally my substantive argument
2052.42,2056.56, in this argument I'm going to explain to you why they increase the likelihood and impact of an
2056.56,2062.68, Indian initiated war the premise of this argument is that currently Modi breeds a policy projects
2062.68,2066.0, the policy of Hindu nationalism for instance the fact that he's seeking to reclaim Kashmir
2066.0,2068.3," and the fact that, just like recently, for example,"
2068.48,2070.24, they have cut Wi-Fi and sent troops in the area
2070.24,2072.44, to arrest prominent pro-Pakistani politicians
2072.44,2073.72, within the Kashmiri region.
2074.02,2075.28, We think this is likely to be worsened
2075.28,2076.82, on their side of the house in two ways.
2077.18,2080.04," First, because India is emboldened by this policy."
2080.38,2082.16, Now that the US has explicitly committed
2082.16,2084.52," to defend all of its members militarily,"
2084.84,2086.34, we think it's incredibly likely
2086.34,2087.46, that on their side of the house
2087.46,2089.04, India will be emboldened by this policy
2089.04,2091.24, because they know they can get the military backing
2091.24,2092.88, of the US
2092.88,2093.5, secondly
2093.5,2094.44, no thank you
2094.44,2094.84, secondly
2094.84,2096.96, even if the likelihood of war remains the same
2096.96,2098.84, we think that the devastating impact of war
2098.84,2100.38, is magnified on your side of the house
2100.38,2101.92, they want to talk about the Cold War
2101.92,2103.92, I think it's more likely that proxy wars happen
2103.92,2109.04, when you create literal alliances that promise to defend every single country within their alliance
2109.04,2112.32, i think it's far worse on the other side of the house because in this specific context of india
2112.32,2117.12, for example we are more likely to see things like proxy conflict and proxy conflict that will ensue
2117.12,2121.44, as a result of these alliances that's why when these wars do happen and these conflicts do happen
2121.44,2128.64, as they are beginning to in a status quo they are going to be even more devastating within this region and it's causing a lot more civilian casualties
2128.64,2133.36, i want to be clear about the weighing here we think that the actions of china are unlikely
2133.36,2136.96, to be significantly transformed on either side of the house and the reason for this is the cost
2136.96,2142.08, especially on their very best case scenario of military conflict how china were engaged in the
2142.08,2147.38," trouble like invading countries and bombing ships for example example, we think they are unlikely to do this to the full extent because they know that"
2147.38,2150.82," they are economically devastated. Like, they concede, and if they engage in a military war"
2150.82,2155.32," with the US, they will lose. That is why it's incredibly likely that A, Chinese forms of"
2155.32,2158.44," aggression are going to be more moderate, in which case their policy does absolutely nothing"
2158.44,2162.14," because it responds to military conflict, not more moderate forms of conflict, like for instance,"
2162.92,2168.42," election interference, for example. And secondly, this argument independently proves to be an external reason, an external impact that"
2168.42,2173.06," wins the debate, because it proves to you that in another region where conflict is more certain and"
2173.06,2177.04," more likely to happen than in the context of China, for example, we think it's more likely that you"
2177.04,2182.36," create even worse harms within these areas. Finally, I just want to be very clear about"
2182.36,2187.4," the ultimate end goal of this debate, because on either side of the house, it's incredibly unlikely that China will completely"
2187.4,2190.86, change their policy stances. But what we are certain about is that in the short to medium
2190.86,2194.7," term, for example, when they engage in more moderate forms of aggression, our policy and"
2194.7,2199.54, not having a clear explicit alliance that increases aggression mitigates and against
2199.54,2202.66," these moderate forms of aggression. Whereas on their side of the house, their policy, A,"
2202.76,2207.52, does absolutely nothing to stop these moderate forms of aggression and b is likely dependent towards uh ceasing paying
2207.52,2210.72, stance or being more nationalistic and being more aggressive when you respond to them with equal
2210.72,2214.24, amounts of aggression that's why harms are going to be far more worse on gas like the house and
2214.24,2218.08, that's why on outside the house we protect against the most realistic types of harms that are going
2218.08,2222.4, to take place in the status quo at the end of the day a they're failed to prove that comparative
2222.4,2226.72," environment is necessarily better and b i outside of the house, we generally protect"
2226.72,2230.1, far more regions in a more realistic way to actually respond to the specific context of
2230.1,2231.1, the situation.
2231.1,2264.36," For all these reasons, never been prouder to oppose. Thank you very much for that speech."
2264.36,2266.84, We go back to the proposition for the third
2266.84,2316.24," proposition speech. Good luck. Hi, just checking that I'm audible. Okay."
2316.24,2321.18, Framing the team opposition has adopted in this debate has already come to sink their
2321.18,2322.82," case, right?"
2322.82,2325.12," Because at the point at which you basically like make,"
2325.28,2332.42," try to draw symmetries everywhere, except for like the binary nature of economic sort of agreements,"
2332.42,2338.04," you basically, you destroy your case because economic agreements are not of binary nature."
2338.18,2343.62," They're not as simple as, you know, oh, you only trade with your military partners, right? It's"
2343.62,2345.9, far more nuanced than that. There's
2345.9,2351.6," far more to it, and I'll explain it in my speech. So I'll have three main questions. Firstly,"
2351.74,2357.26," about whether the Quad works and people join it. Secondly, about economics. And lastly,"
2357.5,2362.1, about military. So on to the first point about whether the Quad will work. They basically
2362.1,2365.9, conceded up to this point that countries will join the Quad
2365.9,2372.84," and countries have incentives to do it, right? Like, you know, the U.S. provides the Philippines"
2372.84,2377.94," with submarines already. So obviously, if they want more military protection, they will turn to"
2377.94,2383.04," the U.S. because that is where their infrastructure is headed. So we're likely to see a large, you"
2383.04,2385.64," know, expansion of this military alliance to"
2385.64,2391.5, include a lot of countries. I think this point just simply stands for our side. So efficacy can
2391.5,2398.2, exist on our side if we're able to prove the other two points fall on ours. So then the second one
2398.2,2403.94," about economics, which is the main impact in this debate, as they have also tried to describe,"
2404.18,2406.08, right? So the main premise of their side is they have also tried to describe right so the main premise
2406.08,2411.52, of their side is that basically like countries will split apart and there will be tariffs and
2411.52,2419.12, sanctions and exclusive trading agreements i'll take your pois later and so um and so ultimately
2419.12,2426.32, like countries will stand to lose from us so let's look at it from the side of China. So let's say that there's a
2426.32,2433.14," claim from them that basically China will economically retaliate. So firstly, you know,"
2433.48,2438.92," there's very little like negotiating power for China at the point at which, like you said,"
2439.06,2450.3," team opposition, they already called it, you know, Asia-NAT NATO, right? Where is the additional wiggle room to suddenly call it Asian NATO, but with additional characteristics, right?"
2450.58,2455.86," Like, where is the additional political power going to come from to retaliate so much more?"
2456.08,2460.46," Plus, we don't even know what this, like, retaliation so much more looks like."
2460.54,2465.88," Like, Chinese does the, like, you know, you have people like Chen wuha on Twitter like"
2465.88,2471.4, you know throwing swear words at other diplomats right this kind of thing is sort of what riles
2471.4,2477.94, up the nationalism within the country and benefits them the actual like trade you know agreements and
2477.94,2487.6, tariffs and all that hurts them far more so secondly yes China is currently in trouble right they have like you know mortgage crisis
2487.6,2493.28, looming they're suffering from the pandemic they desperately need to get like some sort of chips
2493.28,2499.36, and uh and manufacturing going to support their economy that is going downhill if they suddenly
2499.36,2505.76, at this point right decide to cut trade because this motion happens right now so they either retaliate
2505.76,2511.6, right now or they don't retaliate at all because like that ship will have sailed and they'll have
2511.6,2516.8, sucked it up right so at this point right now panel it's important that the timing of this
2516.8,2523.2, debate as well china cannot afford to simply stop trading with these nations it's far more likely
2523.2,2525.56, that they do something like invest in
2525.56,2530.5," other nations. And it's important to split them between, you know, countries that are likely to"
2530.5,2534.44, join the Quad and countries that are sort of staying neutral here. The countries that are
2534.44,2539.42," staying neutral are likely to experience a huge benefit, as our first speaker said, right? When"
2539.42,2544.48," like both the China, both China and the US want to invest in these countries through the, you know,"
2544.54,2545.04, newly formed like US alternative to the Belt and Road and the US want to invest in these countries through the you know newly formed
2545.04,2549.28, like US alternative to the Belt and Road and the Chinese Belt and Road right so you have these
2549.28,2555.28, countries getting a huge economic boost from the US simply being there more and being more
2555.28,2562.88, interested in winning allies that are also not in the quad in the region right but also for those
2562.88,2566.8, countries in the quad Chinese investment isn't actually all
2566.8,2572.64, that good right so china as we described in our first speech in our first speech right they're
2572.64,2578.56, exploitative they manipulate their currency they steal ips and generally seek to leech off of other
2578.56,2583.6, countries like pulling the money towards the imperial core this is already material that
2583.6,2585.38, exists in our our. This isn't
2585.38,2590.46," something new I'm pulling out to rebut them. So they haven't responded to this sufficient, right?"
2590.9,2596.78," So what happens is that basically the Quad will lose some trade with China. Yes, that's a"
2596.78,2603.78," possibility, right? If they do so, they free themselves from this exploitative economic ally,"
2603.78,2610.96," and they're far more likely to get U.S. investment like South Korea and Japan already has up to this point, right?"
2610.96,2620.68," Where the U.S. basically gave them free access to patents and all these things to kickstart their industry, to create an economics boom, to greatly benefit their countries, right?"
2620.94,2626.3," So the Quad stands to gain from this economically as well, if China does retaliate."
2626.6,2634.2," So then secondly, about this US retaliation, where the US forces its partners to stop trading with"
2634.2,2639.56," China, right? So I've already explained to you why Chinese money is just worse for those Quad"
2639.56,2646.38," countries and why they'd be far better off with US money. But secondly, there's secondary benefits"
2646.38,2648.48," for these countries as well, right?"
2648.48,2650.26, They gain fishing grounds
2650.26,2653.24, from simply having more US ships in the South China Sea.
2653.24,2655.38," I'll explain this in a moment, right?"
2655.38,2659.9, They also still will allow trade for the things
2659.9,2663.72, that they can actually hold a specific advantage
2663.72,2664.92, over China with.
2664.92,2665.68, It isn't like there's
2665.68,2671.04, going to be some crazy exclusivity because ultimately like germany still trades with russia
2671.04,2677.36, right now despite them being in nato the us hasn't forced them to stop right they cannot force them
2677.36,2683.92, to stop so ultimately like there isn't this binary in terms of trade and economics are far more
2683.92,2686.24, complex than team sing Singapore want to describe
2686.24,2693.02," them as. But then thirdly, about military. So they wanted to frame this as like our main impact in"
2693.02,2698.14," the debate, and we have to prove that we provide so much more military defense on our side of the"
2698.14,2704.44," house. We don't think we do, because sort of at the point at which we create stronger alliances"
2704.44,2705.4," between these countries,"
2705.86,2710.04," formalize things, you know, the benefits we talked about in our first speech as well,"
2710.26,2714.76, in terms of simply like having more stability because you have more troops in that country
2714.76,2720.92, means more investment from Western states. We don't need a benefit specifically in terms of
2720.92,2725.52," military, but we can still provide one. So two main points under this clutch. Firstly,"
2725.66,2730.56," about these specific encounters, right? They wanted to talk, like give us this tough situation"
2730.56,2736.28, where like a Chinese vessel shoots a Filipino fishing boat. The thing is we like gave you
2736.28,2741.1, reasons in the first speech. And then they thought they had come up with this before we actually gave
2741.1,2745.76," you reasons, right? But actually it's far less likely to escalate"
2745.76,2749.5," into something dangerous because these sorts of things,"
2749.5,2752.82," like the things that you're trained to deal with, right?"
2752.82,2756.34, You mitigate the response of the country to hold them back
2756.34,2758.38, from actually launching a full out war.
2759.34,2761.44, China's just far less likely to do it
2761.44,2763.62, if they risk nuclear war over something.
2763.62,2765.6, If the US literally parks a ship
2765.6,2770.72, in front of the fishing vessel china can't do anything they're far more likely to do this
2770.72,2775.76, instead of just sending their you know monthly uh sort of carriers through the region actually
2775.76,2781.68, committing troops putting naval bases there moving more people there so that it's very difficult to
2781.68,2788.16, do anything without actually escalating because China likes to prey on the weaker countries as opposed to the ones with more defense.
2788.16,2793.86," Right. And then this last idea they throw out about the Indian War, like nothing will happen there anyways."
2793.86,2801.48, Like India and Pakistan are nuclear powers. No one wants to risk a nuclear war over like a region there.
2801.48,2839.34," This is insane. They just wanted to throw this out to distract us. Don't take the big panel. All right, thank you very much for that speech."
2839.34,2842.56, And now we go back to the opposition for the third opposition speech.
2842.56,2848.26, Good luck.
2849.76,2851.28," Hi, am I visible and audible?"
2852.12,2859.36, Thank you.
2861.22,2862.76, There are three important things I want to be clear before I go any further.
2862.76,2864.76," First, their case is premised"
2864.76,2865.16, on a
2865.16,2870.5, genuinely bizarre assumption that all aggressive Chinese actions are deterred by this regional
2870.5,2876.38," defence pact. This is just false. As we point out, all their pact does is deter the most extreme"
2876.38,2881.72," kinds of aggression, like a hot war or direct military intervention, and we give you structural"
2881.72,2889.24," reasons why they were not responded to. First, if they were going to invade, for example, over China building an island or doing the BRI, then no"
2889.24,2893.82," state would ever join, because then the cost of conflict and its likelihood will be prohibitively"
2893.82,2899.32," high. Second, we pointed out this is just inherent to the nature of a regional defense pact. Take a"
2899.32,2903.56," look at NATO, it's exactly like this, where they don't deter other things, but what they do deter"
2903.56,2909.84," is explicit invasion. The problem with this strategy is that the most aggressive actions, like China literally"
2909.84,2914.86," invading the Philippines, which they seem to think is imminently likely, is not going to happen on"
2914.86,2919.04," either side of the house. And I want to point out they have not responded to the reasons we gave you,"
2919.04,2923.3," but how first, the cost will be prohibitively high, given all of the concessions they made"
2923.3,2925.38, about how China trades a lot with these countries.
2925.74,2926.72," Second and more importantly,"
2927.04,2928.78, we pointed out there is still a risk
2928.78,2930.24, that other countries might get involved.
2930.56,2932.28," There is a risk, for example, on our side of the house,"
2932.5,2934.36, that the US might come to Taiwan's rescue.
2934.48,2934.96," It's not explicit,"
2935.26,2936.5, but the fact is that the risk is there
2936.5,2938.08, and that risk is sufficient to deter them
2938.08,2939.66, because the cost would obviously still
2939.66,2940.88, be very high in that case.
2941.06,2942.08, We give you a litany of reasons
2942.08,2942.92, that we're not responding to.
2943.28,2944.76, The problem then is that they lose
2944.76,2947.86," on the more moderate types of aggression, which we point out. For example,"
2948.06,2951.44," things like tariffs, things like cyber wars, things like election meddling, which China is"
2951.44,2955.72," more incented to do, but they don't deter. That's the first thing. So they already lose. The explicit"
2955.72,2960.3," strategy does not work. Second, they completely miss out on what the relevant comparative is."
2960.72,2965.02," They don't understand that in our world, states can still thread a delicate balance between both"
2965.02,2970.02," the US and China. The response we get from third proposition is honestly glib. He says, but it's"
2970.02,2975.24," okay. If you alienate China by joining the pack, the US will just substitute. I'm sorry, the US"
2975.24,2979.24," cannot substitute you for things, for example, like the kind of things that China manufactures,"
2979.38,2983.16," because they can't do it at the same cheap price, and they don't have the same factories. China,"
2983.26,2987.88," for example, cannot substitute for the fact that the US export market is just much more valuable and that much"
2987.88,2992.06, bigger. They cannot substitute for valuable US infrastructure. This is a lazy response. They
2992.06,2995.74," miss out on the fact that they force countries to choose. Third, on our second speaker's substantive,"
2996.14,3000.28, know that they dropped this about democracy and didn't properly respond to ours about increasing
3000.28,3008.52," conflict in India. All they said was, they are nuclear powers, so it's a wash. Here's a newsflash. Conflict has already broken out there before in the 1980s,"
3008.6,3012.5," when both countries were nuclear powers. They did not respond to the structural analysis we gave you,"
3012.64,3016.44," and this is very important in the round, because whatever benefits they get must be weighed against"
3016.44,3021.02," the significant human cost that comes when this conflict happens, and it's infinitely more bloody"
3021.02,3029.16," and brutal. It's too late to respond in reply. With that in mind, I'm going to ask two questions. First, how would China respond to countries who join? Second, how would"
3029.16,3032.94, the US respond? Note that I'm going to spend less time on the second question because we gave you
3032.94,3038.12," an entire argument about this, but they did not respond to anything. First, how would China respond"
3038.12,3042.24, to countries who join? The relevant question in this round is whether China is going to be
3042.24,3049.12, aggressive or whether they're going to try to win them back here are all the reasons we gave you for why an aggressive response is much more
3049.12,3054.46, likely and I want to point out they did not respond to any of this first this just deters
3054.46,3058.66, many other countries from joining you scare away countries like the Philippines or countries like
3058.66,3063.22, Vietnam from joining when for example if Malaysia were to join you put trade tariffs on them and
3063.22,3069.72, destroy their economy so this is very important I want you to know that them saying investment walls right does not work here
3069.72,3073.98, because being nice does not achieve veterans for the very obvious reason that my second speaker
3073.98,3078.24, points out if you for example invest a lot of things in this country and you try and give them
3078.24,3081.84, a lot of aid that doesn't mean they're not going to join the pack they can still eventually do so
3081.84,3092.4, they can accept your information and your aid and then join before i go on sure i'll take the point your your whole idea is sort of premised on the fact that china
3092.4,3097.28, is suddenly going to figure out that they really need to like slap tariffs on everybody why would
3097.28,3102.88, they do this like there isn't an inherent difference in narrative now they've already
3102.88,3105.92, called it asian nato i'll explain this
3105.92,3110.96, right now this brings me to my second reason which is their counter reason that china can't afford
3110.96,3115.44, to tariff states because they are just too poor and they are suffering from like a banking crisis
3115.44,3120.8, for example is very unpersuasive and here are all the reasons why first our comparative wasn't just
3120.8,3124.8, about tariffs we told you that china is more incentive to do things like election meddling
3124.8,3128.18, like increased military exercises like more more cyber attacks. And if you
3128.18,3132.38," want evidence of this, just take a look at Taiwan. There is a reason that China is not pursuing"
3132.38,3136.92," election meddling in Vietnam now, but they are doing so in Taiwan. It's because Taiwan is"
3136.92,3141.96," explicitly alienated China. There's a reason that China, for example, pursued election meddling in"
3141.96,3149.34," Japan the moment they tried to claim the Senkaku Islands, but not any time before and not any time after. The reason is what they tell you. China is a"
3149.34,3153.58," rational actor. Precisely because of that, they have no incentive to want to antagonize countries"
3153.58,3158.14, unless there is an explicit reason to. There is now an explicit benefit of doing so because of
3158.14,3161.76, deterrence. So that's exactly what we told you from the start. There is nothing. They have not
3161.76,3168.62, responded to this at all. Here are more responses to this claim about tariffs that we gave you in Anhao that they just did not respond to. And this
3168.62,3173.12," is a huge contradiction. It cuts both ways. If it is true that China is suffering from the pandemic,"
3173.38,3177.68," that they have, for example, a very bad banking sector, how then will they do the investment wars"
3177.68,3180.92," they say they're going to do in their world and invest a lot of money? Obviously, it cuts both"
3180.92,3185.08," ways. They can't have their cake and eat it. Lastly, even if it is true"
3185.08,3189.54," that China is suffering from very poor underlying economic conditions, we have already responded to"
3189.54,3193.8," this in second because we pointed out in that case, all it means is that there are some costs"
3193.8,3198.02, to implementing tariffs. What it does not mean is that China will never implement tariffs. What it
3198.02,3202.04, means is that they will implement tariffs in instances where the benefits exceed the costs.
3202.46,3209.5," My second speaker explains why this is structurally likely in this instance, not only because China is trying to rapidly expand in Asia, but because geopolitical"
3209.5,3213.08," conflict with the US is something of deep importance to it, which is why, for example,"
3213.14,3217.52," it's trying to do it, for example, which is why it often does a lot of things like the BRI and"
3217.52,3222.12," puts itself in debt. Even though this is objectively economically bad for it, the own examples of the"
3222.12,3229.12," BRI prove that in many cases, China is willing to prioritize losing on the economy to gain influence so what I've demonstrated thus far"
3229.12,3233.8, is that in their aggressive responses against countries that join are hugely likely these are
3233.8,3238.0, devastating because you destroy these economies for smaller countries for example like laws that
3238.0,3241.42, desperately need Chinese trade you completely wreck their economy on their side of the house
3241.42,3246.8," when China imposes tariffs for other countries when for example you do things like election metal, you completely destroy their domestic"
3246.8,3250.8, politics. These are all huge harms happening in their world for not ours because we don't
3250.8,3255.84," explicitly force countries to pick a side, so China has no incentive to do these things to you."
3255.84,3261.2," That's why we win on this. Second question on the US. Before I go any further, I also want to point"
3261.2,3264.56," out that under this, they have not, they've completely dropped all of the analysis they"
3264.56,3268.52," gave you about US investors. At the start, they said US investors are much more"
3268.52,3272.8, likely to invest in the region because there's a security guarantee. At the point where my first
3272.8,3277.86, speaker explicitly makes clear that the chance of the investors' worries that there's going to be
3277.86,3281.68," war is non-existent on both sides, they dropped this. My second speaker brought it up again,"
3281.9,3287.74," their third did not revive it. So obviously, they do not care about this argument. They cannot bring it up in prop reply. Most importantly,"
3288.06,3292.9, they did not respond to anything we told you about US retaliation. We pointed out the US is not a
3292.9,3296.86," hyper-rational actor all the time. Often, they are part of domestic politics. And within domestic"
3296.86,3301.54," politics, there's a huge incentive to show off anti-China credentials. We then point out the"
3301.54,3306.0, best way of showing off anti-China credentials is to target countries that did not join.
3306.0,3309.0, Here's where I take out that third prop's new shift because he says countries can stay neutral.
3309.0,3315.0," Of course not. As we pointed out from the start, if you don't join, you are explicitly signaling that you are not with the US,"
3315.0,3319.0," that you do not, for example, want to protect the US or its allies in the case of Chinese aggression."
3319.0,3322.0, So obviously not joining doesn't mean staying neutral. It means you alienate them.
3322.0,3327.92, I want to point out that this lack of response to our point about domestic politics is devastating it means that in their
3327.92,3332.42, world the US politicians are going to have a huge incentive to say look at these countries that did
3332.42,3336.32, not join us in our fight against China and do things for example like slash foreign aid to them
3336.32,3340.4, so all of these are huge harms again they must accrue at the end of this round I want you to
3340.4,3345.04, remember one thing outside the house countries need both US and they need the China.
3348.92,3349.14," On their world, they force them to pick one and there are huge harms when they only choose one."
3380.2,3383.92, We let them have that cake and eat it in our world. A new we stay with the opposition for the first reply speech of the debate.
3383.92,3389.24, Good luck.
3390.86,3392.84," Hi, can I be seen and heard?"
3417.64,3423.16," Great, thank you. Let's look at the two worlds in this debate. From the get-go, Proposition's world was once shrouded in confusion. They said that China would be deterred from engaging in all kinds of"
3423.16,3425.28," aggression, from the BRI to building"
3425.28,3431.08," islands in the South China Sea to violating sovereignty, without even explaining what their"
3431.08,3437.22, defence pact would actually respond to and when it would actually be activated. We observed right
3437.22,3443.04," from first that they have a dilemma to resolve. Empirically, their defence pact would never deter"
3443.04,3448.66, this kind of economic aggression because it only guarantees retaliation against military invasion.
3448.66,3453.26, But if their defence pact actually forced nations to declare war once China makes one
3453.26,3458.28," aggressive move, no country would join the pact because they actually would have a 90%"
3458.28,3461.12, chance of creating a third world war.
3461.12,3465.66," Unfortunately, when they realised this massive problem for their case, their world"
3465.66,3471.44, walked themselves into a web of contradictions. They said that China was too economically weak
3471.44,3476.5," after the pandemic to launch tariffs, but it was so economically powerful that it could continue"
3476.5,3483.18," debt trap diplomacy, expand the BRI, and engage in investment wars. They said that China was"
3483.18,3485.76," really, really scared of entering a hot war"
3485.76,3491.0," with a nuclear power, but that they would really, really also start a hot war without this pact,"
3491.22,3496.4, even though Biden has made the explicit commitment to defend Taiwan and the US has a strong defense
3496.4,3502.04, presence in the South China Sea. We were very clear from the top. Opposition's world was built
3502.04,3506.48, to prevent the wrong kind of aggression. It was built to prevent
3506.48,3512.14," military aggression that would never materialize in the first place, because the US would be very"
3512.14,3517.44," likely to intervene, because China is a rational actor that cannot afford to spend hundreds of"
3517.44,3523.06, billions of dollars in a war. So this debate is not about preventing military aggression. It was
3523.06,3525.44, about preventing the political and economic
3525.44,3530.5, aggression that the defense pact could not possibly deter. Their central response down the
3530.5,3535.62, bench was just misleading. They said China is economically struggling and cannot afford to
3535.62,3541.58," retaliate. This just cherry picks examples, because as we observed down the bench, election meddling"
3541.58,3549.82," and cyber attacks really don't actually cost that much money. When they realized this problem, their world shifted under their feet. Their only"
3549.82,3555.52, constructive benefit by the end in their shrinking case was about helping Asia-Pacific states as the
3555.52,3560.92, U.S. ramps up investment in the region to substitute China and win these states over to join
3560.92,3565.14, the pact. Never mind the fact that they never built any clear causal links between
3565.14,3570.12, this defense pact and this outcome. Never mind that they didn't understand the U.S. could not
3570.12,3574.56," substitute China, because as Harith pointed out, they were fundamentally different economies with"
3574.56,3579.34, different exports and demands for imports. The bigger problem with this hill they chose to die
3579.34,3585.74," on was that it was preempted down the bench. We observed why the US would not want to win these states back,"
3585.94,3590.3, because this defence pact draws a clear line in the sand between states on the Chinese side
3590.3,3594.96, and the US side. And US politicians have historically retaliated against states
3594.96,3600.8," on the other side, because that's more popular domestically. In contrast, our world was one"
3600.8,3605.18," where China did not ramp up aggressive actions like electoral interference,"
3610.52,3610.92," cyber warfare, and tariffs. Yes, it's true that China currently engages in some form of aggression,"
3614.78,3619.74," but we pointed out that it would just be a lie to say that they're maximally aggressive, because as they concede, China's a rational actor that does not bomb ships whenever it feels like"
3619.74,3625.98, doing so. That's why our world was one where Chinese aggression was mitigated. Our world was one that
3625.98,3631.6," understood the nuances of the status quo, that currently states tread a delicate balance between"
3631.6,3637.38," US and China. Philippines, for example, received substantial FDI from the US while actively"
3637.38,3646.04," exporting to Chinese markets. The problem is that in their world, an explicit alliance is created which forces states into"
3646.04,3647.54, a binary choice.
3647.54,3649.44," Additionally, our world was also"
3649.44,3660.6, The only response of nuclear weapons existing just ignores historical reality.
3660.6,3663.18," Ultimately, we were very clear down the bench."
3663.18,3666.18, A new NATO is a new Cold War. We are very
3666.18,3687.24," proud to oppose. Thank you very much for that speech. And now for the final speech to debate, we return"
3687.24,3691.08, to the proposition reply. Good luck.
3691.08,3714.2," All right, I'll presume I'm audible and visible. Let me know if that's not the case. just a second. Okay, starting in three, two, one. Panel, the South China Sea is full of"
3714.2,3721.48," predatory species, but China is without a doubt the most predatory, and that is what we propose"
3721.48,3729.14," limiting. This debate has been very messy, right? Let's clear it up in two clashes. Firstly, on economics, and secondly, on conflicts and military escalations."
3729.42,3733.7," So on the first clash about economics, right? So notice, right, Singapore, like, switches"
3733.7,3737.28," their stance a lot. They talk about, like, first, they say, like, oh, you know, it's"
3737.28,3741.48," more likely that we'll see economic, you know, forms of aggression. And then when, like,"
3741.66,3745.84," I debat that, when Khalid is debat that, like, change it up and they're like, oh, no, no, no."
3745.84,3751.48, We're also talking about military. Right. But then they go back in their reply and third and talk only about this.
3751.52,3754.18, But sure. You know what? Let's talk about economic aggression.
3754.66,3757.3, So I think the main question here is like what's more likely?
3758.4,3762.52," Well, the two like firstly about tariffs versus investment wars and secondly about the balance of trade."
3762.54,3769.44," So firstly, on like tariffs versus investment wars and secondly about the balance of trade so firstly on like tariffs versus investment wars right so they basically say oh look at everything proposition pointed out like"
3769.44,3773.84, uh china is losing money so it's not likely that they will be investing right i think this is a
3773.84,3780.48, very important like comparative right china does not have like a lot of money to lose so where do
3780.48,3785.94, you lose money is it a when you slap tariffs and sanctions on your neighboring countries?
3786.1,3790.48," Or is it B, when you invest with the hopes of gaining something back?"
3790.72,3795.52," Right. Tariffs and sanctions are effective when we're talking about, like, I don't know, the US versus China."
3795.52,3805.08," But when China needs these trade partners, it's a lot more likely that they will engage in the only scenario which actually hopefully brings them back profit right that is"
3805.08,3809.52, what we've explained down the bench which is why it's still more likely that like even countries
3809.52,3814.38, that don't immediately join this like quad like alliance right this is like our worst case scenario
3814.38,3818.72, the countries that don't immediately join why they still gain benefits right but then on the balance
3818.72,3823.8, of trade so opposition says oh you know these countries are now not able to be like neutral etc
3823.8,3829.28, like okay i think we told you in most of these cases china needs these countries for like trade partners
3829.28,3834.0, it's likely to have the same incentives to still trade with these countries but now have oversight
3834.0,3839.28, right now be less likely to engage in lucrative like you know trading etc because it's got more
3839.28,3846.56," oversight from the west because it is not the only actor taking place in this region anymore, right? But fine, let's"
3846.56,3850.96," engage in our like worst case scenario, right? Which is biting the bullet that probably a lot"
3850.96,3855.58, of trade with China will stop. Caldas did engage with it. This was what our second argument was
3855.58,3860.94," about, how trade with the US and only the US, which is our worst case scenario, is still better"
3860.94,3865.56," than trade with like only practically like with China in the region, right?"
3865.66,3866.88, With China's growing influence
3866.88,3869.46, and its growing need to facilitate even more trade.
3869.6,3872.5," As we've told you, it's likely to become more aggressive"
3872.5,3874.62," if you do not see like, for example,"
3874.72,3876.88," US or like Western interference, right?"
3876.94,3878.96," No response to this down the bench, right?"
3879.06,3880.52," I think it's still more likely,"
3880.68,3882.52," like if we have like Western trade,"
3882.52,3888.38, it's less likely to have all these lucrative loopholes. It it's less likely to have the currency manipulation which is going on in the
3888.38,3892.64, status quo it's incredibly ineffective what these countries are being put through but then onto the
3892.64,3896.48, second clash about the military and like other conflicts right i think the main question here
3896.48,3901.36, is when china is like maximally aggressive because they tell you okay in the status quo there are like
3901.36,3908.92," moderate forms of aggression um you know but that's going to be much worse. Now we're going to have like election meddling. I think like, firstly,"
3909.36,3913.68," basically, this already happens, right? But like the question then is like, okay, when is it"
3913.68,3920.48, maximally aggressive? I think when you talk about like competition with the West versus China being
3920.48,3924.46," the main actor in that region and being able to exploit these countries much more directly,"
3924.46,3933.04," it's a lot more likely that China becomes more aggressive, more lucrative, more exploitative when it doesn't have this competition because it doesn't have this competition."
3933.04,3939.28, Right. I think it's more likely in these cases that China is going to become even more exploitative with their currency manipulation.
3939.46,3948.32, Everything we see in the status quo is going to be worse because you don't have this western oversight and because these countries will have less other partners to like turn to when we give them this
3948.32,3952.46, option and they choose this option like it's a lot better right and then they come up with this very
3952.46,3956.78, flimsy response of like oh look at like the way that china's responded to biden uh you know and
3956.78,3960.58, his like uh i don't know like foreign policy with taiwan i think the problem with the foreign policy
3960.58,3964.84, with taiwan is literally there is not an allegiance in place and the fact that the u.s is able to back
3964.84,3968.48, up at any moment as we've given you an analysis of what the US is like
3968.48,3973.12, with NATO it's not likely to be the same with this like it's not likely to just not completely like
3973.12,3976.88, uh to also go back and forth it's likely to genuinely commit to this alliance that is when
3976.88,3981.28, we genuinely get protection for Taiwan and other such countries panel because we save
3981.28,3997.18," the country that opposition leaves behind, we take this debate."
3997.18,4000.7, Thank you guys for the debate.
4000.7,4001.7, Thank you very much.
4001.7,4002.7, Thank you.
4002.7,4004.7, Thank you all for the debate.
4004.7,4006.82, I'll end the recording.
