0.0,16.16, Most of us would agree it is awful when an individual unknowingly signs a predatory loan
16.16,21.02, contract and ends up paying far more in the future than they initially expected. Even if
21.02,29.0," this doesn't bankrupt them, this is still incredibly detrimental. You may believe people playing a free to play video game is trivial, but the financial damage they face is not."
29.0,32.0," Three arguments I'll forward. Firstly, how we prevent exploitation."
32.0,36.0," Secondly, when we get fair gameplay. Lastly, how we reduce addiction."
36.0,39.0," Before that, set up. One, what are the incentives of gaming companies?"
39.0,42.0," We say most firms are profit maximizing, but have different revenue models."
42.0,49.12, This debate is about which profit models companies would use we say for free to play games they have to make the game as addictive as possible
49.12,53.76, to the extent that individuals are willing to put in real cash companies like epic have entire
53.76,59.12, departments dedicated to exacerbating addiction by working psychologists compared to free to play
59.12,62.88, compared to free games right now or one-time pay games we say they often earn their money through
62.88,68.22, either getting the upfront cost of the game of downloading the app or through advertising and attracting many players
68.22,73.16," who can play and play the upfront cost. Second question, what is the current market of free to"
73.16,76.88, play games? We said there's a current market dominance. Look at the most popular games right
76.88,81.74," now. League of Legends, Fortnite, Genshin, Brawl Stars, Clash Royale. These are becoming incredibly"
81.74,89.04, profitable and therefore many new games are also conditioning to this model third question how do we ban free to play games on our site we say we would stop them
89.04,92.8, we would stop new ones from existing companies would have to change their profit structures for
92.8,97.12, the current games that exist developers would make new players pay it upfront cause if you start for
97.12,101.28, existing players they just get to play the games but can no longer buy things like upgrades what is
101.28,108.96," this but this however doesn't mean that we suddenly lose half the games on the market but those those games probably adapt to non-free-to-play models. Fourthly, what is our preferred"
108.96,113.28, comparative? We prefer games to be either free or have a one-time cost when you download the app.
113.28,117.2," Realistically, we agree not a lot of these games will be free, but we will argue why games are"
117.2,122.0," still more accessible and less costly on our side. First argument, how do we prevent exploitation?"
122.0,127.4," When gamblers entice you with supposed low costs until they trap you in a cycle of addiction, that is unjust."
127.4,129.86, The first question under this is how does exploitation occur
129.86,131.4, with the free to play gaming model?
131.4,132.82," We say, when you enter the game,"
132.82,134.64, you often view the cost to be pretty low.
134.64,135.78, It is actually free.
135.78,137.2, You see your friends playing the game.
137.2,138.56, You think it might be worth a try.
138.56,139.68, You therefore download it.
139.68,141.78, Even if you are aware of the payment level ups
141.78,143.74," in the future, you feel as if you're not going"
143.74,148.16, to get that addicted. That is not going to be you. Then you won't be needing to make these payments. But
148.16,151.84," as you start playing more, often subconsciously when your friends are also hooked onto it,"
151.98,156.34, it is more likely individuals commit far more time and effort into this game. Here's when the
156.34,160.38," costs start to gradually kick in and increase. When you get better at the game, this is when"
160.38,163.64, you are told to purchase additional weapons and perks in League of Legends in order to win
163.64,167.48, ranked battles. This is something that often happens naturally and unconsciously.
167.7,171.22," In Valorant, for example, you play one game with the six characters that come free."
171.22,175.2," Then you see other people playing with locked characters that have cooler abilities, better skill sets."
175.4,179.56," You also want to access that because often when individuals are gaming, they're hyper competitive."
179.94,188.64, You then either have to spend thousands of hours on the game in order to unlock all of these characters or you have to pay for them one of those options is often physically impossible for many individuals
188.64,192.88, they end up just paying in most cases but in addition when you have already invested more
192.88,197.2, time into the gameplay these companies start charging you to level up by making you purchase
197.2,201.52, powerpoints and brawl stars in clash royale it's really frustrating for you to get to level 99 but
201.52,208.92, not be able to access level 100 because you need to pay. It means people often end up paying because they don't want their hours wasted. Companies also implement these
208.92,213.06, payments in very subtle ways that make individuals not be able to realize it. So no single purchase
213.06,217.64," may be worth a lot of money, i.e. it doesn't cost you hundreds of dollars to buy a skin, but that"
217.64,221.96, cost adds up and increases when you're consistently putting in money to make these upgrades in the
221.96,228.36," long run. Most importantly, this accumulates over time. The more you've committed, the greater your sunk cost. You have spent so much money,"
228.48,232.38, you do not want to waste it. This means players don't end up opting out. They simply choose to
232.38,236.66," make these purchases in the future. Additionally, there's often obsessive cultures. This is when"
236.66,240.84," your favorite streamers both buy gun skins, when all your friends seem cooler than you. This is a"
240.84,244.88," networking effect, when you do not want to be left out of the fun and you buy even if it's not really"
244.88,247.84, useful for you. Why has this been really harmful? It's harmful on two
247.84,252.76," levels. Firstly, principally, this is a predatory and exploitative profit model. This is no different"
252.76,257.08," from how loan sharks currently operate. When they entice you with supposedly low interest rates,"
257.22,260.9," when they prey on your vulnerability to get money quickly, when they tell you that the future cost"
260.9,264.54, is not something you should have to massively worry about when your current cost or your current
264.54,267.68, satisfaction right now is important. It is then something you should have to massively worry about when your current cost or your current satisfaction right now is important it is then morally legitimate for
267.68,272.08, governments to intervene and protect consumers from predatory corporations and gaming models
272.08,276.64, note that governments already do this with lots of anti-trust regulations but practically many
276.64,280.8, individuals end up spending lots of money subconsciously throughout time often totaling
280.8,284.72, more than what they would otherwise pay for with a one-time pay game that usually costs about 20
284.72,289.04, us dollars but also we agree people are probably not going to go bankrupt but you still
289.04,293.6, lose significant significant amounts of money that you could have otherwise used better to better
293.6,297.52, your quality of life to save up for the future and that is still really bad why does this massively
297.52,301.8, reduce on our side on the comparative often individuals don't get this miscalculation
301.8,305.38," either the game is a one-time payment, and when you make this decision,"
305.38,306.64, you're not as addicted yet.
306.64,308.08, You haven't experienced the game yet.
308.08,309.84, You are less likely to be this irrational.
309.84,313.04, We do agree that you may spend time on our side.
313.04,315.22, We see spending time alone to play these games
315.22,317.42, is still better than spending both time and money
317.42,318.52, on their sappy house.
318.52,320.24," Overall, even though one-time payments"
320.24,321.5," may be higher at first,"
321.5,323.18, you are likely to spend less on that
323.18,328.56," than on the many upgrades you get in free-to-play games. Second argument, how do we get more entertaining gameplay? Before that,"
328.62,333.8," I'll take a point. Yeah, buying a $20 skin, cosmetic skin, doesn't cause massive harm."
334.16,337.74, Product toy marketing is literally just advertising. Would you also ban makeup for
337.74,343.9," preying on people's insecurities? No, no, no. Our claim is that cost increases over time,"
344.04,349.0," and even though the cost is not very high at the start, that gradually increases and it's something you can control."
349.0,355.0," Secondly, how do we get more entertaining gameplay? The first question under this is what are the incentives of free-to-play gaming companies?"
355.0,366.48, Because this is their one stream of revenue on their side. Companies have strong incentives to make as many people as possible spend and make in-game purchases de facto necessary. Why does this decrease competition in games? Because this incentive means corporations
366.48,369.36, code the game so it's difficult to win against another player
369.36,370.74," with better skins, for instance."
370.74,373.08," Regardless of the effort or time players put in,"
373.08,376.08, the game is designed so you are enticed to buying the add-ons.
376.08,378.66," Obviously, it's not that players who pay automatically"
378.66,381.06," win because it's boring, but that they have a far higher"
381.06,383.68, chance or you perceive them to have a higher chance.
383.68,388.72," So with Genshin Impact, it looks like the game making it practically impossible to hit a final boss level so people"
388.72,393.2, end up spending lots of money on better characters like a yaka to get there it means that in brawl
393.2,397.28, stars people can die very quickly if they don't have rare chromatic high power characters why is
397.28,401.28, this so harmful it means you actually reduce the satisfaction of the game it's frustrating when you
401.28,408.32, spend hours on a game when it means it's frustrating with the hours you spend on a game means nothing when there's a player who paid who means they have
408.32,412.24, a disproportionate advantage and you do not get fair gameplay. Games are meant to be enjoyable
412.24,416.4, in a competition of skill that gives you a shot of dopamine rather than competition of who can pay
416.4,420.24, the most. What is the comparative? We say players are more likely to compete on fair grounds on our
420.24,423.92, side. You do not need to pay in order to win but rather you can practice and mix these and
423.92,428.56," make these games a lot more fun. On our side, players probably still have to commit some time, but it is far less"
428.56,433.36," likely companies make people play for hours or thousands of hours to get a rank upgrade, because"
433.36,437.36, very few will commit in that case. Likely they will decrease the game time needed for you to get
437.36,441.52," a certain upgrade, so we don't think a time commitment is symmetric. Lastly then, on reducing"
441.52,447.12," addiction, the premise is addiction is really dangerous. It deprives people of their autonomy and traps them."
447.12,451.04, We say that free-to-play games give companies a much stronger incentive to get people addicted
451.04,452.04, in the first place.
452.04,455.3," When you want people to play the game more and more, buy more things, and this is your"
455.3,459.52," profit model by the way, in order to incentivize users to buy their upgrades, game companies"
459.52,461.44, have to make you extremely addicted to it.
461.44,468.48," You have to be willing to go a step further to give up your real life hard earned money in these game upgrades. On our side, if there's an upfront cost you set up"
468.48,472.4," or if you use advertising revenue, there's less of an incentive to get people addicted to playing"
472.4,477.2," your game 24-7. Instead, it's about getting new people to join your game and we say those incentives"
477.2,481.68, are very different. Why do companies not maximize addictive potential irregular games on our side?
481.68,488.62," Because if the game has an upfront cost, there's no marginal revenue to be gained by keeping a user glued to the screen 24-7. You already have obtained some"
488.62,493.42," level of the revenue. But if a game has no upfront cost, we see companies do admittedly earn money"
493.42,497.42, through ads and thus keep users on for longer. But there are some costs to making your game more
497.42,501.76," addictive. This is paying coders, conducting trials with gamers to see if addiction is working."
502.02,508.56, These costs aren't worth it if all you stand to gain is some marginal ad revenue however in-game transactions are more valuable they exceed
508.56,512.8, the cost of making a game more difficult that's why it is asymmetric on both sides of the house
512.8,517.6, we are decided to ensure that gaming companies are unable to prey on individuals to prey on
517.6,525.32, individuals vulnerabilities we have decided that makers companies are unable to adopt predatory profit-gaining models.
528.78,529.24," I thank the speaker for the fine speech,"
532.76,536.08, and now I call on the first opposition speaker to open the bench side here.
541.54,542.92," Hi, can I be heard?"
544.14,544.9, Yes.
545.72,546.1, All right.
547.1,547.58, Give me a minute.
554.96,559.3," I'll take verbal QIC, starting my speech in 3, 2, 1."
559.56,563.14, The ability to access escapism should never be locked behind a paywall.
563.5,589.4," Proposition leaves the emotionally distressed participants of society two options. Struggle with their stresses unaided or pay for the right to solace. The stance on opposition is threefold. Number one, we support the status quo without banning free-to-play games, and we support propositions assertions give access to a sizable portion of the game meaning that the advantages are not necessary to obtaining the experience of"
589.4,594.68, the game it nearly enhances it for example if you get skins it's merely a customizing the looks of
594.68,598.58, your characters or you have certain leg ups but you can still complete the quest without paying
598.58,602.9, all of these lastly we think that financial transactions can have information so that
602.9,609.52," people know that they're not being scammed insofar as propositions like harm in this debate, it's about harmful financial"
609.52,613.44, decisions and not actually problems with video games. We think we can have regulations to make
613.44,617.92, sure people don't ridiculously spend on things they don't know what they're getting into.
617.92,621.92, We think proposition therefore cannot just give us a laundry list of harms. Just because something
621.92,628.44," is bad doesn't mean you have to ban it, given that everybody doesn't extract the same harm that proposition claims. We're going to prove to you"
628.44,632.62," why in most instances that harm doesn't exist, and why therefore you shouldn't meet the standard to"
632.62,636.7," ban this. But before I do that, three responses to the speaker before me. Firstly, on their mechanism,"
636.84,640.46, and this also responses to their third argument. They tell you that they have the incentive to
640.46,644.38," make games as addictive as possible, but what they're really telling you is a euphemism for"
644.38,648.7, as enjoyable as possible. Because the only thing that games can really do to you is make
648.7,653.26, you highly invested in the game making an incredibly like entertaining user experience
653.26,657.58, this also responds to their last argument but we would like to note as well that if addiction was
657.58,662.14, so harmful and so crucial to this debate the same incentives apply because you need the people to
662.14,668.38, pay 20 enter the game to be so addicted to the game that they ask their friends to play as well that they recommend it to their communities and
668.38,672.3, that they keep playing or still buying games from that same company insofar as that companies are
672.3,676.94, still profit incentivized the addiction claim stands on both sides of the house but secondly
676.94,682.26, on exploitation then I think it's only exploitation insofar as one side loses out in the transaction
682.26,690.0, insofar as you pay and you get satisfaction from it it's uncurse to why that is clearly and inherently a harmful form of so-called exploitation
690.0,694.32, what proposition really needs to tell us is why the decisions to access happiness a sense of
694.32,699.04, accomplishment a sense of community through these games is inherently invalid and they cannot access
699.04,703.68, this because we think you're paying for the happiness for example on screen this is something
703.68,708.44, some people do genuinely want and find happiness in. Proposition cannot invalidate that just because they don't
708.44,712.96," think it is valuable. But all of their harms then are not unique, right? Because not unique to video"
712.96,716.92," games or to free-to-play games. Because if you were engrossed in fashions, you would buy the"
716.92,721.26," latest products. Unlike their response to the POI, the cost does increase over time. You start with"
721.26,728.22," drugstore lip balm, you move on to more expensive high-end products.end products it is symmetrical proposition cannot say that they want to ban everything that has some"
728.22,733.38, kind of addiction or some kind of like ability to get you invested in the subject but secondly they
733.38,737.58, tell you about how they incentivize you to buy things in subtle ways by pricing things cheaply
737.58,742.08, this doesn't lead to exploitation this is just marketing and selling their products it's uncares
742.08,749.04, to why that is inherently exploitative and immoral but lastly then the only moral hazard therefore they give us is loan sharks but the difference here is
749.04,753.36, that loan sharks promise you money you don't get games provide you with happiness and a sense of
753.36,757.28, accomplishment that you do achieve at the end of the day they promise you excitement you get
757.28,761.04, excitement that is the only reason why you continue playing and the only reason why you will continue
761.04,764.88, in the game in a free-to-play model given you could just leave the game since there is no sunk
764.88,767.84, cost in that game whatsoever we think in fact we increase the
767.84,772.64, ability for users to like uh be responsible in their purchases given that there is no sunk cost
772.64,776.72, fallacy they would opt out if they didn't want to engage in the game but lastly let's talk about
776.72,781.52, fair gameplay right i think let's just note up first it is ridiculous for proposition to assert
781.52,788.94, that government somehow gets to decide what genshinhin does and whether or not Genshin is a fair gameplay why is that anywhere in the realm of the
788.94,793.44, responsibility of banning but I think it also mischaracterizes what it means to engage in free
793.44,797.94, to play gameplay we told you that the games would already be meaningfully accessible and it will not
797.94,802.62, be necessarily so it's so difficult and frustrating because then nobody would engage in the game but
802.62,806.1," also noting that our worst case, where they do make it impossible"
806.1,807.7," for you to reach the final boss level,"
807.98,808.8, note the crucial nuance.
808.92,810.54," This is the final, final level."
810.72,812.8," Out of the millions of majorities of players,"
813.02,814.52," most people never even get that far,"
814.7,816.32, which means that the accessibility and happiness
816.32,818.74, we afford to consumers are on a far broader scale
818.74,819.86, when Proposition only deals
819.86,821.86, with the last minority of individuals.
822.16,823.22, And we don't think they're as important
823.22,825.5, when you weigh it out with the solace others can get.
825.64,826.5," But crucially as well,"
826.52,827.86," if they wanted to talk about gameplay,"
828.08,830.78," I think proposition cannot talk about like exploitation, right?"
830.78,831.62, They either have to choose.
831.76,833.92, They want good gameplay or they want good consumers.
834.24,835.64," Insofar as proposition conflicts,"
835.76,836.88," good gameplay and exploitation,"
837.18,838.02, they cannot have both.
838.22,839.94," Before I go on to my argument, I'll take a point."
840.88,841.72," Just to confirm,"
841.96,844.36, you believe individuals spending thousands of hours a year
844.36,847.0, in gaming is good because people gain enjoyment from it?
847.0,851.0," Yeah, just because you don't enjoy it doesn't mean other people don't, right? Other people might not find happiness in debating."
851.0,857.0," Some people think that you don't find happiness from speaking to a camera, but that is what you decide, and we think they should allow them to make these decisions."
857.0,863.0," Two arguments then to forward from opposition. Firstly, on why it's crucial to protect the autonomy of individuals in three ways."
863.0,868.4," Number one, let's talk about the importance of free-to-play games to consumers. We think this looks like two crucial structural"
868.4,872.88," reasons. We think firstly, this is the perfect balance between accessibility and enjoyable,"
872.88,877.36," because on proposition, these premium games require you to pay upfront and most individuals"
877.36,882.32," don't have the capacity to spend, for example, $20 of their lunch money on seeking solace every month."
882.32,888.88," But secondly, we think this crucially because it's so accessible it creates the largest community base and for example it becomes more competitive"
888.88,893.84, so you have more people to interact with people use these advices as stress relief as escapism
893.84,898.16, it is uniquely that interactive competition that provides individuals with the adrenaline rush
898.16,902.24, and that exciting engagement of all senses that assaults the individuals that allows them to
902.24,907.92, experience this in the best possible way we think banning this takes away doesn't necessarily take away the necessity for an
907.92,912.4, intense vice so proposition would have these individuals default to other methods for example
912.4,916.72, in two ways number one to defaulting to the games which require you to pay which is objectively a
916.72,921.28, bad thing because since proposition says they don't want consumers to spend money on a proposition we
921.28,924.8, are telling you they are going to be spending money because they need to have that vice but
924.8,928.8, secondly it leads to more perniciously more destructive forms of vices i.e
928.8,932.9, vandalism alcoholism or substance abuse because they need something to escape the realities that
932.9,938.0, only we provide we think in most instances people want to release stress from free to play games
938.0,941.6, but we think we uniquely empower their individuality because you can pick and choose
941.6,947.74," between games without the opportunity cost if you you use paid games on Proposition's side of the house, you have to look through reviews,"
947.88,952.88, hypnosis. This is all a time spent that you're not able to spend reliving your unhappiness.
953.0,957.96," We think Proposition loses out on utility there. We say that we're able to pivot,"
958.14,961.88, that all our alternatives will guarantee your self-relaxation because you can choose.
962.14,965.58," But secondly, how does proposition institute a"
965.58,971.9, blanket ban when the impacts and harm differ from person to person? I think other destructive
971.9,976.94," harms we ban in society, they are guaranteed like harms in every single instance, i.e. hard drugs in"
976.94,980.58," most instances, but free-to-play games are structurally different. Since free-to-play games"
980.58,984.56," also don't rely on most people paying their games, it means most people never end up spending money"
984.56,988.0, anyway. The opportunity cost of a majority of the population losing out on this
988.0,992.88, benefit is something we will not stand for but lastly the exclusive benefit because most the
992.88,997.52, opt-in on our side of the house only happens when for example like dota has 8 million players
997.52,1001.52, globally you have chat in game you bond over communities this increased community interaction
1001.52,1007.68, is a crucial problem of solace only we get to claim but the second argument about how we engineer structures to facilitate growth and improvement within the
1007.68,1011.84, industry three things number one the development of a game requires balancing between investing
1011.84,1016.4, into the game and profiteering proposition leaves companies with two options number one no profit at
1016.4,1020.56, all which means it's easily exhausted and you have no incentive to improve the gameplay but secondly
1020.56,1024.72, you only need to have game at the start which means you don't in fact improve it over time
1024.72,1030.56," ours uniquely built on the sustainability of the interests of the consumer base, which also deals with proposition's third argument."
1030.78,1034.54," Because the role of games is to get you engrossed, is to get you to forget reality."
1034.66,1036.58, And that is what we have under our side of the house.
1036.72,1043.96," You're able to extend to people who don't play as well, because when you improve the game, even people who play for free are able to benefit from all of these advances."
1043.96,1045.04, On our side of
1045.04,1049.0, the house we protect the right for individuals to choose we provide we protect the right for
1049.0,1069.0, individuals to have solace proud to oppose I thank the speaker for the fine speech and to can speak here.
1073.0,1073.42," All right, um, so assuming that everybody can hear me, I prefer my POIs audibly."
1075.24,1099.96, So feel free to unmute during our next time. Okay. Team Malaysia is the team that believes that addiction and video gaming simply doesn't
1099.96,1100.96, exist.
1100.96,1111.0," An industry which forces you to spend thousands of hours on gaming, that has literal rehab centers people who have become too addicted, they say, oh, no, addiction is actually just a euphemism for enjoying the game."
1111.0,1117.0," Guys, yes, being addicted to cocaine might mean I enjoy cocaine, but I'm still addicted to cocaine."
1117.0,1122.0," The issue here is that enjoying gaming isn't as innocuous as it seems, because, yes, it's escapism."
1122.0,1128.88," But when it addicts you, traps you out of reality for that long, takes away from other aspects of your life, we say this is an active form. They"
1128.88,1132.84, can't wave away the worst of their damages. Several clashes in the speech and then two splits. Before
1132.84,1136.84," that though, quick note. O1 says based on the motion that paid upgrades are going to be really"
1136.84,1141.14," marginal, unimportant, or cosmetic. Let me read out the motion to Malaysia because they can't seem"
1141.14,1149.1, to do so by themselves. Video games are games that give players access to a sizable portion or to the start of their gaming content without paying.
1149.32,1152.5," What that means is, yes, some of these games might give you a lot of content for free,"
1152.56,1156.2, or they might just give you the start of your game for free. I suggest they actually read the
1156.2,1159.38, info slide. Here's the structural reason that companies won't give you that much content for
1159.38,1163.04," free, though. Companies obviously want money, right? I.e., they want to give you as little"
1163.04,1167.4," content as possible upfront and try to trap everything they can, possibly, behind a paywall."
1167.66,1169.04," Yes, they give you a bit to start off,"
1169.16,1170.68," but then they want you to pay to access more,"
1170.84,1171.76, just like a drug dealer would.
1171.92,1174.12," They give you a bit to begin with, then make you pay for the rest."
1174.26,1175.12, That's the entire point.
1175.38,1176.46," But if we point to reality,"
1176.62,1178.72," which we literally gave you a host of examples at first,"
1178.96,1181.08, the source of payments you make are really important for gameplay.
1181.44,1184.14," In FIFA, even to literally play a full kickoff match,"
1184.14,1184.98, you need to pay.
1188.8,1193.36," Or even if not, we told you it's a perception issue you fear you're losing out people are really competitive it's a networking effect all these issues still exist owen also says regulations"
1193.36,1197.92, exist so people don't make misinformed decisions how are they possibly going to implement
1197.92,1201.84, regulations right look at the only country that's actually implemented regulations unless china
1201.84,1208.56, unless they suggest a totalitarian totalitarian government that watches everything you do in every single game in every single country they really can't
1208.56,1212.32, implement restrictions it's not realistic no practically nowhere in the world does this
1212.32,1216.16, first class who increases addiction because they told us that addiction isn't real it's just
1216.16,1220.48, enjoying the game i already told you how ridiculous this is there are literal rehabilitation centers
1220.48,1229.12," that you have to go to if you get too addicted to something the point is that because gaming companies now have a greater incentive to try to make you get your face glued to the screen,"
1229.3,1233.36," try to get you to pay as much money, because now you're being addicted to the game directly"
1233.36,1237.9," translates to you buying more stuff, which directly translates to more money for the company. That"
1237.9,1241.76, means they have an active incentive to indeed run more trials to make sure that your games are as
1241.76,1248.88," addictive as possible to get people to pay more. They also say, oh, but instead instead of gaming if you lock people behind a paywall for the entire game oh people are now"
1248.88,1254.24, instead going to turn to drugs alcohol and other vices okay think of the average video gamer do you
1254.24,1258.08, really think if they're like oh no i can't play genshin i now have to start snorting coke like
1258.08,1263.36, this isn't practical there's a very different bar of entry to alcoholism versus a video game sure if
1263.36,1268.74," you want a different sort of escapism go watch watch Netflix, go watch TV. I don't think that their harms are remotely realistic."
1269.04,1272.56, It's also a lot more accessible to download a game than to find a dealer or buy lots of alcohol.
1272.74,1276.18," This shows how ridiculous Malaysia's case is. But let's talk about enjoyment, because Malaysia"
1276.18,1280.4, completely misunderstands Maddy's argument when they say that people can't access a significant
1280.4,1284.5," portion of the game and access enjoyment anyway. You may believe that objectively, a game has some"
1284.5,1288.04," opportunities for people, but the perception is comparative. When you play Among Us,"
1288.06,1292.04," for example, you win one game. That's it. That's the full satisfaction because there's nothing else"
1292.04,1296.04," to win or pay for. But when you play Genshin Impact, a free-to-play game, maybe you succeeded"
1296.04,1300.36," at a single mission, but you know you could do more with a payment and you don't feel like you've"
1300.36,1303.6, totally won. You don't get the satisfaction and solace they talk about because the game is
1303.6,1307.52," constantly telling you, hey, level up to access a new thing you know a new part of gameplay"
1307.52,1312.0, a new cool cosmetic skin a new ability that helps you become better at the game this is because you
1312.0,1316.4, compare your successes to the successes of those around you it's obviously not just about skins
1316.4,1319.92, it's about accessing new levels better upgrades to win the game we gave you examples and so does
1319.92,1324.48, the info side so free to play games actually do not give you enjoyment because you are constantly
1324.48,1328.96, frustrated by not being able to actually win the game because there's always another thing to do
1328.96,1333.2, another thing to pay for another level to play here's an analogy maybe malaysia will be happy
1333.2,1336.64, if they win this round but if they don't break i'll be damned if they think this tournament gave
1336.64,1340.72, them any solace right the idea is that if you constantly trap everything behind a greater wall
1340.72,1344.16, then you're not going to get the enjoyment you need second question exploitation because we told
1344.16,1347.46, you very clearly that because of the addictive tendencies and because of the
1347.46,1352.0," misadvertising of such things, this is an exploitative program. What do they say? This"
1352.0,1358.12," isn't like loan sharks. Loan sharks promise you money that you will not get. Judge, here's what"
1358.12,1361.94," a loan shark does. Tell me if this sounds familiar, by the way. Someone tells you that they can give"
1361.94,1368.0," you money to save your dying mother to pay your rent, but they start to exponentially increase interest rates they give you the money up front"
1368.0,1372.08, or maybe the enjoyment from the game up front that's the most attractive part of loan sharks
1372.08,1376.0, but the point is that you only realize what the costs are afterwards even if you know those costs
1376.0,1379.36, theoretically exist they only become real materialize in your mind allow you to make
1379.36,1383.6, a fully consenting informed decision later on that's why people make these calculations bad
1383.6,1388.5," decisions i may realize that a loan truck's interest rates are predatory, but I don't actually realize that and"
1388.5,1392.0, make a decision based on that until it's way too late. The exact same thing happens with video
1392.0,1396.38," gaming. They just tell us, oh, it's a marketing like makeup ads. Okay. Makeup ads may be predatory,"
1396.62,1400.64," but the harm often isn't massive. You buy a cosmetic product, but the harm of predatory"
1400.64,1404.48," marketing is massive and is extreme, but in quite different cases, quite frequently,"
1404.68,1405.48, this is catastrophic.
1405.86,1409.1, Pouring most of your income into a game for special power users.
1409.36,1412.56," Given that we can't ban everything due to limited political capital, we simply want"
1412.56,1413.7, to ban things that are very harmful.
1414.02,1415.84," Yes, obviously, there's a spectrum of coercion here."
1416.06,1418.82, We think when you literally have a situation that looks like you're going to rehab for
1418.82,1422.3," gaming, I think, yeah, it's genuinely true that it is exploitation."
1422.3,1425.76," And who on earth, by the way, is buying 500 Chanel dresses after buying one?"
1425.76,1426.72," So these kinds of products,"
1426.72,1428.46," they provide the full benefit with one product,"
1428.46,1430.96, unlike these games that keep pressuring you to buy more.
1430.96,1433.32," Then they see, oh, most people don't even get"
1433.32,1435.1, to the super high levels that they need to pay for.
1435.1,1437.24," This is one example we gave, right?"
1437.24,1438.44, Look at everything else we tell you.
1438.44,1439.28," For a lot of games,"
1439.28,1440.54," the most fundamental aspects of gameplay,"
1440.54,1441.58," indeed like kickoff,"
1441.58,1443.34," playing a full match of football in FIFA,"
1443.34,1444.8, is only accessible behind the paywall.
1444.8,1448.64," Thirdly, on better gameplay, because we told you how the fact that uh you"
1448.64,1452.56, are constantly trapped and feel inferior to other people who have the upgrades that you want when
1452.56,1456.16, you can't even access the full parts of the game you feel bad what do they say companies have no
1456.16,1460.88, incentive to improve the game on our side companies still need to have a large number of people
1460.88,1464.64, continuously play because that's how you earn ad revenue or earn more upfront payments right
1464.64,1468.16, however companies can't retain players if the game doesn't get better because
1468.16,1471.2, people get bored there are thousands of other games you could be playing it's very hard to
1471.2,1474.72, capture the time of people companies will still improve the game this isn't symmetric though
1474.72,1478.64, because the profit incentives are different ad revenue is one thing but actually actively buying
1478.64,1482.56, uh upgrades is another thing there's a greater profit incentive note the incentive of companies
1482.56,1487.84, is to make improvements on op but it's to suck it isn't improvement on op but it's to suck out as much money as they can
1487.84,1492.48, meaning the improvements are likely to be bad more expensive powerful skin more coercion finally i
1492.48,1496.48, want to note just generally the entire point of this is that you are likely to spend more by
1496.48,1500.64, playing a free-to-play game rather than one that has an upfront cost look at why companies are
1500.64,1504.0, currently moving into free-to-play games right it's not because they're benevolent it's because
1504.0,1506.8, they want more money and this is how they profit maximize before my splits
1506.8,1512.0, i'll take that point what exactly is your metric to ban it is not predatory pricing or predatory
1512.0,1516.08, ads because you can see makeup is the same it's also not addiction because you don't get it
1517.44,1520.88, the point is that there's a spectrum right but it's a combination of the harm that's happening
1520.88,1524.08, and the addiction that's happening we prove significant harm when you spend so much money
1524.08,1527.44, and time and a significant level of addiction when there's little rehab centers
1527.44,1533.12, etc existing with gaming okay uh first split what games become less extensive first on mechanism uh
1533.12,1537.2, on an incentive mechanism we think people want inherently cheaper games the issue is that game
1537.2,1540.32, companies know that they're always going to lose out to free to play games for the people who want
1540.32,1544.24, them on our side the market of people who want free games is less saturated with free to play
1544.24,1547.76, ones and therefore game companies will lower prices because they have the possibility
1547.76,1552.0, of getting these lower cost demanding gamers this tackles a push on access on capacity i think as
1552.0,1555.92, more people are now more willing to buy upfront game costs that means you can lower your individual
1555.92,1559.2, price because you're selling more units this actually makes all games more accessible on
1559.2,1563.2, our side lower in price secondly very quickly on my last foot on harming game developers quick
1563.2,1567.28, context game developers work in horrifying conditions right now known as crunch where they have to work 12
1567.28,1571.36, plus hours a day under really brutal working conditions what does crunch increase on opposition
1571.36,1575.12, because in order for companies to keep earning money they have to keep churning out new upgrades
1575.12,1578.72, cosmetics gameplay every single week for people to buy meaning that game developers are under
1578.72,1582.88, constant pressure to force to be forced to work even longer hours because they need to produce
1582.88,1588.24, new things code design new skins this really matters these workers are the workers behind the product we consume we have to
1588.24,1592.24, consider the ethics of the supply chain like we do in anything else opposition maximizes crunching
1592.24,1597.12, predator labor opposition is a side that supports addiction exploitation practices both in the
1597.12,1609.7, production and consumption of video games i thank the speaker for a fine speech and to continue I call on the second opposition speaker
1609.7,1626.74," yeah can I check that I'm audible uh you are indeed yeah okay thanks great um I'll take POIs verbally, so just unmute yourself."
1630.68,1631.8," Starting in three, two, one."
1635.04,1635.42, Did they try to equate DOTA to loan sharks?
1638.14,1640.56, Because I think proposition has a fundamental misunderstanding of the things that they need to do in this round.
1640.98,1642.74, Their burden isn't to give you a harm.
1643.08,1649.96, Their burden is to tell you why it necessitates a ban. They gave you two metrics. We proved to you why it failed in first opposition.
1650.36,1655.14, What is second prop's POI response? That there's a combination of harm. That isn't a metric to ban.
1655.24,1659.26," There's a combination of harm to a multitude of things. I can do ballet and break my leg,"
1659.36,1663.28, but that does not mean we should ban ballet. You can do a multitude of things that constitute a
1663.28,1669.46, harm. You need to give us the definable metrics as to what it is. We outlined from first opposition that there's likely two
1669.46,1673.62," things, given those are the two arguments given to you in the first proposition speech. They talked"
1673.62,1677.84," to you, number one, about predatory marketing, and number two, about addiction. To deal with addiction,"
1678.18,1683.4, second proposition literally keeps contradicting themselves every single time they talk about why
1683.4,1685.2, games are bad also defend
1685.2,1690.22, paid games defend completely free games with no in-game purchases at all and also defend game
1690.22,1695.16, developing in and of itself their own third argument told you why they also had games when
1695.16,1699.94, they argued a whole argument about bad working conditions and he quote-unquote crunch crunch
1699.94,1703.4, time or whatever that is because i don't actually know what gaming the gaming developing scene
1703.4,1709.16, actually looks like that that means that they can't argue a generic case about addiction because that would
1709.16,1713.54," mean they have to argue against banning all video games, but they clearly in their first proposition"
1713.54,1718.5," were unwilling to actually constitute and take that burden. Therefore, the only other metric"
1718.5,1723.54," left standing in order to justify their ban is predatory marketing. They say that they trap you,"
1723.82,1725.4," make you addicted, make you insecure"
1725.4,1729.26," because your friends look cooler than you in-game, and therefore it's predatory"
1729.26,1734.86," and it's exploitation and we should ban. Two things here. Number one, note that their problem"
1734.86,1739.44, therefore is not with free-to-play games and the in-game purchases that currently exist.
1739.44,1750.68," Their problem is the way in which these purchases are marketed and advertised. Per second proposition's own speech, the way in which ads predate on your own experiences and make you buy certain things"
1750.68,1755.34," means that it's not the innate ability for you or the profit system that's problematic,"
1755.68,1760.7," but necessarily the way in which ads are currently being done and unregulated. So therefore,"
1760.82,1764.44, they have a problem-solution mismatch that they could easily solve absent of the ban that they
1764.44,1765.28, want to constitute.
1765.54,1769.7," But not also, because they never actually argued exploitation and predation at all."
1769.92,1772.96," They analyzed developing a game so good, people are hooked."
1773.26,1776.38, Where was the coercion? Where do we predate on your insecurities?
1776.88,1785.28, The insecurity that they quoted and highlighted is just the innate human experience of wanting to have levels of fun and levels of enjoyment that never meant that you
1785.28,1789.52, exploited individuals that never meant that you predated on these individuals that were vulnerable
1789.52,1794.16, and in these kinds of states insofar as these aren't things that forced you and these are other
1794.16,1798.64, alternatives that you can opt in to a multitude of other things that you still chose to do a game
1798.64,1804.0, but second we drew parallels in status quo that are even worse but are permitted not that the
1804.0,1809.88," importance of this isn't just a frivolous example, but it proves that the metric in society that currently exists"
1809.88,1814.82, right now does not meet the bar that they set for themselves. We told you makeup. What about diet
1814.82,1818.56, culture and the way in which diet culture is perpetuated when people have to constantly eat
1818.56,1822.3, salads? What about mental health when you put it on the insecurity of individuals who come into
1822.3,1828.0," therapy for people that have mental conditions? What was the response we heard from second proposition, which is literally baffling?"
1828.28,1833.32, They said makeup is not that bad compared to spending thousands of dollars in game. Makeup
1833.32,1838.22," is not that bad, but makeup causes body dysmorphia. Makeup makes people look in the mirror and want to"
1838.22,1842.98, kill themselves or be prone to not being able to live the next day. These are individuals that
1842.98,1848.0, constantly feel inferior to themselves in society. And that is the thing that they said was not actually enough to actually
1848.0,1852.56," consider Japan that makeup is not enough. Therefore, if that is the case and the examples"
1852.56,1857.2," hold true, the metric to the ban therefore does not stand. Therefore, even in its best form from"
1857.2,1861.28," proposition, if they are harmed, you cannot credit any of them because they still need to justify it"
1861.28,1869.02," under the lens of actually banning them in the first place. But second, note that the important thing here that we characterize in this speech is that there"
1869.02,1873.64," is an incentive that exists to not only, number one, cater towards a massive consumer base in"
1873.64,1878.3," order to get access, but also, number two, to also try to profit off individuals through their"
1878.3,1882.82," longevity within the market. We told you on our side that you have to balance both incentives,"
1883.06,1890.84, which is why it's not the case that second proposition wants to highlight where you're going to completely lock them out altogether and they're not able to enjoy the experience at all.
1890.84,1904.16," Because if that is the case, there are a multitude of other free-to-play games that fill in the gap, that give people the actual consumer experiences, and it is the case where these purchases are purely cosmetic or add marginal utility towards these games."
1904.4,1909.3," They say they use examples, then use all of them in the info slide. In Dota and League of Legends, if you're"
1909.3,1913.82," unable to purchase a skin, all you have to do is play until level 20 to access most of the game"
1913.82,1918.34," modes, most of the things. It is about 20 hours of having to invest in that, which we think is"
1918.34,1922.64, reasonable. What is the ability for you to lose any sort of gratification in the first place?
1922.82,1928.96," But secondly, note the assertion that you feel bad because other people do better than you know that this also is not actually constituting"
1928.96,1933.12, a ban but not that you think it's highly assertive for them to say so because for some people it
1933.12,1937.76, might be true that if other people are able to buy their way in game and overcome certain challenges
1937.76,1942.48, that you may feel jealous or you may feel bad but for a group of individuals as well sometimes the
1942.48,1950.5, process is one that means a lot to them it It looks like you're having to grind every single day and actually earning the achievements in the game rather than purchasing it.
1950.68,1958.52," So contrary to what they say, sometimes it's actually gratifying, which is why on our side, we said multiple games can exist to cater to multiple people."
1958.82,1961.64, Some games are hard to access. Some games are easier to access.
1961.88,1969.96," People are able to decide for themselves, for a proposition to make a blanket band when some people actually feel good because some people feel bad does not"
1969.96,1976.08, actually justify it at all and lastly then on the idea that they also have access and we can make
1976.08,1981.3, cheap games this is the concession as to why they can't swap our gaming experience we already
1981.3,1989.78, preempted this from first opposition that yes it is true that gaming companies and gaming developers may make cheaper games but not that this is still a cost that if
1989.78,1993.86, they make cheaper games the problem with the revenue model is that it's inherently going to
1993.86,1998.48, have to be a worse game because you don't have sustainability on our side is the only model
1998.48,2002.8, where you constantly gain revenue to channel back into the money because once there's a one-off
2002.8,2008.32," payment there is no incentive to make the game better, because you've already trapped these individuals inside. Note, therefore,"
2008.4,2012.5, the arguments standing left on opposition are unresponded to from second prop and requires
2012.5,2016.22," a response from third prop, but I think at this point, it is far too late. We told you why,"
2016.34,2020.68," therefore, the autonomy of individuals ought to be prioritized. If individuals feel levels"
2020.68,2029.3," of gratification, who is the state to intervene and deprive them of these kinds of experiences we told you therefore also that they will pivot to other worse vices"
2029.3,2034.04, proposition just saying alcoholism isn't actually the alternative it's not actually a response
2034.04,2038.42, there's a skill like they say to the response that each individual has if their stakeholder
2038.42,2043.1, was the person that spent thousands of dollars in game the individuals that spent millions of hours
2043.1,2048.62, or thousands of hours not going to work Etc These are likely the people that would have pivoted to those worst forms of
2048.62,2052.58, alternatives because they weren't recreational gamers. These are individuals that divulge and
2052.58,2057.4, have needed really strong forms of escapism to deal with the harm on your side. Third substantive
2057.4,2064.36, then on how you create a system where small SMEs are unable to penetrate the market and you create
2064.36,2069.16, stagnancy within the gaming market. Not that you shut out entertainment SMEs from effectively competing in
2069.16,2073.3," the market because when there's a paywall introduced, who do consumers pivot to? It is"
2073.3,2077.38, likely going to be therefore based on consumer trust and buy-in. That if two companies make the
2077.38,2081.98," exact same, make a game, but both of them cost $20, I'm more likely to buy from an established"
2081.98,2086.68, one like Valve or Riot Games or Blizzard as as opposed to a new up and coming developer.
2086.68,2090.48, These large established game developing companies are likely going to pivot into their own niches
2090.48,2092.36, and subdivide the community.
2092.36,2094.2, This company will focus on action games.
2094.2,2097.66," This company will focus on indie games and this company will focus on RPG, which means"
2097.66,2101.44," that there's necessarily less competition contrary to what they say, so they can't co-opt"
2101.44,2102.78, the benefits of competition.
2102.78,2107.68, The reason why this is important is that it kills off innovation and diversity in the gaming industry not only number one on
2107.68,2111.68, the base level for entertainment but number two the development of important technologies
2111.68,2116.48, like augmented reality technology first gain traction by making it by making augmented
2116.48,2120.72, reality games that in the future right now can be implemented to a multitude of industries
2120.72,2124.32, in society for two reasons you give it to up you give it because the individuals deserve
2124.32,2125.84, autonomy and you give it to opposition. You give it because the individuals deserve autonomy and you give it to opposition
2125.84,2128.36, because we actually care about the consumer experience.
2131.78,2134.1, I thank the speaker for the fine speech.
2134.34,2176.54," And now I call on the third proposition speaker, Heihei. you I'm sorry, the laptop I was meant to speak at disconnected from the Zoom."
2178.16,2180.24, Juve is currently going to connect it back.
2182.24,2184.6," Okay, sure."
2222.76,2224.4, Yeah. that okay uh sure uh yeah um let's let's yeah let's do it asap but but sure yeah Apologies for the technical issues. Apologies for the technical issues.
2224.4,2225.88, Sorry.
2228.88,2232.28," I used to hear pronouns, POIs in the chat, please."
2232.28,2249.12, I'll open the chat right now so I can see the POIs. Okay.
2268.96,2273.6," This debate is about video games. Malaysia wants to make a case for makeup. Our burden is not to show that everything harmful would be banned, it was to show that we in the world but we reduce a massive one at least our case obviously doesn't praise the cosmetic industry however it's realistically impossible to ban everything so we're banning ftp canes instead of nitpicking our case malaysia"
2273.6,2278.4, needs to engage two questions then firstly which side provides prevents exploitation and addiction
2278.4,2282.24, and secondly which side provides better gameplay firstly i want to deal with their claim and
2282.24,2288.72," clarification they claim that this heart doesn't necessitate a ban, but here's why governments ban things. Firstly, because the risk is too high."
2288.72,2292.56, We agree that most things have both risks and rewards. We agree that soft drugs can give many
2292.56,2296.96," people momentary highs and enjoyment and can still bring many people happiness, but governments still"
2296.96,2300.8," intervene to ban it because the risk of getting more people addicted, the risk of them getting"
2300.8,2306.72," addicted and turning to harder drugs is far more harmful. We'd rather individuals not be able to access this happiness they receive from drugs,"
2306.72,2311.04," but be shielded from massive potential harms. Similarly, even if opposition manages to prove"
2311.04,2315.12," free to play games bring people happiness, which we show isn't even true, we think the current"
2315.12,2319.2, landscape of addiction of unnecessary and irrational spending by young people is still
2319.2,2322.88," a risk we want to prevent. But secondly, don't let opposition make the harm of free to play"
2322.88,2327.52," games seem insignificant. The harm is that teenagers are taking credit card numbers of their parents who pay for skins,"
2327.82,2331.06," and some are even taking up debt. Sure, this might be the extreme cases, but the harms are"
2331.06,2334.92," so immense for the minority of individuals who are impacted by it. Note that such extreme harm,"
2335.02,2338.94," even to a small number of people, does necessitate abandoning the status quo. The majority of people"
2338.94,2342.52," won't be addicted to drugs to the extent that it is lethal, but we still ban it. But thirdly,"
2342.74,2345.18, note that opposition's response to this principle is literally a couple
2345.18,2346.32, of examples tossed around.
2346.32,2347.76, They never give you a reasoning why.
2347.76,2349.72, So maybe you believe that regulation is better.
2349.72,2352.18, You may still be able to regulate ads or make up companies
2352.18,2355.0, but we told you how regulation is impossible with games
2355.0,2356.4, because you would literally have to monitor
2356.4,2358.44, the online actions of every single player.
2358.44,2360.24, This is a massive invasion of privacy.
2360.24,2362.18, The trade-off then is a ban or nothing at all
2362.18,2363.82, which is why a ban is justified.
2363.82,2367.44," A quick clarification, they see that our harms don't occur because you give companies access"
2367.44,2371.76," to a sizeable and players access to a sizeable portion of the game. We do agree, but if companies"
2371.76,2375.84," make 90% of their game accessible, no one is going to pay for these perks and upgrades. This means"
2375.84,2379.68, that the company probably makes 30% of their gaming free to first entice users so they can
2379.68,2384.64," profit off of the other 70% of locked upgrades. Note, this is the premise of all their impacts,"
2384.64,2385.2, they give you
2385.2,2389.44," no structural reasons. Dhruv told you that this was comparative happiness. Firstly then, on which"
2389.44,2393.36," type of events exploitation. Firstly, we told you that it was morally abhorrent that free to play"
2393.36,2397.04," games were predatory because with free to play games, when players first download the game,"
2397.04,2400.64," they're deceived into believing that the game is free, that there's limited cost because most"
2400.64,2404.16, people falsely believe that they're not going to be easily addicted to an app. But when you keep
2404.16,2406.88," playing the game, that is when you're told to purchase additional gadgets to"
2406.88,2411.6, win battles you have already spent so much time trying to defeat to no avail this is predatory
2411.6,2415.6, because these games are created to be addictive to begin with on principle it's the same way
2415.6,2419.44, gamblers entice innocent victims into losing more and more amounts of money when casinos
2419.44,2423.12, exploit you but practically you do lose a decent portion of your money that you would otherwise
2423.12,2425.12, spend to take your nephew out to treat your wife.
2425.38,2430.78," The comparative is that when you make the decision to pay upfront, you're not yet addicted and this coercive mechanism doesn't exist."
2430.98,2433.4," But for free games, you're not exploited to give up vast amounts of money."
2433.66,2436.14, Their response was firstly that you get satisfaction.
2436.32,2439.12, So this is an exploitation. Addiction is a euphemism of enjoyability.
2439.48,2444.52," Firstly, we told you that many harmful acts are enjoyable, such as consuming drugs or gambling, but the government still banned it."
2444.76,2448.0," Obviously, video games aren't extreme but if malaysia claims that their effect"
2448.0,2452.0, is so pervasive that video games can literally help you forget about problems so extreme you
2452.0,2456.72, otherwise need alcohol to wash them away then video games clearly have a strong sway over the
2456.72,2461.44, average person their own analysis the heart of this way was that you continually bleed money
2461.44,2467.24," into this game that you now rarely spend time with your family obviously you don you don't lose all your life savings, but you do lose a decent"
2467.24,2471.1," portion. Secondly, we don't think we actually lose out on enjoyability because the game"
2471.1,2474.52, development market is massively competitive. Look at the number of free games on Google
2474.52,2477.88," Play and the Apple Store right now. So if your game isn't enjoyable, then people won't"
2477.88,2481.54," play. This means that developers, even without these free to play games, want to create the"
2481.54,2488.32, best game so they generate advertising revenue. They do not want to lose out out the second speaker then claims that game developers will split the market so you
2488.32,2492.32, don't actually get this competition so for example certain ones focus on makeup games other ones
2492.32,2496.8, focus on action games but we think that this is really false because if you as a company like
2496.8,2500.88, supercell can make multiple games and if you can make more money from those multiple games when
2500.88,2504.4, you already have hired coders when you already have the infrastructure and code in place you
2504.4,2506.24, probably want to make multiple apps catering
2506.24,2507.66, to multiple different audiences
2507.66,2509.06, to maximize your own profit.
2509.06,2510.8," Thus, we do actually get the competition,"
2510.8,2512.88, which increases innovation and enjoyability.
2512.88,2514.18, But our second claim under this clash
2514.18,2515.86, was that we actually reduce addiction.
2515.86,2517.74," And this was not a contradiction, by the way."
2517.74,2519.82," We can see that we still have games under our side,"
2519.82,2521.78, but that these games were far less addicting
2521.78,2523.24," because with free-to-play games,"
2523.24,2524.7, companies are far more likely to invest
2524.7,2527.68, in high-cost departments that research into psychology and addiction
2527.68,2530.28, when you can continually believe users of their money.
2530.28,2533.9," Our comparative was that with a one time pay model, you don't need to keep players glued"
2533.9,2535.92, to the screen because you have already gained profit.
2535.92,2539.14," With free games, the revenue you gain from ads is not worth the money you need to invest"
2539.14,2542.64, into paying many coders into conducting trials to increase addiction.
2542.64,2544.88," Secondly, then, on which side provides better gameplay."
2544.88,2549.04," Before that, POI. coders into conducting trials to increase addiction secondly then on which that provides better gameplay before that poi yeah most individuals are casual spenders not the people"
2549.04,2552.96, that plunge themselves into debt are you actually hinging your case on a few individuals that
2552.96,2557.36, actually spend thousands of dollars our case was never that extreme but it was the fact that for
2557.36,2561.6, these casual spenders it was often a subconscious accumulation of money when maybe each small
2561.6,2567.58," purchase is not a lot of money but they add up over time we gave you this you this analysis from first. But secondly, on better game pay. On the quality,"
2567.68,2570.8," we told you that games were more entertaining. Because with free-to-play games, for companies"
2570.8,2574.36," to make players pay for their perks, they need to make these perks central to the game. This"
2574.36,2577.68, looks like rare chromatic brawlers and brawl stars that give you a disproportionate advantage
2577.68,2581.56," in bottles. By the way, it wasn't just a minority of players who could not get into the final level"
2581.56,2587.18," that were harmed when most sections are locked up, because this is what maximizes profit for game developers. This means that for the 40%"
2587.18,2590.82," of other people that don't pay, these games are frustrating when you seem to always lose"
2590.82,2595.2, because players that pay have a far better gear and they can snipe you far more easier.
2595.38,2598.8," Their response here was that if it's too frustrating, people don't play. Obviously,"
2598.9,2601.84," you're not going to instantly lose just because you don't pay, but it's the fact that there might"
2601.84,2606.88," be some semblance of battle, but you ultimately consistently this is still frustrating on the compared if it now becomes"
2606.88,2610.48, a competition of skill rather than money it means that people don't get to actually get the solace
2610.48,2613.84, we talk about instead under their side they're constantly frustrated their response to us with
2613.84,2617.36, that development needs profiteering so you get no profit at all which means we don't get any
2617.36,2620.8, development firstly we write explain why gaming is still competitive market because if you get
2620.8,2624.08, terrible reviews if there's constantly bugs in your software you get zero players and zero
2624.08,2627.04, advertising money and note the comparative in this debate isn't to play
2627.04,2630.96, valorant or take drugs it is do you play a free-to-play game or play a different game or like
2630.96,2634.88, for example a one-time pay game under our side but the wing here is that in order for malaysia's
2634.88,2638.8, principle on the metric for a band to stand they have to prove that there's such a massive benefit
2638.8,2642.48, to these games that people lose out on but we prove why we actually make the gaming experience
2642.48,2647.84, better while we increase enjoyability so there is no loss of benefits to ban these games but the second part of this was
2647.84,2652.64, accessibility we also told you that games were now far more accessible because drew's first split was
2652.64,2657.36, on incentive and capacity because now that you get upfront paid games you have a greater chance to
2657.36,2661.68, cater to people who want low price games and they will want to lower these costs to appeal to them
2661.68,2665.96, these companies also now have a greater capacity to lower unit costs because more people will buy it.
2665.96,2668.48," In the comparative, you literally see many more companies"
2668.48,2670.24," going towards the free to play game model,"
2670.24,2672.18, which means you don't actually get accessibility.
2672.18,2674.14," You might get 20% accessibility at first,"
2674.14,2675.28," but for the rest of the game,"
2675.28,2677.62, costs are often high when companies want to get you addicted
2677.62,2680.18, when they want you to lose your money so they can gain more.
2680.18,2681.76, Their response was on escapism
2681.76,2683.5, and how it shouldn't be locked behind a paywall
2683.5,2684.68, and that they get the perfect balance
2684.68,2687.0, between accessibility and enjoyability.
2687.0,2691.0," Firstly, we also get enjoyability. Free games exist on both sides of the house."
2691.0,2698.0, Our claim was that we actually get more enjoyability because you specifically switch the incentives of developers to make it more accessible now that there's a bigger market for it.
2698.0,2702.0," But secondly, we told you why companies are likely to reduce costs and reduce output."
2702.0,2706.96," But thirdly, they claim that substance abuse would occur otherwise. But note how absurd this is, because individuals aren't"
2706.96,2707.98, searching for addiction.
2707.98,2709.76, Just because you can no longer be addicted
2709.76,2711.22," to free-to-play games, it doesn't"
2711.22,2713.38, mean that a person then tries to find something else
2713.38,2715.68," to get addicted to it when it's, in fact, very harmful."
2715.68,2718.18," But also, we think that if their solution to massive problems"
2718.18,2719.56, people face in daily lives is you
2719.56,2721.46," spend a couple hours on your video games,"
2721.46,2722.74, this was really implausible.
2722.74,2724.76," We think that we actually improve accessibility,"
2724.76,2727.38," and we also improve enjoyability. Lastly, we also told you why"
2727.38,2730.58, game developers were likely harmed because of crunch time. I know that game developers
2730.58,2734.12, cannot escape to another game company because this is the kind of culture that becomes the
2734.12,2739.24, norm for most posting companies when you want to selectively lock out your workforce. Gaming
2739.24,2745.44, companies should not prey on your vulnerabilities. Pr proud to stand.
2748.96,2751.52," I thank the speaker for the fine speech and now I call on the OPP3 speaker to continue. Hear, hear."
2762.56,2771.44," Hi, am I audible and visible?"
2771.44,2772.44, You are indeed.
2772.44,2773.44," Yeah, sorry."
2773.44,2775.5," Yeah, you are."
2775.5,2779.6, I'll take POIs in the chat.
2779.6,2789.44, Starting in three. three actually
2796.32,2801.52, starting in three two one free to play gaming was an irreplaceable part of human recreational activity the downfall of this proposition's case was their infatuation with the extremes
2801.52,2805.54," if they wanted to win this debate on the 1% of rehabilitated gamers,"
2805.9,2810.18," that already speaks for itself how ludicrous this case is, and it's clear that Team Hong Kong will"
2810.18,2814.78, lose this debate. The first thing I want to do is clarify the pigeonhole homogenized characterizations
2814.78,2819.62," of gamers, because it's still unclear from all three speakers why everyone's goal was to beat"
2819.62,2824.8," the final boss. Not everyone needs to be the god-tier gamer. Realistically, the average free-to-play"
2824.8,2825.18," player does not spend thousands of hours on a game to neglect their god-tier gamer. Realistically, the average free-to-play player"
2825.18,2829.72, does not spend thousands of hours on a game to neglect their health and wallets. But what was
2829.72,2834.3," the nuance here? The unique nuance we proved was that in free-to-play models in status quo,"
2834.54,2839.7, was that the level of spending each player undertakes differs from gamer to gamer due to
2839.7,2845.1," the diverse demographic of gamers when gaming becomes more common and accessible per their setup,"
2845.46,2851.44," which meant that 10% of rich or professional gamers could spend more on the game, while casual,"
2851.68,2855.68, chill gamers could gain the most accessible experience without having to plunge their wallets
2855.68,2860.64," into it. This is in stark contrast to their side, where if companies were exploitative,"
2861.02,2865.24, every single person across the board will need to pay the cost of buying the game from
2865.24,2869.48," the app store, which is likely to be high per their own setup about how companies have the"
2869.48,2875.36, ability to increase these prices. What then is the crucial comparative here? Their setup on first
2875.36,2880.18, prop that companies are revenue maximizing was fatal to their case because it proves an express
2880.18,2885.66," preference for making lots of money anyway. However, the nuance is those game companies become"
2885.66,2890.38," substantially more predatory on their side. Structurally, this is because the mechanism"
2890.38,2894.5, for gaining money needs to be constant and sustainable because you aren't able to have
2894.5,2899.38," players buy new guns every week or pay on a subscription battle pass every three months,"
2899.38,2906.8," but rather they pay off a one-time purchase of the app store and that's it. Which means if they want to make those things profitable,"
2907.16,2910.42," either they will have to make the initial cost of buying the game really high,"
2910.54,2913.02, or they have other mechanisms inside the game to profit off.
2913.3,2914.34, What do these look like?
2914.48,2917.24," Because pay-to-pay premium games on their side were stagnant,"
2917.4,2919.2," once someone buys the initial game, that's it."
2919.32,2921.42, They can't support other internal purchases
2921.42,2924.44," because that will contradict the entirety of the first prop speech,"
2924.66,2929.6, which means they resort to other mechanisms things like data selling things like sexual imagery
2929.6,2934.0, things like carefully selected colors that reinforce serotonin in your brain which means
2934.0,2938.64, you're also more addicted to these games to gain more money then so therefore if companies were
2938.64,2943.12, likely to be predatory absent the mechanism of wanting to have these micro transactions it gets
2943.12,2948.46, far worse on their end without the unique value you get from being able to purchase something that levels you up.
2948.68,2952.68," And note, if people were so addicted to these games per their analysis, you can't challenge"
2952.68,2956.78, those games as opposed to the argument we provided to you at the end of second op about why there's
2956.78,2961.18," better competition. On our side, we have both free-to-play and pay-to-play games, which means"
2961.18,2968.6," they compete against each other actively. That is them out of the round even on their their best case comparative. Three issues then in this speech. First, on the principal"
2968.6,2973.58," justification why it's a valuable activity. Second, on why this enhances the gaming experience. And"
2973.58,2979.04," third, on why game companies develop significantly worse behavior. First, is this justified? I think"
2979.04,2982.92, the fact that First Prop immediately starts off their case by equating these mobile games to
2982.92,2989.66, illegal loan sharks is quite laughable. The underlying premise is that malevolent companies provide you no way to opt
2989.66,2993.06," out of this. We told you if companies were inherently malevolent, they will find other"
2993.06,2997.26," ways to shackle their consumers, but we can actually regulate them to no response. Four"
2997.26,3001.64," structural reasons why we could. First, community discussions, things like supercell forums or"
3001.64,3005.58, criticism from YouTubers means they respond to feedback to prevent consumers from leaving.
3005.84,3007.38, This is a self-correcting mechanism
3007.38,3010.74, that engages in their context on revenue maximization.
3011.04,3013.88, Just look at how much anger EA has gotten in the past few years.
3014.22,3016.1, They concede to this at third prop
3016.1,3018.44," when they say people become frustrated at bugs,"
3018.56,3020.08, which proves it's an effective mechanism.
3020.38,3021.64, This doesn't happen on their side
3021.64,3024.92, because consumers are more averse to leaving or criticizing the game
3024.92,3029.32, once they've paid for the lump sum and all other alternatives are locked behind a paywall.
3029.66,3033.94," Second, regulation. The App Store and Google Play forces you certain clauses. Our setup highlights"
3033.94,3037.7," this. But given it's a policy debate, you can probably use the fiat and capital to force this"
3037.7,3042.24, in. But for competition from small developers means companies have to act in better ways or
3042.24,3047.88, they'll be pushed out from the market. All the reasons they themselves give shows massive political will to prevent the worst
3047.88,3051.84, excesses of these companies having anyways. Let's deal with your other principal claim
3051.84,3056.4," that on you not being able to consent. Analyzing the problems of consent. First, is this informed?"
3056.6,3060.48," Clearly, you can tell that was a free-to-play game. But second, if whether it was retractable,"
3060.72,3069.28, the reason to why this is better on our side is yes. Even if you have social mechanisms like the fear of missing out. The reason why it's better on our side is because there are other
3069.28,3073.32, alternatives for you to try with your friends. The comparison is that when most people have these
3073.32,3078.32," things locked behind K-walls, now it's far harder for you to try those mechanisms in the first place,"
3078.46,3082.4," which means you are locked to these initial games. But even if you don't believe this to be true,"
3082.7,3088.72," note the abhorrence of the case reveals itself. Even if a few people end up becoming addicts, they have to prove why the small volume"
3088.72,3093.52, of pro gamers meant that all gamers across the board will now lose access to valuable games.
3093.8,3097.4," The weighing here was simple. Given they themselves highlight mechanisms like rehab,"
3097.6,3101.78," it probably wasn't exclusive. But second, the extrapolation we proved here was crucial."
3102.06,3108.44, They can't say this is a tool in a toolbox. This is one of many addictive things because their principle has to extend to all other policies
3108.44,3112.84, the state imposes. We proved to you there was a massive moral hazard that the state gets to
3112.84,3117.48, unilaterally decide that the source of recreation for millions of people ought to be banned forever.
3117.8,3122.38," On volume, this harms massive amounts of people. Third prop says drug users are in the minority,"
3122.38,3126.48," but we still ban drugs. There was a nuance. There are a small number of drug users, yes."
3126.64,3130.4, But the portion of drug users that become addicted and die is huge.
3130.64,3135.78," In comparison, the portion of gamers that become super addicted under their side is tiny,"
3135.9,3137.74, which is why it does not justify a ban.
3137.8,3139.32, So the rebuttal does not stand in the round.
3139.42,3140.26," Before that, I'll take a point."
3141.7,3144.76, Why will gaming companies literally illegally sell data
3144.76,3146.96, instead of using advertising as revenue
3146.96,3151.92, similar to how news companies work so if it's advertising then it also has your claim on why
3151.92,3155.76, people aren't able to have the best experience possible because you want to engineer things like
3155.76,3159.52, data to show advertisements that are good for them and that's how they'll stay on the game and get
3159.52,3163.28, them addicted so once again people are locked in towards these games they may not spend money but
3163.28,3165.0, your calm was never on spending money.
3165.1,3166.42, It was locking people towards a game
3166.42,3167.46, that had no alternatives.
3167.82,3170.02," But second, we proved that most of the other mechanisms"
3170.02,3171.92, in society also require you to have spending.
3172.0,3173.5, That's how most business models work.
3173.68,3175.64, We proved some efficacy of regulation here.
3175.88,3177.64, The reason as to why they will find other mechanisms
3177.64,3179.04, is they can obviously do bad things
3179.04,3180.9, if your site proves these companies are malevolent.
3181.16,3182.88, The second issue was on gaming experiences.
3183.28,3188.88," We give three categorical benefits here. First, that games were more entertaining because these games evolve over"
3188.88,3192.78, time when you have to update your content which is in the interest of gamers but second the gaming
3192.78,3197.28, community becomes larger which is better for the demographic diversity but also means you're better
3197.28,3202.32, able to criticize these companies then but third we come actually prior here even if you buy the
3202.32,3205.72, entirety of second prop on access on here even if the games
3205.72,3209.82, are cheap this was not the biggest consideration because people don't think that this game is five
3209.82,3214.32, dollars so i'll buy lots of five dollar games the difference here is that even it's a five dollar
3214.32,3219.1, game they have to spend five dollars on an unknown small company the comparison is small companies
3219.1,3224.14, will still be disadvantaged on the on our side but you're better able to empower them at the point
3224.14,3229.64," where none of their goods are hide hid behind a paywall that people have to trust from the get-go, which meant that the"
3229.64,3234.86, underlying premise of all three speeches of DRN is the inelasticity of games. We told you that
3234.86,3239.06," games are significantly more diverse on our side because of competition, but on the wide variety"
3239.06,3243.7, of content on games here. Their final claim is that game developers are under crunch. This is
3243.7,3248.0," the attention in their case, because they claim that currently game developers are burnt out, but also"
3248.0,3252.0, that most games are static in status quo. This contradiction renders half of their speech useless
3252.0,3256.0," to the round here, but it means that most of their mechanisms are quite inexcusive."
3256.0,3260.0," Because if companies were going to then burn out these people, they're presumably going to do it on their end"
3260.0,3264.0, by finding other ways to profit off these people because there's far harder ways for you to make money
3264.0,3265.5, once it's a one-off purchase
3265.5,3267.18," that people have to continuously exploit,"
3267.44,3268.42," which meant on our side,"
3268.48,3269.64, we get better games at the point
3269.64,3271.68," where companies no longer have to resort to bad things,"
3271.76,3274.34, but actively compete against with each other then.
3274.5,3277.04, If they prove the viability of certain pay-to-pay games
3277.04,3278.26," could not exist in status quo,"
3278.42,3280.46, they don't prove what's going to be popular on their side.
3280.72,3282.38," If this debate were a Clash Royale match,"
3282.56,3284.42, Hong Kong has already lost all three towers.
3284.78,3288.66," Unfortunately, they would have you do away with free to play games the only thing they lost was all"
3288.66,3295.98, three ballots we are exceedingly proud to oppose i thank you speak of the fine speech and now i call
3295.98,3303.3, on the op reply to conclude for our bench here here yeah can i check one more time that i'm audible
3303.3,3306.78, you are yeah okay great
3312.0,3320.4, starting in three two one proposition clearly was on the receiving end of other people paying to win
3320.4,3330.16, and them having to lose because they wanted to argue benefits in a vacuum and they only wanted to argue harms in a vacuum as well if they wanted to constantly say that we cannot argue extremes
3330.16,3335.04, they in their own speeches characterized that the state only bans when the harms are too great
3335.04,3340.64, proposition only existed in the extreme in any other scenario their case does not stand three
3340.64,3348.88, clashes then number one does this insuscitate a ban note that this is the most important clash in the round in so far as we've proven to you three speeches down why it does not
3348.88,3353.44, none of their harms matter insofar it does not meet the threshold secondly on the enjoyability
3353.44,3358.0, and user experience and third on development within the gaming industry on the first clash
3358.0,3363.28, did we have to prove massive benefits to justify no ban know that it was purely asserted from third
3363.28,3369.24, proposition because the benefit was purely entertainment and that was sufficient or else proposition needs to argue banning television
3369.24,3374.94, or anything else that provides you any level of entertainment or enjoyment. But also proposition
3374.94,3380.22, cannot adjudicate whether something is beneficial for a person or not. For some people like you
3380.22,3385.5," characterized in your most extreme circumstance, they play thousands of hours, invest thousands of"
3385.5,3389.9," dollars as well in order to feel levels of gratification. For that person, it clearly"
3389.9,3394.52," was very important to be pointed, for example, rehabilitation. So proposition could not make"
3394.52,3399.26, blanket swaths and statements that is not beneficial enough because each and every person
3399.26,3403.88, is diverse and different. What were the harms that constituted their actual metric to ban?
3404.08,3405.04, Note that after three
3405.04,3409.96," speakers, it is still unclear what exactly constitutes that said ban. We outlined two"
3409.96,3414.38," things from their speeches. Number one, addiction. Number two, predatory marketing and bad spending."
3414.72,3419.12," On addiction, we pointed out to you why there was a massive tension that they still could not resolve"
3419.12,3423.8, even in the clarification in third proposition. They said that it's different. You're addicted
3423.8,3429.18," when you're in the game versus you're addicted before you purchase the game. Panel, the harm that they argued was"
3429.18,3433.48, addiction and the loss of hours and the loss of resources. So it does not matter whether you
3433.48,3438.24," were addicted prior or after, the harm materializes regardless, which means that they have to defend"
3438.24,3442.82, banning all games and they could not defend entertainment and enjoyment from other sources
3442.82,3447.64, of games. But we also explained how this wasn't even a legitimate metric to ban in the first place.
3447.82,3453.64, Because being addicted to something is not bad insofar as the substance or the thing you're addicted to is not inherently harmful.
3453.88,3456.32," Which is why we ban, for example, harmful substances."
3456.58,3461.58," But we don't ban, for example, going to the gym or being a gym junkie because that isn't inherently harmful."
3461.98,3464.22," Secondly, on predatory marketing and bad spending."
3464.22,3469.52," Third proposition, literally did not want to hear the reason why we gave moral parallels because they"
3469.52,3474.4, say examples were extrapolating status quo and explaining to you why the metrics to ban is
3474.4,3479.32, extremely high and you are unable to even meet the bare minimum in society. The things that all
3479.32,3483.46, constitute predatory marketing are all things that they were unwilling to ban. All they said was
3483.46,3489.6," regulation is hard. Regulation may be hard, but that does not mean that that's a justification to ban it as well they"
3489.6,3494.1, say that the state has to regulate therefore when harms are too great they only argued therefore in
3494.1,3498.12, the extreme scenarios where individuals were addicted until they lost their lives or they
3498.12,3501.96, spent most of their life and ignored their own health or they spent massive amounts of money or
3501.96,3509.1," went into debt when most individuals are just casual spenders. So even if the harm did materialize in their best case, they did not have debate."
3509.46,3511.76," Secondly, on enjoyability and the user experience."
3511.94,3516.78, We explained structurally why both alternatives they provided were inferior up from first opposition.
3517.08,3525.02," For a play-to-play model, we explained that number one, the high barrier of entry meant that they didn't even get access to enjoy any sort of game if you had to pay."
3530.76,3534.04," But second, note that once there's a sunk cost, that companies and corporations have no incentive to make the game more enjoyable because you've already spent the $20 and there's no incentive to make it better."
3534.04,3539.64," For absolutely free games, weak ad-based models, which not only ruin the user experience, by the way,"
3539.7,3544.64," every time you play Candy Crush and a stupid ad pops out, but also has no revenue to actually make it better,"
3544.82,3549.68, which means it stagnates and remains that way our profit model was inherent in terms of how we maximize the
3549.68,3554.16, consumer quality because you constantly need to maintain longevity when you purchase more things
3554.16,3558.64, over time the balancing of incentives was why you wouldn't make the game too ridiculously hard but
3558.64,3562.32, you would still make it so that additional purchase were encouraged last on development
3562.32,3567.5, which saw literally no response we told you our market collusion destroyed diversity and destroyed development into
3567.5,3574.52," other things with social implications, side with off. I thank the speaker for the fine"
3574.52,3619.32," speech and now to conclude this debate I call on the proposition reply, hear hear. Okay. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So assuming that everyone can hear me, I'll start my reply shortly."
3619.32,3623.16, We do not have to ban every single bad thing in the world. That is impossible in a debate
3623.16,3627.38," about free to play games. Rather, our claim was that free to play games"
3627.38,3628.88, do far more harm than good.
3628.88,3630.7, We would rather people turn towards free
3630.7,3632.96, or one-time paid games where the risk of addiction
3632.96,3634.22, and harm is lower.
3634.22,3635.84, Both sides can't determine whether players
3635.84,3637.62, will enjoy FTP games a lot.
3637.62,3638.84," But we know that at the moment,"
3638.84,3640.46, the gaming disease is global.
3640.46,3643.5, This is a harm that we concretely want to stop.
3643.5,3648.0," Their first big claim and their push that they spent a lot of time on is that you can't ban this principally, right?"
3648.0,3651.0, But our justification was a risk reward and the scale of addiction.
3651.0,3654.0," They said, Chloe asserted it, but guess what? We gave you this analysis."
3654.0,3661.0," We told you how this is the majority of things in the world right now being banned because the reward of enjoyability can exist, but it can also be gained elsewhere."
3661.0,3664.0, But the risk of addiction is too high and it is present in the status quo.
3664.0,3667.76," Yes, gaming might be cool, but that's not the most important thing in your life nor is it"
3667.76,3672.4, the only way you can seek this escapism however its harms are indeed unique in addition the
3672.4,3676.72, inability to meaningfully regulate means there's a huge risk of harm they don't get to fiat to claim
3676.72,3680.48, this unless they really literally want to be like china the only country that did it they also tell
3680.48,3684.64, us we lose that unenjoyability and that's why a band is better but if you listen to our arguments
3684.64,3686.24, we make gaming better for people.
3686.24,3689.84, It means people can access the entirety of a game instead of only being able to finish half
3689.84,3694.16," of a FIFA game. It means you get more accessible, shorter games like Among Us, where companies don't"
3694.16,3697.36," care as much about you playing for a very long time, and instead want to make it faster,"
3697.36,3701.28," convenient, and give you immediate enjoyment. Additionally, we realize the gaming market is"
3701.28,3712.0," really competitive. There's no market collusion like O3 said, because if a company already hired coders, already has an app infrastructure, they're going to develop more apps to appeal to different audiences, because this makes them money."
3712.0,3717.0, Simply banning one category of games doesn't mean there's no longer any sort of market competition.
3717.0,3720.0, This is a ridiculous assertion without proper mechanization.
3720.0,3732.0," Note, the only push to their entire claim on exploitation is that most people don't believe they're god to your player, so they're not going to spend a whole ton of money right but our response is that this isn't the crux of our case, but rather than many people when"
3732.0,3742.0," they see the game are incredibly competitive. Yes, we agree not everyone is a gaming addict, but the point is more nuanced than that, is that a lot of people because of the seemingly low cost of micro transaction, or go to engage them one time, and then two times"
3742.0,3746.72," and then three times, maybe it's not to the scale of addiction, but it's that you do it a lot because you lack"
3746.72,3751.04, a perfect autonomy in your side. We gave you this mech at first. You don't start off thinking you'll
3751.04,3755.0," advance much, but as you play more, your perception of ability changes. Our case isn't the fear of"
3755.0,3758.24," missing out, but about the fact that you have to put in massive investments and time commitment"
3758.24,3762.68," on op side. Note the comparative they pushed us in 03, very late, as the upfront payment"
3762.68,3769.12, is astronomical or companies implement data breaches and sexual images sexual images means games are r-rated this is ridiculous not part of the debate
3769.12,3774.56, data breaches are are illegal again ridiculous the upfront payment may exist but it's not astronomical
3774.56,3777.92, price competition does exist between all these different companies they didn't give us a response
3777.92,3781.68, to this we actually gave you a mechanism on how we lower price the most important thing for an
3781.68,3788.6," op is the accessibility of enjoyable gameplay later on in their speeches. We told you from first, the fact that companies are moving towards ops game model"
3788.6,3793.0, instead of ours should indicate that they make more money from free-to-play games and that people
3793.0,3796.72," have to spend, and because people have to spend more money, it's less accessible. They actually"
3796.72,3800.24," encourage people to spend more money actually locking more gameplay, enjoyable gameplay,"
3800.62,3804.04, away from them. These upgrades will likely be significant to your gameplay experience. The
3804.04,3805.12, info side agrees.
