0.0,7.56," All right, let us welcome the Prime Minister to begin the debate."
7.56,8.04," Here, here."
11.46,12.88, So thank you very much.
13.28,16.0," Just to reiterate, my POI preferences are in the chat, please."
16.08,16.68," And yes, thank you."
16.72,17.62, I can see you put that there.
18.44,18.88, All right.
19.58,29.12," Starting my speech, assuming that I'm audible in three two one when fidel castro nationalized the cuban sugar"
29.12,37.44, industry it decimated that industry for decades to come it crippled the cuban economy we would never
37.44,46.72, stand for depriving nations of their development we would always privatize two questions in setup the first is what do we support we
46.72,51.52, support selling these state-owned enterprises to private companies on an open market to the highest
51.52,56.16, bidder for those companies additionally we were happy to break up those companies and sell parts
56.16,60.4, of them to different private companies depending on the way that auction process went the second
60.4,64.96, question in setup then what do these state-owned enterprises tend to look like we think they tend
64.96,66.84," to operate on a national scale,"
66.84,70.68, which means the government resources tend to be spread relatively thin across that nation.
70.96,74.64, They obviously operate on a large market because of this national scale.
74.92,77.04, They often look like companies such as utilities
77.24,80.52, or such as natural resources that operate on that large scale.
80.76,84.08, The last note is that they are not for profit because they are run by governments.
84.32,88.6," Note that that is not necessarily by choice as we think the governments, even if they wanted to,"
88.92,92.8, couldn't necessarily make a profit out of these companies if they were trying because of the way
92.8,96.66," that they are run. But nevertheless, they are usually not run for the purpose of generating"
96.66,101.42, profit. The first point of substantive I will bring you is why we boost public services in
101.42,109.28," this move to privatized. It's important to note that when we sell these estate-owned enterprises, we think those sales would be lucrative. There's several reasons for"
109.28,114.96, this. The first is that there is a guaranteed market for this particular company because that
114.96,118.72," company exists already. That meant there was a certainty for whatever the buyer was, they would"
118.72,122.6," make profit. Secondly, there was established infrastructure that allowed this company to"
122.6,126.02, operate already. The mines were already built for that extraction company.
126.26,128.5, The pipes were already in the ground for that utility company.
128.94,133.36," Thirdly, they had a very low barrier to entry in this market because it only required them"
133.36,134.96, to buy the company that was now for sale.
135.18,138.34," That was a relatively easy decision, particularly with all these factors in place."
138.8,141.74," Fourthly, we think that private companies could easily see that there was a large amount"
141.74,147.5, of room for improvement at these companies when they were run by governments and they had to deal with a series of government bureaucracies and
147.5,151.58, challenges that came along with that we think it also meant that they probably had the ability for
151.58,155.66, example to export minerals to foreign countries where governments wouldn't and the ability to
155.66,160.22, maximize efficiency in that situation of government bureaucracy we think that meant there was a
160.22,164.66, competitive market for these companies that meant there were high bids we were always going to make
164.66,169.16," a lot of money for the government out of this sale. When the government was receiving millions,"
169.28,173.5," if not billions of dollars for these companies to be bought by other private corporations,"
173.78,179.28," as well as not spending any more money on the upkeep, maintenance and administration of this"
179.28,183.12," state-owned enterprise as they do in the status quo, they were going to have a large amount of"
183.12,188.4, money that they could then repurpose. What do we think the government then was likely to do with that money? We think they
188.4,192.16, were likely to direct that to the remaining provisions that they were doing as a government.
192.68,197.06," In our best case scenario, we think that looked like public services because they no longer have"
197.06,201.26, these state-owned enterprises to divert that money to because there's public pressure that
201.26,207.34, is likely to continue spending money that is currently being allocated on public services on more public services.
207.34,211.04, And also purely because the electoral incentives of the fact that it looks good when they can
211.04,214.64, say that they are spending money on services that people can benefit from and that people
214.64,215.64, can use.
215.64,219.72," You could not underestimate the impact of this within the debate, because it's meant"
219.72,224.28," that there was more money going to services like health, like education, like social safety"
224.28,229.2," nets that meant the people within these developing nations would live ultimately better, safer and healthier lives."
229.2,233.04, That was enormously important and something we could only achieve when we privatize these
233.04,237.6, industries. Even if it was just other government spending and investment that they did with this
237.6,242.16," money, that's still like building infrastructure, that's still like increasing the overall spending"
242.16,248.08, in this economy that meant that people were going to be employed that meant that people were going to have access to better goods and services and their
248.08,253.04, economies was going to grow note how this also rippled into the long term because the ongoing
253.04,258.0, expense of upkeeping this state-owned enterprise was now gone the massive costs of running an
258.0,262.8, enormous company that had to reach an entire nation was gone that the company itself could
262.8,268.26, never have been profit-seeking which always meant it was a loss for that government. That was a huge expense for their budget that they no longer
268.26,272.14," had to account for. They were also probably able to collect tax from these corporations, which only"
272.14,276.52, increased the inflows into government revenue. That was a massive benefit for public services
276.52,281.02, and government investment that was ongoing throughout the long term. Before I move on to
281.02,286.44," my second substantive about how privatization meant improvement for these businesses, I'll take that POI."
286.96,292.74, Business services such as healthcare and education would also be highly lucrative and you could use that money for greater government spending.
293.1,294.8, Would you privatise healthcare and education?
295.52,307.68," We think that there are certain industries that the government deliberately does not privatise because privatising would mean an instance of market failure where the government didn't see an efficient allocation of resources in society. We think that that obviously exists for something like health,"
307.88,311.1, where the government is not willing to let their people die on the streets because they have no
311.1,315.52, access to medical care. That is not at all analogous to the government selling a mining
315.52,319.64," company. Obviously, no one is starving as a result of that. In fact, they benefit from the economic"
319.64,323.48, proceeds of that. That was clearly a line that we were able to draw in what companies we were
323.48,328.6, willing to sell and what companies we were not. So why would privatization of these businesses mean improvement
328.6,333.22, for these enterprises and the flow and effects that would have for these nations? It's important
333.22,337.22," to note that now that this is no longer a state-owned enterprise, this industry can have"
337.22,341.38," competition. Firstly, because that competition is now legal in a way that most governments do not"
341.38,348.58," legally allow private competition to their state-owned enterprise. Secondly, that now private companies feel that they can enter that market because it's"
348.58,353.18," far easier to compete with a private company than a state-owned one, but also because when there is"
353.18,357.08," a private company already there, it proves that this market is actually profitable. It proves"
357.08,360.78," that you don't need to make a loss. Thirdly, we were able to sell this to multiple companies,"
360.82,364.84, which instantly set up a situation in which there was competition between those two or more
364.84,368.16," companies. Fourthly, because companies exist in the status quo that have an"
368.16,373.04," ability to expand their resources or reallocate them to move into this market. For example,"
373.04,377.28," if they already own mines and they extract one kind of mineral, they can now extract even more."
377.28,381.6," If there is one utility that they provide, they can use the resources they already have to transport"
381.6,388.5," things across long distances to mean that they can now enter this industry. Because there was a chance and an ability for there to be competition, we"
388.5,392.8, think it guaranteed the likelihood that there would be. Because companies want to make profit.
393.08,397.64, Because there will now exist like less profitable companies that will want to break into this new
397.64,401.94, market as a chance to improve their business operations. Because there are probably already
401.94,408.74," companies that are in this market and now want to stay because of the sunk cost they put into this market, because there's probably a high barrier"
408.74,413.22, of exiting at the point where they need to admit they have a loss and go completely bankrupt to
413.22,417.72," exit. So when we had this competition, because companies were incentivized to and because they"
417.72,422.38," had the ability to, how did we get better efficiency? We got better efficiency because"
422.38,428.5," when there was competition, companies were forced to lower their prices in order to make profit. First of all, that meant they had to lower their prices"
428.5,431.74, from the get-go to make sure that they got customers buying their products. That was better
431.74,435.78, for everyone who was now able to buy products at a cheaper price. That was good for family budgets.
435.78,440.04, That was incredibly important for all consumers. They also likely had to innovate to make their
440.04,443.3, products cheaper. That meant that they were being more productive. That meant they were increasing
443.3,447.56, their development. They also likely had to find ways of making their products better quality so
447.56,451.04, that it would be more marketable in a situation where they weren't simply able to lower their
451.04,455.58," costs from the outset. And overall, they had to become much more productive to make their cost"
455.58,459.66, per unit of production a lot lower. Also note that we think there are some reasons why private
459.66,464.18," companies are intrinsically likely to be more efficient than a government. Notice that a company,"
464.36,469.84," because it must make a profit in order to keep operating, cannot have the same level of bureaucracy in"
469.84,473.7," administration as a government, cannot have the level of corruption that a government can have"
473.7,477.94, because they cannot operate at a loss. They also aren't subject to government volatility when
477.94,481.88," elections change, when the government budget is manipulated. That meant that they were able to"
481.88,488.36, run this company so much more efficiently and so much better. They were motivated to and they were able to because they had expertise that politicians
488.36,492.38, and government officials would never have because they had industry experience that simply wasn't
492.38,496.82, there in the government. The impacts of this were enormous for the consumers that did not have to
496.82,501.52, pay a larger price for the goods and services they needed in their everyday life because of
501.52,507.76, the innovation that meant that these nations were finally able to access some form of development that their government could never foresee or never sponsor
507.76,511.6, because of the productivity that meant they could compete globally and gain foreign investment we
511.6,515.04, were the only side in this debate that allowed these developing countries to become developed
515.04,523.76, we propose thank you speaker sir for eight minutes and 11 seconds thank you speaker for that fine
523.76,526.14, speech let us welcome the leader of opposition
526.14,527.72, to open up the opposition case today.
527.72,528.56," Hear, hear."
544.18,547.0," Hi, can I be seen and heard clearly?"
547.0,550.0," Yep, you're both visible and audible."
550.0,554.0," Oh, sorry, this laptop was muted. One more time, can I be seen and heard clearly?"
554.0,557.0," Yep, you're both visible and audible."
557.0,574.92," Awesome. So just a reminder, their, them pronouns, PYZ chat."
576.1,577.78, Probably have you believed that these are just trivial
577.78,579.9, industries that states have nationalized
579.9,581.92, for their own personal gain. This is
581.92,583.9, not true. In developing countries with
583.9,585.1, extremely high levels
585.1,588.56," of poverty, people are extremely, extremely dependent"
588.56,591.0, on state-owned enterprises for their livelihood.
591.0,593.68," Access to things like electricity, water,"
593.68,596.9," public transport, not only for the use of these services,"
596.9,599.38, but also employment within these services.
599.38,600.74," In the developing world,"
600.74,603.34, the state is the largest employer of people.
603.34,606.5," In India, over half a billion people are"
606.5,611.32," employed within the state sector. That is the problem with proposition, a failure to understand"
611.32,616.16," what state-owned enterprises really mean to people. In terms of context, I want to make it"
616.16,620.88, clear that the creation of state-owned enterprises came about as a reaction to the fact that no market
620.88,625.68," existed at all or was very, small within these countries for example the"
625.68,630.4, creation of the indian railway was spearheaded by governments because of the fact that there was no
630.4,635.6, private company to do so as well as the fact that many businesses in these countries are reliant on
635.6,640.08, state-owned enterprises things like electricity water and transport just i want to clarify the
640.08,644.56, huge degree of dependence our counterfactual is thus where state-owned enterprises remain within
644.56,649.2, the view of the state and the government charges for these services and operates them at cost the
649.2,654.4, state can retain ownership over soes we use the same fiat used on their side to engage in reforms
654.4,658.48, to instead do things that create incentives to increase efficiency by giving higher salaries
658.48,662.4, for workers in the instance where they are more productive bonuses to budgets on the basis of
662.4,669.04," high efficiency so if the electricity board is more efficient this year than last year, we give it more of the government budget. Before I"
669.04,673.36," move to argumentation, very quickly point of rebuttal as to their context with the rest of my"
673.36,678.22," rebuttal integrated into argumentation and flagged. I want to make it clear that it is very, very"
678.22,682.8, unlikely they'll be able to do things like sell in parts on their side of the house. This is just
682.8,687.66, because the infrastructure necessary for this is so large that you can't have multiple owners.
687.66,691.08," For example, water pipelines that stretch across a country,"
691.08,693.26, it doesn't make sense for one company to own half
693.26,695.62, the pipeline and another country to own the other half.
695.62,697.84," You have to have one company that owns all of it,"
697.84,700.4," so it will always, always be sold to one country."
700.4,702.52, The second thing is that it's not going to be things
702.52,703.88, in the vast majority of cases
703.88,705.46, like mining or natural resources. Cuba as an example is pretty unstrategic because it's not going to be things in the vast majority of cases like mining or natural resources.
705.92,711.68," Cuba, as an example, is pretty unstrategic because it's a communist nation that's one of the vast minority in the world."
711.9,717.08," In most nations, this looks like things like transport and utilities, and in a lot of nations, also airlines."
717.42,723.26," So what we're talking about in our side of the house is a majority burden in terms of things like transport, utilities and airlines."
723.62,730.82," Right. Before my argumentation, I'll take a point. If we are able, with private companies, to provide these services"
730.82,735.38," at lower prices and use an efficiency that means more employment, how do we not make the lives of"
735.38,739.74, people in these countries better? I'll prove that that's structurally impossible. First argument as
739.74,744.16, to why you worsen accessibility to utilities on the assets house. The context of this argument
744.16,748.8, is that the reason many of these services are SOEs is because there will be natural monopolies under
748.8,753.5," a free market. This is for two big reasons. Firstly, their demand inelastic because people"
753.5,757.08," are dependent on them for their necessities, things like water and electricity. So these"
757.08,761.36, companies can raise prices and people have to keep buying at that higher price. The second is the
761.36,768.56," nature of infrastructure, where it is hard to switch between providers because you can't do things like rip out the current cables you have and put in new ones and"
768.56,773.12, there's high barriers to entry because even if they say that there is a low cost of buying it
773.12,777.68, there's also a very high cost for these companies in terms of operating it which is why unlike what
777.68,782.08, they say the cost the barriers to entry are not low they're actually very high what this then
782.08,789.62," means is that because companies are profit motivated, they do three things. One, they don't care whether people can afford it or not. All they care about"
789.62,794.32," is making a profit, which is why especially in utilities, they can use a business model of few"
794.32,799.02," consumers and high prices to make profit, reducing the number of people who can access it, but price"
799.02,803.64," gouging to cover their red line. Second thing they'll do is especially in rural areas, it is"
803.64,805.2, unprofitable to go there
805.2,809.44, because the high cost of building infrastructure and even if we can see the infrastructure already
809.44,813.62," exists, because there's a very low population, they can't cover the cost of maintaining the"
813.62,817.24, infrastructure. So they would make losses. So there's just no incentive to provide to rural
817.24,821.9," areas at all. The third thing they'll do is cut costs, which means they're very likely to"
821.9,825.94," unemployed people. In the Sri Lankan electricity board, more than 10%"
825.94,827.94, of the country's population is employed
827.94,829.96, within it. This is a large degree of people
829.96,831.96, that are going to be unemployed on their side of the
831.96,834.12," house, which leads to a higher degree of welfare"
834.12,836.04, spending for the state. This is where we
836.04,837.94, counteract their argumentation in terms of
837.94,839.96, the state earning money. Because maybe it
839.96,841.98, is true that the state earns money from the sale
841.98,843.96," on their side of the house, but the costs to the state"
843.96,848.48, are now immensely high when they have to cover the welfare costs of all the people that are unemployed
848.48,852.64, the impact of privatization is thus that fewer people get access to important utilities
852.64,857.92, price increases and quality decreases because dependency on these companies by citizens means
857.92,862.96, that they can reduce quality without having any backlash if their site wants to now compensate
862.96,869.54, this by doing things like subsidizing that's a massive cost to the state for no benefit because these companies just continue raising the
869.54,874.06, prices with no backlash and thus you don't solve the same issue that they're trying to claim on
874.06,878.56, their side of the house. Here's why it's better as an SOE. The state has an electoral incentive
878.56,882.92, to make sure that these things are accessible because they will likely get voted out if they
882.92,885.92, do not do so. in rural areas these are
885.92,890.16, more likely to have resources on our side of the house because these are swing districts more
890.16,895.04, likely to swing between one political party to the other such as rural areas in india for example
895.04,900.24, kerala that is why you are extremely likely to continue provision on our side of the house second
900.24,904.24, there is a government incentive to maintain industries like agriculture which are the largest
904.24,908.32, industries in these countries that don't have any private companies don't have an incentive to do that.
908.36,909.58, So they won't go to rural areas.
909.58,919.38," Three, governments can run these industries at a loss, which is a good thing because you can provide people with necessary things like water and electricity, even during economic slumps."
919.64,929.04," This may be temporarily higher costs, but it's better in the long term because we can get people out of recessions faster as a result of less people being unemployed. The conclusion of this argument is"
929.04,933.5, that privatization leads to worse outcomes for the most vulnerable. Here's where I'm going to do some
933.5,938.62, way up and directly deal with their argumentation. That POI concedes that privatizing healthcare is
938.62,942.72, bad because of market failure. We've just proven that there will be an equal degree of market
942.72,945.72, failure in the instance where you privatize these industries.
945.72,948.48," So by principle, they can see that we should not do so."
948.48,952.82," As a result, we've proven that their argumentation is flipped and we've proven that all of that"
952.82,953.82, doesn't matter.
953.82,957.52, The second thing in terms of response I'm going to deal with now is their argumentation
957.52,958.52, on competition.
958.52,963.26," We've now proven to you that for structural reasons, there will likely be a natural monopoly"
963.26,964.26, created.
964.26,965.2, My second argument is going to
965.2,971.04, like now prove why corruption gets worse and this creates a private monopoly more so on the outside
971.04,975.12, of the house but before that i want to deal with the argumentation on how the competition leads to
975.12,980.48, lower prices this is not true because consumers cannot switch between companies you cannot rip
980.48,984.8, out your electricity cables every time your company prices you up and switch to another
984.8,988.6," electricity provider so even if there is competition in the market overall, there will"
988.6,994.16, certainly be regional monopolies where one company can control city A and another company can control
994.16,998.78, city B. Second argument on why corruption gets worse. The context of this argument is that
998.78,1002.98, there's likely to be less scrutiny over privatization because the process is largely opaque because
1002.98,1008.7, company bidding is private and the people who are likely to most be affected are the least informed i.e the poor who have very little
1008.7,1013.5, access to information the process of privatization is thus likely to be corrupt because politicians
1013.5,1018.04, have an incentive to give these companies over to their cronies as a result of them being able to
1018.04,1022.46, get money by sitting on the boards of these new companies thus they're likely to not give this
1022.46,1029.14," over to the best company but rather to the government lackeys or the company who pays most, and they can continue making money and"
1029.14,1033.12, investing funds with much fewer checks because you can't trace ownership back to the government.
1033.52,1037.6," Even for non-corrupt states, this is still terrible because it is these companies who"
1037.6,1042.16," now have control over utilities, but the state still depends on utilities for education and"
1042.16,1049.36," healthcare. As a result, you create corporate leverage over states an example here would be venezuela where they privatize water and then water"
1049.36,1053.92, companies force governments to cut things like worker rights and environmental rights to allow
1053.92,1057.6, them to pollute because the government had no alternative because they are now dependent on
1057.6,1062.48, this company on our side of the house we get less corruption because soes feel the effect of because
1062.48,1065.76, people feel the effect of losses of SOEs and thus I list that you
1065.76,1069.66, do want to have that taken out of their tax and governments on their side of the house
1069.66,1072.24, point to the free market as an excuse for lax regulations.
1072.24,1076.38, It is on their side of the house that they worsen corruption and damn the lives of the
1076.38,1077.7, poorest in these countries.
1077.7,1078.7, I'm just opposed.
1078.7,1083.18," Thank you, Speaker, for that fine speech."
1083.18,1089.34," Speaker, so for eight minutes and 22 seconds, let us welcome the Deputy Prime Minister to continue the proposition case."
1089.34,1128.1," Hear, hear. Thank you. Just checking that I'm audible."
1128.1,1135.66," You're slightly faint. I'm not sure if it's because of a volume thing, but can you try speaking?"
1135.66,1136.06, Can you hear me now?
1136.06,1138.34," Yep, slightly clear, yeah."
1138.34,1156.0," Perfect. Starting my speech in 3, 2, 1. I'm going to do 2 clear things in this speech. Firstly, I'm going to prove why we make these industries more accessible to the most vulnerable individuals."
1156.0,1168.88," And secondly, i'm going to prove why we make governments better dealing with all of them. about corruption and things like that. On the first question then, which side makes these things more accessible? They make one big claim here, which is to say it creates monopolies."
1169.1,1173.1," And when you create monopolies, you're able to dictate things like the price because no"
1173.1,1177.18, individual is willing to disengage because you can just set the price to be whatever you want.
1177.58,1182.52," This misunderstands how open markets work, which is to say when a government has complete control,"
1182.72,1189.52, there is no incentive for other corporations to move into that industry to move into that area but what our side does is actively open it up
1189.52,1194.0, that is to say even if you don't win the specific contract for this industry now you perceive
1194.0,1198.24, yourself to be a greater competitor because you don't think the government is able to like
1198.24,1203.52, out regulate you out manipulate you just like model you out from your ability to exist which
1203.52,1205.84, is to say that under our side we get
1205.84,1211.12, open markets and we get competition for all of the reasons we give you live about how now countries
1211.12,1216.8, to see rather corporations perceive the ability to get better better change they say that regional
1217.44,1223.04, monopolies are different because consumers can't switch yes you can right like this misunderstands
1223.04,1229.16, how things like electricity works which is to say it doesn't necessitate a huge amount of infrastructure that these individuals cannot possibly switch behind.
1229.26,1237.02," We're able to do things like just make choices like that. But secondly, note how they try to criticize us for only talking about one specific example."
1237.44,1241.3," Obviously, things like airlines aren't like vulnerable to regional monopolies."
1241.46,1245.04, If you access things like international corporations who now see that they
1245.04,1250.64, can succeed that is very very different secondly then on rural areas it is crucial here to note
1250.64,1255.52, that rural areas not getting services is terrible but it is probably symmetrical that is because
1255.52,1259.76, governments have a resource cap they can only do so much which means when they judge whether or not
1259.76,1264.24, they're going to put resources into specific areas they make the decision under the status quo not to
1264.24,1268.48," put resources there that is that they recognize that the benefit for that many individuals,"
1268.66,1273.02, because the electoral incentive in regional areas is quite small because the voting population is
1273.02,1277.28," small, they don't have the incentive to go in and actively make their lives better because the"
1277.28,1281.74, amount of infrastructure it would take is much greater than what the benefit is in terms of
1281.74,1289.52," electoral incentive. But even if they do, it's important to weigh this out. That is to say, you need to note that the ability of governments to go into these"
1289.52,1293.68, areas and make good infrastructure is incredibly small because of the capital restrictions that
1293.68,1298.56," they have. So under our side, when we're able to free up huge amounts of money because we're"
1298.56,1302.72," selling these corporations, we're getting greater tax and things like that, these governments are"
1302.72,1308.32, able to do things like prioritise education and health care know why they have the incentive to do these things that is
1308.32,1313.6, because unlike services like electricity or whatever you're able to mobilize different rural
1313.6,1318.56, communities around specific things like hospitals around education centers in a way that you can't
1318.56,1322.32, with electricity in a way you certainly can't with things like airlines which is why they have the
1322.32,1327.92, incentive and are more able to do that under our side but seconds you know even if you didn't buy that they're just more
1327.92,1331.64, able to right because the amount of capital you need to open a store and send a teacher there is
1331.64,1335.66, incredibly different to building an entire pipeline they just are more able and able to
1335.66,1339.68, change the decision-making calculus in terms of like how much difference they can make by sending
1339.68,1344.36, in resources then they tell you that they are able to cut corners to maximize profits that means they
1344.36,1345.74, cut employment and reduce production.
1346.08,1352.54, This is structurally untrue for the simple reason that obviously these corporations want to be profitable and want to be successful.
1352.88,1365.0," And if they recognize that the way to do that is to keep employees, obviously you're need to reconcile with the fact that other corporations now come in"
1365.0,1370.82," and presumably also need employees, which means just like on math net benefit, obviously our side"
1370.82,1375.46," is better because we get more corporations coming in and itself, more employees in that way. But"
1375.46,1380.1," even if it is true that we cut some employment, note that this benefit is incredibly marginal"
1380.1,1384.28, because the extent to which you're likely to fire people is small. So we're probably happy to trade
1384.28,1387.92, this off at the point at which we can improve public infrastructure surrounding things
1388.08,1391.24, like unemployment and other social services like that.
1391.6,1394.6," Finally, on this issue, in terms of the idea of agriculture,"
1394.92,1398.12, the governments don't engage with agricultural spheres in and of itself.
1398.32,1400.4, Like that is just not something they do under the status quo.
1400.6,1401.76, I'm not sure where they're going with that.
1401.76,1404.52, I'm not sure how much ground they gain there.
1404.72,1407.24, What do we tell you under this issue? We tell you we make these
1407.24,1410.42, industries more efficient because they have specialization. That means they're able to be
1410.42,1414.66," more successful. When it can be more efficient, you're able to reduce prices to remain competitive."
1415.02,1419.6, That means that every single good consumers are now able to access at a better price. That's
1419.6,1422.8, crucial when you look at developing countries where many people are struggling with things
1422.8,1427.84, like poverty. Now we actively make these things more accessible to them thirdly we tell you about things like fbi
1427.84,1432.72, when the fact that other individual corporations from around the world see the capacity for huge
1432.72,1436.64, benefit in these places through investment you're more likely to get foreign involvement and the
1436.64,1441.04, huge benefits that come from that in terms of globalization and industry and the benefits which
1441.04,1445.06," are subsequent from that second issue, on corruption and government operation."
1445.42,1447.34, They tell you that governments will embezzle money
1447.34,1450.88, through this policy and will give these corporations power
1450.88,1452.2, and only give it to their friends
1452.2,1453.46, and terrible actors and things like that.
1453.72,1455.12, This is that tension with characterization
1455.12,1456.62," of the government wanting to do good,"
1456.72,1458.06, which is to say that if you buy
1458.06,1459.14," that they are likely to embezzle,"
1459.42,1460.86, you must also believe that to the extent
1460.86,1461.98, to which they're going to do good
1461.98,1464.4, when they own this industry is also incredibly small.
1464.64,1468.36," Because obviously, if you're going to do good when they own this industry is also incredibly small because obviously if you're willing to do things like deny the public money"
1468.36,1473.62, and just make deals that benefit you you're also probably likely to minimize costs in terms of
1473.62,1477.32, going to these rural areas you're probably willing to minimize time and effort put in to benefits for
1477.32,1482.92, the major population in terms of just like manipulating governments it is unclear why like
1482.92,1485.28, a regional government is unable to say to a water
1485.28,1489.78, corporation which is just like entire profits relies on being able to operate that they're
1489.78,1493.98, going to be able to manipulate that government obviously I'll take a pure in a second obviously
1493.98,1498.12, the government is able to say that's ridiculous we're able to ban that I'll take a pure why if
1498.12,1510.0, you have one all your reasons as to why there will be incredible demand for the contract of privatization are reasons as to why the cost of buying this contract is incredibly high.
1510.0,1514.0, Why then can all companies afford to enter this market?
1514.0,1520.0," Because they have money, right? Like obviously on our side, we're not assuming that companies start up from nothing."
1520.0,1527.18, But our claim is that companies already have infrastructure and already engaged probably in neighboring regions just go in and buy this up.
1527.36,1539.02," But obviously, we can just do things like branch off different industries, which is to say that your only response to this material in your context model about whether or not we can actually split these industries, then you can't split a pipeline."
1539.48,1541.94," Obviously, that is non-responsive to things like airlines."
1542.02,1542.78, We can sell planes.
1542.86,1544.3, We can sell other types of infrastructure.
1544.52,1547.28, It doesn't necessitate big corporations doing everything but also we
1547.28,1551.12, probably think they do so what do you know at the end of this issue if that characterization
1551.12,1554.88, of governments is right and they are likely to embezzle money they achieve no benefit in this
1554.88,1559.12, debate because they're unlikely to do positive things to individuals what we do is free up huge
1559.12,1563.52, amounts of government spending money that they can flush through things like education and hospitals
1563.52,1565.12, that actively better people's lives.
1568.04,1568.3," One point of substantive then, why we limit instability within industries."
1572.04,1576.52," That is, the governments, specifically in the developing world, are often subject to extreme volatility, whether it be because of burdens on resources, the effects of geopolitical"
1576.52,1578.44," events, or just the unstable nature of their industries."
1578.74,1581.92, This is harmful because it means that these industries and the jobs associated with them
1581.92,1584.06, are at the whim of incredibly volatile forces.
1584.48,1588.96, Why is it better under our side? Because companies have more focused budgets and permanent mandates with
1588.96,1592.88, a maintained sense of control. What are the benefits of this? It means that industries
1592.88,1598.08," become far more stable, so corporations that operate them are more stable in and of themselves."
1598.08,1602.4," Why is this incredibly important? Firstly, because you get stability in prices. This is a huge"
1602.4,1605.84, benefit to consumers who now no longer have to worry about how much gas
1605.84,1610.06, price is going to change because of how much a specific government policy is impacting
1610.06,1612.34, the government's ability to free up funding.
1612.34,1614.38," But secondly, it means you get stability in employment."
1614.38,1617.5, You no longer need to worry about whether or not you're going to have a job in two years'
1617.5,1621.1, time because of a specific policy that China's had that impacts your government's ability
1621.1,1623.24, to have the money to employ you.
1623.24,1626.06," But thirdly, you just get greater stability in the economy."
1626.06,1628.24," That is a benefit in and of themselves in these nations,"
1628.24,1630.62, where often economies are incredibly volatile
1630.62,1632.04," and people have very little trust,"
1632.04,1633.62, that worsens their quality of life.
1633.62,1635.66, What do you know then at the end of this speech?
1635.66,1637.12, We free up government money
1637.12,1638.4," that they can put into other services,"
1638.4,1640.0," which actively better people's lives,"
1640.0,1642.44, but also we make other industries more efficient
1642.44,1644.76, and we make other industries better.
1644.76,1645.36, So incredibly proud
1648.56,1653.2, thank you speaker so for eight minutes and 17 seconds let us welcome the deputy
1653.2,1688.0," leader of opposition to continue the opposition case today here here Hi. Hi, can everyone hear me?"
1688.0,1690.0," Sorry, can everyone hear me now?"
1690.0,1692.0," Yep, you're both visible and audible."
1692.0,1767.72, Thank you. I think it's important in this debate to realize what privatization really means.
1767.72,1771.96, Because a lot of propositions analysis is most applicable if this were a this house
1771.96,1776.5, prefers motion about whether from the beginning of time we would have preferred had certain
1776.5,1780.82, industries been controlled by the private sector or whether they had been state owned.
1780.82,1783.48, But unfortunately that's not the debate that we're having.
1783.48,1790.28, Even their own examples of doing things like nationalizing minerals and the oil industry are about creating new state
1790.28,1796.18," monopolies in industries where there is already a thriving private market. Clearly, states already"
1796.18,1800.2," don't do that, given that there is a limitation to the number of state-owned enterprises that"
1800.2,1810.4," exists even in countries like Sri Lanka, and given that states also don't have an incentive to do things like ban private competition. This debate is about taking existing state-owned"
1810.4,1815.68, enterprises and pushing them into the private market through auctions. The importance of this
1815.68,1822.0," is twofold. Firstly, these are industries that people have already begun to depend on."
1822.0,1826.84," Many people in countries like India and Sri Lanka already depend on state-owned enterprises for employment,"
1826.84,1829.08, and many people rely on subsidized services
1829.08,1830.36, to be able to afford them.
1830.36,1834.16," But secondly, the same issues of corruption, nepotism,"
1834.16,1836.1, and bureaucracy that they pointed out to you
1836.1,1837.76, are likely to bleed into the process
1837.76,1839.48," of privatizing these industries,"
1839.48,1841.98," given that you are taking an existing state-owned enterprise,"
1841.98,1843.32," which they presume is corrupt,"
1843.32,1848.08, and attempting to push it into private market. We think that the incentives of politicians to want to leverage this to their
1848.08,1853.04, benefit will exist as well this is important because it proves that even if state-owned
1853.04,1856.64, enterprises are not perfect even if in certain instances they are somewhat corrupt and
1856.64,1861.12, loss-making we ought to maintain them because the costs of trying to privatize them in a world where
1861.12,1867.52," people are already dependent on them are far too high this takes me to to my first area of response, about which side has better public services."
1867.52,1871.28," I want to respond to the framing of this argument that Proposition gives us, because they say that"
1871.28,1874.64," the sale will be lucrative because there's a guaranteed market and infrastructure,"
1874.64,1879.6, and you can maximize opportunities because you open up competition. I would counter frame that
1879.6,1884.24, there is massive uncertainty associated with the profitability of these industries for two reasons.
1884.24,1888.0," Firstly, most state-owned enterprises are fundamentally loss-making"
1888.0,1890.92," because people in developing countries have limited purchasing power,"
1891.22,1895.34, which means the state often has to intervene through subsidies to make sure that these services are affordable.
1895.7,1898.6, So the vast majority of private companies would see this as an indicator
1898.6,1901.54," that if they were to enter the industry, they too would make losses."
1901.54,1906.8," But secondly, the only reason that some state-owned enterprises are profitable is because there isn't"
1906.8,1909.68, massive competition given that the state has control
1909.68,1911.62, over this through state monopolies.
1911.62,1913.72, And so we think that private companies would deduce
1913.72,1916.04," that even if these industries are profitable now,"
1916.04,1919.42," once a private market is created and competition exists,"
1919.42,1921.76, it would no longer be profitable given the ground realities
1921.76,1923.28, within developing countries.
1923.28,1928.88, This framing is important because it means that the idealistic version of propositions model where you'll be able to
1928.88,1933.84, partition off different parts of industries and sell each part to a different private company is
1933.84,1939.12, unlikely the only conditions under which private companies are likely to want to participate in
1939.12,1944.4, auctions to buy state-owned enterprises is if they can control the whole supply chain because that is
1944.4,1949.1, the only way in which they can guarantee that they are profitable given that regional markets are also
1949.1,1953.34, likely to fail in instances where the regional market that you own and buy is one that is rural
1953.34,1957.8, and therefore less profitable and so private companies would also want national control over
1957.8,1963.3, these industries as opposed to being limited to a specific region. This proves that the most
1963.3,1965.34, efficient companies are unlikely to be the
1965.34,1969.88," ones who participate in these auctions. And even if they do, they're likely to place massive"
1969.88,1973.46," restrictions on the way in which the government can sell to them, even if the government isn't"
1973.46,1976.42," corrupt. This leads me to the second claim that they make, that the money will be used for greater"
1976.42,1979.96, government spending. The first thing that I would point out is that the profitability of these
1979.96,1984.46," industries will require changes to the way in which state-owned enterprises operate. For example,"
1984.78,1988.7," reducing redundancies by cutting down on the bureaucracy that they wanted to talk about,"
1988.76,1993.16, which is really just pushing a lot of people into unemployment. The point is the money that they
1993.16,1997.78, earn from the auction will be used to necessarily increase costs to the government because when
1997.78,2001.4," people lose their jobs, you have to pay for things like welfare and unemployment benefits."
2001.7,2005.96, So the amount of money that they have after they have accounted for the loss
2005.96,2007.42," is probably far, far lower,"
2007.42,2008.48, given the effects of things
2008.48,2010.2, like unemployment compound over time.
2010.2,2011.04, The third thing that they say
2011.04,2012.68, is that this creates competition.
2012.68,2013.78, The first thing that I would point out
2013.78,2014.88, is that a lot of the benefits
2014.88,2016.92, of having higher quality services
2016.92,2019.16, aren't really very important with basic utilities.
2019.16,2020.18, Like I don't care about having
2020.18,2022.62," like a very high quality electricity supply,"
2022.62,2024.96," but given that these are basic utilities in nature,"
2024.96,2025.2," any electrical supply is probably more important, which is why we think accessibility like a very high quality electricity supply given that these are basic utilities in nature any"
2025.2,2029.28, electrical supply is probably more important which is why we think accessibility has to be
2029.28,2033.12, made over the quality of these services i would point out then that private companies will find
2033.68,2038.24, profitable in certain instances to pursue alternative business models as opposed to
2038.24,2042.32, giving everyone equal access to these services what do these alternative business models look
2042.32,2048.36, like firstly in areas with low population density they are unlikely to enter the market given that operating costs will be too high
2048.36,2053.82, and existing infrastructure is limited. So they're concentrated in urban areas. They say that this is
2053.82,2058.16, symmetric. I refuse to believe that no government has an incentive to give poor people in rural areas
2058.16,2062.54, who are more likely to vote and turn out access to public services. To say that these people don't
2062.54,2068.2," have access to basic utilities is simply untrue. But the second thing that I would point out is that on their side of the house,"
2068.48,2072.48, you can't guarantee that private companies will continue to provide the same supply of these
2072.48,2076.96," services to the domestic market. So for example, when they say you can just become more profitable"
2076.96,2082.58," by exporting, we think that that's a really bad thing. Because if existing state-owned enterprises"
2082.58,2086.16, pivot towards an export-oriented model it means the services
2086.16,2091.04, and access to essential goods like gas for example is likely to be driven out of domestic markets
2091.04,2096.64, and into foreign markets finally our their responses to our arguments they say that they
2096.64,2100.56, can open up industries and that this can prevent the creation of natural monopolies but this is
2100.56,2104.4, unresponsive to the claim that we made which is that what makes things like water and electricity
2104.4,2108.02," natural monopolies isn't the fact that there is a state monopoly currently,"
2108.02,2110.02, it's the very nature of this service itself.
2110.02,2113.9," It's very difficult to tear out existing water pipelines from your home, given that that"
2113.9,2118.28," probably leads to a main water supply that goes to your region, which in turn leads to"
2118.28,2119.28, a water distributor.
2119.28,2123.46," And so we think that infrastructure is often fixed, which means that people can't switch"
2123.46,2124.7, in between services.
2124.7,2126.6," And that makes that process very, very difficult."
2126.6,2128.4," Before I move on, I'll take the point."
2130.18,2132.5, Only one of your two claims can be true.
2132.5,2135.3, Either everyone or a large portion of people
2135.3,2137.48, in these countries rely on these industries
2137.48,2139.02, because everyone consumes these products
2139.02,2140.58," because they are a huge employer,"
2140.58,2143.02, or these industries are not profitable enough
2143.02,2149.3, for companies who want to enter into this market. Which of these claims is true because currently the government gives people
2149.3,2152.6, a lot of access to this service doesn't mean that it could be profitable given that the government
2152.6,2156.56, is also subsidizing it they make a few blip responses in second firstly they say that
2156.56,2160.7, governments have a resource gap governments don't really have massive capital restrictions given
2160.7,2164.54, that they can raise money through the sale of government bonds or higher taxation and secondly
2164.54,2167.14, I would point out there are incentives to give services to rural areas
2167.14,2171.34, regardless they often swing voters they're necessary to form coalition governments regional
2171.34,2174.94, governments are likely to lobby the federal government in order to do so finally they say
2174.94,2178.18, that corporations won't be profitable and therefore they won't fire people this is
2178.18,2182.68, untrue if what they say is true at the top and there's existing bureaucracy then firing people
2182.68,2188.96, will be necessary how is this supposed to be made even if on our side of the house we need to maintain national carriers that are highly
2188.96,2193.52, loss-making industries we can always do that by increasing taxes on the growing middle class and
2193.52,2197.84, large businesses in these countries which is what most developing countries already do however on
2197.84,2201.44, their side of the house it is the poorest people who have the least access to these services
2201.44,2208.4," finally on reducing the effects of corruption i want to point out that there is very little response to the analysis that we gave you, which is that even"
2208.4,2213.08," though broadly governments are responsive to electoral incentives, some elements within the"
2213.08,2216.94, government are corrupt. There are a number of reasons why corruption is better dealt with on
2216.94,2221.86," our side of the house. Firstly, it is far easier to have scrutiny on state-owned enterprises as"
2221.86,2228.08," opposed to private businesses that are owned by state cronies, given that you need to discover the fact that they have ties to the state in the first place."
2228.32,2231.86," But secondly, the state can always default to the fact that these are private businesses,"
2232.2,2235.92, and so they shouldn't be forced to give up their expense reports to the public. And we shouldn't
2235.92,2240.14," have immense regulations on them, because the point of privatization was to facilitate a private"
2240.14,2244.08, market. And so there are ways in which the state can better facilitate corruption on their side of
2244.08,2249.48," the house. Importantly, if the process of privatization puts state-owned enterprises into"
2249.48,2253.62, the hands of state cronies where electoral incentives are no longer likely to lead to
2253.62,2257.46, greater accountability it means the effects of corruption are great on their side for all of
2257.46,2264.18, these reasons oppose thank you speaker soak for 8 minutes and 14 seconds thank you speaker for
2264.18,2309.6," that fine speech let us welcome the government whip to conclude the government's constructive case today. Okay. Guys, am I audible?"
2309.6,2311.5, You're audible but not visible.
2311.5,2323.5," Oh, you're not audible and visible."
2323.5,2352.92," Cool. The The problem with this opposition case is that as much as I want to say companies are bad,"
2352.92,2357.08, they provide almost no material why governments are likely to run them better other than the
2357.08,2360.8, words electoral incentives. I'm going to break that down in my speech and if governments have
2360.8,2368.1, no reason to run it better then this opposition is actually the one that harms the poorest people the most. They are the ones that force people to pay higher prices for
2368.1,2372.02," electricity because there is no innovation in that industry, because there are no reasons why"
2372.02,2376.2, those prices get cheaper. And I'm going to explain that in my speech. Their line about cronies as
2376.2,2379.72," well, I would note, is the exact reason why the government is likely to be corrupt in these"
2379.72,2384.08," instances, why they're so inefficient, why they're so bureaucratic, which means even in their best"
2384.08,2388.16," case, where we assume that governments have the best incentives, unlikely that they're able to"
2388.16,2391.84," get the cheapest prices, which we are going to support on our side. There are two questions in"
2391.84,2395.66," this speech. The first is how does this affect these services? And secondly, how does this affect"
2395.66,2399.22," the overall economy of these countries? Starting off with the first issue, because it's the most"
2399.22,2402.9," important part of this debate, and it's clearly where we come out in front. This will explain"
2402.9,2407.92, why it's only under our side where the best services come out and where people actually have the incentives to ensure that
2407.92,2411.6, the prices are the cheapest there are two things we're going to talk about here firstly let's talk
2411.6,2415.28, about governments secondly let's talk about companies firstly on governments the only thing
2415.28,2419.68, they say about why governments are likely to do this well is electoral incentives i'm going to
2419.68,2423.84, give you four reasons why that's unlikely to actually lead to the outcomes they say the first
2423.84,2429.84, thing to say is that there's no comparison of service. It makes it hard to complain about whether that service is
2429.84,2433.58," good or bad. And so therefore, it means that it's unlikely that people are going to cast their vote"
2433.58,2437.96," on that. But secondly, because electoral incentives are incredibly slow. So even if you buy their"
2437.96,2442.84," mechanism, it takes four years for that to happen. Our market immediately adjusts. Our market is one"
2442.84,2445.24, that immediately makes the price cheaper.
2445.24,2447.28, And that is a claim this opposition cannot get.
2447.28,2449.9," But thirdly, with other factors exist in elections,"
2449.9,2453.0," other than like how much your airline costs,"
2453.0,2455.54," which is to say that clearly under our side,"
2455.54,2457.64," that is when we get the market mechanism,"
2457.64,2460.4, whereas this opposition can't rely on people to vote
2460.4,2462.34, explicitly on how much their airline costs.
2462.34,2464.38," Instead, they probably vote on things like taxes"
2464.38,2467.72, and this opposition has not explained why this electoral incentive will work.
2467.88,2471.44," The final thing to say is that it's easy for governments to blame external factors,"
2471.7,2474.88," and that's for the reason they can say, well, there was less electricity this year because"
2474.88,2478.94, less was produced. It's incredibly hard for people to use that as a reason to vote them out.
2479.24,2483.04," All that is to say that the one mechanism this opposition relies on, which is electoral"
2483.04,2488.56," incentive, does not work in this event, which means that under their side they have no reason to make those prices cheaper they have"
2488.56,2493.12, no reason to make sure that electricity prices go down in the same way that companies do but the
2493.12,2496.32, second thing to say is that let's take this opposition to their best and assume that
2496.32,2500.32, governments have all these really good incentives note that they don't explain how they can overcome
2500.32,2504.16, the bureaucratic barriers that we point out from first in fact that they themselves talk about
2504.16,2508.3," corruption the fact that they themselves talk about cronyism, which is more likely to happen"
2508.3,2513.06," on their side, because clearly it's much easier to investigate a company than it is to have the"
2513.06,2517.14," government investigate itself. And that's clearly why we've went out on that, and it's worse under"
2517.14,2521.52," this opposition side. The third thing to say is that even if this opposition, even in their best"
2521.52,2528.96," case, ignoring all that makes it cheaper, they haven't explained why governments are likely to manage it better because cheaper in their best case is not always good if"
2528.96,2532.88, you're over supplying something which you have limited resources on which is to say that if a
2532.88,2536.96, government has short-term interest and they push out all the electricity in four years and do not
2536.96,2541.6, have electricity for the next four years that is obviously harmful what we have under outside is a
2541.6,2548.0, market mechanism that appropriately makes the price correct it means that people can access it but it means that people can access it sustainably
2548.0,2552.32, and that is what this opposition has not engaged so what we know so far that this competition does
2552.32,2556.88, not provide reasons why the government is likely to be good providing the service by comparison we
2556.88,2560.72, have for companies so second let's talk about companies the first line of attack is that you
2560.72,2567.78, don't service rural areas two responses firstly it is still profitable because the infrastructure already exists. The reason why it may not be profitable
2567.78,2571.52, before is because you have to build up that infrastructure. But to the extent it already
2571.52,2575.92," exists, it is still like profit in order to service that place because you can still make"
2575.92,2579.48," money from it, even if it's less so than you might originally. But the second thing to say"
2579.48,2583.44, is that this is uncomparative because it's unclear why governments with electoral and
2583.44,2589.92, short-term incentives would be providing those rural places or other places with the services which they want to defend
2589.92,2594.16, under their side so clearly that's uncomparative and it's likely worse the second line of attack
2594.16,2598.64, is say that these places are natural monopolies there are two responses the first thing today
2598.64,2602.72, that we think that this is unlikely because there's no reason why you want to cut out all
2602.72,2608.42, the people in the market except the super rich. And the reason for that unknown is because you want more people to access it such
2608.42,2613.28," that you can make more profit overall. And note that even if you don't buy that, the other reason"
2613.28,2617.32," why you necessarily want more people to access it is because it grants you stability, which is to"
2617.32,2621.54," say that if you only have like a few thousand people who are flying your planes, you don't know"
2621.54,2626.04," when they're likely to fly those planes. But bigger your market is, the more stable your profit is"
2626.04,2628.38, because it happens over a greater group of people.
2628.56,2631.14, So the amount that they consume each time matters less.
2631.28,2632.7, And that is what grants you stable profit.
2633.0,2634.78," But secondly, we do an unlikely monopoly"
2634.78,2636.9, because lots of companies want to enter the market.
2637.16,2639.02, And it's unlikely that they pull out halfway
2639.02,2641.06," because of the fact that they've already invested,"
2641.34,2643.32, which means that instead they're likely to compete.
2643.32,2648.0, They're likely to improve their service overall. The final thing that we explain is that there is a certainty because
2648.0,2651.76, they know that the market exists and that necessarily means they'll make profit the only
2651.76,2655.12, response here is that they'll only buy it from governments if they don't sell it to others
2655.12,2658.72, firstly that is not true because we think that governments are the ones who are able to set
2658.72,2662.64, conditions given that they're the ones they're the ones selling the product and they are obviously
2662.64,2667.8," therefore the ones in power but secondly because even if you don't sell it initially to lots of people,"
2668.14,2671.82," obviously other companies can come in, they can build up their own infrastructure,"
2672.2,2673.8, and that is what triggers competition.
2674.1,2677.0, The final claim here is that you can only have one pipeline for one house.
2677.18,2682.28," We've already dealt with this at second, but I would note that you can build more pipelines"
2682.28,2682.9, to one house.
2682.9,2689.0, And it's unclear why this applies to a whole set of other companies like Airways which we talked about but first but the second thing to
2689.0,2692.96, note here is that even if it is true we think there is still competition because if you are
2692.96,2696.74, not efficient enough other companies will choose to buy you out and I'm going to move on their
2696.74,2702.44, final piece of substantive but before that I'll take a point your first speaker says that the
2702.44,2709.32, reason these institutions operate and cost and aren't profitable is due to mass government subsidies to provide cheaper utilities.
2709.7,2714.08, You say that these government incentives don't work and these are actually very expensive.
2714.5,2716.32, Which one of these characterizations is true?
2717.32,2720.1, What we said from first is that governments don't need to make profit.
2720.46,2725.0, But that is the exact reason why governments don't innovate into the future.
2725.0,2730.0, That is the reason why electricity doesn't become cheaper. That is the reason why these services don't improve.
2730.0,2734.0, And it's only on the outside where we have competition that makes those services better.
2734.0,2738.0," What do we tell you here? Because note that they don't respond at all to our second piece of substantive,"
2738.0,2741.0," from our piece of substantive and second, about more stability."
2741.0,2748.32," Because given that many developing nations are unstable, it is only under side proposition where the instability"
2748.32,2750.44, of a government does not affect that entire economy.
2750.44,2752.26," That doesn't say that if the government is unstable,"
2752.26,2754.06, that can take away resources from people.
2754.06,2756.24, Whereas if we have multiple companies running around
2756.24,2758.56," an economy, that necessarily means that you're unlikely"
2758.56,2760.82, to pose that risk and you're unlikely to have that harm.
2760.82,2763.04," So the final thing I'm gonna talk about in this speech,"
2763.04,2764.8, how does this affect the overall economy
2764.8,2767.92, of these countries? And this is important because it drastically raises this
2767.92,2771.28, burden because even if you believe that their services are slightly better you have to weigh
2771.28,2775.04, that up against the billions of dollars we give you on our side we say that the money spent on
2775.04,2779.28, the infrastructure can now be spent on governmental programs because tax increases under our side the
2779.28,2782.72, amount of money you get from the sale of these companies increases and they virtually have no
2782.72,2787.44, response other than to talk about employment let's deal with their employment claim here we would say that we
2787.44,2791.6, actually win on employment and the reason why that's true is because when you have more companies
2791.6,2795.68, operating in that specific industry means that they have to compete against one another which
2795.68,2799.92, means that they have to outdo each other to sustain themselves what that means is that under
2799.92,2804.24, our side where you're trying to innovate more you employ more people you ensure that you're the one
2804.24,2807.86, who can produce the service at the cheapest rate for the best price. And that is
2807.86,2811.7," necessarily why we win on employment. Because when there are so many companies operating,"
2811.94,2815.58, that is better than a government which does not allow for that competition. That is better
2815.58,2819.26," because governments have no reason to improve their own incentives, sorry, to improve their"
2819.26,2823.18, own product to the extent that they know that there will be no cost to them if they don't.
2823.18,2828.72," At the end of the speech, what do do you know this opposition has not provided reasons why government are likely to actually"
2828.72,2833.28, improve their service by comparison we have pointed out a simple market mechanism that allows
2833.28,2837.04, companies to improve themselves into the long term which this opposition has not engaged with
2837.04,2887.0," so proud to propose thank you speaker stock for eight minutes and seven seconds. Let us welcome the opposition whip to conclude the opposition constructive case. Hi, just check if I'm audible and visible?"
2887.0,2914.94," Yeah, they're both audible and visible. Three questions in the speech."
2914.94,2919.4," First on government incentives, second on competition and innovation, finally on accessibility"
2919.4,2920.4, and exploitation.
2920.4,2921.4, First on government incentives.
2921.4,2932.0, I want to note that we get a laundry list of reasons in third as to why governments don't have the incentive to provide cheap and accessible state services that are of a good quality.
2932.0,2939.0," I want to note that we don't need the best quality services on our side of the house, but it needs to meet a minimum level such as clean water."
2939.0,2952.44, Note that the best response to this argument was already given to you across both of our first two speeches that is direct state ownership of these industries and revenue means that any mess up that occurs or
2952.44,2957.98, any problem that arises from these utilities is directly tied back to the state and it massively
2957.98,2964.02, hurts the state's chances at re-election even corrupt governments want to be re-elected because
2964.02,2966.44, that is how they can be in power and
2966.44,2967.44, consolidate the power.
2967.44,2972.38," And given how much people value things like water, value things like electricity, because"
2972.38,2977.58," it creates employment and because it's affordable, I would note then that the electoral incentive"
2977.58,2979.66, is strong on our side of the house.
2979.66,2984.1," In third, they tell us, no, you're just going to push out all the electricity in your first"
2984.1,2985.44, four years of your term
2985.44,2990.96, and there won't be any electricity left after look i've done edible physics electricity is produced
2990.96,2995.68, through like turbines and stuff you can't just push everything out but more importantly i want
2995.68,3000.0, to note that party re-election is also a big thing that you don't just want to protect the current
3000.0,3005.68, candidate in power you want your party to keep getting re-elected in the future so if you mess
3005.68,3010.64, up in one term and the next year people are living extremely bad lives i would note that the blame
3010.64,3017.12, comes to your party the thing to note here is that when they when this is privatized the external
3017.12,3023.12, check and the ability for governments to deflect blame is far greater on proposition side of the
3023.12,3025.0, house this is due to three reasons.
3025.34,3027.92," First, the bidding process in itself is opaque"
3027.92,3030.36, given that things such as journalistic freedoms
3030.36,3032.32, aren't the best in the developing world.
3032.32,3036.3, And given that the poor only feel the effects and harms of privatization
3036.3,3038.48," after the contract has been bid for,"
3038.68,3042.2, it means the most reliable actors don't necessarily get the contract
3042.2,3045.0, but only the highest bidders do in propositions work.
3045.0,3050.0," But second, it's harder to identify instances of state abuse through private corporations,"
3050.0,3055.0, because they can do things like hide black money in shell corporations abroad.
3055.0,3059.0," And finally, I want to note that states can sell the rhetoric to their populations,"
3059.0,3063.0," that it isn't necessarily their fault that these companies are abusing them,"
3063.0,3069.66, that they're actually meant for lower prices and better quality. So when abuse does occur on the proposition side of the
3069.66,3074.88," house, states can deflect it and don't need to take responsibility for it. So make no mistake,"
3075.12,3079.24," corruption isn't symmetric, it becomes worse on their side. The second thing I want to talk about"
3079.24,3089.14," is competition. Note crucially that all of their benefits, such as lower prices, are contingent on the"
3089.14,3095.16, multiplicity of actors existing within this market and therefore prices will be lower.
3095.16,3100.0, What I want to flesh out is why monopolies are likely to exist on their side of the house.
3100.0,3104.76, The first thing we told you is that the cost of switching to consumers is exorbitantly
3104.76,3105.76, high.
3105.76,3107.44, They say it's not really.
3107.44,3111.66, You can rip out your water and electricity lines and put new ones in if you want to switch
3111.66,3112.66, to a new company.
3112.66,3113.66," Yeah, you can do that."
3113.66,3120.66, But the fact is doing that is extremely costly to the middle class or lower income person
3120.66,3121.66, within the developing world.
3121.66,3125.16, And that in itself is a reason for as to why they cannot
3125.16,3130.74, switch more crucially but Chanika gave you analysis in his second speech as to why there will be very
3130.74,3136.62, few bidders within the market one given that it is a state Monopoly and these companies and the
3136.62,3141.6, state is already making a loss on selling at cost companies think that at the end of the day these
3141.6,3145.44, are unprofitable Industries to invest into due to the uncertainty
3145.44,3150.8, that exists but second given that the vast majority of consumers in the developing world
3150.8,3155.68, are poor companies are uncertain on whether or whether or not they can make a profit within these
3155.68,3161.84, industries whether if they charge even marginally higher prices whether people will buy that product
3161.84,3165.68, what is the implication of this analysis this means that the companies
3165.68,3171.52, that can afford the contract of privatization are those that can better those uncertainties and
3171.52,3176.96, afford those extremely high costs which are likely to be the few richest emmenses around the world
3176.96,3182.48, or within these countries and therefore monopolization is likely even at their best
3182.48,3186.8, let's say monopolies don't occur then there are one of two possibilities
3186.8,3191.68, first are oligopolies where there are a few companies operating within the market and in
3191.68,3196.96, order to reduce things such as cost across production they do do things like kalu so they
3196.96,3202.24, can use each other's railway lines they can use each other's electricity and water lines or given
3202.24,3209.52, that consumers find it hard to switch even if there are multiple companies within the market there are regional monopolies where consumers within
3209.52,3214.0, a certain region or certain area of a country cannot afford to switch and this leads to
3214.0,3219.12, exploitation and higher prices the second mechanism they gave us for as to why innovation
3219.68,3225.04, is that innovation leads to lower prices but why are companies incentivized to innovate given that
3225.04,3230.72, competition isn't the greatest within the market like i would counter argue that it is actually
3230.72,3235.92, beneficial to reduce the quality of these services because that is what is the most profitable and it
3235.92,3240.8, allows you to cut costs within the industry especially if you have to give this to a large
3240.8,3246.2, amount of people i'm unsure why you will give the highest quality service. Let's weigh this argument.
3246.64,3249.36, Even if the price is not exorbitantly high
3249.36,3250.52," in propositions world,"
3250.7,3253.36, it is still higher than it is in our world.
3253.66,3255.24," This is because in our world,"
3255.56,3256.98," governments operate at cost,"
3257.26,3258.58," while on propositions world,"
3258.8,3260.82," companies need to make some profit,"
3260.98,3262.42, if not the most profit.
3262.42,3264.44," And therefore, prices will be higher"
3264.44,3265.04, than they are
3265.04,3271.04, in the status quo to the poor person in india who doesn't have the capital to afford his child's
3271.04,3277.12, education or put three meals on the table even a marginal increase in prices is banned for that
3277.12,3283.04, case the final thing then is not exploitation the first thing i want to flesh out is that demand for
3283.04,3285.6," these services may be inelastic,"
3285.94,3290.08," but if many people can't afford it, they are forced not to use these utilities."
3290.56,3293.46, So proposition can't hide behind demand inelasticity.
3293.7,3297.7," But the way companies can make a profit is by switching their business model,"
3298.0,3300.96," which is even if we reduce the amount of consumers,"
3301.32,3304.5, we will just charge the existing consumer base higher prices.
3305.58,3310.6," This is a problem because when people can't afford things such as electricity and water, when they don't"
3310.6,3316.82," have the transport in order to get to work, this increases the cost of living to individuals and"
3316.82,3321.68, it hurts states because states are the ones who have to create the safety net for these people.
3321.96,3325.84," But second, I want to weigh this analysis, because even if we"
3325.84,3330.52," are not talking about industries like electricity and water, and we're talking about industries such"
3330.52,3335.94," as mining, think about how mining is important for the export of a state, how the raw materials"
3335.94,3341.22, that comes from mines are integral to export-oriented nations such as South Korea. So I
3341.22,3350.56, don't know then that this deals with the argument that we can get a lot of money by scaling state industries because at the end of the day if that money has to be used to cover up
3350.56,3355.44, the cost of exploitation of companies that is in net harm on proposition. The second thing I want
3355.44,3361.28, to talk about in this clash is on rural areas. First in places that has existing infrastructure
3361.28,3367.06, the operational cost of companies is too high to operate. Given
3367.06,3371.62," that few people live in these areas, companies find it more profitable to just not provide"
3371.62,3375.12," services to these areas. Given that these are the poorest people, they are the most"
3375.12,3380.22," vulnerable and proposition harms them. Second, areas that have no infrastructure. I want"
3380.22,3388.16, to note that the only response to this was states won't do so either. But we gave you a multitude of analysis as to why states will do so.
3388.42,3390.98," That is, there's an electoral incentive of swing states."
3391.32,3397.12," Regional governments, for example, want to create coalitions within parliament in order to lobby the federal government."
3397.34,3401.08, So I do note that rural areas are far better off on our side of the house.
3401.54,3410.08, Proposition ultimately needed to prove that prices were so high in the status quo that there is a problem that requires privatization they haven't done so oppose
3412.64,3419.04, thank you speaker for that fine speech um let us um speaker suck for eight minutes and 16 seconds
3419.04,3433.92," let us welcome the opposition reply to conclude the opposition case as a whole. Hear, hear."
3434.88,3436.08, Can I be seen in the video?
3458.64,3462.4," Yep, you're both audible and visible. two sections in this supply speech firstly i'm going to go over the mechanistic contentions between the two sides then i'm going to go to the clashes firstly i think there are two"
3462.4,3469.92, mechanistic contentions in this debate firstly whether or not competition is likely and secondly whether or not rural areas will be cared
3469.92,3474.4, for on our side so firstly in terms of whether or not competition is on is likely we give you
3474.4,3478.16, multiple reasoning as to why this industry is likely to be a natural cost of replacing
3478.16,3482.32, infrastructure is too high demand is inelastic even if you can break up parts of the supply
3482.32,3485.44, chain government won't do this because of uncertainty in the market.
3485.44,3488.24," In fact, it's only profitable if you own the whole supply chain."
3488.24,3491.9," The fact that governments, the fact that companies are unlikely to want to invest because they"
3491.9,3496.5, already see this as a cross making industry and therefore very few companies will invest.
3496.5,3500.22, The fact that there's an extremely high barrier to entry in terms of being able to maintain
3500.22,3502.34," the infrastructure, all of that."
3502.34,3506.68," Their only response here was to say, oh, but companies want to make profit."
3507.16,3509.14," We, this ignores all the structural analysis"
3509.14,3510.6, about developing countries.
3510.86,3512.22, That means that these industries
3512.22,3514.02, are never going to be profitable.
3514.34,3517.06, Why it is required that you run them at a loss
3517.06,3518.76, and that's why it is only the state
3518.76,3520.18, that is able to take care of them.
3520.7,3522.38," If you want to make this profitable,"
3522.76,3524.14, we told you why this is bad
3524.14,3525.44, in terms of alternative
3525.44,3530.4, business orienters orientations such as being expert oriented which shanika told you was bad
3530.4,3534.88, because of scarcity in the domestic market or taking a few consumers and giving extremely high
3534.88,3539.2, prices which cuts off access to the vast majority and makes it much harder for the people who do
3539.2,3543.36, have access all of this is reasoning as to why competition is worse on their side second
3543.36,3548.48, mechanistic contention is on rural areas i'm going to do more of this in the clash analysis so i just want to do the
3548.48,3553.2, way here which is said even if governments reject some rural areas those rural areas are much more
3553.2,3557.44, likely to be rejected by profit motivated businesses because they give us no incentive
3557.44,3561.68, for profit motivated businesses to go to rural areas whereas we give you some incentive to go
3561.68,3565.4," to rural areas for government so there's four cl clashes. Firstly, in terms of government incentives,"
3565.84,3568.08," when there's direct ownership, the losses are tied to the state,"
3568.18,3569.2," the government wants re-election,"
3569.38,3571.6," there's a strong electoral incentive,"
3571.9,3573.96, which means they are likely to want to provide this for low cost.
3574.36,3577.0," Second, rural areas are not locked out."
3577.22,3578.38, They are swing states often.
3578.74,3580.92," They often, rural governments have lobbying power."
3581.2,3582.66," They often have agricultural importance,"
3582.66,3584.54, all of which means governments want to provide for them.
3588.8,3593.04," On contrast, on the private sector, ability may privatize it the ability for governments to deflect blame is lower because the bidding process is opaque it's hard to justify"
3593.04,3597.44, state abuse and states sell the rhetoric of the free market all of which means that government
3598.08,3601.68, incentives get worse off on their side of the house and we have proven a government incentive
3601.68,3605.22, to provide this for very low cost. Second cash in terms of competition.
3605.5,3607.66, This is important because all our propositions benefits
3607.66,3610.2, are contingent on proving competition exists.
3610.64,3612.88, This is not true for the reasons we've told you earlier.
3613.24,3615.16," The way here is that even if there is no monopoly,"
3615.28,3617.2," you're likely to have an oligopoly or regional monopoly,"
3617.34,3619.42, which makes it much less accessible.
3619.76,3620.88, And you also reduce innovation
3620.88,3622.82, because you really don't need to care about innovating
3622.82,3624.1, if you control the whole market.
3624.1,3629.04, The weighing of this is that even if the price is not exorbitantly high it is still higher
3629.04,3633.36, because it's government selling things at cost versus companies having to sell things with a
3633.36,3637.28, profit which is where competition is unlikely to happen and therefore exploitation but not
3637.28,3640.88, exploitation but companies are like to happen and therefore prices are likely to be higher less
3640.88,3645.76, people have access third clash is on exploitation look human's given you the
3645.76,3651.44, analysis as to why companies would make profit by doing things like increasing prices for example
3651.44,3655.28, we want to do some weighing here to conceive completely that it is possible that these
3655.28,3660.0, industries are loss making and come at a cost to the government here's where chanidu's weighing is
3660.0,3664.96, extremely important on our side of the house even if these industries are loss making you cover up
3664.96,3669.68, that loss by taxing the rich and upper middle class within these countries to cover for that
3669.68,3674.8, on their side of the house they force the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable to cover for
3674.8,3679.92, this by losing access to important things like water that's necessary for their literal survival
3679.92,3684.24, or electricity which is important for them to live a decent quality of life so even if it is not
3684.24,3687.36, things like electricity and water we've already given you reasons why even
3687.36,3691.44, things like mining are important because the state needs access to that and the ability to
3691.44,3696.32, concentrate the benefit for exports. The last clash here is the one that got least response
3696.32,3700.08, but it's extremely important in terms of social harms. The fact that cost cutting is likely to
3700.08,3705.44, increase in unemployment which leads to an extreme increase in government spending which undermines
3705.44,3709.44, any benefit you'll get from selling it and the fact that corporations get liberated over states
3709.44,3713.36, where they can hold them at gunpoint and force them to impose policies like they did in venezuela
3713.36,3716.96, for all of these reasons we are the site that benefits developing countries
3719.68,3730.76, thank you speaker for that fine speech seeker so for four minutes and 22 seconds let us welcome the government reply to conclude today's debate as a whole.
3730.76,3738.64, Just checking that I'm audible.
3738.64,3743.56," Yep, you're audible and visible."
3743.56,3749.0, Great.
3759.0,3768.4," Two questions to ask in judging this debate. Firstly, why side proposition is able to improve these services and industries, and second, why we improve the overall economic and public services of these nations. On the first question, why we improve these services. I'm going to split this into two parts. parts firstly talking about the behavior of governments and then secondly talking about the behavior of these"
3768.4,3773.52, companies firstly on governments it is crucial to note that most of their benefits in this debate
3773.52,3778.88, rely on governments having good incentives why do we think they do not the only claim here is to say
3778.88,3783.28, that they have good electoral and strong electoral incentives we respond to this in four key ways
3783.28,3788.5, first we say that this in and of itself isn't enough because there's no comparison that voters can make so it doesn't
3788.5,3792.48, impact their voting decision because they cannot decide that the government is less or more better
3792.48,3796.96," at a specific thing than other corporations. But secondly, we say this mechanism is slow and that's"
3796.96,3800.9," harm in and of itself. Thirdly, we say that other factors matter to individuals when they're voting,"
3801.18,3804.72, so this is an insufficient bar to meet in terms of whether or not this is going to impact
3804.72,3808.34, individuals' ability to make good choices choices but fourthly and crucially
3808.34,3812.72, we say governments can just blame other factors so that individuals are less informed when they
3812.72,3818.12, make this ballot this is all reasons why they don't do this well but even if we take side
3818.12,3823.34, Sri Lanka at their best and say they do have good incentives why do we still win this debate because
3823.34,3828.48, governments don't do this as well as corporations. That's firstly because of structural problems like corruption that they
3828.48,3832.82, observe. The fact that you can't have investigations into your own government be as successful as you
3832.82,3837.06," could into other companies means that they lose out on all of those benefits. Second, it's the"
3837.06,3841.34," lack of expertise and skill, which is simply structurally and empirically true. They are less"
3841.34,3844.92, able to innovate because they do not have the same infrastructure. They do not have the same capital.
3845.3,3848.72," Thirdly, it's the mismanagement of funds and lack of funds."
3848.72,3852.34, Team Sri Lanka tries to run away with this debate by saying that they don't have capital
3852.34,3853.34, caps.
3853.34,3856.72," Obviously, that's a lie when most of their contextualization is pointing out people living"
3856.72,3857.72, in abject poverty.
3857.72,3861.88," They didn't have capital caps, they could solve their problems, they couldn't."
3861.88,3864.56," They didn't have the same amount of money that these corporations did, so they were"
3864.56,3867.76, going to be worse at it but even if they could do this well it was
3867.76,3872.72, still worse because firstly they didn't have to come out of cost so they had no incentive to
3872.72,3877.04, innovate this is material we give you a third that is they don't have market incentives which force
3877.04,3881.52, them to continue to get better so there's no incentive for them who get better they continue
3881.52,3888.16, to do the status quo that is why these services are the worst in government alone secondly then let's talk about government behaviors they try to make
3888.16,3893.36, uh sorry company behaviors they try to make one big claim here which is that people in rural areas
3893.36,3898.72, lose out we respond to this in three key ways firstly we reject it we say that the infrastructure
3898.72,3902.8, which already exists in these areas means that these companies are likely to just take over and
3902.8,3907.68, to continue maximizing profit in these areas second we tell you if this infrastructure doesn't already exist then
3907.68,3912.32, this is a symmetrical harm because governments are unlikely to continue going to the most rural areas
3912.32,3917.12, to provide them with these services but thirdly we tell you we would trade it off the huge benefit
3917.12,3921.28, would be get when we free up government spending to focus on other things finally then they make
3921.28,3925.18, a ditch on monopolies and credit say this is the most important thing in this space.
3925.18,3930.66," We respond to it in one key way, which is to say that many competition, this policy"
3930.66,3932.06, enforces competition.
3932.06,3937.4," They tell you in response that it is the companies will simply collude, but at best for them,"
3937.4,3940.5, this is mitigatory and doesn't deal with the nuance and sophistication that we give you
3940.5,3944.46," about why companies want to expand, about why they must be profitable given all of their"
3944.46,3948.24, framing about the scale of these industries and why that means we get better quality the impacts
3948.24,3952.96, of this are huge it's the fact that now transport is better people live easier lives the fact we
3952.96,3957.28, improve the economic capacity of these countries and we increase employment on their own metrics
3957.28,3961.52, we win this debate but even if you didn't buy any of that our alternate path to victory is just
3961.52,3968.8, this improves overall economies and public services the scale of employment they want to claim in this debate is insufficient that is because more companies
3968.8,3973.6, existing means you get more employment on numbers alone we win this debate but second it's to say
3973.6,3978.08, that we could do things like rely on welfare they try to make this a response at best for them it's
3978.08,3982.8, mitigation because it's untrue that when governments get this huge influx of capital that
3982.8,3986.22, they are going to waste it all on the unemployment benefits of these individuals.
3986.22,3987.08," So at best for them,"
3987.08,3989.46," even if you wanted to credit this response at its fullest,"
3989.46,3991.06, you still couldn't give them this debate
3991.06,3993.32, because governments were inevitably going to have spare money
3993.32,3994.9," to spend on things like education,"
3994.9,3996.92, things that actively improve the lives
3996.92,3998.88," of the world's most vulnerable individuals,"
3998.88,4000.52, things that meant that you could go to a hospital
4000.52,4002.62, and you could get treated for diseases
4002.62,4010.22, or for whatever was ailing with you. That was why we won this debate so incredibly proud of those thank
4010.22,4015.58, you speaker for that fine speech i'm seeker so for four minutes and 16 seconds thank you
4015.58,4021.8, all for that great debate um please cross bench and shake hands virtually um judges
4021.8,4024.04, let's go to prop prep room
