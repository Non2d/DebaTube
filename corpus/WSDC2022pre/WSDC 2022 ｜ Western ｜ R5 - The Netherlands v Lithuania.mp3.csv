0.0,8.06, Amazing. All the best to both teams. I'd like to welcome the first proposition speaker to begin the debate.
8.26,16.42," Hi, I'd prefer POIs in the chat, please. And my pronouns are she, her."
19.14,23.4," All around the world, polarization is reaching a boiling point."
23.4,25.92," In the United States, a mob stormed the"
25.92,32.16, capital in an effort to overturn a stolen election. Pakistan issued a nuclear warning to Israel after
32.16,36.54, a misleading news segment that claimed that Israel had threatened them with a nuclear attack.
36.92,41.8," During the pandemic, the media fueled non-compliance with protective measures all"
41.8,45.42, across the globe because refusing to get a vaccine or wearing a
45.42,51.62," mask became a political stance. We tell you to limit polarization, we must implement a fairness"
51.62,57.44," doctrine. Before I move into my framing, we have a three-part model we want to push. Firstly, a"
57.44,63.18," fairness doctrine requires two things. A, that when covering any controversial topic, broadcasters"
63.18,65.24," must report both sides of the story. B, they must report both sides fairly,, broadcasters must report both sides of the story."
65.8,68.22," B, they must report both sides fairly."
68.54,70.54," So broadcasters are not allowed to, for instance,"
70.8,73.6, discredit or otherwise undermine one side.
73.94,76.02," In practice, this looks like in Italy,"
76.22,78.16, where talk shows regularly host debates
78.16,79.32, in which they invite speakers
79.32,81.22, from the two major political parties.
81.68,83.12, Note that Italy has implemented
83.12,84.36, a fairness doctrine recently
84.36,90.94, and partisanship in the media landscape has significantly decreased. The second part of
90.94,95.62," our model is that broadcasters that do not comply will face a range of repercussions,"
95.62,101.02, ranging from a warning or a fine to even losing your permit in cases of repeated grave offenses.
101.5,105.58," To avoid repercussions, we believe that broadcasters will want to comply."
105.98,110.74, The last part of our model is that the fairness doctrine extends to all broadcast media. So this
110.74,116.84," includes television, radio, YouTube, podcasts, but even on social media, such as the BBC on Instagram"
116.84,121.96," or the New York Times on Facebook. Okay, three points of framing I want to push before we get"
121.96,128.28," into our substantive. Firstly, note that the Fairness Doctrine is merely an extension of existing broadcast regulation."
128.66,134.6," So for instance, we already have regulations on defamation, which are implemented so that the public is properly informed."
135.12,139.84," Secondly, for some audiences, it may take some time to get used to both sides journalism."
140.28,151.28," However, we think that in the long run, a fairness doctrine will become the new normal. So in other words, in our world, audiences will accept both sides journalism because they will be less polarized to begin with."
151.42,155.58, But the third point of our framing is that people are not born with extreme opinions.
155.88,166.72," We tell you they are socialized into them. Strong beliefs are shaped to a big degree by the media, which constantly reaffirms your tendencies to radicalize okay moving on to"
166.72,172.96, our substantive on why we think the fairness doctrine can combat polarization firstly why
172.96,177.68, do we think that the media tends towards polarization without government regulation
177.68,184.4, we tell you three reasons firstly to draw people's attention in the digital age information is
184.4,185.52, extremely saturated.
186.02,190.74," What this means is that there are constant grabs for your attention, whether that is in social media or the news."
191.02,197.08," And to grab your attention, broadcast media have to report in a polarizing way because that is what people are drawn to."
197.08,208.0," We like drama. We like controversy. The second reason as to why you naturally polarization is because of competition in the digital age, the number of broadcasters has exploded."
208.0,213.0, This means that broadcasters face increasingly intense competition to beat that competition.
213.0,218.0, They start using toxic reporting strategies during the start of the pandemic in India.
218.0,225.16, We had a lot of Islamophobic voices in the media that continuously promoted conspiracy theories that Muslims were intentionally spreading COVID.
230.24,236.02," Thus, you see that competition creates a race to the bottom, where broadcasters increasingly turn to inflammatory reporting. The third reason is because of a self-reinforcing cycle. Note that"
236.02,241.02," once the media polarizes its audience, the audience will in turn demand more polarizing"
241.02,245.16," coverage. So this looks like in Mexico, where opposition voters consume media"
245.16,249.14," that tells them what they want to hear, namely that the current president is deliberately trying"
249.14,253.66, to tear down Mexican society and undermine their economy. Note that this only makes them more
253.66,259.76, certain in their beliefs. What this all proves is that polarization is inherent to an unregulated
259.76,265.88," media landscape. That is why we see it all over the globe. Before I move on, I'll take a POI."
266.78,273.14, Note how those people who engage in conspiracy theory sort of thinking already have predisposed
273.14,277.34," notions about the state and its involvement through theories like the Deep State, QAnon,"
277.34,283.16, etc. How do you address this issue while you're furthering state involvement in how information
283.16,285.38, is being decimated to such people.
289.96,295.46," Okay, later on my speech, I'm also going to analyze to you why on opposition side of the house, you're more likely to have people go to unreliable sources such as 4chan, such as,"
295.52,300.24," for instance, Twitter. Okay, moving on. Why do we think that a polarizing media landscape is"
300.24,305.68, detrimental to society? We tell you characterize a characteristic of polarizing media
305.68,311.28, is that all political opponents are framed as the explicit enemy this harms political discussion in
311.28,316.48, three ways firstly through increased hostility because hostile behaviors become legitimate when
316.48,321.44, you think of the other side as evil this looks like protesters abusing those visiting abortion
321.44,329.8, clinics in poland secondly we tell you this creates a political gridlock because legislators of different parties are unwilling to cooperate because you see the
329.8,334.86, other side as the enemy. This occurs even when there is substantive overlap in their viewpoints.
335.08,339.8," This looks like Republicans blocking a democratic bill to subsidize baby formula, even though"
339.8,345.36, previously they proposed the exact same policy. The last part of this is democratic backsliding.
345.84,349.56, The reason that democracies survive is not because there are legal processes that make
349.56,350.88, authoritarian moves impossible.
351.56,354.22," Rather, it is because we have soft democratic norms that are respected."
354.58,358.0," For instance, you accept election results or you don't engage in gerrymandering."
358.4,362.3," Note that when the other side is the enemy, you're far more likely to break these norms."
362.3,369.48," This looks like Republicans refusing to let Democrats appoint Supreme Court justices, for instance. What is the comparative then? We tell you,"
369.6,373.96," implementing a fairness doctrine decreases polarization in three ways. Firstly, through"
373.96,378.26," normalization. When you get more exposure to the other side, you're more likely to accept that view"
378.26,384.1," as normal. So in the 2022 study, Fox News viewers were paid to watch CNN. And after this experiment,"
386.24,390.56," their stance of political issues changed. For example, many participants started to believe that Fox News actually"
390.56,396.28, concealed negative information about Donald Trump. The second way in how the fairness doctrine can
396.28,401.24," change things is through moderation. As explained, the fairness doctrine requires broadcasters to"
401.24,408.76, give a platform to viewpoints of the other side. We don't think broadcasters will want to give a voice to threatening viewpoints. So what's more likely
408.76,413.24," to happen is they will invite moderates. So for example, rather than Fox News constantly pointing"
413.24,417.98," to a far left politician like AOC as a representative of the Democratic Party, they're"
417.98,422.28," more likely to invite someone like Joe Manchin, who is far more restrained. The third way in which"
422.28,429.32, we change things is through humanization. We tell you speakers are more likely to emphasize commonalities when they know their audience
429.32,433.4, is less respective to their ideas. So if you're going on Fox News and you know that people
433.4,436.78," are probably going to be very apprehensive to what you're what you have to say, you're"
436.78,440.96, more likely to try to convince them by finding things you have in common. The impact of this
440.96,445.52," is as follows. Firstly, those only far in the spectrum are more likely to moderate their opinion."
445.84,450.46," But secondly, even if they don't moderate their opinion, they will moderate their view of the other side."
450.6,455.44," Because when you have seen their humanity, when you've heard their explanations, even though you disagree with their conclusions,"
455.76,459.42," at least you see them as human, as having pure, not evil motives."
459.92,462.86, Note that a decrease in polarization has an additional benefit.
463.16,467.64," You decrease consumption of untrustworthy media like Twitter, Breitbart, and 4chan."
467.8,470.6," This is a direct response to the POI, and this is for two reasons."
470.92,477.22," Firstly, because polarized traditional media are a gateway into untrustworthy media sources."
477.22,490.02," So in other words, the jump between Fox News and Breitbart is smaller when Fox News reporting is blatantly unfair, when you hold these strongly biased and dehumanized views of all Democrats, you're more likely to believe in QAnon,"
490.24,494.32, a conspiracy theory that states that a group of pedophiles is conspiring against Donald Trump.
494.62,498.9, The second reason why you have more consumption of untrustworthy media on their side is that you
498.9,503.86," become polarized by the media, so you demand more extreme content to fill that artificial desire."
504.08,505.0," We tell you all along,"
505.2,509.3, we're able to break that cycle. We're able to create an audience that is less polarized. I am
509.3,524.14," so proud to propose. I'd like to thank the first proposition speaker for that speech,"
524.14,528.46, and now to begin the case for the opposition welcome the O1.
528.46,528.88, Yeah.
535.68,556.64," Okay, I'd like my POIs audibly, and I'll begin in a few seconds. Panel, platforming homophobes, fascists, and casual racists will not suddenly"
556.64,562.52, rid them or the nation of bigotry. It will only legitimize their existence. Show them on the big
562.52,571.52," screen and you encourage thousands of others to think that their views are justified. No panel, no to fascism, no to bigotry, very proud to oppose."
571.86,576.4," Three arguments on our case. Firstly, why does the fairness doctrine reduce accountability on"
576.4,581.02," media platforms? Second, how does the fairness doctrine induce radicalization? And third,"
581.26,588.02," how are minorities left out from the public debate? But first of all, four points of framing before I move in into rebuttal and the arguments."
588.38,592.92," First, we posit that since radical ideology is diametrically opposed to centrist narratives,"
593.18,596.98, attacking them with centrist ideas and facts will not make them change.
597.3,600.74," Second, insofar as bad media outlets exist on both sides of the house,"
600.98,605.82, we prefer a few large legacy media channels which are moderately self-regulating
605.82,610.8," rather than a bunch of small news entities which have no incentives for accountability. Third,"
611.02,615.48, this debate therefore orbits around people who are undecided or willing to change their political
615.48,620.08, preferences and ideological alignment. This looks like a working-class mother seeking higher
620.08,624.52, child care subsidies having to decide between a progressive party and a conservative counterpart.
624.96,629.2, Both parties share the same goal of increased maternity support right but extracted from two
629.2,633.52, different world views and having her priority met the mother is willing to make an informed
633.52,638.72, decision on who represents her best and fourthly we think that polarization is inevitable and we're
638.72,643.28, actually happy to support the fact that under increased partisan friction news outlets of
643.28,649.36, different political stances keep each other accountable. We ultimately stand for the status quo. But now a couple of
649.36,654.22," points of rebuttal, firstly on feasibility, secondly on practical. Firstly, let's characterize"
654.22,658.66," how broadcasting news actually works. They were very shallow on this panel. Panel, they say that"
658.66,663.82," polarization is the biggest issue in society, but notice how polarization comes from the mistrust of"
663.82,665.32, the government. Think of the massive
665.32,669.22," lack of trust in states' coverage of the coronavirus, and especially the lack of trust in"
669.22,674.22," governmental narratives and fact-checkers. This pushes people to be anti-establishment and to,"
674.26,678.3," like, be on the outskirts of society. And, like, we don't understand on their side of the house,"
678.4,683.36," who decides what is fair, right? Parties change. We don't understand how having more government"
683.36,686.18, intervention into media is good for polarization.
686.6,691.8, We think it makes people more radical. Right. And they never even answered our POI on the deep in state involvement.
691.8,697.14, It is clear to us that they have no explanation for why people do not become more polarized on their side of the house.
697.36,702.4," But secondly, in any other state that's not the U.S. and pluralist democracy with multiple parties,"
702.66,709.36, the fairness doctrine would mean representing like views of seven party representatives like their own example in italy right not
709.36,714.56, to like in the us we posit broadcasters will have to change their whole air time for this right
714.56,718.72, even if debates can actually happen on their side of the house and proposition will explain all of
718.72,724.0, the unanalyzed issues on their side we tell you that their world's reporting is going to be biased
724.0,729.8, like a biased fox news reporter asking guest provocative bias questions would sway the answers to a certain
729.8,734.82, side rather than actually informing viewers about the issue objectively. But they also have agency
734.82,739.2, to choose what kind of guests they want to invite. They will not choose the most radical leftists.
739.38,743.76," They will choose Democrats that vote Republican. In the Senate, like Joe Manchin, they literally"
743.76,745.34, concede with us that
745.34,750.32, their fairness will be some tokenistic view of objectivity Fox News on their side will look like
750.32,755.84, two right-wing people instead of one we see no impact right but they're also their whole analysis
755.84,761.48, like stems on the idea that people will actually watch these news we think that debates are boring
761.48,769.08," people need something sensational and they only get that on our side of the house, right? So now moving into the first argument, why does the fairness doctrine reduce"
769.08,774.0, accountability of media platforms? The thesis is paneled that by allowing all views to actually be
774.0,780.0," debated, broadcasters make viewers more confused and less likely to call out bigoted ideas."
780.16,784.16, It is fair for us to presume that the fairness doctrine seeks to educate viewers to make the
784.16,785.16, most informed decisions.
785.44,788.18, So let's analyze why it does the opposite on their side of the house.
788.4,796.08," We tell you that the Fairness Doctrine establishes that all angles can be true, meaning news channels can no longer ridicule one side for being blatantly false."
796.32,799.48," With this, two mechanisms how illiberal views get more legitimization."
799.84,811.04," Firstly, legitimization via normalization. There's a positive societal censorship and pressure against platforming transphobic people like JK Rowling or the anti-Semitism of Mel Gibson, right?"
811.18,825.88," What happens under proposition is that these news media are literally legally mandated to give these people an outlet and thus expose the victims to more abuse while encouraging the spread of these ideas. But secondly, legitimization via the perception of infallibility. Undertaking the most"
825.88,830.76," charitable characterization of the average news viewer for proposition, that is one that retains"
830.76,836.56," a perfect attention span during a fair but lengthy political debate and is unbiased, we posit that"
836.56,841.26, they're far more likely to accept and retain conservative ideas under proposition. This is
841.26,849.2, because Fox has vast incentives to fulfill the Fairness Doctrine by inviting Republicans and pseudo-Republicans like Manchin to debate political issues.
849.2,854.56," This is bad, as the Fairness Doctrine transforms news media outlets into marketplaces of ideas."
854.56,859.44," This ultimately means that under proposition, the unbiased and engaged viewer concludes that"
859.44,864.48, climate change is unnecessary upon listening to two right-leaning opponents thinking that they've
864.48,874.0," heard it all they need. Under our side of the house, that same viewers knows that what they saw was a news broadcast from a singular source and is motivated to actually investigate"
874.0,888.2," why climate change might actually be needed. Before moving into second, I can take that point. go polar look you say polarization may be somewhat natural but don't you think the media at least"
888.2,891.82, plays some role in enhancing the level of polarization where you can't even have proper
891.82,897.36, discussion yeah i already talked about this in like the first minute of my speech panel we think
897.36,902.46, that polarization comes from the involvement of the government in the media from controlling the
902.46,909.52, media it makes people mistrust the government and the media and makes society polarized that doesn't happen on our side of the house we support the
909.52,914.24, status quo moving into the second argument how does the fairness doctrine induce radicalization
914.24,918.48, the thesis is that radicalism often believes anti-state narratives and therefore introducing
918.48,924.16, more state control will only perpetuate the cycle i'll explain this to a proposition very clearly
924.16,925.28, right let's characterize
925.28,929.76, radical beliefs they see any regulations in state body interference as like hugely limiting
929.76,934.42, i already talked about this in my rebuttal right but they also have differing ideas from like the
934.42,938.8, mainstream which essentially ensures that they only consume media that caters to them think of
938.8,943.3, like right-wing leaning far-right voters still watching things uh things like le piguette in
943.3,945.28, france or reading the sun in the uk
945.28,950.16, right so what happens to these people under proposition first as it's likely that previously
950.16,955.76, your favorite channel like fox like newsmax like oan no longer portrays your ideas panel you feel
955.76,960.8, fundamentally isolated and second since these people are already paranoid about state propaganda
960.8,965.38, and like brainwashing they're unlikely to even turn on any type of broadcaster
965.38,970.28, that is state approved. This leads to you searching for more radical alternative news
970.28,974.72, that further entrench you in the process of radicalization. Think of alternative for
974.72,980.16," Deutschland, supporters in Germany, turning to online forums like Heise or unregulated sites"
980.16,985.04, like the Telegram when the idea of fact-check checking was actually firstly introduced in the Reichstag
985.04,989.76, right the comparative difference on both sides of the house is that firstly media with significant
989.76,994.48, audience reach still has to like stay based and appear rational on our site and that is the reason
994.48,999.52, why the sun in the UK doesn't call for direct violence against Muslims second we will be the
999.52,1004.0, first to concede that Fox News does run some controversial and occasionally pretty harmful
1004.0,1005.28, content but it is still
1005.28,1010.56, incentivized to appeal to the general conservative population and especially attract young voters
1010.56,1015.52, think of fox news hosts like lesbian tommy bruce or brian lenis a latino lgbt activist hosting
1015.52,1020.8, their news segments proposition we see this as tokenism but we posit it has a net net benefit
1020.8,1025.28," right as fox news exists as the radicals or radical leanings continue to watch it,"
1025.48,1030.28," they're slowly being de-radicalized and de-bigoted. Look, we're not claiming that right-wingers will"
1030.28,1034.68," be like all loving and progressive, but the comparative is very simple, panel. On our side,"
1034.82,1040.06," sure, they may support the baker not making a gay couple a wedding cake, but they no longer support"
1040.06,1045.06," just burning gay people on stakes. And for all these reasons, they're proud to oppose."
1052.06,1054.54, I thank the O1 for that speech.
1054.74,1056.3," Now to continue the prop case,"
1056.44,1058.2," welcome the second prop speaker, Hehe."
1062.84,1063.98," Hi, am I audible?"
1064.92,1065.1," Yes, all is good. Great. Hi, am I audible?"
1065.92,1066.8," Yes, all is good."
1070.34,1071.06," Great. I would like POIs in the chat, please."
1073.24,1076.98," Without further ado, I will start my speech."
1080.86,1081.4," Tanul, why do people become conspiracy theorists in the first place?"
1089.8,1094.86," You become a conspiracy theorist and radicalize the far right or the far left or whatever, the moment in time which gets so ingrained in a one certain way of thinking about things that you lose touch with reality. So for instance, when you only watch Fox News and"
1094.86,1098.28," you get to the point where you believe that the election was stolen, that the Democrats are"
1098.28,1101.72," conspiring to kill babies and those kinds of things, there's not too much of a logical leap"
1101.72,1105.6, to believe that Democrats are all Satan worshipping.
1105.6,1110.16," The difference is, on ours or the House, we force people to be confronted with different perspectives."
1110.16,1115.36," So even if they don't change their mind, the likelihood of them radicalising further away"
1115.36,1120.56," from the centre is diminished, purely because they have that outside perspective"
1120.56,1124.48," and they don't get too certain in their own viewpoint. So even at our worst, in which"
1124.48,1127.76, opposition can prove to you that people who are already quite radicalized become even more
1127.76,1133.04, radicalized i think that's such a small portion of the the population and because we make sure
1133.04,1136.88, that there are more people who are unable to do so we win this debate on that a couple of things in
1136.88,1140.8, the speech then firstly i'm going to above the argument which kept from opposition about
1140.8,1149.6, legitimization and radicalization then i'm going to explain why our arguments will stand and why they outweigh opposition in this debate firstly in terms of legitimization three
1150.16,1155.76, three things here firstly they tell you that extreme views are no uh or are normalized the
1155.76,1161.52, problem here is that this is true to an extent but the problem here is that like oftentimes
1161.52,1168.0, cnn and the bbc will already talk about conspiracy theories.
1168.0,1174.0, Things like no QS and oftentimes stories about these because
1174.0,1179.0," Secondly, they talk about radicalization. Two responses here."
1179.0,1184.0," Firstly, they say that individuals won't watch mainstream news because they become distrustful of the government."
1184.0,1188.46," Two things here. Firstly, if this is already true, then that's no difference."
1188.7,1197.54," So, for instance, if I'm already distrustful of the establishment, then I'm also unlikely to want to watch any kind of mainstream news because I would see this as part of the establishment."
1197.54,1201.2, I don't think there are many QAnon people who are very deep in Fox News.
1201.5,1205.54," Oftentimes, QAnoners and far-right conspiracy theorists are also distrustful of Fox News."
1205.78,1207.62, This is why so many people moved away from Fox News
1207.62,1210.2, after they disapproved of January 6th.
1210.3,1212.5," But secondly, we argue from first"
1212.5,1214.74, that platforms like Fox News are a gateway
1214.74,1217.38, to further and further right news sources.
1217.62,1219.0," Since they did not contest this,"
1219.08,1221.02, we think this claim already doesn't stand.
1221.32,1223.16," But thirdly, if this is not about people"
1223.16,1224.34," who are already radicalized,"
1224.52,1228.08, but rather about normal people who don't like government intervention we think there are two reasons
1228.08,1233.12, as to why they're unlikely to move further away firstly because these sources are generally quite
1233.12,1240.8, reputable to the average voter the BBC is broadly trusted to some extent by the vast majority of
1240.8,1245.04, especially moderate British people but secondly these are also the sources which
1245.04,1249.26," are most accessible. When you Google something online, the first sources that you'll see will"
1249.26,1254.04, be from the most reputable news sources. These stories will be the ones which people around you
1254.04,1260.36," will be talking about. But lastly, even if people further radicalise, we think overall we create a"
1260.36,1264.96, healthier and more functional democracy. Why? Because if the 5% of people who are currently
1264.96,1268.46," very far down the rabbit hole are incredibly conspiracy theorists, even farther"
1268.46,1273.62," away, that's fine if at least 50% of the population moves closer to the center, but we don't let as"
1273.62,1277.44," much political grid look as we do in the status quo, where the Republicans and the Democrats are"
1277.44,1281.56," unwilling to concede on absolutely anything. Before I move on, I'll take a POI."
1282.58,1286.72," Look, the comparative of this debate is the point at which you create more radical people"
1286.72,1290.82, is the point at which you justify literal hate crimes like you see against Muslim people
1290.82,1294.04, in Germany or like white supremacy in the United States.
1294.26,1294.68, Please engage.
1295.38,1298.58," Okay, I'm going to explain now in terms of our own case,"
1298.66,1300.94, why people further polarize on the opposition side of the house.
1301.3,1308.02," So basically, we say that there are three reasons why individuals are less polarised at Marseille House. Firstly, because of normalisation. And the opposition is"
1308.02,1311.3, going to say that we rebutted their mechanism about normalisation earlier. But here's the
1311.3,1316.72," difference. Fox News doesn't oftentimes talk about the actual viewpoints of Democrats,"
1317.0,1324.3," whereas CNN and the BBC oftentimes do stories on, for instance, the way that QAnon or anti-vaxxers"
1324.3,1325.82," think. Oftentimes, that's the most"
1325.82,1329.88, sensationalist kind of news. However Fox News and CNN for instance are unwilling to show the
1329.88,1334.26, reasonable side of each other's stories because there there's a greater level of fear that your
1334.26,1337.78, audience will find they're a part of that reasonable so they'll go away from your own
1337.78,1343.28, ideological stance. So that's why we get more normalization on our house when it comes to the
1343.28,1345.08, other side of the aisle.
1347.76,1347.88," Secondly, we talk about moderation. So here they give a response."
1353.48,1353.84," They say it's a bad thing when, for instance, Joe Manchin goes on these channels because Joe Manchin will agree with anything, everything we say."
1360.54,1367.26," Firstly, this is not true. So if Joe Manchin agrees with Fox News or whichever host Fox News invites on climate change, there's not really a discussion and it's not really a fair discussion. Because as our first speaker explains, what the fairness doctrine then means is that controversial big"
1367.26,1371.4, issues within society must be debated from the major perspectives which exist within society.
1371.7,1375.4, So if Joe Manchin and whoever you'd be debating against on Fox News would both agree that climate
1375.4,1380.02," change isn't a problem, then that would be an unfair representation of the discussion around"
1380.02,1390.08," climate change, for instance. What we mean with moderation is that oftentimes platforms like fox news will talk about to democrats as if they're all like aoc or bernie sanders or the most"
1390.08,1394.24, far left the democrats will ever go even sometimes they'll even pretend that they're even farther
1394.24,1398.32, left they'll talk about like the democrats being literally like communists and stuff like that but
1398.32,1403.36, the problem then is that they can't really do this when you have the fairness doctrine i think logic
1403.36,1409.28," behind that's fairly simple because there's a, because there's a greater risk that AOC or Bernie Sanders will sound reasonable to the"
1409.28,1414.76," average Republican voter, with the same amount of chances with moderates. But the danger then is,"
1414.84,1419.08," is if your starting point is here, if you find yourself agreeing with someone who's way farther"
1419.08,1422.88," away, then the middle point will be farther away than if you find someone who's already kind of at"
1422.88,1428.32, that point. Then you'll be less weighted to the other side thirdly and lastly we talk about
1428.32,1432.94, humanization about the degree to which you can see other people as actual people instead of like
1432.94,1436.68, thinking that all the democrats are like satans and stuff like that what do they say here they
1436.68,1440.98, say a couple of things firstly they say that polarization comes from lack of trust in the
1440.98,1449.36, government and people become more polarized when the government intervenes in media i've already contested this claim in my rebuttal but even in our worst case scenario which
1449.36,1454.0, people do for a time move away i think over time people are going to come back as this becomes the
1454.0,1457.92, new norm in which everyone who watches the the mainstream media will get used to this so
1457.92,1465.52," individuals will no longer find this as a governmental over overreach. Before I continue, I'd be happy to take a POI."
1471.94,1476.68," Notice insofar, why would anyone who has severe distrust of the social system that thinks that state is literally out to get them would ever confide back to the system which fundamentally"
1476.68,1480.76, they believe is controlling their every thought and their ideas?
1480.76,1489.6," For the people that are this extreme, like how many of them are watching mainstream news anyways like surely they're already watching news which is about as far right as them to"
1489.6,1495.36, confirm their their own viewpoints platforms like oan or 4chan or whatever secondly they say that
1495.36,1499.12, the news is going to be super biased anyways in the questions and things like that that they ask
1499.12,1503.2, firstly i don't think this is true i think that the moment in which you ask biased questions or
1503.2,1509.28, you invite or invite guests you clearly clearly do not represent a certain important point on a topic then that's the moment
1509.28,1513.28, in time which the fairness doctrine comes into play and when the accountability mechanism for
1513.28,1517.76, that coming we say that the media is likely to are on the side of caution so even if it's unlikely
1517.76,1521.28, that you will be that you will be stopped for the fairness doctrine media will do so anyways
1521.28,1524.88, why because getting your broadcast license stripped is such an incredibly huge harm to your
1524.88,1525.2, business like you literally can no longer operate that even if it would be more beneficial if you and media will do so anyways. Why? Because getting your broadcast license stripped is such an incredibly huge harm to your business.
1525.28,1526.7, Like you literally can no longer operate.
1526.92,1528.26, That even if it would be more beneficial
1528.26,1529.52, if you could be biased
1529.52,1530.9," and there's a low chance that you could be caught,"
1531.02,1533.1, you're going to want to err on the side of caution
1533.1,1535.0, because otherwise you would lose everything.
1535.66,1537.44," Lastly, they say that people don't like debates."
1537.5,1538.84, So no one would want to watch this.
1539.28,1541.0," Firstly, I don't think that's true."
1541.36,1542.88," If anything, I think that oftentimes debates"
1542.88,1545.04," are more sensationalist than like boring news items. But secondly, I don't think all people true. If anything, I think that oftentimes debates are more sensationalist than like boring news items."
1545.34,1548.74," But secondly, I don't think all people watch news to be sensationalist."
1548.86,1551.6," I think the news, which is most sensationalist, tends to get the most views."
1551.82,1555.64, But oftentimes people want to watch the news for reasons which aren't specifically about sensationalism.
1555.94,1560.1, People want to feel informed and people want to feel like they have a diverse view of society.
1560.1,1563.74," So overall, we find it unlikely that people are going to switch off the media."
1564.08,1568.56, And even if people who are already far right will go even further right we find it more important that the average
1568.56,1573.52, person becomes less polarized that we can get more done politically and people people feel
1573.52,1575.2, less hatred towards each other vote prop
1582.64,1588.86, i thank the prop second for that speech and now to continue the case on opposition welcome
1588.86,1590.76, the op second.
1590.76,1601.6, Yeah hello hi I do POIs audibly so if you want to unmute yourself say point something
1601.6,1602.6, like this.
1602.6,1608.64, It's the best. unmute yourself say point something like this it's best
1631.12,1653.1," yes Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll start my speech in 321 at the point at which the proposition fails to analyze"
1653.1,1657.86," and actually impact into this debate, what is the crucial harm of polarization within"
1657.86,1663.16, society when we claim that it's a natural process of the political change that occurs
1663.16,1665.5," within society is a natural process of having disagreement, it is the natural process of the political change that occurs within society, is a natural process"
1665.5,1674.02," of having disagreement, it is the natural process of the society being kept in check"
1674.02,1679.14, as for the views that they hold near and dear to their hearts. Because they have never proven
1679.14,1683.78," those harms and basically their entire case hinge on the increase of polarization, we"
1683.78,1685.04, believe that we have already
1685.04,1686.92, outframed and won this debate.
1686.92,1692.3," I'm incredibly proud to stand side opposition in my speech, I'll have a few points of reputation"
1692.3,1696.18, and move on to a further argument about how minorities are left out from the public debate
1696.18,1700.68, and how it is also a crucial agent within this debate that must be analyzed by side
1700.68,1701.68, proposition.
1701.68,1705.84," Okay, let me first of all get into the idea of, you know, people who people"
1705.84,1712.24," getting actually fully informed on their side of the house, getting the best information possible,"
1712.24,1718.38," and all of these sorts of ideas. First of all, I believe that this necessarily clashes with their"
1718.38,1723.5," own characterization of how people engage with news media in the first place, and what they"
1723.5,1727.88, actually want to see when they themselves bring up the ideas of news
1727.88,1729.6," having needing to be shocking,"
1729.6,1732.28, needing to be dramatized and all of these points.
1732.28,1734.58, But then at the point at which you introduce
1734.58,1737.12, a sort of like political show debate
1737.12,1740.56," into every single news segment that you must have,"
1740.56,1742.88," into every single topic that you discuss,"
1742.88,1749.76," but then what is most likely to happen, the news channels are going to get the most viewer attention rates the the shows which are going to"
1749.76,1754.72, be most successful and we want to do all of these things are actually the ones who are going to have
1754.72,1760.56, the shocking debates with insults and screams right the the this is why the people why people
1760.56,1770.24, actually found like people uh uh individuals such as no donald trump appealing right because of the sort of shocking debate nature that he had or the p or people like jordan
1770.24,1775.6, peterson like under the status quo as well right but then you that this characterization innately
1775.6,1780.8, clashes because i don't understand why like debate is necessarily going to get us to the right
1780.8,1788.66," conclusion i believe that it's far more likely to be like a sport like we are having right now, you know, in which there are people who are sort of trying"
1788.66,1795.02," to enjoy it, trying to judge it, trying to know to, to, to, to, to, to analyze it and"
1795.02,1799.4," whatnot, right? This often happens. Then the idea, you know, they say like, then also they,"
1799.4,1804.76, they never like completely deal with the ideas that still news channels are going to have
1804.76,1805.52, the ability and
1805.52,1811.12, the freedom to manipulate because of how they can like you know invite the guests that are supposed
1811.12,1815.76, to be representative right which is going to be far more misleading on their side of the house
1815.76,1820.8, when you keep inviting joe manchin on fox news as the representative democrat right because under
1820.8,1827.08," our side of the house and what is crucial about the status quo is that when the vast majority of people watch Fox News,"
1827.08,1830.52," they know, ah, yes, it's the Republican TV channel. Right."
1830.52,1835.06," When you watch CNN, they know, ah, yes, it's that it's the Democrat TV channel."
1835.06,1838.72, Right. This is like the this is what people mostly understand. Right.
1838.72,1846.74," So, you know, you know why how the information is biased, you know whether or not you can actually engage"
1846.74,1853.5," with this on a fruitful level, and that's the vast majority of voters, that's how they"
1853.5,1854.5, act.
1854.5,1862.68, Then let's talk about the idea of radicalism and people who are being radicalized.
1862.68,1865.44, Proposition brings this idea that now people are going to be forced
1865.44,1871.28, to be confronted with the views that they don't like. We're telling you that this is also already
1871.28,1877.12, a clashing characterization because they are being forced to watch those views by the state which
1877.12,1884.0, they have already been primed to mistrust by areas such as Fox News itself and itself. Let's look at
1884.0,1886.66," the example that the second opposition speaker,"
1886.74,1887.92, proposition speaker actually brought.
1888.12,1890.36," He said after the January 6th attacks,"
1890.64,1892.7, the people walked away from Fox News
1892.7,1894.26, when Fox News condemned it.
1894.38,1895.52, This is exactly the point.
1895.6,1897.5, This is what the fairness doctrine would do.
1897.5,1900.56, It would actually like force Fox News
1900.56,1902.26," to condemn the January 6th riots,"
1902.38,1904.42," which means that people tend to,"
1904.6,1906.18, then will walk away from
1906.18,1910.94," this show, will look for other news sources, right? This is exactly the point when they prove our"
1910.94,1916.04, mechanisms of people actually going into other sources. And what is the crucial harm of this?
1916.22,1920.52," Because the people are most likely to move to sites like Reddit, sites like 4chan, they're"
1920.52,1924.7," likely to go to YouTube, they're likely to go, you know, to those sites which already conform to"
1924.7,1925.0," their biases. They're likely, you know, to go with likely to go to those sites which already conform to their biases."
1925.0,1934.0," They're likely to go with the Fox News anchor who also leaves the Fox News channel when it implements the fairness doctrine, because that's no state censorship."
1934.0,1937.0, It's likely that new news shows would be established like this.
1937.0,1945.72," And we're telling you at this point, these are the spaces when the self-organization and the recruitment into radical groups happens. This is"
1945.72,1950.54, the place where people actually actively turn violent. This is the place where people actually
1950.54,1955.96," commit terrorist acts at the end of the day, when they're being drawn into these wormholes,"
1956.24,1961.18," and etc. At the point at which you're still able to be conformed to your biases on Fox News,"
1961.34,1968.5," which still has to be relatively moderate, at the point at which it wants to appeal to a major conservative audience and wants to attract new voters,"
1968.5,1969.5, right?
1969.5,1973.38, But telling you is a point at which we have far less violent people on our side of the
1973.38,1975.72," house, right?"
1975.72,1982.32," And then also on the point, which I now forgot, on the getting the correct information."
1982.32,1986.34, It often takes like 10 minutes to refute a 10 second
1986.34,1990.18," lie. I think we all know this, like even from debate experience, you know, how hard it is to"
1990.18,1994.76," engage with the other team when they are saying bullcrap, you know, but then the idea here is"
1994.76,2000.46," that you are never actually able to actively engage, you know, on those news shows on a fully"
2000.46,2005.2, fruitful level at the point at which those shocking and uh uh things are happening i can take
2005.2,2010.88, the point for water for the argument in the status quo as a democrat that goes on cnn you know that
2010.88,2014.88, your audience already agrees with you but when you go on fox news don't you think you have an
2014.88,2021.04, incentive to try to convince other people okay no i don't think that like no okay joe manchin wouldn't
2021.04,2025.1," have that incentive fox news would never have the incentive to invite such a person, right?"
2025.3,2029.86," And even when this is happening, we're telling you it's far less likely to happen,"
2030.2,2036.14," even when it's put in a discussion format, when both views are sort of being held in equal regard."
2036.44,2039.98," Now, let's look at how media covers realistically in the majority of cases."
2040.28,2043.66," Major broadcasting channels provide fast, easily consumable news."
2043.88,2048.12," This looks like in 15 minutes, they have four reporters providing news on like 10 topics."
2048.36,2054.76," We're telling you that objectively covering more sides of the same issue means that more time needs to be spent on each of them,"
2055.04,2062.14, meaning that time now has to be relocated and the news channels will have to prioritize certain issues over others
2062.14,2069.02, because they don't have the same capacity to report on everything. The issues prioritized will most likely be mainstream news that are relevant for
2069.02,2073.74, the majority of people and the minority issues are more likely to be left out due to time constraints.
2074.1,2079.5," Further on, people who actually engage in social activism, who work for the welfare of other people"
2079.5,2090.94," and like notice who this will also engage with their POI directly, are unlikely to want to debate about their activity. Most serious activists will go on to debate the notion whether Black lives actually"
2090.94,2095.94," matter, whether trans people deserve to be seen as people, whether refugees should be let in."
2095.94,2101.2," They wouldn't warrant such topics as worthy of discussion. Far more likely, the news agencies"
2101.2,2109.34," who just have quotas to fill under the fairness doctrine to check that all the views are fairly represented will invite those who are willing to speak,"
2109.34,2113.62, likely to be either people who aren't actually engaged in social causes or opportunists who
2113.62,2116.76, want to abuse the chance of getting a platform.
2116.76,2121.82," Comparatively, our site still allows for the existence of long in-depth interviews with,"
2121.82,2125.28, say like a social worker who helps refugees go through the legal
2125.28,2130.74, process and actually explains what it's like without any need for scrutiny from a nationalist
2130.74,2147.8, who wants to keep the borders closed we're closed for all these reasons uh uh votes team opposition I thank the opposition second.
2148.2,2150.46," Now to conclude this substantive portion of prop,"
2150.78,2152.54," welcome VP3, Yaya."
2156.12,2157.04, Thank you.
2158.96,2161.16," Meanwhile, in the chat, please,"
2161.26,2162.98," and if I haven't taken one by six minutes,"
2163.08,2176.88, you can make them audibly
2181.2,2186.1, how the status quo is one in which people have literally stormed the capital.
2186.1,2190.48," It is one in which new governments overturn past policies from other ones, not because"
2190.48,2195.44," they were bad, but in order to differentiate themselves from them because they are the"
2195.44,2196.44, enemy.
2196.44,2200.2," Do not let side opposition get away by saying the status quo is not bad enough, because"
2200.2,2201.2, it is.
2201.2,2214.18," It is terrible, something needs to change, very proud to propose. In a speech, very quickly on a minority argument, then on their arguments on more radicalization and how this reduces accountability."
2214.84,2217.94, And then on how we combat polarization and the final way off.
2218.16,2220.3," So firstly, quickly on our minority arguments."
2220.94,2225.36," OK, they tell us the time has to be really relocated and therefore minority news"
2225.36,2230.4, will be cut firstly panel i think it will not because many things with minorities also also
2230.4,2235.36, affect the general public so for example when bln strikes that is relevant for everyone because that
2235.36,2240.24, is something that is for example going on in your city but secondly even even if that would not be
2240.24,2244.24, the case i also do not think that would be the case on the comparative because i think the group
2244.24,2248.24, that will not know about minorities will not know about them either shy because of
2248.24,2252.0," the speech we generally just see in the world. If anything, we have more representation for"
2252.0,2256.96," minorities because when we do report on them, we have to show both sides of the issue. Now,"
2256.96,2260.88, let's get into the more important stuff in this debate than the one minute argument outside
2260.88,2270.24, opposition. What have they told us? They firstly brought us an argument on how we read reduce accountability they basically told us that shows will only invite your right-wing people
2270.24,2274.64, for example and that's with that you create a sense of legitimacy because the fairness doctrine
2274.64,2281.04, is still there panel firstly no why will this not happen note that we set up a model in which news
2281.04,2285.04, broadcasts would be penalized at the moment that they do this. They're more likely to
2285.04,2289.6," want to err on the safe side because you're getting penalized too often, you literally can"
2289.6,2294.48," lose your license. That is a huge risk to take, therefore you want to err on the safe side and not"
2294.48,2299.76," invite two Republican speakers. I think that is simply very unlikely. But secondly, note that this"
2299.76,2310.34, is literally an emotion. I think we have some fear to actually have opposition debates that people have to actually represent the other side as well. I think they're just not debating
2310.34,2315.24," the motion with this. You're going to penalize for it. We simply have to fear it. But thirdly,"
2315.24,2319.12," even if that would not be the case, even if it would be the case that you have to write"
2319.12,2325.48," to people and it has a sense of legitimacy, not that there's also a sense of legitimacy in the status quo."
2325.48,2327.92, They tell you that Fox viewers do not know
2327.92,2331.24, that they're getting biased media.
2331.24,2333.08, I think that that is inherently untrue.
2333.08,2335.2," For example, there was this research conducted"
2335.2,2338.16, in which Fox News viewers had to watch CNN
2338.16,2339.56, for an entire month.
2339.56,2341.94," After that month, many of them shifted their views,"
2341.94,2344.84," for example, on the relation with the Democratic Party,"
2344.84,2348.48," with police, for example, showing that they actually did change their views because they"
2348.48,2353.2, were not aware of the bias that fox news had and they did not inform themselves more so i think
2353.2,2359.04, this falls secondly tell us yeah but you normalize more extreme views by talking more about them and
2359.04,2364.8, that that is very bad look panel firstly showing both sides doesn't require you to promote fringe
2364.8,2365.0, viewpoints.
2365.0,2369.0, That's not what this debate is about. So we are talking about pro-vaxxers.
2369.0,2372.0, You don't necessarily have to invite people to think the government is a scam.
2372.0,2376.0," The people that, for example, think the vaccine is scary because it was made so fast."
2376.0,2382.0," But secondly, even if the media, even if it is the case, if the media normally doesn't report this unreliable information,"
2382.0,2385.2, it now has to quite inform viewers that will they will not
2385.2,2388.8, believe these fringe views as they're already quite informed such largely of the parents but
2388.8,2393.92, thirdly even if this is case it's a good thing firstly it provides a good stage for constructive
2393.92,2397.52, discussion in which fringe views can be deconstructed so clearer people are likely to
2397.52,2402.32, believe them secondly media that normally promotes these fringe views also have to invite opposing
2402.32,2407.56," speakers meaning that if you're not able to defend yourself well, you will lose support. Note that the way that people"
2407.56,2412.28, become extremists is not by hearing a fringe view once. It's by getting in an echo chamber
2412.28,2416.76, of that fringe view and hearing very little opposition. We get people out of this echo
2416.76,2421.46, chamber's on-site proposition by letting them hear other views as well. So we do not
2421.46,2425.04," reuse inequality. Argument false. Your second argument, now they have more"
2425.04,2430.4, radicalization. They basically tell us is that people will go to other forms of media. Some
2430.4,2434.88, already gave quite some responses as to why there are reasons for news consumers to still
2435.92,2440.4," continue to with consuming traditional news sources. For example, it's more accessible and"
2440.4,2446.92," reputable, but no, that's also just habit to do so. But secondly, even if consumers do leave, the quality of other sources improves."
2447.12,2450.08," Small websites don't have the resources for their own teams of journalists,"
2450.2,2453.2, so they tend to base their stories on reporting from big broadcasters.
2453.4,2455.28, Since we improve the quality of reporting
2455.48,2458.0," there, these websites will also become less problematic."
2458.2,2460.72," But thirdly, even if consumers leave and they leave"
2460.72,2464.2," the sources that are significantly worse, that is a problem that exists in the short"
2464.2,2467.3, term at best. We explained why the audience becomes less polarized over
2467.3,2471.88, the long term therefore they will not be as offended by balanced news reporting then they
2471.88,2478.16, bring us a point on that people that are anti-establishment will radicalize further firstly i think the
2478.16,2482.16, ferris doctrine is separate of who's in office secondly it works both ways this means that
2482.16,2485.58, you also have to critique for example the office at the moment that they do something bad.
2485.64,2490.66, So I don't believe this. I think you have insufficiently explained how people radicalize further in their societies.
2490.96,2492.6, The case falls. I'll take a PY now.
2493.6,2500.54," On your side, how would a discussion on giving trans people rights look like without platforming a transphobic person?"
2501.02,2511.04," Look, I think at the moment that you platform a transphobic person you put someone actually see actual feelings uh across them i think that is the moment that people are likely to uh to believe the"
2511.04,2515.84, person that is arguing for people's actual rights because you see your face you see their emotions
2515.84,2522.32, you're actually putting a real human being uh across to that okay then now what did we tell
2522.32,2525.36, you on our side of the house we We told you how we found that polarization.
2525.7,2530.34, We gave you three reasons why it is inherent to free media that it is polarizing.
2530.62,2534.24," So the opposition tells us, yeah, but that proves why people want shocking debates."
2534.52,2537.76," Look, the reason why this is the case is because there is a race to the bottom."
2538.16,2540.44, Media constantly needs to compete for people's attention.
2540.72,2544.84, That is terrible because that way media reporting constantly becomes worse and worse.
2545.12,2550.32," We told you why three terrible things happen because of that. Firstly, there's increased hostility"
2550.32,2554.56," because you simply think the other side is the enemy. We told you why there's a political gridlock,"
2554.56,2558.32, why it means that politicians are unwilling to find common ground because they constantly feel
2558.32,2562.72, the need to differentiate themselves from one another. We told you why democratic backsliding
2562.72,2569.92, is easier to happen outside opposition at the moment that this critique is not necessary. That is terrible. We prevent many of these impacts
2569.92,2573.52," actually from happening. Well, at least we make it a lot better at the moment that we give people"
2573.52,2578.56," more viewpoints. Because firstly, it means that you're likely to actually humanize the other side."
2578.56,2583.44," Not that you see their faces, not that you hear the motivations for the viewpoint they have. So"
2583.44,2588.4," for example, the example I earlier gave on people that are anti-vax, I think that"
2588.4,2591.86, they're not necessarily terrible people for being anti-vax at the moment that you're just
2591.86,2596.38," scared, you don't know what is going on, and you think that you might be putting something"
2596.38,2597.76, very scary into your body.
2597.76,2601.74," I think that moment is very important to have the constructive debate, to tell people why"
2601.74,2604.4," they shouldn't have to be scary, why it's all going to be all right."
2604.4,2609.0," I think that is the moment that people grow closer towards each other, the moment that we get a less polarized society,"
2609.0,2615.0," where people are simply nicer to each one another, at the moment that politics becomes less polarized."
2615.0,2623.0," OK, then in your way of, once again, do not let that side of opposition get away with saying that it's not that big of an issue and that polarization isn't that bad,"
2623.0,2629.36," because it's terrible, it's affecting everyone in the world all across the globe i think on even if they prove"
2629.36,2634.32, that uh that there's like even if they prove some harms of their um their side of the house maybe
2634.32,2638.32, maybe some people go to other forms of media or that they will believe this is another hoax of
2638.32,2643.36, the government i'm very unsure why those people aren't very radical in the first place to begin
2643.36,2646.64, with because i think they're too far gone on either side of the house.
2646.64,2648.48, Why is our impact more important?
2648.48,2650.32," Firstly, short term, long term."
2650.32,2653.68," There may be some backlash in the short term, but in the long term, this is a new normal,"
2653.68,2656.64," meaning that people adapt and therefore on the long term,"
2656.64,2659.28, people are willing to accept that this is a new new
2659.28,2662.24, and therefore don't become as radical to begin with.
2662.24,2665.88," But secondly, the number of people who are not going to respond positive"
2665.88,2667.38, is quite small.
2667.64,2668.44, We get the majority.
2668.7,2670.9, People that have actual political and societal power
2670.9,2672.14, can actually make a change.
2672.3,2673.34," For all those reasons,"
2673.52,2675.02, never been prouder to propose.
2683.4,2690.56," Okay, I thank the P3. Now to conclude the substantive for prop and the substantive portion of the debate, welcome the O3."
2694.88,2696.88," Yeah, hello. Firstly, am I audible?"
2698.32,2699.42," Yes, perfectly fine."
2699.84,2726.96," Okay. Yeah, my pronouns see him. I'd like my POIs in the chat, please. Yeah, just write it and I'll see it and just, I'll start my speech in just a few seconds. Three, two, one. Panel Proposition asked us, why should we care about radicals getting more radical?"
2727.42,2730.04, This is because every new radical person
2730.04,2733.68, is likely to be a lone wolf attack on the Black community.
2734.16,2735.52, It is likely to be a hate crime
2735.52,2736.8, on a Muslim community in France.
2736.96,2739.42, It is likely to be bigotry to migrants in Germany.
2739.68,2741.78, We reject this cold and heartless narrative
2741.78,2742.54, from Proposition.
2742.86,2744.72," If polarization is so horrible,"
2744.72,2745.28," then hate crimes and radicalization, then outright violence is even worse. reject this cold and heartless narrative from proposition if polarization is so horrible then"
2745.28,2750.98, hate crimes and radicalization when outright violence is even worse in my speech two flash
2750.98,2756.32, points firstly is the fairness doctrine fair right and secondly which side solves the polarization
2756.32,2761.36, and radicalization right but just a quick strategic oh no right like notice how generally
2761.36,2765.08," all of their analysis is only contingent on the United States, right?"
2765.32,2771.6," Notice how this is important because the majority of functioning democracies in the world have actually pluralistic systems, right?"
2771.72,2778.44," This means that we have a few parties and therefore for opposition to, you know, for proposition to actually show all of the sides,"
2778.52,2789.52," we would have to platform from all the different parties, fundamentally increasing complexity increasing the boringness and generally just decreasing uh like just making it more complicated something we never"
2789.52,2795.16, engage with right but let's talk about the first flashpoint is the fairness doctrine fair look
2795.16,2800.5, let's talk let's just think about this logically what will be the people who they are likely to
2800.5,2806.0, invite right a it is likely to be someone with at least minimal power and balance
2806.0,2810.98, someone to mock and make it more entertaining because generally just think that these uh like
2810.98,2816.5, if they're if their characterization of media networks being so profit-driven being so wanting
2816.5,2820.96, to be sensationalist and all of that stuff then they're what is the incentive for them for like
2820.96,2825.36, blaze to not invite ben shapiro and then as a counterbalance to just get like a
2825.36,2830.0, radical feminist college student who he can destroy and therefore just seem so much more
2830.0,2835.04, effective to the general uh observers right but secondly even if they will invite someone
2835.04,2841.12, who satisfies your ideology similarly for instance right look let's take a very simple example
2841.12,2850.56, something that has been running through this case if a democrat-sponsored green new deal is being debated in the united states senate why wouldn't conservative outlines
2850.56,2856.16, justin knight a republican like ted cruz and then joe manch mansion as a counterbalance because he's
2856.16,2861.12, someone who comes from a different uh party right that's literally their own mechanism that we said
2861.12,2868.96, in their like first speech like for example in italy people come from different political parties right what we tell you is that since the spread of ideas is so far right
2869.6,2875.36, we cannot just simply not engage with the fact that these networks are likely to still push
2875.36,2879.84, their own ideas but let's talk about the format a bit right because we generally say that oh
2879.84,2885.52, all of these will be debates right because this is a bit like and generally will be just discussion
2885.52,2890.72, right this is crucial because people like like why do people watch news because that's something
2890.72,2895.04, what opposition opposition never really characterizes right the reason why someone
2895.04,2899.84, turns on cnn is because it's really fun to see them dunking on pet crews and the same is the
2899.84,2905.6, reason why we watch daily mirror right because destroying boris johnson about painting red trucks is really
2905.6,2909.68, really funny right they aren't really that interested in watching a debate why is that
2909.68,2913.6, a crucial characterization it seems that they are less interested and less incentivized to be
2913.6,2918.64, interested in politics insofar as we don't actually watch the news as we fundamentally don't see the
2918.64,2923.44, minimal enjoyment that we got there right by that definition they're way less likely to be
2923.44,2925.1, politically active and for
2925.1,2930.14, example with voters already low right insofar as they fundamentally decrease the interest in
2930.14,2934.86, politics that is a net harm on their side of the house but let's talk about our side because this
2934.86,2939.9, one totally unengaged right because look what do you tell you a we literally told you that
2939.9,2950.0," everything that is brought is perceived as a possible truth. Never engage, right? This is incredibly harmful because it says that some questions can be discussed."
2950.0,2955.0," It raises the question that, for example, the rights of people, the rights of queer individuals,"
2955.0,2958.0," the rights of trans athletes are something discussable, right?"
2958.0,2962.0," But more importantly, right, notice how this normalizes bigotry, right?"
2962.0,2969.92," Their only response to this ever was that, oh, they were just talking about it on both sides of the, on their side, on both perspectives, right?"
2970.2,2974.0," But look at the comparative. On their side of the house, they've platformed people,"
2974.68,2979.3," that are, they platformed most people and allow them a voice. On our side of the house,"
2979.3,2986.56, we just have the sun dunking on Mel Gibson for being antison for being anti-semitic right it's so much less likely
2986.56,2991.36, that anti-semitic ideas will be spread on our side of the house the point at which the anti-semitic
2991.36,2995.76, people don't actually have any sort of outlet right notice how this is independent of their
2995.76,3000.48, model because they will have to invite these people to provide like a counter alternative
3000.48,3004.32, because by their own definition right if they cannot invite joe manchin because he isn't a
3004.32,3008.72, radical enough of a difference right he cannot just invite two people who both agree on on like
3009.28,3014.56, trans rights right but look well like uh let's talk about like let's look where are you more
3014.56,3018.88, likely to be misinformed let's take a look at best case scenarios of both sides of the house because
3018.88,3024.08, once again never done that on their side of the house like on their side you just watch a debate
3024.08,3025.28," and get intelligent right let's let's let's assume that on our side of the house. On their side, you just watch a debate and get intelligent."
3025.28,3027.38, Let's assume that.
3027.38,3029.6," On our side of the house, even if you're still"
3029.6,3032.36," an undecided voter, what you'll likely do"
3032.36,3035.36," is that since you know that, for example, Fox News is biased,"
3035.36,3036.86," but you know that CNN is also biased,"
3036.86,3038.54, you're likely to still look at both of them
3038.54,3040.16, and you just craft your own narrative.
3040.16,3041.36, Why is this more important?
3041.36,3050.0," Because look, there's this thing called elaboration likelihood right there's two roots of processing uh thought right something that is peripheral something that"
3050.0,3054.72, happens on our side of the house is that when you hear fox news you don't retain it because you know
3054.72,3060.56, that that information is biased in a certain side but on their side of the house their thinking is
3060.56,3068.34, active right insofar as you see a debate and you automatically craft a narrative because you think that you know both sides of the coin insofar as we prove to you that
3068.34,3073.58, although both sides of the coin are actually not the true sides we take this point right before
3073.58,3077.88, moving on to the second flashpoint i'll gladly take up your wire in the status quo fox news
3077.88,3082.2, already gives platforms to openly racist individuals don't you think the difference
3082.2,3088.88, in our world is at least able to debate these individuals panel uh this is directly leads to the second replacement which side
3088.88,3093.04, falls polarization and radicalization right we talked to you that you see other people as human
3093.04,3097.44, right this is important because notice how all of their analysis on that can be extended to be
3097.44,3102.54, to people just watching a racist debate and then say oh maybe the racist person also has some sort
3102.54,3109.74, of a point he does seem human right he does have a family that he cares and maybe he's just concerned about the increased crime right but secondly right
3109.74,3114.26, there's like the look that there is generally uh like the way we say it is that you will just
3114.26,3118.84, invite models right but this is literally no change from the status quo right he literally
3118.84,3123.7, squirreled this debate because like joe manchin is the most common democrat on fox news they uh
3123.7,3126.08, they trip uh they trip over
3126.08,3130.24, themselves right you say that this would be unfair representation but their own model says that these
3130.24,3135.28, people will come from different political parties right but now let's talk about polarization
3135.28,3140.64, because what they never ex understand is that polarization doesn't just land from fox news it
3140.64,3146.62, is natural in politics right we never explained to you why would Biden not call Trump racist?
3147.04,3150.3," Why would this sort of language, this toxic sort of language,"
3150.54,3154.74," would not be shown on public debates or anything like that, right?"
3155.14,3158.82, Polarization in itself is likely to happen either way.
3158.96,3162.3," But look, status quo may not be perfect, but why is proposition so much horrible?"
3162.74,3164.32, Because what did we tell you?
3164.56,3165.44, We told you that the
3165.44,3170.64, point at which you literally your entire life have been uh have been slowly being introduced
3170.64,3177.68, by your family by just general uh uh media into the idea that maybe the state is not uh the uh
3177.68,3183.2, optimal agent the point in which we say oh we will endorse we will show to you what is fair is the
3183.2,3185.36, point in which you're unlikely to ever come back to that is fair is the point in which you're unlikely to ever come
3185.36,3189.28, back to that network again is the point which you're likely to move to other movements right
3189.28,3193.76, but this is crucial because notice that we never engage with our actual uh second or third argument
3193.76,3197.68, because what happens on our side of the house is that the people that they will be platforming on
3197.68,3203.6, these uh individual on these uh ternas doctrines right they're not going to be uh individuals who
3203.6,3207.98," for example support uh palestine because those people see this as a sham,"
3207.98,3208.52, right?
3208.52,3210.68," What's likely to be, there will be people who are just"
3210.68,3213.24," searching on the cloud, meaning that their ideas will never"
3213.24,3214.88," be represented, and minorities are"
3214.88,3234.88, going to be the individuals I'm incredibly proud to oppose. I thank the O3 that concludes the substantive portion of the debate and now we move on to
3234.88,3239.56, the team's concluding reply speeches and I welcome the reply speech yeah the up reply sorry
3239.56,3243.16, okay
3243.16,3248.0, wait am I audible?
3248.0,3252.0, Okay. The microphone
3252.0,3256.0," doesn't have the green, it doesn't move on it."
3256.0,3260.0, Okay. I'll start my speech in
3260.0,3264.0," three, two, one. The first thing I would like to clarify within my speech"
3264.0,3266.16, is to sort of look at this debate
3266.16,3269.5," and try to understand how both teams conceptualized,"
3270.52,3273.0, how do people engage with the news?
3273.0,3278.0, What is the reason behind people watching the news
3278.6,3279.82, and why do we do it?
3279.82,3282.52, Because I think that the primary analysis
3282.52,3284.3, that was brought by side proposition
3284.3,3285.42, and the characterizations
3285.42,3291.32, they want to make makes their world fundamentally unclear as to how the new fairness doctrine
3291.32,3292.82, would actually look like.
3292.82,3297.44," Because at the point at which they say that already under the status quo, shocking and"
3297.44,3302.12, sensational news is being rewarded and the sort of race to the bottom is constantly occurring
3302.12,3305.24, and that's how news sort of operates it's unclear to
3305.24,3312.64, us then are people actually engaging with the news through the lens of wanting and like trying to be
3312.64,3320.14, like informed of actually like seeking out uh political uh discussion and ideology so that
3320.14,3327.46, they could uh so that they could actually like you know uh think of themselves as being enlightened and knowing much more
3327.46,3329.8, than any other or something like this.
3329.8,3336.14, But what we say is that most of these people who watch most of these shows already through
3336.14,3346.64," the sense of after work, having during lunchtime or whatever right we're telling you they are not watching it as a way of"
3346.64,3353.04, getting informed far more likely they're watching it as like a way to keep the illusion of being
3353.04,3359.2, informed and getting their confirmation bias like being engaged right we're telling you that the
3359.2,3365.0, people who would then want to watch the debates on their side of the house would still want them to be
3365.0,3369.88, sort of like a sports match sort of like a political debate in which you know the commentary
3369.88,3375.28, afterwards goes like this oh i think he was a very confident speaker he's it's it's same that he
3375.28,3380.3, knew what he was talking about uh the other one seemed a little bit no squirrely or whatever
3380.3,3385.32," uh something like this you know after like the political debates happen,"
3385.32,3387.0," often you see this, right?"
3387.0,3391.16, We're telling you that like the fairness doctrine
3391.16,3394.66, would still make the news essentially as ineffective
3394.66,3398.56," as in informing people, and we've proved this in many ways."
3398.56,3401.16," But secondly, like the people who are in the sort of"
3401.16,3404.12," middle way, the people who would actually seek"
3404.12,3405.68, and want to be informed that
3405.68,3411.6, sort of watch and scrutinize these shows right now on their side of the house would be presented with
3411.6,3418.0, debates under the illusion of fairness and fairness already existing and that it's not the
3418.0,3424.4, thing that they need to search for themselves via research via scrutiny and etc we're telling you
3424.4,3426.3, that it's far more likely that
3426.3,3431.88," these people then would be sort of brainwashed on their side of the house, right? Because of how,"
3431.88,3436.56," because when they are already searching to scrutinize, they know that when they watch Fox"
3436.56,3441.78," News, it's a Republican channel, right? Then let me go into the distinction of polarization and"
3441.78,3445.26," radicalization also, because it seems throughout this debate"
3445.26,3447.78, that proposition treats those two concepts
3447.78,3449.66," as exactly the same thing, right?"
3449.66,3452.24," Because like, let's look at the capital rioters."
3452.24,3454.94," It was not like political polarization,"
3454.94,3458.18, which caused the mass reaction of violence.
3458.18,3460.8," No, it was radicalization, right?"
3460.8,3463.74, And notice how it was already born out
3463.74,3470.0, of a narrative of perceived state involvement in the election process.
3470.0,3473.0," And they like they are hindering it, etc."
3473.0,3487.96," But telling you that the people who have been radicalized along these lines and polarization is fundamentally different because polarization can happen across many different lines across society, which not necessitate them to be radical polarization,"
3487.96,3490.12, but telling you that the sorts of people
3490.12,3492.66, who are actually the most important agents
3492.66,3495.66, in the context of radicalization within this debate
3495.66,3497.4," would be far more radicalized,"
3497.4,3500.86, would be pushed into far more echo chambers
3500.86,3502.06, on their side of the house
3502.06,3504.84, because of the way that we have characterized them
3504.84,3508.18," and how proposition has never refuted it. For this reasons, I beg you to oppose."
3513.96,3520.32, I thank the upper plight now to conclude both the prop bench and the whole debate. Welcome the proper plight.
3522.32,3523.5," Hi, am I still audible?"
3524.4,3524.8, Yes.
3525.64,3526.56, Great. Okay.
3532.32,3535.12, The proposition push has been very simple since the start.
3535.6,3537.14, This is a debate about echo chambers.
3537.46,3540.78, Side proposition is the side which breaks the echo chambers for the vast majority of people.
3541.08,3542.58, I want to put this way up at the front.
3542.96,3549.08," Even if there are more people who are going to go to 4chan, that is unfortunate. However, it's unlikely that the vast majority"
3549.08,3553.38, of people will leave traditional news media for all the reasons that we gave you in our speeches.
3553.84,3558.62," Therefore, sure, there are certain people who are likely to already be radicalized who will become"
3558.62,3563.02, slightly more radicalized. But the more important change is that we break the echo chambers which
3563.02,3568.78," the vast majority of voters in the status quo exist in. I'm going to do two things in this debate. Firstly, I'm going to"
3568.78,3572.98," acknowledge the case ship which happens in third op and respond to it. Then secondly, I'm going to"
3572.98,3576.5," talk about the main thrust for the vast majority of this debate, the debate about polarisation."
3576.84,3580.78," So firstly, in terms of the third opposition speech, the vast majority of the third opposition"
3580.78,3589.52," speech is specifically about minority representation in media. This content is not new, however it does suddenly become the most important impact in the debate. A couple of things"
3589.52,3594.72," here. Firstly, in terms of the points of minorities in news which is brought up in 7 opposition,"
3594.72,3599.12, just a quick observation here. This is brought up in the last minute of the second opposition and
3599.12,3603.68," then completely dropped in the third opposition speech. But secondly, note that our speaker also"
3603.68,3609.34, engages with this and explains why on our side of the house we uniquely get more minority representation in the news. So
3609.34,3613.4," sure, we might cover less stories, but those stories are more likely to feature the representation"
3613.4,3618.5, of minority views. But their second point was about bigotry specifically in the news. So for
3618.5,3622.9," instance, that you'd have to have transphobes or racists. Firstly, I don't think they ever really"
3622.9,3627.92," explain why that's likely to be such a controversial issue, especially given that the vast majority of people aren't necessarily"
3627.92,3631.74," explicitly racist. I think it's more likely that you're going to have discussions about, for instance,"
3631.84,3635.96," BLM, but not about whether or not, like for instance, black people deserve rights. But a"
3635.96,3640.38," couple of concerted points here. Firstly, note that we explained that this is also about echo chambers,"
3640.74,3644.14," that there will be, for instance, platforms like Fox News, which will have exclusively transphobic"
3644.14,3648.72, people on either side of the house. these these kinds of ideas will exist either way
3648.72,3653.28, but secondly we explain why it's only on ours the house that we're more able to deconstruct
3653.28,3657.76, these ideas and in addition to that also know to be given a unique mechanism for this model line
3658.48,3663.04, speech that individuals who are bigoted are acting off of hate and it's easier to humanize the
3663.04,3668.48, individuals who are fighting for the rights of others that's why someone who's fighting for gay rights is likely to be more
3668.48,3673.28, persuasive than someone who's fighting against it thirdly and lastly on weighing which is what they
3673.28,3678.32, never do here they say it is bad for a minority to hear a transfer or a trans person to hear a
3678.32,3683.2, transphobic person in the news but we also flag that it's bad for a trans person to not have any
3683.2,3688.02," trans representation in the news since they never never do weigh in between these groups, we think this is the best I'll watch for them."
3688.28,3693.14," But secondly, in terms of the more important question in the debate, about polarization, there are two groups here."
3693.38,3698.34, The first is what Proposition focuses on. It's about people who are explicitly radical conspiracy theorists already.
3698.34,3701.36, And the second group is about literally everyone else in society.
3701.84,3708.24," Firstly, about conspiracy theorists. I'm going to do some weighing up front so I can contribute to this directly before I go into evaluating the"
3708.24,3713.98," three points of weighing for the group of conspiracy theorists. Firstly, these people"
3713.98,3719.74," are pretty far gone already. Sure, they might go further to the right or further to the left,"
3719.74,3724.42," but it's unclear how exactly you create a massive delta there, where previously they were unlikely"
3724.42,3728.0," to, for instance, commit to school shooting shooting, however now they are more likely."
3728.0,3731.9," Secondly, in terms of scale, yes it's a bad thing when more people radicalise, but the"
3731.9,3736.0," amount of people who are currently radicalised, as we already flag in every single speech,"
3736.0,3739.96," is so incredibly marginal that the 80% of society or more, which has now changed the"
3739.96,3742.8," arts of the house, massively outweighs it in terms of scale."
3742.8,3748.96," Thirdly and lastly, the way in which which opposition never engages about short term versus long term maybe in the short term we create"
3748.96,3754.24, more radicalized individuals whereas over time as society adapts we get increasingly lit amounts of
3754.24,3759.44, conspiracy serious so only long term we also win note their analysis here is that people are scared
3759.44,3762.72, of the government but our analysis here is that people are scared of the governments because
3762.72,3765.92, currently they exist in echo chambers which which only push them further away.
3766.22,3775.52," But secondly, about everyone else, all they say here is that people will stop watching the news because it will become too boring without firstly ever establishing why it would be boring."
3775.82,3785.1," But secondly, rebutting the incentives for people not to go and leave the news that we give in mind and online speech, that people want to be informed and that these are the most accessible news sources"
3785.1,3786.54, that you hear around you.
3786.54,3789.28," Overall, because of issues like getting policy passed,"
3789.28,3790.92," issues like making sure that there aren't,"
3790.92,3793.4," for instance, BLM rights or anti-BLM rights are important,"
3793.4,3795.48, you should vote for a proposition.
3802.62,3804.82, Thank the proper reply for that speech
3804.82,3807.42, and indeed everyone for what was an enjoyable debate.
3807.42,3808.26," Oh, sorry."
