0.0,12.94," Okay, can everybody see recording? Did it make a sound for everybody? Okay, great. Cool."
12.94,20.48," So are there any questions before we start this round? Okay, timekeeping will be done"
20.48,26.08, in chat. I will give you timestamps time stamps at one minute seven minutes and eight
26.08,32.72, minutes um and if there are no dilemmas i would like to invite the first speaker of the proposition
32.72,48.32," to open the debate here here all right so you cannot hear me all right so everyone in brazil Todos no Team Brasil prefeririam não ter uma POI verbal, então a POI é no chat ou visualmente, por favor."
49.04,53.38," Então, meus pronomes são ele, ele e eu vou começar em 3, 2, 1."
53.48,59.28," Um par de coisas na minha fala. Primeiro, as definições e caracterizações e depois por que nós temos melhores relações sociais em nossa casa."
59.28,63.18," Primeiro de tudo, definindo família, não estamos falando apenas sobre família nuclear."
63.32,69.0," Estamos falando sobre avós, avós, cas wives, and not also not necessarily biological bonds."
69.0,72.0," For example, a step parent is part of your family as well."
72.0,75.0, So what is the comparative of having this debate?
75.0,83.0, The Prop. Trafetio looks like people maintaining closer relations to their family as their dominant unit of organization in society.
83.0,85.82," So they spend more time together, strengthen even more their bonds"
85.82,90.08, and their relationships stronger so people depend and think more about their family instead of other
90.08,93.9," institutions, and the family is the organization that people trust more on the outside of the house."
94.16,98.12," Having your side of the house, people get away from their family to look for a group that represents"
98.12,103.36," them and groups that have social common traits. They prioritize other groups such as friends,"
103.66,105.78," work, church, political parties, etc."
106.0,109.6, We believe that the most important metric is in which world we have better relations for
109.6,113.44, individuals. That's especially important in a modern world in which relations are even
113.44,118.76, times weaker. So why do we actually get some stronger bonds on our side of the house? First
118.76,122.96," of all, some framing. People live through a lot of challenges in their life. So they need some"
122.96,125.34, strong support system and strong social relations.
125.34,128.8," They go through diseases, financial struggles, everyday stress."
129.02,132.16, They need help to overcome all those issues and keep going with their lives.
132.48,137.46," Therefore, strong relationships are especially necessary in the status quo."
137.78,141.24," So what are the incentives that families, groups have in other side of the house?"
141.44,142.52," First of all, quick disclaimer."
142.94,148.08, Rational incentives aren't the ones that lead families. families have more incentives to take care of their members and
148.08,152.96, not abandon them family members take care of each other because they have biological souls
152.96,158.56, show bones towards them that are stronger than other common bones they have exp they have been
158.56,163.2, together for a long time and all of that but they're they trust people and they take care of
163.2,165.76, people not because of how they how
165.76,169.86, fun they are how interesting they are or how useful they are but just for the fact that they
169.86,174.84, are your kids your parents or anything like that for example when you're extremely sick having a
174.84,179.08, devastating disease we believe that the ones that are actually going to help them in all instances
179.08,183.9, are your family consideration for family members happens because of who they are parents don't love
183.9,186.6, their kids because they're useful or funny or anything.
186.6,190.32, They love them because they are their kids regardless of all these aspects.
190.32,197.28," That is why, for example, parents give up their dreams to take care of their kids if they have some sort of disease, deficiency or anything like that."
197.28,201.64, Because parents love their kids for things that are more than how useful they can be for them.
201.64,205.58, Families also have incentives to accept their members. Even if
205.58,210.8," they will behave differently from expected from your family, they are more incentivized,"
211.04,215.28," more likely to accept what you're doing, who you are, than in the comparative of other social groups"
215.28,221.16," because your family members only have you as part of your family. Therefore,"
221.42,229.2," there are high incentives for forgiveness in other friendships, for example. I'll explain that in a minute. That is why if you go outside a prison, for example,"
229.34,234.2, the only people you see coming in and out are mothers or parents in general. You're not seeing
234.2,238.38, friends for a simple reason that has to do with how these social groups work and how they're
238.38,242.58, different from families. Organization of social groups that are the dominant in your side of the
242.58,245.16, house is based on factors that change over time.
248.54,248.86," People's beliefs, personality, behavior, utility, and etc."
255.08,255.34, Who these people actually are and the fact that they might change and these things might change doesn't really matter.
261.66,261.98," These groups are built around things in common, and if those things in common change and don't exist anymore, the relations between these groups don't exist."
265.64,269.0, There's a huge standardization of behaviors in such groups in your side of the house. What happens is that people they need to maintain a
269.0,271.82, specific pattern in order to belong to these groups and be
271.82,274.68, accepted. Members of these groups don't really care about
274.68,277.08, who these people really are. They have no will for quite
277.08,279.86," little, don't have any incentives to actually protect"
279.86,283.98, you. You only care for people only care about you from the
283.98,294.54," time they see that you have behaviors that are common, the time that you have traits common, that are the traits that base the relations of social groups in your side of the house."
294.66,297.28, What happens is that families are based on things that are more definitive.
297.6,299.18, Your kids are your kids no matter what.
299.36,300.82, Your parents are your parents no matter what.
301.04,312.4," But in your side of the house, social relations between friends, work groups are change so before moving on poi no verbal pis but i'll take that oh i'm so sorry i"
312.4,318.16, forgot um surely under our side of the house um under the status quo despite this decline of
318.16,323.46, traditional family relationships they still this if this love is unconditional between family
323.46,325.04, members surely this is something that
325.04,330.56, has con like declined under your side of the house like this can exist without um in like people
330.56,335.44, seeking more individualism all right all right i got that so what happens says yes we get these
335.44,339.76, love in our side of the house however in your side of the house people are more dependent of other
339.76,344.32, relationships that are weaker we're talking about people who spend more of their time and be more
344.32,348.7," emotionally dependent of people that don't really care about them. However, in our side of"
348.7,352.98," the house, people are actually closer to their families and to this bond. They are more definitive"
352.98,357.94," than in the comparative. What happens is how individuals behave in ops world. In ops world,"
358.06,363.38," people look for a group to socialize and feel welcomed, etc. This is bad for individuals"
363.38,367.88, because they have to look for this specific bond that makes them together.
367.88,370.76, Individuals often have to change themselves to be accepted.
370.76,374.3," If the group is built there out something like,"
374.3,376.88," liking a soccer team, for example,"
376.88,379.24, people can't just stop liking this
379.24,380.76, or stop or changing themselves
380.76,382.78, and not bring that interest in this anymore
382.78,384.2, because they are breaking the bond
384.2,387.94, that was actually created. And the thing that bases this relation in your sort of house
387.94,392.74, but i saw that of the house people don't need to change themselves to feel accepted family is only
392.74,397.86, one and you this family can't be changed so what happens is that no matter if you move to another
397.86,402.8, place if you don't like things you used to like family is a more solid institution than any other
402.8,405.14, institution that is dominant in your sort of the house and family is the more solid institution than any other institution that is dominant in our side of the
405.14,411.12, house and family is the only place where people are more free to change and people will keep
411.12,415.66, loving you because the reason they love you is not what you like not what you're interested in
415.66,420.3, but actually who you are they're actually biological incentives in our side of the house
420.3,425.2, but even if the family doesn't like you where you act or what you identify with if we
425.2,431.12, have we still get a benefit compared to your world for example families are able to combine different
431.12,434.96, people with different points of view and backgrounds so even if you have a homophobic
434.96,440.32, father for example you can still be extremely close to your brother your uncle or great father
440.32,444.32, or something like that and these people actually care about you no matter what what happens that
444.32,447.84, older other social groups are more willing to abandon you if you're a different
447.84,452.16, compared to if you're different than what they believe compared to families because they actually
452.16,458.72, have an emotional closer emotional bond with you even in a world scenario where worse scenario the
458.72,463.52, families are horrible they don't have anyone that loves them in this scenario even in a worse
463.52,465.74, scenario they would need to get closer
465.74,469.96," to other groups, but it'll still be dependent of what these groups believe, so they'll still be"
469.96,474.1, oppressed and still need to be that same person said they'll be abandoned. On their side of the
474.1,479.9," house, family is not people's main social group. It leads to people being closer to groups in which"
479.9,484.2, relations between people are weaker and their social relations are worse. If relations with
484.2,486.68," such groups collapse, they will be worse off because they are"
486.68,488.2, more dependent of these relations.
488.4,491.24," In our role, people have stronger relations with their family and they"
491.24,494.12," would have a safe haven, a place they can feel good, et cetera."
494.28,497.04," So in our South of the House, people are more dependent from these groups where"
497.24,498.48, social relations are weaker.
498.64,501.48," However, in our South of the House, people base their lives on relationships"
501.48,503.56," that are stronger, which means the family."
503.68,508.76, So practical benefits in our South of the House. People have better support system for huge changes in their
508.76,513.16," life. If they need money, food, psychological support, their family will be there for them."
513.28,518.26," More than these other groups, they also have a better support system for everyday things. So"
518.26,521.9," someone that actually cares about these people, someone that actually cares about who they are"
521.9,527.0," and their well-being compared to your side of the house. In your side of the house, relations are based on some common traits."
527.0,532.0," These common traits change and people don't have an incentive to care for you, actually care about you."
532.0,534.0, Incredibly proud to propose.
536.0,539.0, I thank the speaker for that fine speech.
539.0,546.8," And if everybody is ready, I would like to invite the first opposition speaker okay cool thank you"
547.52,552.0, here here
570.16,573.64," today we don't refute the importance of family regarding a person's growth, but we do believe that the decisions of individuals should not be dependent on family."
573.64,578.3," Having seen the benefits of individualism brought to oneself and women, we don't regret"
578.3,582.88, the decline of family as the dominant unit of organization in the society.
582.88,585.12," Today we'll prove to you that on our side,"
585.12,590.4," individuals will be better off, especially for women. And secondly, we tell you that"
590.4,598.44," having other relationships actually, I mean, on our side of the house, we would improve"
598.44,613.0," the relationships within the family. And today I'll bring two arguments to the debate. First, I'll talk about self-identity. And secondly, I'll talk about how it improves the relationships within a family."
613.0,630.08," And my partner will be expanding on how it improves the status of women. But before I start my substantive, I'd like to do some rebuttals of what the previous speaker have said so first of all um at the very beginning of their speech they said that the whole motion is for individuals to look for a group as"
630.08,635.44, to look for like which relationship is better for individual whether family or friends however we
635.44,639.84, believe that they have misunderstood the motion we don't see like why finding a relationship isn't
639.84,645.5, necessarily the only aim of having family as the dominant unit of organization within
645.5,649.66, the society. We see that they have fall into the fallacy of false dichotomy. We believe
649.66,655.18, that it is not either you have a relationship with family or then you have a relationship
655.18,658.9, with your friends. We don't see this as the purpose of this motion. So therefore we don't
658.9,665.52, understand why do they put on this burden of proof on themselves but then secondly there's uh the first proposition
665.52,672.08, spent whole like the like most of her most of his speech talking about like how um because that
672.08,676.96, family has unconditional love and they would take care of each other then they would get a better
676.96,681.44, relationship for the family which is the most important thing however we do this is very
681.44,685.24," heartwarming to see that oh a family is actually so caring for each other and we do, it's very heartwarming to see that, oh, a family is actually so caring for each other."
685.24,690.92, And we do believe that family does a family relationship for an individual is very important.
691.16,699.68, But we don't see why having not having family as a dominant unit of organization in the society means that you don't get a good relationship with your parents.
699.84,706.44," Right. We tell that actually you can also get this on our side. And exactly, no, no, thank you."
706.44,710.76," I'll be telling you, I'll be telling you in my second point"
710.84,714.64, how the relationship with the family can also be improved under our side
714.72,718.12, when even when family is not the dominant unit
718.92,721.4," in this organization, in this society."
721.6,726.34, Now back to my own substantive on first self identity.
726.34,730.38," So first of all, what does their world look like? In the past, we tell that there are"
730.38,734.32," these traditional thoughts that family comes first in all situations, because there's no"
734.32,739.58, family then there's no them. And but what does it mean for individuals? We tell three
739.58,743.94," things. First, all people mean all people will feel that they have responsibility and"
743.94,745.2, obligations to their family.
745.2,750.4," For example, if your family runs an old business, then it is your responsibility to continue their"
750.4,755.52," business. Secondly, it also means that it's just basic for you to obey your family. It's just"
755.52,760.16," basic for you to follow your parents' hopes and plans for your future, and because you're born"
760.16,764.08, to make your family proud. And we tell them that this idea is still perpetuating in some
764.08,768.64," traditional Asian countries. For example, parents are overly exerting their control"
768.64,773.6," over children, wanting them to succeed. And sometimes where the definition of succeeding"
773.6,779.02, is to be wealthy or wealthy or married to a wealthy counterpart. And then certainly
779.02,783.64, we tell that having family as a dominant unit also means that your identity is directly
783.64,785.84," linked to your family. In this society,"
785.84,790.72, you identify yourself as part of the family instead of an individual. So what are the impacts
790.72,796.16," of this? So we see that we see this as incredibly harmful because of three reasons. First, you get"
796.16,800.8," less self-actualization because time is limited, right? If you spend too much time doing things"
800.8,805.0," your family wants for you, then there's an opportunity cost for other self-exploration."
805.0,810.0, I'll get that later. It also means that you have less time to explore your interests and your preferred career.
810.0,815.0," And secondly, we tell it is harmful because you get less maturity because then you have surfing,"
815.0,820.0, your family has been your main purpose in your whole life. You can't find your special purpose in life.
820.0,825.04," You can't have your own directions in life because your soul, because a family is a"
825.04,829.46, dominant unit within the society and you have to work for a family and you lost your position
829.46,835.28," within the society. And thirdly, we tell that also harms self-identity. Because when everyone's"
835.28,840.14," identity is linked with their family, there will be stigmas or overgeneralization around the family."
840.44,845.0, But what if a person's opinion do not align with that of the family? What would happen?
845.0,852.0," For example, what if a kid is gay or lesbian, but then the traditional Christian family do not accept that?"
852.0,861.0, Do she need to change her identity and change her sexual belief into what her family wants for her?
861.0,865.12, We simply don't believe that it's healthy for the individual so therefore
865.12,872.16, we don't believe that having family as a dominant unit as helpful for an individual but on the other
872.16,876.72, hand whereas on our side we tell that we prefer the status quo where I respect my family and I'm
876.72,881.84, grateful for them bringing me up and having to build this intimate relationship with them however
881.84,888.98, I do not connect my identity with them I do not think what they believe is what but what i must believe in i have the freedom of religion i'm free from
888.98,894.32, influence of my family over important decisions i am myself i have individualism and we think
894.32,898.76, that's the most important thing for an individual but before before i start on onto my second
898.76,903.92, substantive i would like to take your point family relations are not relation of control
903.92,905.28, of individuals people don't have the
905.28,910.0, autonomy to decide if they want or they want don't want to do and actually in family they have more
910.0,916.0, space to change into what they want we do understand the nuance of your characterization of
916.0,921.28, a family however we tell that under the current under this motion uh having family as a dominant
921.28,925.16," unit of organization under society it society, it means that family"
925.16,926.6, is the most important thing.
926.6,929.66," Even if the family is not exerting control over you,"
929.66,931.24, it also means that you believe you
931.24,932.96, have this obligation for the family
932.96,935.84, and you won't want to make your family feel disappointed.
935.84,938.62," So therefore, no matter from a family's point of view"
938.62,940.16," or from individual's point of view,"
940.16,943.82, we see that it's very likely that individuals will follow
943.82,945.64, what the family's directions are.
945.64,949.0," So therefore, I would guess let individualism as I've explained."
949.0,953.56, Now onto my second point on how it improves the relationship within the family.
953.56,958.84," How would this happen? As I've explained to you, family has been a primary form of socialization for individuals."
958.84,961.72, We see that in day to day lives in the household.
961.72,965.28, So individuals are more likely to do what their family pushes
965.28,970.72, them to do so this restricts individual individual freedom as i have explained so therefore it can
970.72,976.8, cause disputes on the other hand on our side when we have more space we have less family
976.8,982.0, pressure so therefore this is more beneficial for relationships within a family because it allows
982.0,987.56, individuals to blossom and when the parents see their kids actually have the ability
987.56,988.76," to flourish on their own,"
988.76,990.88, it's just likely that they're gonna be happy.
990.88,993.68, It's likely that relationship is gonna be better
993.68,996.0, because there are less disputes within the family.
996.0,998.56, And what are the impacts of this?
998.56,1001.0," We tell that for the family,"
1001.0,1003.6, it says there will be less pressure from the parents
1003.6,1009.24," and older members of the family, because therefore we we allow the society to evolve to become more diverse."
1009.48,1025.1," And we tell that a family as a result to form stronger bonds with one another, because the younger generations are happier and healthier, which satisfies the traditional norms of families, which are to ensure the protection of children and And also we tell that for a society, we'll get a more"
1025.1,1034.68," harmonious society because now the relationships within the family is better. So therefore,"
1034.68,1039.32," everyone is happier on our side of the house. So in conclusion, we believe that also in"
1039.32,1044.16," our inclusion, we believe that the society requires both collectivism and individualism."
1044.16,1050.0, So we don't agree with this dominant culture of family that doesn't make the balance of collectivism and
1050.0,1055.68, individualism on their side so therefore I'm incredibly proud to oppose thank you
1058.4,1067.0, I thank the speaker for that fine speech I will be back in a second. I just need to close my door because my roommate came home. And I don't want to have
1067.0,1071.38," background noise. But in meanwhile, everybody collect"
1071.38,1072.96, your notes. I need 20 seconds.
1078.6,1082.14," Cool. If everybody's ready, then I would like to invite the"
1082.14,1088.94, second prop speaker here. Here.
1092.66,1096.08," Okay, great. I'm going to start my speech in a few seconds."
1115.44,1115.82," Alright, just gonna put my timer on here. All right, so I'm going to start my speech in three, two, one."
1120.8,1121.56," Better note, the opposition team never actually engaged with their status quo and with their counterfactual."
1121.56,1125.36, They never explained how they deal with the problems that we have to
1125.36,1131.28, deal with in the status quo. This means that they never actually explain how individualism is
1131.28,1136.88," something that is not bad or how not being able to connect, having strong relationships, something"
1136.88,1141.44, that is not bad in their side of the house. They need to engage with their status quo and be
1141.44,1151.36, comparative about why they prefer to have a world that does not care about relationships rather than a world that has more stronger connections with people that they
1151.36,1156.8, are close to because of family. But now answer some questions during my speech and again my POIs
1156.8,1163.44," on the chat. So first of all, why prioritizing other groups is bad? So how do we believe that"
1163.44,1165.12," such values work in the outside of the house? Tana, look, It's bad. So how do we believe that such values work in their side of"
1165.12,1170.76," the house? Tana, look, we're talking about groups that do not have like the same idea of what is"
1170.76,1175.92," important as family. This means that in their side of the house, what is most value is the idea of"
1175.92,1182.16," how I can like be on, how can I like aggregate something to the group? How do I compare myself"
1182.16,1185.44," to the group? Look, my, my my friend my group of friends is"
1185.44,1189.68, not because we're like love each other um unconditionally but it's because we share the
1189.68,1194.72, same values or because we share the same opinions right now this means that uh my friend of groups
1194.72,1199.76, is not actually someone that would be for with me for the whole time of my life but actually someone
1199.76,1205.28, that just agrees with my idea right now So this means that we understand that such relationships are not
1205.28,1210.58," as strong because they depend on actions, they depend on beliefs, and then depend on how you act"
1210.58,1216.36," inside a group to be accepted. In the comparative, we told you that we believe that a family does not"
1216.36,1220.94, have this because of the analysis that my first speaker gave you. This means that we understand
1220.94,1225.54, that a family values no matter what who you are so this means that you're better able
1225.54,1230.86, to be yourself when you value a family when you value your family because you're able to develop
1230.86,1236.82, your beliefs you're able to develop your passions you are like who you choose to be without having
1236.82,1242.44, the fear of not being accepted into a group when you have family as your primarily way to develop
1242.44,1245.46, yourself you're more able to be who you actually are
1245.46,1250.56," because you do not have to follow social standards to achieve this. But most important, why is"
1250.56,1256.08, this bond stronger in our side of the house and why are they more likely to accept themselves?
1256.08,1261.46," As I already told you, we believe that a family, no matter if my mother do not want me, for"
1261.46,1265.12," example, my mother wants me to be a doctor, even though I'm not going"
1265.12,1270.28," to pursue medicine in the future, still, she sees me as her daughter, as someone that she cares about,"
1270.76,1275.2," maybe I don't, like, you know, don't agree with my sister about every political opinion, but still,"
1275.3,1280.5," she's my sister who cares, who cares about me, who respects me, and who will be thinking about me,"
1280.5,1285.2," and how I am during her entire life, This means they do not have like conditional times to"
1285.2,1289.84," be loved, we do not have conditional times to be accepted, we can just be ourselves because my"
1289.84,1294.96," family will care for me and my family will take care of me. But what this status quo looks like,"
1294.96,1299.44," panel, so where I already told you that this status quo do not value their family and do not"
1299.44,1310.0," see family as the most important thing. This means that they believe that rather than being able to spend a good Sunday morning with my family, have a good like Christmas night, it's better for me to"
1310.0,1314.64, have momentaneous moments of connections with people who I do not have stronger bonds with.
1314.64,1321.44, So this means that prioritizing being accepted to like a group that likes to dress like something
1321.44,1327.14, rather than being able to have stronger connections with my family and being able to develop who I believe I am.
1327.36,1329.32," This means that in their side of the house,"
1329.44,1332.34, people are less likely to be themselves as a whole.
1332.56,1335.18, But what does it mean that having your family as priority?
1335.4,1338.08, You value what family values at most.
1338.42,1341.32," This means that we understand what family values at most,"
1341.32,1343.82," like respect, value being there for each other,"
1344.0,1347.26," value being there, value being empathetic,"
1347.26,1349.22, and value giving back to the community.
1349.22,1351.7, This means that you grow up watching your parents
1351.7,1354.0, dedicating most of their time to yourself
1354.0,1356.26, when you're a kid.
1356.26,1358.22, They lose time to take care of you
1358.22,1360.42, rather than to be working or to having fun.
1360.42,1362.96," This means that you grow up learning that as a people,"
1362.96,1367.76," as an individual, you have to do more for others than just use people for your advantage."
1368.02,1372.82, Because you see your grandmother leaving her town to just take care of you on the weekends.
1373.02,1378.06, Or you see your brother sleeping late at night because you need help with your math exercise.
1378.52,1385.8," This means that in our side of the house, we see people as someone who need help for their lives, not only for momentary"
1385.8,1391.6," experience, but most important, people want to have a family. Panel? No, look, everybody wants"
1391.6,1398.34," to be able to, like, out of the blue, have someone asking you, how are you? Not depending on any"
1398.34,1405.82," fact. This means that everybody wants to be able to, on a Christmas night, having a fine dinner with your family,"
1406.12,1410.18," being able to go sometimes like parties with your family, have someone next to you all"
1410.18,1410.7, of the time.
1410.98,1414.84," The comparative here is that in the rest of the house, people still want to have families."
1415.22,1418.64, The difference is that they're not able to achieve this because they do not have strong
1418.64,1419.12, connections.
1419.46,1424.16," It's not enough for them to say that, oh, not valuing your family does not lead to worse"
1424.16,1429.36," family relations, as they already said. we do not believe that is actually true when you do not put your"
1429.36,1434.88, family as a priority leads to you getting away from them we see you getting uh like not going
1434.88,1439.36, to their houses anymore not talking not speaking to them anymore this means that you do not create
1439.36,1443.76, important bonds and most important they are not your priority so if you have a party to go or if
1443.76,1448.56, you have like your mom your mom's birthday you're going to choose to go to the party rather than celebrate
1448.56,1453.4, your mom's life so this means that in the rest of the house they do not have strong bonds so they
1453.4,1458.1, can claim this but most important when they see the parents are controlling I have two responses
1458.1,1463.26, for that the first it's not necessarily true because family not always allow you to be someone
1463.26,1465.1, who are not family is likely to
1465.1,1469.36, accept who you are especially when you talk about this motion that we're not like debating this
1469.36,1474.64, motion in the past but actually how we believe that we should have prioritized best um like
1474.64,1480.1, this dominance of family in in right now so this means that we believe that families still have an
1480.1,1484.96, evolution of how cultural meanings uh culture means matter for her so we're talking about
1484.96,1486.58, families that can be diverse right now
1486.58,1489.08," and families that can care about diverse opinions,"
1489.08,1492.68, diverse decisions and diverse individuals.
1492.68,1495.32, So this means that we understand that the parents
1495.32,1497.64, are going to accept you and they're going to not be
1497.64,1498.84, controlling about who you are.
1498.84,1500.66," But even though, even if they are,"
1500.66,1503.22, we still believe that this is not likely to be like
1503.22,1507.28, something that will go on for a long
1507.28,1511.2, time. This means that my model would be probably sad that I'm not going to be a doctor for a couple
1511.2,1516.4," of weeks, but then she'll realize that, okay, maybe it's not that bad because my daughter is"
1516.4,1520.88," happier now that she can choose to be like a debater, for example. So this means that family,"
1520.88,1530.08," because they care about you, are likely to accept your decisions because they see how important this is for you in comparison um people for our groups do not care about this but before"
1530.08,1537.04, engaging more a poi so do you believe then that people should make compromise have to make
1537.04,1543.12, compromises for this benefit of the family organization being dominant for example not
1543.12,1545.8, taking a job but in order to be closer to
1545.8,1551.88, the family in order to like be present to like providing these family values okay okay okay
1551.88,1556.3, okay i'm not saying this i'm saying that if people will if if people believe that this is most
1556.3,1559.82, important thing okay fine they should do this because it makes them happier okay i don't have
1559.82,1564.18, i do not have a problem with this but look we're talking about people who care best about their
1564.18,1568.4, values and about their family this does not mean like uh bribing themselves of doing what they want
1568.4,1573.44, to do but just just believing that they should do more than just care about their themselves in this
1573.44,1579.36, world but engaging better about uh opinions and how we have the diverse opinions better diverse
1579.36,1582.96, opinions in their side of the house as they claimed this is not actually true because when
1582.96,1588.16, you do not because in their house you actually search for people with the same interest as you and you get you're
1588.16,1593.52, likely to get like very close to it and it's going to the same idea this means they're all are like
1593.52,1597.68, only going to follow people the same people in social media are only going to believe the same
1597.68,1601.68, ideas because you're likely to going to just insert yourself in groups that think the same
1601.68,1606.28," way as you the comparison here is that in families, people actually have different opinions,"
1606.28,1608.76, different minds and have different relationships about the world.
1608.76,1611.44, So this means we have more diversity in our side of the house.
1611.64,1613.88, So proud to propose.
1615.12,1618.88," I thank the speaker for that fine speech, and I would like to remind all"
1619.08,1622.76, of the debaters that the time you have for asking POIs is 15 seconds.
1622.96,1625.88, Please give that to respect your opponents
1625.88,1632.52," to adhere to that. But with that, if everybody is ready, I would like to invite the second"
1632.52,1634.46," opposition speaker. Here, here."
1640.46,1642.36," Hi, sorry, just need to set up my timer."
1648.36,1649.0, Sorry.
1653.68,1654.32, OK.
1661.94,1662.58, OK.
1662.94,1671.42," Also, hi, my pronouns are she, her, and please could you announce your POIs verbally,"
1671.42,1685.18," as I will not be keeping an eye on the chat. Okay, starting in three, two'm so sorry. OK."
1690.48,1695.4," OK, starting in three, two, one."
1696.16,1710.04," As opposition, we stand for a world where individuals have the power to stand as just that, individuals who have freed herself, actualised and pursued their own goals and dreams outside the expectation of the rest of their family unit."
1710.4,1718.5," We say that Propositions World undoubtedly appeads upon this, particularly for stakeholders who they have failed to address in the debate, such as women."
1718.86,1729.56," So in my speech, this is what I'm going to just, I am going to primarily outline. I'm going to address how the status of women is better off on our side of the house compared to what Proposition's world looked"
1729.56,1733.78," like so far in the debate. However, I would like to begin my speech with some rebuttal."
1734.22,1739.64," So we've had some interesting discourse so far from Proposition. They've talked about how,"
1740.54,1749.0, they've seemed to frame this debate in the point about whether or not family is something that is important or whether or not family is something that is needed.
1749.0,1765.24," They've talked about how without family people fail to find this meaningful existence in society because the friendships that they have are only conditional because they're based on the action and beliefs of the group. However,"
1769.56,1773.66," we believe that this characterization of the debate is not something that is actually quite true. We don't think this is a debate about whether or not family is a good thing, essentially,"
1773.78,1777.58, which is something they have failed to recognize. This is a debate about whether we think family
1777.58,1787.28," should be the dominant organization in society, i.e. whether everything that your actions in society, i.e. whether everything that your actions inside your intentions,"
1787.48,1792.96, your even individual identity should be tied primarily to your family.
1793.16,1796.28, This is what we believe is meant by dominant.
1796.48,1801.12," Therefore, bring back to that point about how they believe then that it is"
1801.32,1806.14, impossible because of this idea of friendship being conditional and contending with
1806.14,1812.38, the concept of family um we don't see how on our side of the house family and friendships are
1812.38,1817.02, something that should a family mother should have to choose from or prioritize also the house we
1817.02,1823.16, it's much more realistic that um we address their main points for a battle about um individuals not
1823.16,1827.22, being able to like get different opinions from
1827.22,1831.82, groups and friendships under our side of the house. We think because of how our side of
1831.82,1838.3, the house accommodates for an individual to pursue their identity through forging these
1838.3,1843.28," friendships with individuals, we believe the family as a whole is going to be something"
1843.28,1845.8, that is more greatly like um enriched
1845.8,1849.58, and diversified in opinion because of this interaction that they have from different
1849.58,1856.34, friendly groups and individuals therefore we fail to see how um we do not allow um for this
1856.34,1865.16, like different this different like formulation of opinions and identity is something that stands on their side of the house.
1873.56,1874.36," Also, they talked about how the importance of the community and they talked about how lack of like social,"
1880.9,1881.34," like how people learn from the family, the expectations of the community and social standards,"
1884.3,1885.3, because they no longer have this traditional setup of family.
1888.64,1888.88," No, thank you. This is something that leads quite lightly. It's my main debate,"
1895.74,1896.2," because we believe it is this traditional setup, indeed, that promote within the family,"
1901.72,1909.08," that serve to restrain the actions of the individual within itself, which is actually what I'm going to be talking about now about the role of women so therefore in conclusion what have we gathered so far from opposition stance in the debate"
1909.08,1915.92, we believe that their point about um we don't see how like a positive family familial relationship
1915.92,1920.54, can occur alongside pursuing like individuality and stuff because we don't think this is a debate
1920.54,1930.02, about whether or not family is important we think is about whether family should be centric to your life now main now on to my main uh points in the past because of family
1930.02,1934.92, being a dominant unit a dominant unit of organization for um we believe that traditional
1934.92,1941.66, gender roles were more oftenly more often imposed for example because of how historically um it was
1941.66,1946.0, examined how males and females were biologically composed historically this was
1946.0,1952.16, something that led because of the prioritization of safety and development to the children
1952.16,1956.88, it led to the implementation of these more generic gender roles for example men being expected to
1956.88,1961.76, work women being expected to stay at home with the children to provide we believe that
1963.04,1966.96, is it it was expected then to for women to spend a lot of time catering to the
1966.96,1972.24," needs of the family. No, thank you. Because it was rare to see women, and it's actually very rare to"
1972.24,1976.62," see women in the workplace, because if they were seen in the workplace, it was seen that they were"
1976.62,1982.34," not pushing this characterisation of safety and of their children, because instead of staying at"
1982.34,1985.2, home to fulfil this role of protection um they are
1985.2,1989.68, instead in work and therefore they are neglecting the needs of children in the family therefore
1989.68,1994.32, overall with this context of women being like this being family being the dominant role
1994.88,2000.48, stakeholder in society um women were seen as having a significantly lower status in society
2000.48,2005.3," and because of this segmentation stigmat in place, this was incredibly detrimental to"
2005.3,2010.54, the well-being of women and they were unable to pursue their self-individuality and go
2010.54,2016.94, into the workplace exploring more social time outside of the family because they were not
2016.94,2023.98, complying with this expectation of women. I'll take your POI now.
2023.98,2026.24, External social groups with influence exist in both worlds
2026.24,2030.32, families better because people care more about you compared to other groups why would people
2030.32,2033.6, only talk about you because your likes and everything in commas would actually care
2033.6,2037.76, thank you for your pi yeah we don't see how this is something that is exclusive under your side of
2037.76,2043.6, the house um because under your side has on our side of the house we are allowing for um people
2043.6,2050.46, not only to be out with their family to be to like be exist with as a part of a family we're allowing for them better to
2050.46,2055.08, explore their roles and individual so on our side of the house these two things coincide i don't
2055.08,2060.02, understand your point exactly then so um on prop side of the house this treatment of women women
2060.02,2065.2, is quite likely to continue because under their model as a tradition of a traditional family
2065.2,2069.52, um women are expected to continue to remain close to the family in this more traditional
2069.52,2075.2, manner because they're expected then to as prop suggested sacrifice their time and spend time with
2075.2,2080.88, um that spend time with their family and like cater to their needs of the people and we believe
2080.88,2085.0, then that um even if we consider the possibility that under.
2086.06,2110.16," Oh, sorry. OK, and we believe that it's unlikely then under their side of the house that women can be close and still work for most of the time if they're pushing this thing for women to be um and more like have more dominant role because under the state um and under the status quo so then under their side has"
2110.16,2114.96, women are more expected to stay at home and work there for the most of time whilst i'm under our
2114.96,2119.44, side of the house on on the status quo women can still be close and work with a family but their
2119.44,2125.3, whole life and the whole process um is not tied to this expectation of being centric to the family.
2126.68,2134.72," Therefore, on our side of the house, we provide better opportunity for women to explore this individualism and explore their lives outside of this maternal norm."
2134.94,2149.04," Because, A, if they are married, they do not have this stigmatisation of them anymore under our side of the house because they no longer need to spend all this time at home with their family because they won't be seen as not being dedicated to their family because we're not enshrining this"
2149.04,2154.14, dominance and sacrificing your individuality to the family. We believe that women deserve a life
2154.14,2159.24, to explore for themselves and therefore they're able to go out into the workplace and find the
2159.24,2163.92, individuality which is going to be as we proved better for the family as a whole because they can
2163.92,2165.64," come back and formulate their individual,"
2166.02,2172.86, their different individual opinions and they can contribute to providing these different opinions and stuff in the family.
2173.08,2177.14," And they'll be better members of society as a whole because of that. And if people, women are not married,"
2177.14,2181.74, they are not being pressurized into forming this family. So we believe this is important.
2181.96,2185.52," So therefore, in conclusion, our side of the house,"
2185.52,2187.6, it better supports the rights of women
2187.6,2189.92, because we are no longer expecting them to conform
2189.92,2193.12," to this norm of caring and catering for the family,"
2193.12,2195.96, which is why I urge you to oppose.
2198.24,2200.6, I thank the speaker for that fine speech.
2200.6,2202.12, And I would like to invite
2202.12,2212.64, the third proposition speaker here.
2214.08,2216.32," Hi, can everyone hear me well?"
2227.0,2252.04," Give me just 10 seconds to set my timer. I'll be preferring my POIs in the chat. Great. I'll be starting my speech in 3, 2, 1."
2252.86,2258.76," Panel, on both sides of the house, humans have biological and emotional tendencies to connect with other people."
2259.02,2262.9, That's important because they go through a lot of struggles that they can't solve alone.
2263.06,2266.24, So they search for other people to alleviate that pain.
2266.44,2269.92, So the most important matter of this debate is in which role do we get better
2270.12,2273.6, relationships and decisions in life? Two themes in my speech.
2273.8,2278.72," Firstly, on family relationships and second of all, on self identity and relationships."
2278.92,2280.68," Just before moving on to these clashes,"
2280.68,2283.28," let me just get a strategic clarification out of the debate,"
2283.48,2292.0, because their argument on women is very uncomparative and very symmetric because they say that they say about women being tied
2292.0,2297.12, about being tied to become housewives because they identify with the family values and that's
2297.12,2302.16, what what makes them close closing these relationships but we don't think that's not
2302.16,2306.7," that's not really intrinsic to the motion, but to the patriarchal values of men's superiority."
2306.7,2310.4," So in their side of the house, if that's not through family structures, we believe that"
2310.4,2320.18," they will still be an advantage through other social structures, such as workplace or other"
2320.18,2329.92," social groups that also have these patriarchal values, and will still be um a lot of crafts in these groups okay moving on to my first splash regarding family ties"
2329.92,2334.88, they say here that if you take away all the pressure and self-identification with your family
2334.88,2340.0, now uh you have better relationships with your family that's untrue because you're going to
2340.0,2345.52, identify with something either way that's and that's likely to be a community or social groups
2345.52,2349.92, apart from your family because people have social tendencies to look for places where they feel
2349.92,2355.2, understood so on their side of the house people will deprioritize their families so they will
2355.2,2359.76, have worse relationships because they'll have less connections and less incentives for example to
2359.76,2365.64, look for each other for examples in times of need so I don't trust my family anymore to have for
2365.64,2371.88, example when I'm feeling uh ill or when I'm passing through an economic struggle now I'll go through
2371.88,2376.08, another social group or for my friends or work or workplace individual or something like that
2376.8,2381.66, and on the comparative our games were important because on our side of the house at least we
2381.66,2389.44, identify with the social structure that's stronger and more likely to support you through struggles and hard times in life before moving on i feel like
2391.92,2396.64, yeah surely because we're pushing for more dominant um like a more dominant presence in
2396.64,2401.76, society and because of these existing biases in society women are more likely to be susceptible
2401.76,2406.08, to um this like misogyny because of the existing biases so
2406.08,2409.62, therefore they're going to be spending more time at home under your motion because of how they're
2409.62,2414.7, i see i see your point you say that family structures are inherently tied to the patriarchal
2414.7,2419.88, structures in society but we say that's not actually true because people are biased anyway
2419.88,2425.16," so even in your side of the house if these women don't get self-identified with their families,"
2425.24,2428.38, they will be self-identified with other social groups and these social groups will also have
2428.38,2433.46, biases and therefore they'll still suffer from misogyny and from sexism on your side of the
2433.46,2438.76," house. So that's actually symmetric. Okay, moving on then to my second clash about self-identification"
2438.76,2443.08," and relationships. They say two things here. Firstly, that identifying with your family"
2443.08,2450.48, makes you live your life for them. So all all of your decisions and um dreams are going to be tied to your family wishes and second
2450.48,2457.44, of all that this makes you take better this um taking yourself off this structure makes you
2457.44,2461.68, take better decisions especially for women which i've already said this isn't clear and that's
2461.68,2465.82, totally symmetric but a few responses firstly that's a
2465.82,2471.28, very little nuance that's a very little nuanced vision as to how families work it's not because
2471.28,2476.62, I need my family that I'll shape all of my actions according to their ones okay they will affect my
2476.62,2482.32, decisions but if there's something that that's really important for me I'll do it anyway even
2482.32,2485.36, in disclosure of my family so if i'm lgbt uh
2485.36,2491.28, person even then i even if my father of my mother they don't agree with that decision i can still
2491.28,2495.2, do that in my free time because i'm still an individual that can take individual decisions
2495.2,2502.4, apart from my family but having this identity is what makes me for example um stronger for example
2502.4,2506.06, when i'm going through a struggle or going through identity crisis I can
2506.06,2511.28, go to them I can talk to them and we've already shown incentives to the family uh parents or to
2511.28,2516.92, these family structures to actually accept you because that's everything they want so when you're
2516.92,2522.14, talking when you're talking about a world in which these people identify themselves with other social
2522.14,2525.54, groups we believe that these ties would be less strong.
2525.54,2529.86," So for example, it would be more easy, for example, not to accept me."
2529.86,2534.42," For example, when I'm talking about the LGBT community, for example, in your side of the"
2534.42,2540.2," house you say, okay, LGBTQ individuals should not identify themselves with their families."
2540.2,2545.16," So on your side of the house, you identify themselves with the LGBTQ plus community."
2545.42,2554.56," Even in this community, there are a lot of behavior standards in which if you don't fit in, you're not going to be loved and you're not going to be accepted anymore."
2554.66,2560.3," So, for example, if you're an LGBTQ person and you don't identify with your family anymore and you identify with the LGBT community,"
2560.5,2565.92, you are still going to be tied to a lot of standards and behaviors that are going to make
2565.92,2571.06, you less autonomous in your decisions and they will still in fact affect your decisions anyway.
2571.58,2575.7," So we believe that on our side of the house, you are still able to grow as an individual and have"
2575.7,2581.78," self-actualizations. I can still go through self-journeys, self-actualization journeys on"
2581.78,2588.0," our side of the house, especially because you have your families and family structure with you."
2588.0,2593.0, They will support you with all of your decisions.
2593.0,2598.0," And when you're going through, for example, existential struggles, you're going to have someone there that's not going to abandon you."
2598.0,2605.84, You know that because that's everything you have and that you are the only person that they have and they feel this biological and and this
2605.84,2611.76, biological and social bond that's not going to be uh thrown away because on their side of the house
2611.76,2616.48, you have these behavior changes that uh condition these relationships but second of all if you don't
2616.48,2621.36, identify with your family you need to identify with other things this looks like workers other
2621.36,2625.92, social groups so they will still affect your decisions anyway it is
2625.92,2631.28, it is better uh with your family because they're they have more incentives to uh keep together with
2631.28,2636.32, you and to support you either way what have you bought here then we said that families have more
2636.32,2641.6, incentives to stick together because one they have more stronger social biological bonds they have
2641.6,2650.68," lived all their lives together they have experienced things that nobody else has. For example, I have swapped my son's diapers. So I have this"
2650.68,2656.24," connection with them that's stronger than any, for example, friendship that you can have on"
2656.24,2660.04," the other side of the house. But second of all, we have unconditional love and unconditional"
2660.04,2666.48, affection within those families because of of these uh experiences that they've
2666.48,2671.88, lived together they have incentives for example to accept and support them in any decisions in
2671.88,2676.26, life because they know that when they're going they're going through these struggles they will
2676.26,2682.62, be helped um in the future and they will be helped anyway but second of all we have said the social
2682.62,2685.04, groups rely on behavioral patterns.
2688.12,2688.62," So that looks like, for example, the LGBT community."
2698.24,2710.8," Even though there might be a strong narrative to love yourself and love others, you'll still be conditioned to certain behavioral patterns that are going to inflict on your self-autonomy and self-actualization. Just as opposition tries to say that this doesn't happen in their scenario but i've already said that this um as well as symmetrical but it actually it's strong on their side of the house because these social groups and"
2710.8,2717.12, these other uh identities they are not forced for example to have you and to support you through all
2717.12,2721.84, decisions in life because you're not everything to them they have other members they have other
2721.84,2726.3," friends so on our side of the house your your parent does not have, for example,"
2726.54,2728.7, a million sons or a million opportunities.
2729.04,2730.82, They have to support you
2730.82,2735.64, and you have to love them for all of your life
2735.64,2738.08, because you have a better support system.
2738.26,2739.06, I'm very proud of those.
2741.84,2744.44, I thank the speaker for that fine speech
2744.44,2748.04, and I would like to invite the third opposition speaker.
2748.04,2748.54," Hear, hear."
2752.3,2755.88," I prefer my POIs verbally and my pronouns are she, her."
2758.56,2769.12," We think that proposition has completely mischaracterized how relationships outside of family look like on our side of the house. We think that relationships can still be loving and close within different situations,"
2769.5,2773.46," for example, in friendship groups, in school, or in the workplace. We don't refute the importance"
2773.46,2778.46," of family regarding a person's growth, but we do believe that the decisions of an individual"
2778.46,2782.9, should not be dependent on family. Proposition kept talking about how they think family is
2782.9,2794.0," important, and we do agree with it, but we don't understand how we are automatically giving up family relationships on our side of the house by also valuing other relationships such as friendships, and we don't think that's mutually exclusive."
2794.0,2808.14," I'm sure everyone here, while having a family, also has friends, and we don't think this debate is about whether friendship or familial relationships are stronger, but rather whether people should actively have more social interactions outside of family."
2808.22,2812.64," So two points of clash within this debate, firstly, on which side gets better relationships."
2812.96,2815.98," And secondly, which side is more beneficial towards the individuals themselves."
2816.56,2819.84," Firstly, moving on to the first clash on who gets better relationships."
2820.18,2828.68, What Prop told us was that they said that family has more incentives to take care of each other and basically a bunch of random advantages of family.
2828.98,2832.74, And also they said that people need to have a strong support system for challenges.
2833.26,2838.82, And our response towards that is that we do not deny the importance of family or how people need a good support system.
2839.0,2844.54," But what we're saying is that in addition to that, it is important that individuals still interact with other organizations."
2844.54,2850.4, We don't see how the advantages of family don't exist on our side of the house but we bring to
2850.4,2855.84, exclusively why we gain more benefits when people shift more focus to other social interactions
2855.84,2860.96, while still maintaining these close relationships with their families and we think that they also
2860.96,2869.58, completely misunderstood the status quo and told us that basically these relationships that exist outside of family is based on dynamic things.
2869.58,2873.6," And that people basically, if they're friends, they don't really care about each other."
2874.32,2880.56, They like people just don't care about others that are outside of their family and that these relationships are significantly weaker.
2880.86,2885.26," Our response towards this is that we think it's unlikely that, I'll take that later,"
2885.64,2890.04, we think that it's unlikely that relationships outside of family are weak and change dynamically.
2890.28,2894.48," Because firstly, for friendship groups to occur, we think that it's likely that people actually"
2894.48,2899.12, care about those who they interact with to a certain extent due to human nature. We think
2899.12,2903.14," that due to the challenges and flaws that individuals have, it is likely that people"
2903.14,2909.72, are sympathetic towards those they interact with daily life whether or not they are within their family I'll take it now
2910.74,2915.54, this debate is about a trade-off between who you must trust more and spend more time family or
2915.54,2920.34, others give with your burden of prioritizing other social groups in detriment of family that have
2920.34,2925.12, already got closer bonds to you we don't think this is a trade-off that we necessarily
2925.12,2929.48," have to make on our side of the house. Rather than that, we think that it is about like shifting"
2929.48,2934.7," focus, but we can equally prioritize two things. The motion is about whether family should be the"
2934.7,2938.98," main thing in life. We're telling you that you can have other priorities as well as family,"
2939.06,2942.58, and we don't think that we're completely disregarding family on our side of the house.
2942.58,2949.38, What we're saying is that we can have other things that occur at the same time. Moving back on to my point on why we think it's unlikely
2949.38,2954.62, that relationships outside of family are weak and change dynamically. We think that for relationships
2954.62,2958.72," to occur, it doesn't necessarily mean that your friends have to have like the same interest as you"
2958.72,2963.44," are like, or to have the same personality as you. For example, we think that there are people who"
2963.44,2968.58," have been friends for decades. And despite things changing dynamically throughout like this time, these"
2968.58,2972.76, people still are able to remain friends. And we think that this is based on the basis that like
2972.76,2977.48, they perhaps like encounter challenges together in their lives. And we don't think that by having
2977.48,2982.0," like sudden changes in interest, this will automatically lead to like relationships"
2982.0,2986.06, dismantling. We never received any analysis from proposition as
2986.06,2991.52, to why they think relationships depend on dynamic things and once the relationship um once that
2991.52,2997.46, changes the relationship suddenly dissolves um no thank you um and we think that the whole case
2997.46,3002.44, basically hinges on whether relationships outside of the family are weak and if that characterization
3002.44,3008.64, falls the whole case falls and we think that we have proved to you sufficiently why these relationships are not necessarily weak um
3008.64,3014.4, outside of family on the flip side we tell you on our side of the house well with family not being
3014.4,3019.52, the most dominant unit we have family being a stronger support system we have clearly told you
3019.52,3024.88, in first speaker how we think relationships work better within the family as it is less likely for
3024.88,3025.24," for individuals to feel that they're pressured to sacrifice their own freedom in achieving what's speaker, how we think relationships work better within the family, as it is less likely for"
3025.24,3029.5, individuals to feel that they're pressured to sacrifice their own freedom in achieving
3029.5,3034.14," what their family expects them to do, and instead have more space to explore what they"
3034.14,3038.86, actually want. And we think that this leads to less tensions because of less conflicts
3038.86,3042.66," between what the individual actually wants and what their family expects, and therefore"
3042.66,3049.12," it's less likely for conflict to occur. What proposition told us in response is that they think that, they tell us"
3049.12,3054.44," that like people will not prioritize their family anymore, and that they will have less incentive to"
3054.44,3058.42," take care of their family, therefore family relationships will become worse. Our response"
3058.42,3063.22, towards this is that we think it's very contradictive for a proposition to come up and
3063.22,3065.08," tell us that, because they have told us throughout"
3065.08,3070.1, their whole speech like in both first speaker and second speaker how that's like they think that
3070.1,3075.02, people have the incentive to take care of their family no matter who they are even if this family
3075.02,3080.2, has like very strict Christian values even if they belong to the LGBT community we still accept you
3080.2,3085.38, but then now they tell us that family like family members are no longer incentivized to
3085.38,3090.22, care about each other just because they have other friendships as well and we think that this
3090.22,3094.98, we think they need to solve this problem on their side of the house and even if we take them at
3094.98,3099.22, their best case and assume that all other interactions outside of family are weak and
3099.22,3107.02, dynamic and are over like and are just like completely unloving at all we still have better relationships on our side of the house
3107.02,3109.42, as we prove to you why family relations are better
3109.42,3112.16, on our side with less tensions occurring.
3112.16,3114.82," Therefore, all the benefits they say about family"
3114.82,3117.46, throughout their whole case are even more magnified
3117.46,3118.52, on our side of the house.
3118.52,3122.16, And we see that this leads us to winning this clash
3122.16,3124.42," because firstly, okay, I'll take your POI."
3126.26,3131.7, This is a debate about prioritization. You cannot have both. How will the relationships with
3131.7,3136.92, outside family affect your decisions better than the relationships within family?
3137.92,3142.22, I don't really understand your POI. We have told you throughout our whole case that we don't think
3142.22,3149.02," this is a trade-off that we necessarily need to make. We tell you that family and friendships are not mutually exclusive, and you"
3149.02,3154.06," have never really told us why you think that if we care about friendships, we automatically just"
3154.06,3158.54, have to disregard our whole family at all. We don't see how that happens. Moving back to why
3158.54,3162.2," we win this clash, firstly, we prove to you why friendships are not weak, and secondly, we prove"
3162.2,3168.6," to you why we still have family relationships, And we think this is important because the whole case hinges on the cis-partner relationships,"
3168.68,3172.2," and this is their main line of argument. So if we win this clash, we win this debate as a whole."
3172.44,3176.58, Then moving on to the second point of clash on benefits towards individuals. Proposition said
3176.58,3181.16, that it's bad that individuals socialize because they have to change themselves to be accepted.
3181.54,3188.56, Our response towards this is we don't think this is necessarily the case for most individuals we think that for people to actually become friends they usually accept
3188.56,3193.52, individuals for who they are and panel or even fellow fellow debaters i think we all have friends
3193.52,3197.92, that we value and in those instances we think i think it's very unlikely that we have to actually
3197.92,3202.88, change ourselves um in order to make friends for that to occur and secondly even if we assume that
3202.88,3208.6," some people may have to change themselves to be accepted, we think that is an overgeneralization of relationships. And most,"
3208.72,3213.1," and in most cases, people are able to attain loving relationships. But rather on the comparison,"
3213.24,3218.38, we tell you how individuals are better off on our society because of how we can see an improvement
3218.38,3224.06," status of women in the status quo. And they say that it's due to the patriarchal view of family,"
3224.06,3225.36," but we, in response, we tell you that it's due to the patriarchal view of family but we in response"
3225.36,3230.22, we tell you that it's because of the emphasis of family and the significance it has with one's
3230.22,3234.8, personal identity that people are actually expected to dedicate more time to family and
3234.8,3240.58, we think that this bias is actually perpetuated on their side of the house therefore we think that
3240.58,3246.9, all what basically what proposition said about like family being able to accept
3246.9,3251.16," people for who they are, we think that there's no analysis as to why this is going to happen."
3251.16,3255.62, And we think that this is insufficient to take out all our analysis on why people are
3255.62,3260.36," likely to be pressured to contribute to family. Therefore, we think that we're we win this"
3260.36,3265.36, debate and we are very proud to oppose.
3267.44,3268.8," I thank the speaker for that fine speech. And if everybody is ready,"
3268.8,3271.72, I would like to invite the opposition to reply.
3271.72,3301.28," Hear, 1. This is a regret motion. What we need to do is to look back"
3301.28,3306.88, and see what happened in the past and why that paradigm has changed and why do we
3306.88,3312.56, want to revert back to the old world so what are the metrics of judging this debate first of all
3312.56,3316.96, we'll look at what are the what are the problems and what was the problems and what are the
3316.96,3323.04, problems and secondly we'll look at who creates better benefits for individuals under the first
3323.04,3325.94, question what was the problem? We told you from
3325.94,3331.18, first speaker that the reason why family is no longer the dominant unit of organization in the
3331.18,3336.58," society is because we don't want to be directly linked to the family. As in like we don't want to,"
3336.62,3343.3," when we go out, we don't want to be identified as a member, as Wong's family per se, whereas I will"
3343.3,3345.5, identify myself as Millie for myself.
3345.5,3351.12, And I do all the decisions. I will not prioritize my family's
3351.12,3357.7," benefits, but rather I would prioritize my own will and engagement and"
3357.7,3361.9, self-actualization in this paradigm. They have never really engaged with
3361.9,3365.84," our analysis of the importance of individualism,"
3366.34,3368.34, then let's look at their problem.
3368.56,3373.04, So today it's in PROP's responsibility to tell us what are the problems in the status quo
3373.04,3375.08," and why do they want to change it, right?"
3375.08,3380.9, So the whole case on PROP is based on the premise that they had better relationships with family in the past
3380.9,3383.08, before the change of the status quo happened.
3383.36,3385.04, But the only mechanism that they gave
3385.04,3390.4, us is that family is not adopt if the family is not a dominant unit of organization in the society
3390.4,3394.16, it means that you will spend less time with your family therefore relationship with your family
3394.16,3398.64, will deteriorate right that's the only sole mechanism they have given us but first they have
3398.64,3403.84, never proven to us why there's a problem with the status quo other than the one-liner of individuals
3403.84,3410.0, are lonely therefore they need intimate relationship with others then they force us into having this choice between
3410.0,3414.64, either you can rely on your family or you there or either you could rely on your friends after we
3414.64,3419.44, don't think there's a problem in the status quo uh at all with the individual with the individuality
3419.44,3424.0, being embraced and we don't think there's a detachment within the society for the people
3424.0,3425.28, like uh in the status quo we just don't think this is happening detachment within the society for the people like in the status quo
3425.28,3426.72, We just don't think it is happening
3426.72,3433.4," So since that the problem that they're trying to solve doesn't even stand therefore the whole case contingent on this problem also falls, right?"
3433.4,3435.66, We don't see people are being detached from the society
3435.66,3440.18, We don't think there's enough analysis why this problem is happening and why do we need to?
3440.76,3446.32," Change the current status quo and we tell that even if we engage with their best case,"
3446.32,3450.64," onto our second point on who creates the most benefits for individuals, we tell that even if"
3450.64,3456.64, we engage their best case and assume that improving relationships with others is the
3456.64,3460.32," most important thing that we need to justify, we tell that this is actually symmetrical on"
3460.32,3465.3," both sides, right? I have analyzed to you how good relationships"
3465.3,3466.96, are also happening in the status quo
3466.96,3469.96, with family not being the dominant unit of organization.
3469.96,3473.2," In fact, I've spent like my whole point telling you"
3473.2,3478.2," why individuals, why family and individuals"
3478.92,3481.7, will have a better harmonized family
3481.7,3483.3, because they understand each other
3483.3,3485.52, and because family is willing to give
3485.52,3490.9, individuals space to develop themselves when they're not seeing family as their sole purpose
3490.9,3496.36," in life. And now we have told you, and on top of that, on our side, we have told you unique"
3496.36,3503.64," benefits that individuals can achieve a better actualization, maturity, etc, etc. But let's take"
3503.64,3505.48," a step back and assume that symmetrical,"
3506.04,3510.82," it's a symmetrical, like the benefits that I get is symmetrical given the nuance of characterization"
3510.82,3515.96, of family. Let's say that this family is extremely open and understanding to their kids and our
3515.96,3521.36, benefits are symmetrical on both sides. So what? This characterization can be happening on our side
3521.36,3530.24, in the status quo as well. We tell them that this is the prompt responsibility to prove to us that why status quo is bad and why do we need to revert back to the old paradigm.
3530.24,3534.24, We don't think they have done their job so therefore we win because we don't see a problem
3534.24,3538.56, with status quo. We prioritize individuality before family but we still respect the intimate
3538.56,3546.84," relationship with family members. On the other hand we have proven to you the benefits to the family, the benefits to"
3546.84,3551.94," individuals and benefits to women which they have not even addressed. So therefore, I'm incredibly"
3551.94,3558.5, proud to oppose. Thank you. I thank the speaker for that fine speech and I would like to invite
3558.5,3568.62," the last speaker of this round, the proposition reply. Here, here. Okay, I'm going to start my speech in two seconds. Just"
3568.62,3585.0," gonna put my timer on. Okay, so I will start my speech in three, two, one. Panel, the clarification for this debate reads,"
3585.6,3588.72," union of organization societies, which means family,"
3589.04,3592.12," is a combine of people that you identify with,"
3592.6,3595.22," that you're likely to spend time with, and act together."
3595.44,3598.26, This means that there is a clear trade-off in this debate
3598.26,3602.08," that in order for you to have your family as a dominant part of your life,"
3602.18,3604.88, you need to be actually part of their lives.
3604.88,3609.94," So opposition team has run away from this wording, but now engaging with the actual debate."
3610.16,3615.04," So this debate is about the trade-off between who you must trust more and spend more time with,"
3615.68,3620.86, so your family in our side of the house or other people. This means that opposition is actually
3620.86,3630.82, mixing the comparative in this debate because you're not actually able to have both at the same time. But what does the world look like? Our
3630.82,3635.48, counterfactual is the one that we have stronger foundations and relationships due to the fact
3635.48,3641.36," of being closer to our family. Because time, attention, love is a scarce source in both"
3641.36,3650.0," worlds. The difference is that, but that only in our side of the house we have actual people who are able to spend these scarce resources with us, our family."
3650.0,3659.0," What happens in their quintessential, the one that is the status quo, who has individualistic relationships, people who only care about what you can give to them,"
3659.0,3665.2," is the one that when you do not prioritize your family and because of that you do not have a strong connection with them,"
3665.44,3669.86," you do not actually have this scarce resource of love, passion, and attention."
3670.0,3675.3," Because if they're not able to give what they want from you, you do not deserve their love."
3675.6,3677.72, So engage with the main clashes of this debate.
3678.78,3680.72, So which world has better relationships?
3681.06,3692.1," In our side of the house, we have people who love you no matter what, but most important, they care about who you truly are, not depending on what you can give back to"
3692.1,3697.54, them or what you believe in or what your actions are. You have strong relations because you do not
3697.54,3710.64," depend on momentary relationships and fragile relationships. In their set of the housing comparisons, they have their fundamental principle of relationships is how useful you are,"
3711.04,3716.0," what are your interests in your personality. They rely on how you're able to be accepted by people,"
3716.0,3721.34," not because who you are, but because who they want you to be. So when they say that we have"
3721.34,3731.66," a more controlling world, they are lying because the control world only happens when you have to adapt yourself every day to be accepted by the group of friends who do not care about who you truly are."
3731.66,3748.82," Your family, no matter what, will actually love you because family is a strong bond that does not rely on simple actions like dressing the way you should or talking the way you should or think the way you should to be accepted. So we went through clashes of relationships. But about"
3748.82,3752.26," the clashes of which world is better, who you should rely on."
3752.64,3757.2," But look, in our world, we can rely better on families. We believe that there are dominant"
3757.2,3761.48," groups in both sides of the house. The difference is that in our comparative, it's better because"
3761.48,3765.04," families, as we already have explained to you, have the best interest for your life."
3765.26,3770.4, And this only happens in our world because we prioritize their more because they're directly connected with.
3770.66,3775.06," So this means that when you choose to spend more time with your family, you're likely to be closer to them."
3775.06,3784.3, They're not able to do this because they choose to live lives with closer connections to fragile friends and to people who are not actually inherent to your family.
3784.48,3786.16," So panel, how should we disobey?"
3786.44,3788.56, You should just answer two basic questions.
3788.9,3790.06, Which world do you prefer?
3790.34,3793.8," Do you prefer to have a family next to you every time you need when you do not have money,"
3793.88,3796.68, when you do not have someone to be there for you?
3796.72,3800.02, Or do you choose to have your friends that are only there because they think that you
3800.02,3804.6," can give them back, because they think you can give something back to them?"
3804.72,3809.26, I choose my family that is always there for me I choose my family that does not that does not care
3809.26,3816.3, about me spending eight hours a day debating because she knows it knows that I'm I'm I'm I'm
3816.3,3822.7, strong enough and I do matter for that my my life my love does not needs to be addressed because I'm
3822.7,3827.32, useful it needs to be addressed because I'm useful. It needs to be addressed because I'm important. My family is the only one that sees me that way.
3829.24,3832.96, Okay. I would like to thank everybody for this debate.
3833.98,3837.14, We are going to go into deliberation now.
3837.14,3839.6, So the teams please stay in this room.
3839.6,3842.72," We will be back in like 15, 20 minutes."
3842.72,3843.9, Oh yeah.
3844.94,3850.08," Does anybody know, like do I just now stop recording?"
3850.08,3857.38," Will it be sent to org? Or will it be on my computer? I've never done, like, what happens?"
3857.38,3865.64," It's going to be on your computer. My computer. Okay, cool."
3865.64,3869.84, So I'll just stop it if it deletes itself.
3869.84,3872.8, I'm very sorry if it does not delete itself.
3873.46,3874.7, Fantastic.
3874.7,3876.66, But like I'm not
