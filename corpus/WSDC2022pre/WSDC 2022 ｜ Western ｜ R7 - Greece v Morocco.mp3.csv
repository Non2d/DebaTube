0.0,5.72, I'd like to invite the first speaker of the proposition to open this debate.
63.62,67.0," No, sorry, you're not audible. We're just changing our microphone, just give me a sec."
67.0,70.0," Okay, now we can hear you."
70.0,72.0, Can you hear me now?
72.0,76.0," Yeah, yeah, we can. Yeah, no, it's okay."
76.0,89.44," So, okay. you at all okay so since i am not able let me second timer realizing the job please and"
90.88,97.84, i will start my speech in three two okay the six decades since africa decolonized have been filled
97.84,104.4, with crippling poverty violent and even genocidal dictatorships and shamping offices we would rather
104.4,107.24, live in a world where af Africa had followed a different path.
107.86,110.8, So this house prefers a world in which post-colonial African states
110.8,114.32, had prioritized achieving economic and land reparations
114.32,116.96, over enshrining civil and political rights.
118.06,122.16," Before definition, post-colonial Africa covers 52 states."
122.16,126.64," This debate is not on the specific individual policies pursued in each state, but on the"
126.64,131.94, structural differences between pursuing economic reform or enshrining civil rights in a broad
131.94,132.94, postcolonial context.
132.94,139.66," This is a retrospective debate, but with the benefit of hindsight in how situations evolve"
139.66,142.76, when evaluating which options should have been prioritized.
142.76,148.0, Economic and land reparations are ways to transfer economic power to the masses of the country.
148.0,165.84," This looks like anything from seizing land or nationalizing corporations that were held by colonial masters, and distributing the land or wealth to the people all right to participate in democracy, like freedom"
165.84,170.96," of speech, right to vote, and right to fair trial through the constitution."
170.96,172.56, So three arguments from Kintra position.
172.56,175.76," First, how this leads to an immediate increase in prosperity."
175.76,178.1," Second, how this leads to state building."
178.1,182.24, And my partner will explain to you how we limit neocolonialism.
182.24,186.0, So first argument on how this leads to immediate increasing prosperity.
186.0,191.0," Why do economic rights matter to individuals? Firstly, day-to-day life improvement."
191.0,197.0," If you had given these people land to their name, they would have been able to utilize this land for survival."
197.0,201.0," For example, they would have been able to cultivate their land and feed their children."
201.0,205.44," This matters especially in post-colonial Africa, when during the 60s,"
205.44,211.44," 45% of child deaths in Africa was due to malnutrition, while at the same time it held the biggest"
211.44,216.82," level of agricultural exports in the world. On the comparative, what happened under opposition"
216.82,221.12, was giving those people freedom of speech to ask for food without giving them the benefit
221.12,222.12, immediately.
222.12,225.84, Second reason why economic rights matter is independence.
225.84,230.64," If you had given these people economic reparations, it would have enabled them to act independently"
230.64,235.92, by giving them options from ownership of land that would allow them to sell it or start trading or
235.92,240.96, open up a business to cash transfer that would give them stable income and control of their
240.96,245.88," future. On a principal level, we restore their autonomy because they are finally"
245.88,251.1, recognized as people who can make choices. This is something they were deprived of by colonialists.
251.1,256.62," On the comparative, opposition as a form of compensation gave these people rights they could"
256.62,262.68," not utilize to maximize their choices for two reasons. Firstly, lack of democratic institutions."
262.68,266.0," For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state. And secondly, lack of democratic institutions. For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state."
266.0,274.0," And secondly, lack of democratic traditions. For people in power, it was difficult to understand their powers derived from the people."
274.0,282.0," And for the people, this meant accepting the complex of democracy, like being on the losing side of elections and having to accept majority control."
282.0,285.28, This is complex for them to understand so third
285.28,290.88, reason why economic rights mother to individual is trusting the system because the outcome of having
290.88,295.52, day-to-day improvements and independence is that these people would have started to see immediate
295.52,301.04, change and tangible benefits to their lives on the comparative when rights didn't give them immediate
301.04,307.8, benefits they ended up doing the system that didn't give them what's promised in the chart piece.
308.12,309.16, So economic
310.32,312.4, so economic rights are the first priority.
312.96,316.68, Why immediately after the colonization is a narrow window in time
316.68,318.96, for the opportunity to get these rights.
318.96,319.6, Two reasons.
319.6,321.76," First, the momentum of the colonization."
322.0,325.6," When the colonization happened, there was a situation of political power"
325.6,330.4, so with new institutions in the way it would have made sense for a distribution of economic power
330.4,335.36, to have been part of that process as well. On the comparative what happened under opposition
335.36,340.48, by postponing land reparations was establishing a new state that reflected the older colonial
340.48,346.96," economic order. So when South Africa is now doing it during the colonization, but now it's"
346.96,352.4, targeting part of the elite instead. So initially it said it would happen in five years under
352.4,358.32," Parisians, but now the target has changed to 35 years later. So the second reason why now is the"
358.32,362.72," right time to do it, why after the colonization is the right time to do this, is that elites were"
362.72,369.6," at their weakest. Because right after the colonization, they had time to do this is that elites were at their weakest because the right because right after the colonization they had part of economic wealth but they didn't yet have"
369.6,375.24, the opportunity to establish their control over the new government so opposition allowed the
375.24,380.34, elites to establish political power without challenging economic power so pursuing economic
380.34,385.0, operations to start would have meant less powerfully to oppose this process.
385.0,397.0," So, for example, Ghana that prioritized political reform and only tried cross transfer programs 10 years after independence, at which point they had established political power and could make sure to get the majority of funds."
397.0,406.0," Well, in that case, it would have been much easier to have a successful cash transfer program immediately when elites power was not so much a trench in"
406.0,413.12, society now moving on to the second argument about state building where economic rights reparations
413.12,419.6, likely to create a more stable state than civil and political rights before all that argument
419.6,426.48, i will accept the poi you keep talking about how you will be achieving all these great impacts for vulnerable
426.48,431.36, people in the post-colonial states but you never explain to us how you're going to be doing these
431.36,436.56, things. How is the land going to be distributed and by whom? Who is going to be deciding who gets
436.56,449.5," the cash in that colonial state? Who is going to be leading? Okay, so well there are land reparations have a defined process of happening."
449.5,454.08, You have the new state that has been assigned the role of distributing the land to the people
454.08,455.08, as fairly as possible.
455.08,460.48," And since under our city we make it a priority, then all political capital, all the focus"
460.48,464.74," would be on how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest,"
464.74,465.76," to the most vulnerable. These things would be the how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest, to the most vulnerable."
465.76,468.58, These things would be the criteria for starting this.
468.58,475.68," And in fact, this was in our model from the get go about how this looks like nationalizing companies, for example, to distribute wealth to the masses."
475.68,482.98, Now moving on to my second argument about state building. Why economic rights are likely to create more stable states than civil and political rights?
482.98,486.66," Because to have stability in the system, you need to have people buying and support."
486.66,490.2, So when politicians promise that people's lives will become
490.2,494.24," better and actually they don't, the system loses credibility."
494.24,496.44, So what happened is people were expecting
496.44,498.42," change improvements in their day to day life,"
498.42,501.6," but when promise of meaningful rights never materialized,"
501.6,503.46, they lost faith in the system.
503.46,505.04," On the comparative, if you had given these"
505.04,508.48, people a piece of land the system wouldn't have been perfect but they would at least have done
508.48,513.28, to be improving was it important firstly this led to uprisings by the people who were disappointed
513.28,517.68, by the system which political leaders responded with martial law and violent oppression for
517.68,524.16, example in vongo mobutu had 33 300 000 civilians in that instance people neither had economic
524.16,525.68, prosperity nor did they enjoy the
525.68,530.24," rights they were promised to get. Secondly, when things go wrong, people needed someone to blame"
530.24,533.84," and because there were societies that were deeply ethnically divided, they started blaming each"
533.84,538.4," other, leading to incredibly bloody civil wars and even genocides. For example, in Rwanda,"
538.4,544.08, Tutsis controlled a lot more land than the Hutus and the fact that it was never redistributed led
544.08,549.2, to conflict which escalated to genocide. On on the comparative when you have a small business you don't want economic
549.2,554.08, activity to be interrupted by coffee so there is less chance of this happening so where are we
554.08,559.2, likely to create more accountability because we it's because we decrease the symmetry of power
559.2,564.16, between people and the government it's important because colonialism created ethnic divisions with
564.16,567.36, local elites that benefited from their regimes because not just the colonial masses that
567.36,571.68," pressured the people. For example in Rwanda, Belgium chose to rule over the Hutus and now"
571.68,576.96," we increase accountabilities from the Hutus to the Tutsis because now, because we give them land,"
576.96,580.24," they can actually have an influence in government because they're the ones that pay taxation,"
580.24,584.32," contribute to the state budget. So even if you buy the idea of democracy is better,"
584.32,585.1, you think the democracy is democracy is better you you
585.1,589.12, think the democracy is good on the other side you have more accountability so for more accountability
589.12,598.72, and better state building where you can vote so I'd like to thank the first speaker of the
598.72,605.98, proposition for their speech and assuming the panel is ready I would like to invite the first speaker of the opposition.
607.94,609.18, Am I clear and audible?
611.18,612.54," You are, both."
617.78,619.78," Three, two, one."
620.2,623.54, There is a reason why the majority of post-colonial African states
623.54,628.48, did not prioritize economic and land reparations over enshrining civil and political rights.
628.88,631.58, We Moroccans know this truth way too well.
632.16,639.06," Subject to decades of dehumanization, the most important thing was for these nations to give their citizens their autonomy back."
639.06,645.12, We stand for a pragmatic approach that would not have wasted limited political capital on controversial
645.12,649.52, and polarizing economic redistribution when those nations are already fragile enough.
650.32,655.52," Today I will do four things in my speech. First of all, I'll plan our stance for this debate."
655.52,659.36," Second, I will rebut the opposition's case. Third, I will present my first argument about"
659.36,664.32," the importance of civil and political rights. And fourth, I will present my second argument"
664.32,665.52, about the practicalities
665.52,670.8, of economic and land reparations so let's start with my our team's stance our stance in this
670.8,675.52, debate is very simple we prefer a world that largely resembles the current status quo one
675.52,680.56, where the majority of post-colonial african states prioritized enshrining civil and political rights
680.56,685.42," such as rights to protest vote free, free speech, and forming associations, overachieving"
685.42,690.62," economic and land reparations, such as active land redistribution, quotas, and cash transfers."
691.1,695.08," That is not to say we think that those things are bad, but with limited political capital,"
695.34,698.2, we believe our side is both more important and more pragmatic.
698.8,704.16," When we talk about prioritize, we mean governments, civil society groups, and local populations"
704.16,705.32, doing this through government
705.32,711.06," charities or any other vehicle for change. Now let's move on to the rebuttal. First rebuttal,"
711.42,716.12," you spoke about economic land reparations means saving land, nationalizing corporations,"
716.54,720.52," and distributing the land. First of all, who will decide who gets the land? How is that distributed"
720.52,728.72," and by whom? Without elections and without a proper democratic process, it is very likely for there to be unequal distribution to happen first of all due to corrupt leaders that"
728.72,733.92, take control and all the other issues that occur in these post-colonial states without actual
733.92,738.64, proper governments the people need to have the right to vote plus civil rights in order to
738.64,743.28, organize themselves in a group in groups and voice their opinions on this and be able to have proper
743.28,745.36, discourse and have actual say
745.36,750.72, in how that land is distributed and b after colonization states are very unstable and very
750.72,755.76, vulnerable to corruption the prop tells you in response to our poi that they will have land
755.76,760.72, distribution but land distribution can only be successful it's the only case where it's
760.72,766.0, successful is in a structured state with structured stable work union or
766.0,770.96, election or some kind of political system that is only developed through political rights on our
770.96,775.28, side of the house so our side of the house actually does more land distribution over long
775.28,780.56, term than their side does later on secondly economic rights you spoke about the day-to-day
780.56,784.32, life improvements the biggest issue is that these guys give you the impact of economic rights but
784.32,787.42, never explain to you how these impacts are achieved. How are these
787.42,791.4," economic rights going to be given? Third, the right to vote is meaningless, they said. Well,"
791.44,795.4," we tell you that's exactly the opposite. Without voting, without having civil rights, people remain"
795.4,800.34, dehumanized and unheard. Vulnerable minorities like women and children will not have their
800.34,804.6, voices heard on their side. How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need? You
804.6,808.64," simply cannot without a proper political system. Fourth, you speak about space building."
808.64,812.72, The promise of meaningful rights never materializes. People are given lands. You never
812.72,817.44, give a reason why meaningful rights will never materialize on our side of the debate. Why will
817.44,821.76, civil rights not be promised? You also never give the likelihood to which economic rights could be
821.76,827.2," achieved. I'm intuitively led to understand your impacts, but I do not believe that they are likely to happen because you never"
827.2,832.64, explain why land is more achievable to give to people than civil rights. Now let's move on to
832.64,837.44, the first argument. Let's speak about the importance of civil and political rights in these societies.
837.44,841.68, There are a few reasons why we believe that civil and political rights were the most important thing
841.68,846.7, for African states to prioritize in their postcolonial periods? I'll be answering this in three different points.
846.88,851.34," First of all, this is what citizens in colonial periods were most denied."
851.96,855.56," Many colonial rulers, be it British, French, Spanish, or whoever,"
856.0,858.4," often operated in these countries by a certain control,"
858.68,861.22, without any limited or democratic input from citizens.
861.62,864.46," Where citizens had a say, it was often limited to the most elite"
864.46,868.22, or those who supported the colonial regime. This was done in order for those colonial
868.22,872.82," forces to maintain their power. However, this denied the majority of citizens their fundamental"
872.82,877.48," autonomy, the thing they craved the most, their capacity to vote for their representation,"
877.48,882.04," their capacity to simply express their political opinion, and as a result, it was the most"
882.04,885.32, important thing to take back after that colonial period is over.
887.3,887.58," Of course, people care about their convict status too."
888.38,888.66, We don't say that they don't.
894.06,894.1," However, there is a reason why middle-class citizens agitate for change and dictatorship for one-party faiths."
900.14,900.8, They desire the fundamental human dignity that comes with being able to express your free will in society and political system.
913.0,920.0," Secondly, these rights are necessary for some of the most vulnerable groups. Women, sexual minorities, and ethnic minorities often face massive discrimination in post-colonial societies, often as a relic imposed from conservative Western rulers. Civil and political mechanisms were often the only way these groups could bring attention to their struggle, whether it be through free speech, protest, or otherwise."
920.0,925.0," Three, these rights were crucial to prevent democratic backslide in post-colonial states."
925.0,930.0," For many African nations, the post-colonial period represented their first attempts for decades or centuries at self-governance."
930.0,935.0," Whilst many nations thrived, many nations faced challenges due to democratic cronyism."
935.0,943.0, Only strong political rights provided the mechanism to check this democratic backlash and ensure fragile institutions do not completely crumble.
943.0,951.36," Before I move on to my second argument, I'll take your POI now. If leaders are corrupt enough not to be able to do land redistribution,"
951.88,957.86," why wouldn't, for the example, rig the election, making any right to vote completely meaningless?"
958.48,962.38," Well, simply, I'll give you the example of Morocco. Morocco focused on land redistribution"
962.38,965.92," after colonial states, where the people in power were the elites in the society."
966.2,969.06, They took all the land for themselves and did redistribute it properly.
969.42,972.64," However, on our side of the debate, political rights are the first thing looked at."
972.78,979.9," Therefore, the people elected are through the consensus and the votes of all the people around them, not simply by being elite or being a general in society."
980.06,983.86," Therefore, they have their structured people that were put in place by their people."
984.16,989.82," They were chosen by their people and have a much, much higher chance of being less corrupt due to being in a politically correct system."
990.16,994.72, Now let's move on to argument number two. We speak about the practicalities of economic and land reparations.
995.0,1001.38," Even if you don't believe my previous arguments, we think that to a large extent, postcolonial African states should prioritize pragmatism."
1001.68,1008.96, And there are many reasons why economic and land reparations are far less practical than civil and political rights. I'll be answering this in two points.
1008.96,1013.52," First of all, in many cases it will simply be done right and possible to achieve economic and land"
1013.52,1017.68," reparations. I'll be expanding about this in four different points. First of all, land reparations"
1017.68,1021.6, is probably the worst case for opposition. Take for example the case of South Africa. Given the
1021.6,1034.0," significant overlap between post-pollinism and apartheid, advocating for any land redistribution is away from white landowners would not only have been unsuccessful due to the massive influence of white landowners such as farmers,"
1034.0,1048.54," but this might have been a very real chance of inciting significantly further violence as individuals felt their very livelihoods were threatened. B, taking even a less contentious example, even quotas or cash transfers in the majority of African societies would have been seen as"
1048.54,1052.02, contentious due to the perceived nature of them taking from one group and giving to another.
1052.28,1057.28," C, this is not the case with civil and political rights, which are not zero-sum, which is exactly"
1057.28,1061.14," what they're proposing. That is, if you give rights to one group, you don't need to take it"
1061.14,1065.88," away from another group, whereas that is necessarily the case with any form of economic distribution,"
1066.18,1068.44," which of course leads to conflicts and tension in the country,"
1068.66,1073.0, which is especially bad for these fragile new countries that are still developing.
1073.42,1076.04, The conclusion of this is that governments and civil society groups
1076.04,1078.08," would have not only wasted their limited political capital,"
1078.5,1082.72, but may have actively risked further destabilization and violence in many fragile societies.
1083.0,1084.26, And that is their only impact.
1084.74,1089.04," Secondly, in the long term, we think that it's actually easier to achieve economic rights"
1089.04,1092.72," through stable political rights. For example, when you're able to freely form associations"
1092.72,1096.16, like unions you can advocate for worker protection or you're able to freely vote
1096.88,1101.36, for a party that represents your actual interests you can vote for the best economic policies.
1101.36,1109.52, And PropsWorld is one where at best best we have achieved some economic redistribution but not prioritized a long-term mechanism to continue to achieve economic benefits
1109.52,1113.92, once those needs evolve in the future only our side does so and that's why i'm extremely proud
1113.92,1187.0, to support today thank you thanks to the first speaker of the opposition and now we continue with the second speaker of the government side you You're not audible.
1187.0,1195.0, Am I audible now?
1195.0,1196.0," Yep, now you are."
1196.0,1218.0," Thank you. Okay, so"
1218.0,1228.02, under our side of the house we have more people immediately and right now being fed. We might not be able at their scenario to
1228.02,1233.6," say that someone's child is being hungry, but what we can do is feed that child because these people"
1233.6,1240.22," are more likely to have land to cultivate, to sell their crops and to be able to have a normal life."
1240.48,1245.1, Because we're talking about two very bad situations but we think that what is better off
1245.1,1250.92, is for these people to be able to have these this well-being because the reason why why democracy
1250.92,1255.84, would care about society is for the well-being and we think that the end goal of both sides should be
1255.84,1261.6, the well-being of the African people before going on into my argument about limiting neocolonialism
1261.6,1267.1, rebuttal four main things firstly opposition is telling us that we are going
1267.1,1272.96," to have unequal distributions because of corrupt leaders, but that people need to group and have a"
1272.96,1276.94, say and decide together where there are not these land reparations are going to happen.
1277.72,1283.42," Firstly, we think that the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them"
1283.42,1289.38," to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to do this land distribution"
1289.38,1291.12, under our side of the house.
1291.12,1294.42, Because these are the people that are more likely to assume power.
1294.42,1299.58, The people that are leading the independence movements are the ones that usually are elected
1299.58,1303.68, in the beginning of these democracies because these are the most known people and in the
1303.68,1305.04, same way they
1305.04,1310.44, would usually assume power under our side of the house as well so if these people are so corrupt
1310.44,1315.48, then that is also the way that they corrupt these democracies that they're able to then change the
1315.48,1322.44, constitutions so but what do we change here is the second response having these same people under
1322.44,1326.0," our side of the house we have more accountability for these people,"
1326.36,1331.98," exactly because the states are now more dependent on the people, care more about the people,"
1332.14,1334.0," because they have something to offer, right?"
1334.12,1338.52," Because now that these people have land, now that these people are paying taxes,"
1338.88,1342.22," they're not just a burden to the state asking for shelter and food,"
1342.42,1345.04, but they're actually something that the state is dependent on
1345.04,1351.84, on the comparative it is very easy to like dismiss their civil and political rights when they can
1351.84,1357.6, just say that these people are not as important because we don't get our money from these people
1357.6,1362.8, let's change the constitution it's much harder to have accountability when the state is not
1362.8,1366.18," dependent on them but third thirdly, even if you"
1366.18,1371.96," buy that under our sort of the house, we have more corruption, right? We still get the benefits of"
1371.96,1378.46," having at least some kind of land distribution, at least some kind of more cash towards these people."
1378.8,1384.64," So on the immediate level, these people are better off because they're less hungry, because they're"
1384.64,1385.54," able to use their money to invest in hungry, because they're able to use their"
1385.54,1390.62," money to invest in things, because they're able to have autonomy in their decisions. But secondly,"
1390.96,1395.92," because we have more stability in that place in general, exactly because of the fact that they're"
1395.92,1402.58," not leaving to have conflicts, that we have less, we even told you about why genocide is less likely"
1402.58,1406.0," to happen because of this stability, which is very important."
1406.0,1413.0," So even if you buy that corruption, we still think that it is very important to have these economic reparations prioritised."
1413.0,1417.0," But secondly, opposition is telling us that people lose their voices."
1417.0,1425.14," But we think that, as I said in my introduction, it's not as important for people to lose their voices when we're talking about people that do"
1425.14,1431.04, not have like basic things to begin with we think that these people need to have these reparations
1431.04,1437.54, need to have this land and need to be able to like have to have this immediate benefits right now
1437.54,1443.52, but thirdly opposition is telling us that the reason why they want civil rights is because
1443.52,1446.0, this is what people were mostly denied
1446.0,1451.6, because they did not have a say like during colonialism which we think to an extent is true
1451.6,1457.2, right like during colonialism former colonial powers did not give people the ability to have
1457.2,1462.4, a say and to have political liberties but the reason why this was harmful is because they also
1462.4,1470.64, didn't give them a way to take control of their resources to take like to be able to decide what is going to happen with their land which is taking
1470.64,1475.92, away the the idea that these people have ownership over their land when they didn't let them decide
1475.92,1480.64, what to do with their minds what to do with their agriculture this meant that these people now don't
1480.64,1485.2, feel like their land is theirs so in order to be able to have civil and political
1485.2,1489.58," rights, even in the long term, if you buy that this is something ideal, we need these people"
1489.58,1495.0, to feel like what they're deciding on is something that is theirs. And this will not happen if you
1495.0,1499.06," don't give them the ownership, right? Because the ownership is what they have been missing"
1499.06,1504.94," for all of these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistribution"
1504.94,1505.1," are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another. these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistributions"
1505.1,1509.18, are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another.
1509.7,1513.88," We think that firstly, it is harmful that the examples that they gave us are of things like"
1513.88,1519.84," South Africa, which have been delayed and delayed again and again, exactly because they let time"
1519.84,1524.1," pass, which now makes it harder to do this redistribution because it seems like you're"
1524.1,1527.0, taking away this from the elites and not from the colonial powers.
1527.0,1533.0," But secondly, we think that this is exactly why land redistributions cannot happen later on."
1533.0,1539.0, And we need to prioritize them in the beginning because this is when we have more turmoil going on in society.
1539.0,1546.62, This is when we have a general thing of like changing the way that society exists and generally of trying
1546.62,1551.38, to make reparations taking stuff away from the colonial powers especially when we have
1551.38,1556.46, when we live in a society where a lot of decolonization happened in the same time period before moving
1556.46,1558.16, on into my argument i'll take the point
1558.16,1573.76, okay so no point now my argument is about limiting neocolonialism. This argument is going to prove that prioritizing economic reparations is necessary to limit the instincts of the former colonial power.
1574.04,1585.44," Even 60 years after decolonization, colonial powers are still benefiting from the extraction economies that they created, which is why France is dominating Cameroon's agriculture and selling in their own markets."
1585.44,1590.16," This means that even though the colonization ended formal political control, it did not end economic"
1590.16,1594.96," control, since a lot of the assets remained in the harm of the former colonial power or their local"
1594.96,1601.36, collaborators. How does economic presence enable other forms of neocolonial influence in the area?
1601.36,1605.84," Firstly, political influence. Having economic influence over the country like"
1605.84,1610.88, france owning the majority of senegal's banking telecommunications and supermarket industries
1610.88,1614.8, means that they get more bargaining power intervention in the political situation
1614.8,1619.28, because when a majority of the african states income comes through these taxes when they're all
1619.28,1623.6, especially when their own people are that poor this means that if they see a benefit in cheap
1623.6,1628.2, working hands for extraction they're more likely to pressure for the continuation of such conditions.
1628.68,1633.0," But secondly, they can even have military influence because they can use the excuse of,"
1633.26,1637.84," I have my assets there, I need to be able to defend them, like France does with having troops"
1637.84,1643.1," in Mali, Chad, and Niger. This is important because these two ways of influence break the"
1643.1,1645.82, self-determination and sovereignty of these African states.
1646.42,1649.76, How would prioritizing land reparations and past transfers fix this?
1650.08,1657.5, Because returning wealth and capital from the colonial elites to the masses means that they would have the ability to use this capital to create domestic industries.
1657.92,1661.72," Therefore, they could use their minds to build manufacturing rather than only extraction."
1661.86,1670.32," This could create an economy that is more independent from the former colonial control. Notice that by doing this from the beginning, it would become"
1670.32,1675.06," easier to actually disengage from that economy versus on the comparative, because you have tied"
1675.06,1679.8," your development to these companies that extract, it's not easy to happen. When we're creating this"
1679.8,1684.42," independent economy, this means that when the other powers like the US and China want to have"
1684.42,1689.52," influences in China, in Africa, which they will because of the vast resources they don't get involved with"
1689.52,1693.68, the extraction model but they're more likely to have agreements as trading partners which would
1693.68,1698.32, be better because they're established based on a new order as two sovereign states so they're more
1698.32,1702.8, likely to be actually beneficial but secondly because the agreements will be beneficial to
1702.8,1705.2, the majority of the people and not the top 1%
1705.2,1709.12, because they are the ones that own the assets that now foreign powers want to use.
1709.44,1714.98," So because we prove to you that it is actually better to have economic independence with our side of the house,"
1715.24,1716.84, please vote for PRO. Thank you.
1721.46,1724.18, I would like to thank the second speaker of the proposition.
1728.66,1730.66, And now we are ready to continue with the second speaker of the opposition.
1732.84,1734.68, Thank you very much. Am I audible and visible?
1739.12,1739.72," Okay, I'll begin my speech in three, two, one."
1745.6,1753.2," If history has shown us anything, it's that humans value a sense of autonomy and dignity above all else. Revolutionaries, soldiers in war, mothers foregoing for their kids, all have given up economic security in the name of freedom."
1753.2,1761.2," The continent I call home was brutalized and dehumanized for decades by foreign rulers who thought that they knew what was best, but they didn't."
1761.2,1765.44," Only citizens of these nations know what's in their interests, and only political"
1765.44,1770.28," and civil rights can give them that. I will do four things in my speech. Firstly, I will rebut"
1770.28,1775.12," the opposition's case. Secondly, I will present my first argument about international exploitation."
1775.78,1779.22," I'll present my second argument about the risk of corruption, and I'll do some weighing."
1779.74,1784.32," So firstly, let me respond to what the second proposition speaker has said. They kept telling"
1784.32,1788.66," you that on their side, they have the most short-term benefit of having people being immediately fed."
1788.98,1794.38," But we've already explained to you, panel, that these impacts don't make any sense without a proper mechanism."
1794.38,1803.4," They still don't explain to you how land distribution, how cash quotas, how all of these economic reparations will actually happen on their side."
1803.64,1809.36, How will this land be distributed? Who will be making these decisions? Who will have their cash removed in order to give
1809.36,1814.7," it to someone else? All of this model, this model is not existent on the proposition side. They"
1814.7,1819.8, haven't explained to you the detailed outline of what is needed in order for their economic
1819.8,1826.78," impacts to have any sense. No, thank you. Protected time. We also tell you that the comparative is that it is very"
1826.78,1829.7, difficult to hand out political and civil rights
1829.7,1831.1, in a discriminatory way.
1831.1,1833.72," For example, if you protect the right to protest,"
1833.72,1836.2, you are almost always likely to do this
1836.2,1837.46, for all groups in society.
1837.46,1839.68, And this is the point that they have not responded to.
1839.68,1842.36, We already told them that there is a great point of contention
1842.36,1848.72," and tension because of their economic policies. Because at the end of the day, if you're giving land to someone, you're taking it from"
1848.72,1853.6, someone else. And that creates tension in an already unstable country that has just been
1853.6,1858.02, decolonized. And for you to not respond to these arguments makes you already lose that clash.
1858.24,1862.52," They also tell you that, you know, the same people will have power on both sides of the house. And we"
1862.52,1870.4," completely disagree with this point, because we tell you that people that are likely to receive power on the proposition side without an electoral"
1870.4,1875.6, process are people who already have power who are not the vulnerable stakeholders of this debate
1875.6,1880.96, who like women and children and minorities ethnic minorities sexual minorities who do not have the
1880.96,1890.1," ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them back we tell you that through our side with an electoral process we have the ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them best. We tell you that through our side, with an electoral process, we have the ability to choose a leader that will do the best."
1890.1,1898.06," So we tell you on the on the point of tangible changes, our side can support basic welfare programs that help the most vulnerable."
1898.4,1908.0," But Proposition has to specifically defend things like active land distribution, quotas, cash transfer programs, which are not necessary to get people out of poverty."
1908.0,1912.0, Proposition still has to explain how they can achieve those things.
1912.0,1921.0," We explained to you why those aims would have been impossible in many countries in our first opposition speaker due to the fact that they are seen as a trade off for some groups,"
1921.0,1925.54, which is not the case for political rights. And even if economic rights
1925.54,1930.12," are important, they are not more important than political rights, because the only way that you"
1930.12,1935.84," can achieve any form of utility is by being able to express your preferences in a political system,"
1935.84,1941.46," which only our sides provide. And at the end of the day, we provide the longest-term pathway to"
1941.46,1945.82, propositions benefits. With only proper political rights can groups form
1945.82,1951.2," unions, lobby governments for economic policies, and so on. So I'll be moving on to my first"
1951.2,1956.24, argument about the international exploitation. The premise of this argument is simple. Even as
1956.24,1962.82," many colonial forces exited African states, many did so with unease, either believing their"
1962.82,1965.42, ousting was illegitimate or seeking to continue
1965.42,1970.38," to reap the economic rewards of colonial exploitation. Thus, these powers looked for"
1970.38,1975.28," other ways to exert power or control, for example, through exploitative trade deals,"
1975.58,1980.98," resource projects, and so on. Our claim is that that would have been significantly easier for"
1980.98,1987.0, colonial powers to do this if African states did not prioritize political and civil rights in this period.
1987.0,1997.0," Firstly, political and civil rights simply provide a mechanism to lobby domestic governments if citizens feel that international powers are exerting inappropriate influence."
1997.0,2006.08," For example, to vote out a government that is in bed with a problematic Western company. Secondly, international powers can more easily justify intervening in African"
2006.08,2012.64, states when they perceive them to be quote-unquote broken or corrupt. This is less likely on our side
2012.64,2018.58, when these states have a much healthier political system. The second proposition speaker told you
2018.58,2022.32," that on their side, they'll have better trading relationships with countries like the US,"
2022.62,2028.32," countries like France, and that they'll be better partners. But we tell you that the reality is when you have a broken political"
2028.32,2034.32," system, these higher powers like the US and France can take advantage of that country and can exploit"
2034.32,2040.08, them further through exploitative trade deals. The impact of this argument is clear. We get less
2040.08,2045.84," long-term international meddling in African states, allowing them to be more autonomous and not stuck"
2045.84,2051.2, in an exploitative relationship that is different to their past colonial rule. Moving on to my second
2051.2,2057.68," argument, but before I do so I'll take your POI. When these countries like France have so much"
2057.68,2062.64," have so much investment in these colonial states, why would the government kick them out when it"
2062.64,2069.28, gets a lot of the money from their taxes okay international investment is based on so many factors it's based on resources it's based on
2069.28,2073.12, borders it is hard to fully predict that if investment with that investment would have been
2073.12,2077.44, stronger if those countries economies would have been stronger if i take your best case saying that
2077.44,2082.08, your economic impacts will happen and as we've shown you powerful western countries may have
2082.08,2085.04, further exploited african countries post-colonialism
2085.04,2089.68," if they perceive them to be weak politically. Like with the example of South Africa, for example,"
2090.04,2097.06," when that political system was weak, that African state was subject to exploitative trade agreements"
2097.06,2101.3," through apartheid policies, for example. So when you have a weak political system,"
2101.42,2108.4, there is guarantee that you will be exploited by those same trading partners that you reap that you claim you reap benefits from our second argument about is about
2108.4,2113.36, the risk of corruption to be perfectly clear we are not saying that all post-colonial african
2113.36,2118.24, states were corrupt however we think economic distribution in certain states may have been
2118.24,2123.04, susceptible to corruption or lobbying influence especially where government institutions were more
2123.04,2129.68, fragile this looks like groups with more political power such as farmers lobbying governments for a greater slice of the
2129.68,2135.68, pie or in the worst case scenario corrupt officials embezzling parts of cash transfer programs this
2135.68,2140.72, has a few impacts firstly proposition just reduces the benefits of their economic redistribution
2140.72,2144.64, because they keep telling you about how they're going to have this you know poor vulnerable child
2144.64,2148.72, being fed on their side when we tell you that it is very likely for that child
2148.72,2154.8, to remain starving on their side and secondly if exposed this is likely to exasperate tensions
2154.8,2160.64, within a country and pit certain groups against one another and thirdly this is likely to undermine
2160.64,2165.3, faith in governments which is crucial for new democracies if they feel their
2165.3,2170.58," officials cannot be trusted. The comparative, as we told you before, is that it is very difficult"
2170.58,2175.96," to hand out political and civil rights in a discriminatory way. For example, if you protect"
2175.96,2181.1," the rights to protest, you're almost always going to be doing this for all groups in a society."
2181.1,2185.2, The economic distribution that the proposition proposes to you panel
2185.2,2190.32, has is contention on the fact that someone will be losing land and another person will be gaining
2190.32,2195.2, land that some people will be gaining more land than other people and that already creates tension
2195.2,2200.56, in a society even if they claim that will be done in an equitable way which they haven't provided a
2200.56,2206.88," mechanism for why that would happen in an equitable way. And even in the case that it doesn't happen in an equitable way,"
2207.08,2210.0, all the economic impacts that they've outlined in today's debate
2210.12,2214.48," about helping people be better taxpayers, helping people be,"
2214.52,2218.72," you know, active citizens in an economy, all that impact goes straight away"
2218.72,2222.72, and does not happen because they don't have the they don't have a foundation
2222.72,2224.64, for which those impacts will happen.
2224.64,2228.64," And for all these reasons, I proudly,, I proudly oppose this motion. Thank you."
2232.16,2234.08, Thanks to the second speaker of the opposition.
2234.08,2236.64, And now it's the time for the third speeches.
2236.64,2255.0," I'd like to invite the proposition third speaker. Sorry, am I all the way?"
2255.0,2256.0, Great.
2256.0,2260.28, I will be receiving your eyes from the chat as well.
2260.28,2274.64, So just right below
2290.44,2291.44, nice Opposition has been changing the description about how corrupt the states are throughout the debate.
2291.44,2295.96," At the beginning, they're telling us they're so corrupt that land distribution will not"
2295.96,2296.96, be able to happen.
2296.96,2302.32," And then they bring a second speech argument, which you have a system working so great that"
2302.32,2306.0, you're literally able to outvote politicians you don't agree.
2306.56,2312.24," To clear this debate, this debate is about a world in which you have the same leader."
2312.24,2318.88, The question is whether this leader with the same corruption is better balanced and checked
2318.88,2325.3," and whether the people are better off in a world that you would have prioritized land distributions, you would have"
2325.3,2331.58, prioritized economic rights. This means that opposition cannot be changing the characterization
2331.58,2336.62, of what this corruption looks like every time it is convenient for their case. But second
2336.62,2342.14," clarification here, they've been pushing us this burden of our impact does not materialize because"
2342.14,2345.24, we never explain how this distribution will be done.
2345.6,2352.26," The same actor that is giving the political rights to their side is giving the economic rights to ours, right?"
2352.4,2357.98," If the government is doing the distribution, like the distribution, this happens under our side,"
2358.26,2362.42," the way this land distribution is going to be done is case by case scenario,"
2362.72,2365.5, obviously by focusing on what all people
2365.5,2370.86," having a piece of land, having class transfer programs, depending on the size of this country,"
2370.86,2376.04," and obviously, how this is managed by the establishment. This is something that like"
2376.04,2381.4," the same actor that this would have done under their side of the house, right? But now into my"
2381.4,2386.0," classes. Firstly, about the benefits to the people, and secondly, about stability."
2386.0,2393.0," Look, in the first class, the main contention to our entire case is that land distribution will fail because of corruption,"
2393.0,2397.0," and hence our impacts are all, as they claim, thrown out of the window."
2397.0,2411.08," And to that, we have two very important responses. Firstly, we have pointed throughout the debate that corruption is symmetric, that if they are like if under their side of the house, politicians are corrupt, like if under our side of the house, politicians are corrupt."
2411.42,2414.22," This means that also on their side of the house, the same politician is corrupt."
2414.82,2423.68," The reason why your side is better is because, for example, if you're corrupt enough to make land distribution a little bit different, you will end up having a piece of land."
2423.9,2425.04," Yes, maybe not the same with the elites, but end up having a piece of land yes maybe not the same"
2425.04,2430.16, with the elites but you will have a piece of land under your side of the house if you end up
2430.16,2436.24, corrupting the election and it's rigged therefore your like rights to vote is meaningless because
2436.24,2442.48, whatever it happened the very electorate process was corrupt under our side of the house you at
2442.48,2445.92, least get some benefits but secondly and most importantly
2445.92,2451.28, here let's take them at their very best and assume that somehow under our side of the house we have
2451.28,2456.8, more corruption here's why more corruption still wins the debate because even if you're more corrupt
2456.8,2461.2, under our side of the house and they give less rights like they give a lot less time to the
2461.2,2465.12," people right they're giving them very very little little land or very, very little caste."
2468.04,2470.96," We told you why even a very, very small piece of land is important to literally feed your child"
2470.96,2472.9," to the point that during the 60s,"
2473.0,2477.44, malnutrition was the cause of 45% of children dying in Africa.
2477.82,2479.66," And on your side of the house, yes,"
2479.82,2482.84," you have, for example, less corrupt freedom of expression"
2482.84,2486.08, and you're able to have a more independent press
2486.08,2491.12, but what's the point of that if the reason why you needed it in the first place was to demand the
2491.12,2495.84, food that we're immediately giving them under our side of the house this is why in the end of the
2495.84,2500.64, day even if we take them at the best what they never managed to respond is our argument about
2500.64,2505.28, what these people what they need in the short term is the ability to eat is the
2505.28,2510.74, ability to exercise the basic economic rights that they were deprived of and in reality this resulted
2510.74,2516.44, to deaths of children that's a family that did not have access to a simple necessities as food but
2516.44,2521.84, also notice that they bring the response of South Africa right and they tell us no because in South
2521.84,2525.44, Africa the cast transfers did not work which is exactly their
2525.44,2531.2, problem right and south africa is an example from proposition the reason why cast transfer programs
2531.2,2536.56, failed were because they were too late they were postponed and then the elites had too much fire
2536.56,2542.0, which was our mechanism about why this should be prioritized and they never managed to respond
2542.0,2546.24," this means that all our ideas about why this is something that you should be prioritizing now,"
2546.24,2547.72," because it's a perfect timing,"
2547.72,2549.24, because elites have the left power
2549.24,2551.7," than we ever have still standing in the debate,"
2551.7,2553.0," and they're enough for us to win it,"
2553.0,2554.52," because it means that other opposition,"
2554.52,2557.14, these people never end up getting these economic rights
2557.14,2559.18, that are fundamental to their survival.
2559.18,2560.88, The second thing that they bring in this class
2560.88,2563.04," is that civil rights empower people the most,"
2563.04,2566.3, because that is what they were most denied during colonialism.
2566.3,2568.52," And to that, we have two different responses."
2568.52,2570.86," Firstly, we think they're being a lot assertive here."
2570.86,2573.74, We think that the major harm that was done during colonialism
2573.74,2575.9, is that these people were not able to exercise
2575.9,2578.0," the right of property, that in Nigeria,"
2578.0,2580.58," they were not able to take control of their oils,"
2580.58,2582.48," that in Congo, they were not able to take"
2582.48,2583.7, control of their diamonds.
2583.7,2589.6, Not having a right to property means that you're not able to understand that you have a right towards the state.
2589.6,2595.0," Meaning that even if you give these people the right to vote, these people don't have the sense of empowerment,"
2595.0,2600.6, don't have the sense that I have a right towards this property and this brings me this empowerment that I need.
2600.6,2609.84," You're giving these people the right to vote in a world in which they don't even have like a right to property. But secondly, we also tell you that under their side of the house,"
2609.84,2614.56," civil rights do not end up materializing. This is because as we told you from the get-go, which"
2614.56,2619.28," they didn't respond to, you're giving them for example the right to vote in a way that the"
2619.28,2623.92," institutions themselves are not being established. This means that in their best-case scenario,"
2624.8,2625.24," these things end up materializing in the best case scenario, these"
2625.24,2629.7," things end up materializing in the very long term, taking away all the benefits that they"
2629.7,2633.88," bring about faith in the system. Because the point that the colonization has happened,"
2633.88,2638.0," and the first thing that you prioritize is this right, but the institutions are not there,"
2638.0,2642.06," these people do not see them as valuable. And in the long term, this results to them"
2642.06,2648.88," not being able to exercise them. And this is why a lot of states right now in Africa do not have a democracy,"
2649.12,2652.12, exactly because the people were not able to take advantage of these rights.
2652.88,2656.34," But thirdly, they also tell us that rights are very important to minorities."
2656.8,2661.76," Yes, we also think that for these minorities, what is really important is for them to eat, is to have food."
2661.94,2668.4," And also, who are these minorities and the women that are so great and like they have gotten all these rights we think that they have been massively oppressed"
2668.4,2674.08, to the point that they did not have basic access to necessities and therefore if they were a lot
2674.08,2678.56, were placed in a lot more difficult positions being forced in extreme conditions of work and
2678.56,2683.12, hence being deprived of even more rights before i move on to my class about stability i'll take
2683.12,2688.96," the point so you say that the vulnerable stakeholders on your side will be better benefited, but you never"
2688.96,2693.66," explain to us why these vulnerable stakeholders are likely to reap the benefits on your side,"
2693.92,2698.92," given our analysis on power and corruption. Great. No, you need to stop telling us that we"
2698.92,2702.9, don't have mechanisms when all of our case was about how we needed benefits to the majority of
2702.9,2705.2," people, result to them having food, right?"
2705.2,2706.04, It was there.
2706.04,2708.14," If you don't want to respond to that's another issue,"
2708.14,2709.58, but the mechanism was there.
2709.58,2712.24, Now into my class about stability and sex.
2712.24,2714.1, The first thing that we tell us is that tensions
2714.1,2716.4, are going to be greater because you take land
2716.4,2718.5, but by other people.
2718.5,2719.44," Firstly, that's not true."
2719.44,2721.68, We're taking the land from the colonial elites
2721.68,2723.24, and we're distributing to the people.
2723.24,2726.36," But secondly, if that's your metric of how tensions arise,"
2726.36,2728.84, we think it happens far worse on the other side of the house.
2728.84,2731.84," Because on the other side of the house, the moment you want to do this land"
2731.84,2736.44," redistribution is the moment which a lot of time from the colonial era has passed,"
2736.44,2739.32, which in the end of the day results to some elites owning the land.
2739.32,2742.56, And this is when the tensions are most likely to increase.
2742.56,2748.72, And this is when their description of how you're getting land from other people is actually materializing but thirdly we're also telling
2748.72,2752.72, you that you are likely to have less conflict because the point that these people have a land
2752.72,2756.8, they also have an economic incentive not for conflict to exist because now their property
2756.8,2761.84, is at stake but fortunately we are also telling you that you're likely to have less tensions and
2761.84,2766.5," to hold the government better accountable because to the point that these people are given rights,"
2766.5,2768.36," that they're contributing to the GDP,"
2768.36,2770.46," that now they're important stakeholder of taxation,"
2770.46,2772.44, what happens is that they're better able
2772.44,2774.56," to hold the government in check, right?"
2774.56,2776.78, The same government that now depends on these people
2776.78,2779.06, to literally be economically prosperous
2779.06,2781.4, or to profit from their land.
2781.4,2782.54," For all of these reasons,"
2782.54,2784.06, because you wake up in a better world
2784.06,2788.28," under our side of the house, for the majority of people, where they're able to literally feed their children,"
2788.68,2795.66," vote for proposition. I'd like to thank the third speaker of the proposition, and for the last"
2795.66,2799.44," constructive speech of the round, I'd like to invite the third speaker of the opposition."
2801.12,2807.0," I would like my POIs to be taken verbally, and I will start my speech in 3, 2, 1."
2807.0,2813.0, Can you build a house with unstable grounds? The answer to this question is rhetorical and easy to answer.
2813.0,2820.0," However, why does it feel to you more tricky when it gets to attaining economic growth while having an unstable society?"
2820.0,2825.04, It's pretty much the same case but with different words the answer that seemed obvious to the first
2825.04,2830.32, question is likely to be the answer for the second one we can't attain economic emancipation while
2830.32,2835.68, our citizens are still protesting to get their rights a different country that once were the
2835.68,2840.88, ones who colonized african countries come now and tell us that's what we did was wrong that's our
2840.88,2845.12, entire strategy was wrong giving giving up our political rights and drawing
2845.12,2850.56, towards money was right so what did you do they come now to tell us to tell us that we did it all
2850.56,2855.04, wrong and that we should have children the other way but we all know this is just a way to them
2855.04,2859.84, themselves clear the conscience that they are not the reason we haven't developed our country
2859.84,2866.0," so that gives us that we are the mistake not that we have been colonized for more than 20 years, dehumanized,"
2866.0,2872.0," and the moment we were set free, we wanted to get our dignity back rather than our land, which shows dignity over anything,"
2872.0,2878.0," because we knew that without our political rights, we will be exploited again and again and again by these countries."
2878.0,2884.0," And now they are coming here telling us, you shouldn't have taken this route, you chose the wrong route,"
2884.0,2885.76, this is why you aren't developing.
2885.76,2891.84," Clear their conscience maybe. So before I begin, I want to start by saying that the third"
2891.84,2898.64, speaker has completely ignored our second speaker arguments about international
2898.64,2907.46, exploitation and our analysis on corruption. They are not engaging in this debate in any way. So let me start with some rebuttals.
2907.76,2913.44," First, let's agree upon one thing, that T-PROP haven't provided any mechanism"
2913.44,2916.72, about how this land reparation and cash transfer is going to happen.
2916.72,2920.34," By you, how? No criteria were given."
2920.64,2923.18," No mechanism, nothing. Just talking in the air."
2923.48,2926.88," And by this, their motion falls we already have we"
2926.88,2931.76, have already explained to you that this in fact does make sense without a mechanism they still
2931.76,2936.56, have not explained to you how this time will be distributed who will be making this decision who
2936.56,2942.88, will have their cash removed and given to someone else etc so two main classes in this debate so the
2942.88,2950.0," first main class is going to be about corruption and the other one is going to be how they are keep Satan, how variable."
2950.0,2958.0," Second, are going to be benefited. One no clear mechanism about how they will reap in the benefits that are there are there are there are supposing."
2958.0,2969.3, So our first class is about corruption. They claim that corruption exists in both sides. This is not true. We tell you that economic distribution in certain states may have been susceptible to corruption
2969.3,2974.12," or lobbying influence, especially where government institutions were more fragile. This looks"
2974.12,2980.24," like a group with more political power, such as former lobbying governments for a greater"
2980.24,2986.0," slice of the pie, or in the worst case scenario corrupt official investment parts of cash transfer"
2986.0,2993.12, this uh the comparison is is that is that is very difficult to hand out political and civil rights
2993.12,2998.4, in a discriminatory way for example if you protect the right to protest you are most likely to do
2998.4,3007.44," this for all groups in society they have clearly clearly and in real comparison, they keep comparing corruption on our side and corruption on their side."
3007.86,3012.54, Investing some money doesn't have anything to do with corrupting an entire election.
3012.84,3014.32, This is not sympathetic at all.
3014.7,3022.34," Well, corruption on your side is most likely to happen because they are corrupting, taking land, having more cash, etc."
3022.64,3026.72, But you are saying that it's the same as corrupting an entire
3026.72,3031.76, election well this doesn't make any sense they say that in their world they have independence
3031.76,3037.2, and citizens restore their autonomy do you think in a world where they don't have right to vote to
3037.2,3042.24, speak to choose from themselves it's being independent having the land but no right to vote
3042.24,3045.76, is exactly the opposite of independence their most our second
3045.76,3051.28, main flash and their most important arguments later their our second clash and their most
3051.28,3057.44, important argument was that post-colonial uh states suffered from extreme poverty and uh uh
3057.44,3062.48, and that's in their world they have more people to defend and we have four responses to this
3063.36,3066.56, although these claims are too vague and not true in in all
3066.56,3075.44, cases as i imagine most people in post-colonial countries are all uh are all uh not fed well
3075.44,3081.68, for responses to this is our side can support a basic welfare program that's how the most variable
3081.68,3086.64, prop side has to be side has to specifically defend things
3086.64,3088.96, like active land distribution quotas
3088.96,3090.42," and cash transfer programs,"
3090.42,3094.04, which are not necessarily to get people out of poverty.
3094.04,3096.38," Second, profs still has to explain"
3096.38,3098.34, how they achieve those things.
3098.34,3100.32, We explain to you why those aims
3100.32,3102.8, would have been impossible in many countries
3102.8,3106.26," due to the fact that they are seen as straight up for some groups,"
3106.4,3108.54, which is not the case for political rights.
3108.92,3112.28," Thirdly, even if economic rights are important,"
3112.28,3116.6, they are not more important than political rights.
3116.88,3119.78, The only way you can access any form of utility
3119.78,3124.58," is by being able to express your preferences in the political system,"
3124.76,3126.68, which only our side provides.
3126.68,3133.1," And lastly, we provide the longest term pathway to profit benefits."
3133.44,3139.78," Only with our political rights can groups form unions, lobby governments for economic policies and so on."
3140.04,3141.32, Now I will take your POI.
3142.48,3146.16, What happened is that these people were given a right to vote
3146.16,3150.76, in the hope that they would manage to elect someone that would bring them food
3150.76,3154.68, instead of literally giving them the right of property to cultivate
3154.68,3156.58, and have food for themselves.
3157.96,3163.1," Well, you are talking too vague because what I'm hearing is that"
3163.1,3167.16," these people, yeah, they are voting for people to protect them,"
3167.16,3170.34," to give them money to eat, to feed them."
3170.34,3171.92, And we are not saying that all politicians
3171.92,3173.62, aren't achieving that.
3173.62,3175.82," Well, we are saying that by this right,"
3175.82,3179.04," not just to vote, right, express themselves and so on,"
3179.04,3183.12, they are protecting themselves and elected politicians
3183.12,3185.76," are going to be able to develop the country. Well, later on, they are going to be able to develop the country well"
3185.76,3193.6, later on they are going to be able to also have more money and so on uh so they say the right to
3193.6,3198.88, vote is meaningless and it's not important well we tell you that's the exact opposite without voting
3198.88,3204.48, without having civil rights people will remain dehumanized and unheard vulnerable minorities
3204.48,3207.0, like women and children will not have their voice heard on their side.
3207.0,3211.0, How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need?
3211.0,3219.0," Well, much better to choose who can do that than wait for someone who didn't choose to do that for you."
3219.0,3227.0," Like, as you said, like people are choosing the person they want them to represent them."
3227.0,3233.26," Well, in your side, they haven't even elected someone who is going to be a redistribution"
3233.26,3234.26, lamp.
3234.26,3238.44," And as we are saying, you have provided no mechanism of who is going to..."
3238.44,3243.32, Is this person who is going to be a redistribution lamp is going to be elected by the population
3243.32,3251.0, or is it going to be chosen by the elites who are going to benefit in them more than benefits the entire country?
3251.0,3258.0," Well, they said that having economic influence will influence countries such as France."
3258.0,3265.6, Are we going to have economic influence right after the colonial period by having land reparation is this your solution
3265.6,3270.64, don't you think this this would just happen in the best theoretical word you are providing well
3270.64,3275.44, most more international investment will have been better with stronger economies that's what we are
3275.44,3280.88, going to say well we have three responses to this international investment is based on so many
3280.88,3285.0, factors resources borders etc it's hard to fully predict
3285.0,3287.18, if this expansion would have been stronger.
3287.18,3290.44," Second, as we show you,"
3290.44,3292.52, powerful Western countries may have further
3292.52,3296.0, exploited African countries for post-colonialism
3296.0,3298.78, if they perceive them to be weak politically.
3298.78,3303.68," We say that if when you have a broken political system,"
3303.68,3306.02, powerful countries would just take advantage of it
3306.02,3308.86, and exploit it rather than help it.
3308.86,3311.72," And for all these reasons, we proudly oppose."
3314.76,3316.68, Thanks to the third speaker of the opposition.
3316.68,3318.5, And now the reply speeches.
3318.5,3321.06, I'd like to call upon the opposition reply speaker.
3322.38,3324.32," Okay, am I audible and visible?"
3330.96,3335.12," Okay, I'll begin my speech in three two one and every single one of proposition speakers they keep telling you about this vulnerable child that"
3335.12,3339.84, will be fed on their side they keep mentioning this child and what their future will look like
3339.84,3349.76, on their side well i would just like to take a moment to actually paint to you panel the reality of what that what will happen to that child on in propositions world let's take it into the
3349.76,3356.48, context of morocco so the french have left the continent they're finally able to you know be free
3356.48,3361.92, and independent of french colonial rule what actually happens rich families in morocco take
3361.92,3392.46," control of the land and take control of that land distribution that they keep telling you about, about those cash quotas, those cash transfers. Moroccan families that are vulnerable, that are poor, that live in poverty, have no right to vote, no self-autonomy, no suffrage, no ability to speak for themselves. And at the end of the day, that vulnerable child that they keep telling you about will not be fed and will not have the right to speak for themselves because they don't have the right to vote."
3392.62,3396.94," They keep telling you that, oh, well, we're also going to have corruption on our side."
3397.12,3405.36, But we tell you that it's much better to choose and elect your leaders for yourself rather than wait for a more powerful stakeholder to do that for you
3405.36,3409.08, because there is no guarantee that they'll actually protect your interests. So I'm going to be
3409.08,3413.5," responding to the main clashes in this debate and then I'll be doing some weighing. Firstly, on the"
3413.5,3418.14, clash of the likelihood of economic distribution being successful. They tell you that economic land
3418.14,3421.5," reparations will be successful on their side, that they're going to save land, they're going to"
3421.5,3432.84," nationalize corporations, distribute the land, They're going to give people economic rights and help them on a day to day basis, give them the ability to be taxpayers and to be citizens that contribute to an active economy."
3433.14,3468.54," But we tell you that in many cases, all of these impacts are very, very unlikely to happen and that it's downright impossible to successfully achieve economic and land reparations. We told you that land reparations are sometimes the worst case for many African states, because many quotas or cash transfers can be seen as contentious because of the perceived nature of. Because when you give voting rights to one group, you're not taking away the voting rights of another group, whereas it's necessarily the"
3468.54,3472.64," case with any form of economic redistribution. And we also tell you that in the long term,"
3472.64,3478.1, we think it's actually easier to achieve economic rights through stable political rights. For
3478.1,3482.74," example, when you're able to freely form associations like unions, you can advocate"
3482.74,3485.12, for worker protections. When you're able to freely
3485.12,3489.92," vote for a party that represents your interests, you can vote for the best economic policies."
3490.28,3494.38," Proposition's world is one where at best we'd achieve some economic redistribution,"
3494.74,3500.38, but not prioritize a long-term mechanism to continue achieving economic benefits once those
3500.38,3504.18, needs evolve in the future. I think the biggest thing that Proposition has not done in this debate
3504.18,3508.08, has actually to characterize to you panel what their economic policies look like.
3508.08,3512.48, What does it look like to have a cash transfer program? What does it look like to have land
3512.48,3516.32," redistribution? They don't do that on their side and we tell you that only through unions,"
3516.32,3522.16," only through political systems, strong stable ones, can we have those economic policies"
3522.16,3525.04, in the long term. Now I'm going to be doing some weighing our
3525.04,3531.2, arguments in this debate are the most important because firstly we help ensure the most prosperous
3531.2,3536.64, long-term future for these nations only political rights can help governments in check and ensure
3536.64,3542.4, that they do not backslide democratically which would undo all the gains made in getting rid of
3542.4,3549.62," these colonial rulers secondly we tell you that we help protect the most vulnerable. While low-income individuals are indeed the most vulnerable,"
3550.0,3554.3, so many other groups are only protected by our side of the debate when they have the capacity
3554.3,3559.64, to bring attention to the struggles that they are experiencing in the political system. We also tell
3559.64,3565.52, you that we ensure the most political and economic rights on our on our side that is proposition side cannot
3565.52,3570.64, meaningfully achieve political rights but our but our side can achieve economic rights in the long
3570.64,3576.24, term once we have institutions in place to sustainably do so and finally we prioritize
3576.24,3581.12, what the majority of citizens are likely to value the most which is a political system that helps
3581.12,3590.44, them feel dignified and no longer dehumanized and for all these reasons i proudly stand for opposition thank you very much thank you and now for the final speech
3590.44,3610.0, and debate i'd like to call upon the proposition reply speaker Am I audible? Thank you.
3610.0,3616.0, So.
3616.0,3621.0," Under opposition, people have freedom of speech without an independent press."
3621.0,3625.84," Under opposition, people in Kenya have the right to vote but they have a"
3625.84,3633.36," one-party election. Under opposition, women might have the right to protest but their children are"
3633.36,3639.68," starving. Even in the best case of opposition, they have less corruption but they still have"
3639.68,3645.68, these ethnic tensions that we keep telling you from the beginning they still have all this unequal
3645.68,3653.6, inequality and land and power and economics they even have like cases of conflict and genocide
3653.6,3659.28, when the very reason behind genocide in ronda was the land as we told you was the fact that
3659.28,3663.52, who just had more land that the duties had more land the hooties during colonial rule and land
3663.52,3668.12," was never redistributed we're telling you that in this world, we wanted to have"
3668.12,3673.88," prioritized economic and land reparations. Two clashes in the reply, firstly about stability,"
3673.88,3678.54," and secondly about corruption. Starting with stability, notice that this is an independent"
3678.54,3684.36," clash and an independent benefit of the land given. This doesn't mean, and this doesn't"
3684.36,3685.78, mean for us to have a
3685.78,3690.74, lot of land for each person but rather the fact that they now have some type of ownership. We have
3690.74,3696.24, told you three main things. Firstly about pensions that we're less likely to have pensions when you
3696.24,3700.64, have some ownership so you're less likely to have these deadly conflicts that we're telling you
3700.64,3709.48," but secondly we're less likely to have these ethnic divisions that are deep under opposition, as we told you, that have even led to genocide. These mechanisms were"
3709.48,3714.34," not responded, but what we heard from opposition is that you can have conflict from land distribution"
3714.34,3719.4, because you're taking away someone's land and taking it to the other. This is why we
3719.4,3724.22," told you about why this is important for it to happen in the beginning, where we are in"
3724.22,3726.36," a context of the changing situation,"
3726.66,3728.24," where we're changing regimes,"
3728.52,3730.42," where we're changing the international arena,"
3730.74,3734.26, especially when this decolonization happened around the same decade.
3734.5,3737.1, This is why it needed to be prioritized in the beginning.
3737.46,3740.0," And from their first, opposition has said"
3740.0,3742.84, that they would want to land the distribution at some point.
3742.98,3744.64, They just think it should come from the people.
3744.92,3749.52, If they agree that it should come at some point because of this reason that we told you it
3749.52,3756.48, is only going to work if it happens prioritized in the beginning secondly in this clash we told
3756.48,3762.56, you about how it is harder to take away these like ownership exactly because it's more tangible
3762.56,3765.92, versus on the comparative it's much easier to change
3765.92,3770.8, bad stuff to like even restrict a bit of freedom of press because it takes more time for you to
3770.8,3775.92, realize this and why because of this means that it's more easy for our types of rights to actually
3775.92,3781.6, succeed on happening this wasn't responded so it means that we are more likely to have this benefit
3781.6,3785.1, which brings us to the impact of having less tensions and not having
3785.1,3789.64," more people being able to feed themselves. But thirdly, on neocolonialism, they're saying that"
3789.64,3794.76," we don't respond when we have an entire argument on this that they only apparently responded to,"
3794.94,3799.78, and when we brought back in the POI our mechanism on why governments are less likely to listen to
3799.78,3804.66," the people when they have these colonial powers, having all of this economic rights and control,"
3804.86,3809.18, and why this would change when you actually redistribute this economic control from the
3809.18,3813.56, beginning and allow the people and the masses to have these rights to be able to make more
3813.56,3818.96, decisions on their account so the impact of this clash is that we have more stability which allows
3818.96,3823.7, for more economic development that is independent of former colonial powers and because of this
3823.7,3825.64, class alone we can win this debate.
3825.64,3827.76," But in the second class about corruption,"
3827.76,3830.38, opposition says that people are corrupt
3830.38,3831.96, so they don't give good distribution.
3831.96,3834.36, So we don't get any of our benefits.
3834.36,3836.82," But firstly, we have told you again and again"
3836.82,3838.18, on why corruption still exists
3838.18,3839.52, under the leadership of the house.
3839.52,3841.82," But even they can have worse harm, right?"
3841.82,3844.52, Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution
3844.52,3847.96," to actually distort like economic civil rights and be able to have worse harm, right? Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution to actually distort like economic civil rights"
3847.96,3849.7," and be able to have a dictatorship,"
3849.7,3851.88," when Kenyatta, the elected president,"
3851.88,3853.44," prohibits rivals from running,"
3853.44,3856.8, this doesn't allow for the rights to actually live at all.
3856.8,3859.14," Whereas for us, if that means that they're limiting"
3859.14,3860.66," and giving less land to people,"
3860.66,3862.08," at least they get some land,"
3862.08,3864.64, at least they're able to be fed even a little.
3864.64,3865.12, So we also told you why least they're able to be fed even a little so we also
3865.12,3869.84, told you why they're more likely to be contained because of this accountability that was unresponded
3869.84,3874.48, so this also helps us win this debate because even if we have more corruption at least under us it's
3874.48,3880.88, less likely to affect the people for all of this please vote for prop thank you i'd like to thank
3880.88,3885.98, the proposition reply speaker and like to thank everyone for a great debate.
3897.08,3897.34," I would now like to invite my panel to move to debate, what is it, Prop Prep Room 10."
3901.4,3902.68," And we will confer there, fill in our ballots and then we'll be back in a while."
,, Thank you for the debate.
