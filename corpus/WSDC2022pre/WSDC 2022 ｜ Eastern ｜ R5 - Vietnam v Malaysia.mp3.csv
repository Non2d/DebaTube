0.0,30.0," Fine. It's full. Okay, so I think we're going to start the round now. So without a further ado, kind of the Prime Minister here here. Hi, are we starting?"
30.0,49.28, Yeah. and I'll get to you with that said.
51.4,53.74, A flourishing democratic society is one where its occupants are fully aware
53.74,55.74, and capable of making independent decisions
55.74,57.36, based on trust in the system
57.36,58.98, and the information given to them.
59.34,60.58, Progress is impossible
60.58,62.24, when the media has perverse incentive
62.24,65.36, to amplify lopsided messages proud to propose.
66.0,70.0," Firstly, who will be affected by the doctrine? We think this is a traditional large broadcast"
70.0,75.84, news company who shape the opinion of the world and brand themselves as carrier of truth like
75.84,80.16, CNN or Sky News. But we also want to include social media based company that also have
80.16,85.12, significant audiences. This is like political or ground news once news companies pass a certain
85.12,89.12, threshold of viewership we think this is when the fairness doctrine becomes applicable to them
89.12,93.76, here's how it works no this is not about what topic is covered so do not come up with a
93.76,98.96, censorship argument but it is about having both sides of one issue it will look like these news
98.96,103.2, company covering controversial issues of public importance like the recent u.s supreme court
103.2,108.06, decision abortion or in malaysia where the government was exposed to have spent 6 billion ringgits
108.06,113.0, on a navy ship that never existed. And then we do so with equal and adequate coverage
113.0,117.72," of diverse viewpoints, as in having diverse programming, different teams and speakers"
117.72,122.1," on different topics to ensure an equitable discussion. For example, channels will have"
122.1,125.0, to invite equally reputable experts and panelists from both sides to discuss.
125.0,133.0, There will be an independent governmental agency to monitor and ensure that this is a good faith effort to get both sides of this issue.
133.0,136.0, It is reasonably easy to detect operations based on bad faith.
136.0,142.0," For example, if a network continually relegates opposition viewpoints to lower viewership time slots,"
142.0,145.16, fails to invite credible speakers or unfairly
145.16,150.7," distort the environment to benefit one side, we are happily to penalize corporations and"
150.7,153.28, channels that do not adhere to the doctrine.
153.28,154.72, Our stance is very simple.
154.72,159.08," We believe that the truth comes out best when both sides are presented, interacted and battled,"
159.08,161.7, and let viewers analyze and make decisions for themselves.
161.7,164.94," This debate is about better democracy, journalism and conversation."
164.94,165.04," First argument then on how the Venice doctrine remedies political polarization. and the position for themselves. This debate is about better democracy, journalism, and conversation."
165.04,170.08, First argument then on how the Venice doctrine remedies political polarization. The problem in
170.08,175.2, the status quo is that people are trapped in an echo chamber that exposes them to the same message
175.2,180.24," over and over again, leading them to reaffirm existing biases without questioning them. For"
180.24,184.72," example, things like the radical right-wing individual storming Capitol Hill happen because"
184.72,188.88, they are constantly bombarded by Fox News narratives that liberals are toxic forces
188.88,193.68, that will ruin America. Why then is this happening? Before I move on to analysis of how this is
193.68,199.28," happening, I would like to take a QI. Yeah, the Capitol Hill riots was organized and all discussed"
199.28,205.36, on underground news streams like Parler. How exactly is your analysis the reason why they are driven into
205.36,211.84, these underground news is because fox news give legitimization to these kinds of fake and fake
211.84,216.08, understanding so they look further into it to reinforce their bias and look for underground
216.08,221.28, news your side of the house is bringing them to underground news why then is this happening this
221.28,228.24," is happening because people select their favorite news channel based on proximity and familiarity, like what your parents watch is what you grow up watching."
228.24,234.08, So it is just factually correct that the majority of people do not watch both CNN and Fox News.
234.08,238.56," But moreover, news is partisan and extremely divisive because currently the media is"
238.56,243.44, oversimplified and exaggerated on both sides of the bench. This refers to conservative media with
243.44,250.0," scapegoating of minorities such as the China virus narrative in 2020 that led to rampant attacks against Asians in America,"
250.0,254.32, or in liberal media that ridicules and mocks the other side without an incentive to genuinely
254.32,259.36, engage. Why then is it going to worsen opposition without an end? Because there's a race to the
259.36,264.08, bottom incentive caused by toxic competition amongst news agencies in a dying market. This
264.08,270.0, happens because the rise of social media platforms means falling readership for traditional podcasts and news media.
270.0,276.0," And also, there's a profit incentive to capture as much of the limited viewership as possible and compete with each other."
276.0,281.0, News channels then are now so desperate that they will be willing to lean into whatever appeals to more people
281.0,285.4," and radicalize, playing into biases rather than accurate information."
285.4,289.3," So media companies, furthermore,"
289.3,291.52, media companies are often owned by individuals
291.52,294.2, or organizations with vested political interests.
294.2,296.38," For example, Rupert Murdoch's New Corp,"
296.38,299.0, which has so much influence on the media landscape
299.0,301.4, and tried to push climate change narratives out of it
301.4,303.64, due to their vested interest in all companies
303.64,309.12, that two ex prime minister of Australia labeled them as a cancer on democracy how will then the fairness doctrine
309.12,314.8, solve this problem the premise of this is that the viewers are less likely to be pushed and pulled
314.8,319.68, towards one radical end of the spectrum this debate is not about reducing concern or whatever
319.68,326.16, but this debate is about lessening like radicalism on both end the average reasonable viewer will not will
326.16,331.44, adopt a balanced point of view and make rational decision how then does this change occur think
331.44,336.8, firstly it will be of exposure because currently viewers have very little incentive to compare
336.8,340.96, different point of views and hence turn to channels that are comfortable and familiar and
340.96,350.36, feed into their biases so models are exposed to an environment that slowly nurtures radical perspective. The extremists on the left and right of either
350.36,355.58," side of the debate are unlikely to change. However, the fairness doctrine does provide"
355.58,360.08, them an opportunity to be exposed to content and opinion that they would never voluntarily
360.08,365.18, look up before. Then this will lead to a shift in consumer perception because viewers are now
365.18,370.18, restoring their faith in media as a voice of reason and knowledge compared to the pseudo-entertainment
370.18,375.16," status news channel that we have today. Then, there will be a containment of extremist and"
375.16,380.18," radical view because currently, mainstream media gives weight and legitimizes fake news when it"
380.18,384.46," features them in its broadcast. This is also a further elaboration on their POI because, for"
384.46,389.26," example, conspiracy from POA non, such such as stop the steal narrative that the liberal establishment"
389.26,395.1," were conspiring to deny Trump a free and fair election, went from being fringe belief that only"
395.1,400.18, the most radical believed into being mainstream conservative talking points once Fox News
400.18,406.56, popularized and spread them into a much wider audience. The importance of this point
406.56,411.5, is that conspiracy and fake news are a danger to society when there is enough support and
411.5,417.12, clout behind them. And this happens because these traditional broadcast news media with
417.12,422.68, significant reach are legitimizing them and broadcasting them. Current media creates this
422.68,425.36, clout as they serve as the entry point for the
425.36,429.92, moderate viewer and make the moderate viewer even more radicalized what's the impact of this two
429.92,436.4, problem impact so um first problem of impact then on the individual how we create dialogues based
436.4,441.04, on empathy respect and rational thought because fairness doctrine ensure the space that is
441.04,450.4, required for individuals across the spectrum to feel hurt because in this day and fall conservative fields undermined mistreated and underrepresented which oftentimes fuels further
450.4,455.92, xenophobia homophobia and other phobia towards minority groups this is also why they are driven
455.92,460.0, more into underground sources when they think that current traditional media sources are not
460.0,465.6, representing their viewpoints but two is that at the same time liberals refuse to engage based on
465.6,471.2, moral superiority and the wokeness of issue instead of acknowledging differences and the cause of
471.2,476.88, misinformation fairness doctrine then enables individuals to form opinions based on youth
476.88,481.76, that present both sides of the issue there's independent personal preferences and familiarity
481.76,485.92, of a certain channel second problem of impact then is that when individuals
485.92,490.48, change the political landscape benefits from this significantly because when we force media
490.48,494.8, companies to cover what is actually important rather than what gets them the most clout and
494.8,500.24, views this create discussion of issues like climate change and conserve cycles or circles
500.24,507.0," rather than vastly disproportionate coverage on outrage-inducing subjects, such as trans athletes in sport."
507.0,513.0," Second, we reduce partisan gridlocks, as sides are more capable of understanding one another and seeking for compromise,"
513.0,519.0," which is an essential ingredient in getting any actual legislation to pass, electing moderate candidates, and so on."
519.0,528.76," Finally, we lessen active violence breaking out, because there is a very short pathway for emotion regarding these marginalized issues to turn into destructive actions that harm"
528.76,531.76, others like the shooting in Buffalo or the Great Replacement Theory.
531.76,533.44, It is a numbered game.
533.44,537.8, Even a small number of radical individuals being pushed over the fringe can result in
537.8,538.8, violent outbursts.
538.8,543.54," Therefore, the fear destruction decreases polarization, improves societal engagement"
543.54,544.96, in individuals' well-being.
544.96,549.36, We can no longer let the status quo set opposition must engage practical force
555.6,566.32," uh i think the prime minister for this speech can i have the leader of the opposition Hi, can I be heard?"
567.92,568.76," Yes, you can."
569.32,569.72, All right.
570.34,573.58," Starting my speech in three, two, one."
573.92,576.92, Proposition mandates rebuttals to issues of human dignity.
576.92,579.88," When the opposition to abortion rights is the patriarchy,"
580.22,582.06," the objection to gay marriage is homophobia,"
582.5,584.9, and the justification of police brutality is bigotry.
589.44,593.84, The Fairness Doctrine doesn't platform neutrality it platforms oppression before that the stance from opposition is three things one we support the open market for media which has a self-correcting
593.84,598.48, mechanism in the form of competition to meet consumer demands so companies with poor journalistic
598.48,602.96, practices are naturally shut out of the market in the wake of cambridge analytica there is a
602.96,608.54, rise in media literacy where consumers are highly critical about the information presented to them and how media
608.54,613.24," organizations could be exploiting them. More than ever, consumers are politically conscious,"
613.64,618.74," and they value media organizations that practice responsible journalism. Therefore, competition"
618.74,623.52, among media outlets gives them the incentive to mutually scrutinize non-factual and exploitative
623.52,625.84," reporting. Secondly, status quo"
625.84,630.8," has existing mechanisms against misinformation and fake news as first proposition claims,"
630.8,635.36," such as fact-checking, which we see in two forms. One is enforced by the state and companies such"
635.36,640.4," as rooting out COVID-19 misinformation online, and the second is conducted by independent media"
640.4,650.02," who are signatory of the international fact-checking network, such as factcheck.org, and localized versions like AfricaCheck. Lastly, crucially, OPP does not need to prove that we're"
650.02,654.88," able to break the most entrenched echo chambers, but rather that PROP does more harm than good"
654.88,659.26, in incentivizing people to retreat into them. Before I talk about the two arguments to forward
659.26,664.38," from opposition, three responses to the speaker before me. Firstly, on their mechanism, I think"
664.38,665.16, we would like to note
665.16,670.36," that propositions equitable discussions doesn't necessarily mean that you have equal representation,"
670.82,675.46, i.e. having equal error time or even equal credibility of speakers under the fairness
675.46,680.34, doctrine doesn't translate into equal weightage in practice. Metrics that measure the persuasive
680.34,690.92," power of each speaker are subjective. Comp comparing between a professor of politics with greater expertise versus a community leader with greater influence, who are both equally powerful"
690.92,694.76," in their own ways, especially since the speakers don't possess the same style of engagement."
695.16,699.52," For example, less confrontational speakers disproportionately make concessions to"
699.52,704.3," aggressive ones, and making fair representation therefore almost impossible to micromanage"
704.3,705.08, across media
705.08,709.52, outlets who may deliberately use this gray area to select speakers' advantages to their ideological
709.52,714.24, leanings. Even Proposition themselves concedes this by telling you there are instances of biases
714.24,719.2," and they want to regulate all of this, but we are telling you it is inherently impossible. In fact,"
719.26,723.68, we think oppressors are usually awarded more social currency and can get away with being more
723.68,728.94," aggressive and more dominant within these quote-unquote fair discussions. For example, an overly aggressive"
728.94,733.94," black man is seen as a threat, while an aggressive white man is seen as a confident leader. When"
733.94,738.24," proposition hinges the entire case on the characterization of media being biased, their"
738.24,742.54," policy requires them to entrust the enforcement of the fairness doctrine to bad faith actors,"
742.76,749.06," which means on proposition they do have subjectivity and they don't get equality. But secondly, let's talk about the argument on echo"
749.06,753.2," chambers. Number three things to say here. Number one, they tell you that people we think that the"
753.2,757.1, people who are the biggest stakeholders in this debate are the ones who already have an active
757.1,761.62, incentive to be politically conscious. Why is this so? Because the only reason why you're consuming
761.62,765.2, news media over the 1000s of other media you could be consuming
765.2,766.66," like pop culture and music,"
766.66,768.12, is because you have an active incentive
768.12,769.84, to be involved in the political scene.
769.84,771.12," Meaning that on our side of the house,"
771.12,773.64, a majority of the individuals are likely to be moderates
773.64,774.88, or likely to be rational enough
774.88,776.4, to seek out counter narratives.
776.4,778.4," If they were so entrenched in their echo chambers,"
778.4,779.98, proposition changes nothing.
779.98,782.08," Because of secondly, we think they move underground"
782.08,786.08, because they don't trust the mainstream media.
786.44,789.96," Proposition says that they move underground because Fox News legitimizes this, but we don't"
789.96,793.8, think that's necessarily true. That's empirically untrue because underground platforms are in fact
793.8,798.08," empowered when people lose trust in what they can easily access, so they seek other alternatives to"
798.08,802.12," verify their viewpoints instead. But thirdly, when they tell us that the media has the incentive to"
802.12,810.66," play into biases, I think we would note that while status quo is not perfect, we would say that not all media biases are playing into racial stereotypes and harmful biases."
811.12,822.46," Insofar as our proposition uses the example of Capitol Hill's riots, for example, prop would require CNN to justify the Capitol Hill riots, i.e. spreading misinformation about why the election was rigged."
822.82,828.42," Proposition has to define a world where liberal bubbles will also become saturated with conservative views, and we think that's in fact far worse"
828.42,832.92," because it leads to the dehumanization of minorities. Crucially on perceived representation,"
833.26,836.78," conservatives will never seek representation in CNN because it is not their main sphere,"
836.94,840.9," but if Fox News becomes saturated with liberal news because the state forces it, I think that's"
840.9,844.84," when they go underground. Lastly, on the impact on discourse, we think that's contingent on healthy"
844.84,847.28," discourse, especially since these discussions are usually crucial to their identities. I think that's when they go underground lastly on the impact on discourse we think that's contingent on healthy discourse especially since this discussion these discussions are usually"
847.28,851.2, crucial to their identities i think it's far likely to be more aggressive instead of constructive two
851.2,855.28, arguments then to forward from opposition firstly on why the state must not mandate the violation
855.28,860.56, of moral minimums in mainstream media three parts one proposition platforms and spreads dehumanizing
860.56,864.8, political rhetoric when media houses in the status quo recognize moral boundaries when it comes to
864.8,869.2, reporting by not providing extensive details about suicide victims and methods and
869.2,873.6, promoting suicide hotlines instead because it is important not to perpetuate the legitimacy of
873.6,878.86, suicide to society. Prop contravenes this via mandating equal platforming as one side of
878.86,883.78," controversial discussions will be defending police brutality in the U.S., the use of Nazi symbols in"
883.78,889.44," Germany, and other positions which actively require them to justify oppressions, innately including dehumanizing"
889.44,893.36," rhetoric. Given the media is a culturally normative force, it creates the permission"
893.36,898.08, mechanisms that allow society to emulate the discriminatory language that the media has
898.08,903.2," legitimized as so-called fair discussion. Unlike on op, prom lacks the ability to criticize such"
903.2,912.0," rhetoric for two reasons. One, discriminatory rhetoric is disguised as neutral discussions, failing bigotry behind a veneer of legitimacy within mainstream media."
912.0,917.0," Contrasting to opposition, a small number of outlets engaging in this can be delegitimized and deplatformed."
917.0,929.36," But now, bigoted rhetoric once exclusive to this site is propagated in all news sites, making bigotry mainstream and signaling it is appropriate to hold this view. Secondly, back and forth debate between competing views means viewers"
929.36,934.16, get desensitized to morally grievous claims. The gravity of those claims lessen over time when we
934.16,939.12," view this as being yet another debate, much like how American voters get less and less outraged"
939.12,944.88," by the depravity of Donald Trump. Secondly, safe spaces of discourse are violated as minorities are"
944.88,945.6, forced to justify
945.6,949.68," their oppression. Instead of allowing minorities a safe space to share their lived experiences,"
950.4,954.24," Proud mandates that they have to exist in an adversarial climate. Before I go on, I'll take a"
954.24,964.48," point. Taking that as none, for example, yes. Yeah, you can see that the majority of viewers"
964.48,965.14, will be moderate.
965.46,971.72," When your side turns moderate into radical because you push them into watching Fox News every single day, how are you going to be better?"
972.16,973.88, So why are they forced to watch Fox News?
973.96,976.28, We already told you they have an incentive to seek out counter narratives.
976.62,979.34," But other than that, they can also watch CNN and they can throw off other views."
979.6,982.52, What you do is that you force liberal media to have conservative views.
982.66,987.52," And we think that is harmful. So on our side of the house, the illustration is that a transgender person sharing their gender"
987.52,991.84, identity journey is forced to face opponents who believe that gender dysphoria is a mental illness
991.84,996.4, and accusations of being a sexual predator just because they want to use a bathroom that matches
996.4,1000.4," their gender, requiring every minority to be traumatized in the process of advocacy."
1000.82,1003.9, The second argument is about how the fairness doctrine pushes people towards underground
1003.9,1008.58," information streams. Number one, they force media companies to platform all ideologies and therefore"
1008.58,1012.82, alienate viewers from mainstream media. People are then pushed towards echo chambers due to a trust
1012.82,1017.24, deficit between the people and the media when mainstream media platforms are seen as a tool of
1017.24,1022.28," a state to engineer social narratives. Secondly, the counterfactual is an exposure to diverse media"
1022.28,1025.0, but rather alternative and unregulated information streams.
1025.34,1032.54," Individuals abandon the major regulated media platforms in favor of underground platforms, which are unaffected by the fairness structure and under-propositions model."
1032.54,1041.16, And crypto-social networking sites like Parler seem an underground echo chambers because these alternate platforms are immune to criticism as they exist in the deepest parts of the internet.
1041.48,1049.3, The entrenchment of alternative media and powers misinformed political choices Trump's 2016 campaign saturated Facebook with millions of targeted ads effectively
1049.3,1053.14, replacing mainstream media with his political rhetoric with the majority of Trump voters
1053.14,1057.1, consuming their news from Facebook the misinformation led to his rise to power we
1057.1,1060.64, call up all our propositions benefit when we prove that the people whom they try to
1060.64,1070.08, stay from their echo chambers fall deeper into it proud to oppose
1108.0,1115.0," uh i find the speaker for this page can i have the second proposition figure here All right, I'll take my POIs in the chat, please. I will try to get to you as soon as I can."
1117.0,1125.84," Three, two, one. The fact that our opponents conflate conservative ideology with bigotry is indicative of the exact reason why we need to increase"
1125.84,1131.76," exposure to different ideas. A couple of things before I move on to my speech. Number one,"
1132.02,1136.52, they say our fairness is non-mechanized and that a lot of companies can exploit this loophole in
1136.52,1141.8," order to further perpetrate the status quo. Number one, this is simply not true. We have told you"
1141.8,1145.6, we are happy to imply fines. We are happy to penalize those who are
1145.6,1152.56, willing and who keep perpetrating the status quo but also uh but also additionally uh but also
1152.56,1158.64, additionally when in order to gain competitive also additionally even if some new channel try
1158.64,1164.32, to find and successfully exploit this loophole the harms only materialize insofar as all or the
1164.32,1165.52, majority of news channels
1165.52,1170.54," also do the same thing. Because one, there is now a higher standard. Their legitimacy will instantly"
1170.54,1175.28, be doubted because of diverse opinions is available everywhere now. And this is the standard for
1175.28,1179.62," fairness. If you don't have this, you are not fair. Your news channel is deleted and lost. But also,"
1179.82,1183.96," two, the appeal to consumers, it's really simple. One guy ranting versus two guys ranting at each"
1183.96,1188.56," other, which is more appealing? This is very obvious when when news channel provide discourse when news"
1188.56,1194.64, channel provide debate when news channel actually actually dig at the root of logic and ideology we
1194.64,1200.24, think this appeals far more to consumer and as long as this fairness doctrine is applied uh
1200.24,1206.7," applied uh news media will have an incentive to change. But furthermore, the ability point here,"
1206.82,1212.54," the ability to achieve absolute fairness is impossible. However, the point of the fairness"
1212.54,1216.8," doctrine is that you take both sides on their best ground, you invite their best expert,"
1216.94,1221.38," you invite their best representation, ideology, for them to combat against each other so that"
1221.38,1229.58," the truth comes out. We do not think this is a fair ground for opposition to take us on. But also moving on to my two classes today, number one on news quality,"
1229.88,1234.16," and number two on democracy. Let's look at number one, look at what they have given us. They told"
1234.16,1239.26," us that our side of the house will be dehumanizing, that people will be desensitized, and that we will"
1239.26,1246.08," legitimize things that are often controversial, like bad ideology. Let's tackle"
1246.08,1252.42," this. Number one, in regards to dehumanizing to people. Panel, if this is about finding solidarity"
1252.42,1258.3," for trans athletes, news media is not the place. You can do that elsewhere. Those alternatives"
1258.3,1266.72, exist. News media is when you interact with the other side. Panel opposition has to prove here why other platforms of safe
1266.72,1272.24, spaces do not exist on our side and also actually show why safe spaces is so important in the first
1272.24,1277.2, place because liberal movements tend to have a tendency to message among themselves and do not
1277.2,1282.4, interact with other people to believe them. This actually is the reason why you turn a lot of
1282.4,1285.86, moderate and slightly conservative supporters away.
1285.86,1300.52," For instance, the BLM actually lost momentum because they kept talking about defunding the police within themselves without actually explaining it to the other side, turning a lot of moderates away from BLM."
1300.94,1305.0," If you stick to your ideology, you don't grow, your movement actually fails."
1305.0,1312.0," For instance, take Martin Luther King. He made a much stronger effort to reach across the aisle like the march on Washington, for instance."
1312.0,1319.0, The whole reason why the Civil Rights Act was passed in the first place was because MLG was able to compromise and discuss with the other side.
1319.0,1329.08," The far better way to achieve the end goal of the trans movement, i.e. achieve chance-to- right or advocacy, is to challenge anti-trans narrative and not to let them fester. But also, the expert in"
1329.08,1334.68, participation in this discussion consented to participate in here. If you're a trans person
1334.68,1338.82," who feel like you won't be able to handle this kind of thing, you do not participate. But also,"
1339.04,1346.54," let's tackle the idea of desensitization. This is just factually false. People get equally angered on the, no matter how"
1346.54,1352.64," many matches they carry in a month, people get equally, so the desensitization is just weird."
1353.12,1359.64," But also, but moving on, how we on the, let's look at my extension, how we on the side have"
1359.64,1369.52," actually a higher quality of journalism, because the journalistic incentive will always be the bottom line of profit so traditionally they have done this by appealing to the select demographic"
1369.52,1374.0, and retaining their loyalty by feeding into pre-existing beliefs and diverging away from
1374.0,1378.08, contradictory narratives that might cause cognitive dissonance and uncomfortability
1378.08,1382.64, so the main comparative advantage for a lot of news sources in status quo is their political
1382.64,1385.36, leading so the racial bottom appears here.
1385.36,1387.76," The more one-sided you are, the more profit you get."
1387.76,1390.88, So how does the fairness doctrine completely change this?
1390.88,1393.36, When the fairness doctrine imposes a regulatory measures
1393.36,1394.32," across the bench,"
1394.32,1396.94, this doesn't change the profit incentive of news media.
1396.94,1398.94," So in order to gain competitive advantage,"
1398.94,1402.56, they have to distinguish themselves in other ways instead.
1402.56,1404.54," This is like seeking out more unique perspective,"
1404.54,1407.6, like in a discussion about climate change for instance you don't take this climate
1407.6,1412.48, doomism or climate advocacy and and but and and climate change doesn't exist you take perspective
1412.48,1418.32, from indigenous people people on the ground in order to stand out and and stand out from other
1418.32,1423.44, news sources secondly we think this also looks like some companies will do very aggressive kind
1423.44,1425.1," of rebuttal style debating,"
1429.96,1430.3, but others will specialize in more logical academic debates in order to appeal to various different demographics.
1434.52,1434.72," There are different ways companies can go about this, and they have an incentive to do so."
1437.96,1438.12," The impact here is that you lead on a race, you flip the race to the bottom,"
1441.82,1442.08, and you create a race to the top to achieve the highest quality of journalism.
1444.6,1448.8," You change consumer preference, and you improve democracy, and you eliminate the worst actors in the news industry with political agenda who are"
1448.8,1453.02," trying to misinform people. Before I move on to the second class, I'll take that POI."
1453.86,1458.5," The duty of the media isn't to engineer liberal outcomes, it is morality. So what is unengaged"
1458.5,1462.68," from our case is that the same conservative viewpoints oppose the very humanity of individuals,"
1462.86,1469.52," i.e. literally saying that trans individuals are not human. Why is it moral on your side of the house? Okay, number one, we never said"
1469.52,1475.38, it was moral. The difference here is that instead of letting these anti-trans narratives disperse
1475.38,1480.8," here one-sidedly for half the country, what you do now is that you integrate liberal ideology"
1480.8,1525.14," into those same channels. So if you really do believe that trans right is the correct morality here, then of course, when they battle it out, the anti trans will be debunked. And the truth stands that trans right, trans people do deserve it. And this is what we advocate for on our side of the house, whereas your side of the house has to protect half the country just listening to anti trans narratives. But moving on to democracy. Opposition gave us two, three things. Number one, echo chambers changes nothing. Number two is that you push people to the ground. Number three is that there will be no healthy discourse. The third reason they just stated it without giving any analysis as to why, but also let's tackle the push people to the ground. Couple of responses. Number one, people already do this."
1525.14,1526.82," Number two, this is not true."
1526.82,1529.18, Most people don't care enough in order to do this.
1529.18,1530.56," Take for one example,"
1530.56,1532.18," when Trump got kicked out of Twitter, yeah,"
1532.18,1533.82," conservative were very angry about it,"
1533.82,1535.12, but when he moved to this platform called
1535.12,1537.54," the Real Truth or whatever, did anyone move there?"
1537.54,1538.96," No, because they don't care enough,"
1538.96,1540.1," it's too much work, they will"
1540.1,1542.3, still stay at these particular places.
1542.3,1544.3," But also three, underground channels"
1544.3,1545.04, actually get smaller
1545.04,1548.56, on our side of the house because now various channels across the political spectrum allow
1548.56,1554.32," them a voice on national broadcast. So because they have a popularity incentive, they will leave"
1554.32,1558.08," underground channels for national broadcast. But also let's take them on the worst, let's take"
1558.08,1562.96," them the best case. Even if people do go, this is fine because underground discussion is only"
1562.96,1568.86, dangerous insofar as they are hyped up and legitimized by national broadcast because opposition can't say that everyone will
1568.86,1575.92," go to the same underground source. They cannot co-office. Rosa, now that I debunked their mean"
1575.92,1581.56," push against our clans, let's review what we have given you. We told you that we uniquely eliminate"
1581.56,1588.98, alienation between people. We disallow the strawmanning and misunderstanding that is integral to the kind of polarization
1588.98,1592.62, and lack of mediation in the status quo.
1592.62,1596.54," For individuals, we give you dialogue, but for the larger political landscape, we give"
1596.54,1600.68, you a better informed voters because now they take both sides of the spectrum and not simply
1600.68,1601.68, one side.
1601.68,1610.88," We have better voting panel, we have better containment of extremistist or radical values and you get a better democracy as a whole so proud to win on proposition"
1616.8,1625.18," i can the speaker for this page can have the second opposition speaker here here Yeah, can I confirm that I'm audible?"
1626.32,1627.0," Yes, you are."
1627.84,1631.78," Okay, great. I'll take my POIs verbally, so just unmute yourselves."
1634.34,1635.66, Setting up my timer.
1641.9,1645.42," Starting in three, 2, 1."
1646.14,1650.82," It is truly ironic that on site proposition, they wanted to argue for the minority."
1650.82,1656.4, They wanted to argue championing leftist ideals and ensuring that society is a far better democracy.
1656.88,1662.86," When they were the ones that handed bigots the megaphone, when in the last bits of the second proposition speech,"
1663.12,1665.28, they conceded in trying to respond and
1665.28,1670.32, mitigate to our harms that actually news and underground sites become smaller because they
1670.32,1675.6, broadcast them and they gave them a platform the reason why proposition needs to take the loss
1675.6,1680.88, immediately is because they never fulfilled their burden on one hand their entire first argument was
1680.88,1685.68, only contingent in half of these scenarios in terms of when conservative bubbles
1685.68,1690.56, and conservative echo chambers are now flooded with neutrality and the fairness doctrine but
1690.56,1695.52, they needed to concede therefore the converse of that situation as well which is that in protected
1695.52,1699.68, liberal echo chambers and protected liberal circles where these were the same spaces that
1699.68,1704.16, you quote unquote said they could default to that you would erode all of those situations and you
1704.16,1709.4," would turn the previously leftist individuals on the fence towards conservatism, which is why their"
1709.4,1713.54," first argument needs to fall, because their first argument does not actually fulfill their burden"
1713.54,1718.56, in terms of the harms equally applied symmetrically in the converse. All they get is individuals
1718.56,1724.24," politically confused and within a political deadlock. But second, note that before I move on"
1724.24,1726.48," to my later parts of the speech, what"
1726.48,1730.88, have they not responded to from first opposition? Note that they say that there is no actual
1730.88,1735.6, engagement or no actual analysis as to why individuals would pivot and go to underground
1735.6,1741.68," news streams. Note that this is an extremely important argumentation, because I think it"
1741.68,1750.28, kills off the entirety of PropBench because their first argument on political polarization and their second argument on better outcomes for democracy
1750.28,1755.54, and social outcomes are all contingent on buy-in because only in so far as people actually
1755.54,1759.96, subscribe and absorb the information under the fairness doctrine in their world are they
1759.96,1762.18, able to materialize the harms.
1762.18,1765.76, Which is why after at least one or two minutes of analysis
1765.76,1769.76," from first opposition, the response that we heard from second prop was insufficient, if"
1769.76,1775.32, not disingenuous. They said that it is far too much work to go to underground streams.
1775.32,1779.06, But what was the nuance that we provided to you in first opposition? And they continuously
1779.06,1783.24, affirm this in first and second proposition when their whole argumentation was trying
1783.24,1788.8, to re-engineer the way in which individuals work. If their end outcome was liberalism and individuals tried
1788.8,1792.98," to be empathetic, they actively tried to change conservative viewpoints and actively tried to"
1792.98,1797.22," change conservative ideals, which is why it directly fed into the first opposition clash"
1797.22,1802.26, and the first opposition point in terms of there exists a massive trust deficit in status quo
1802.26,1809.6, that you're going to exacerbate in the first place which is why individuals are more likely to turn to other forms of information that are unlikely to be
1809.6,1814.88, regulated or far harder to regulate on our side because individuals actively feel like they're
1815.68,1820.8, like their choices and the information that they consume are propaganda and state machine and state
1820.8,1824.48, sanction which means that they're unable or unwilling to actually want to engage in that
1824.48,1827.32, that is number one in terms of pushing towards echo chamber. But number
1827.32,1831.96," two, we gave you a far more nuanced rebuttal preemptively in terms of even if they didn't"
1831.96,1836.58," pivot towards these kinds of information streams underground, how do people absorb the information"
1836.58,1840.4, is necessarily important. Because I think Proposition only wanted to hinge their case
1840.4,1844.88," on the truly ignorant, that these are people that live literally insulated, never heard"
1844.88,1850.04," a counter to racism, and therefore the exposure meant they changed their minds. The reason why"
1850.04,1855.46, this is an important response is opposition will be the only team to actually analyze how do people
1855.46,1860.54," internalize and process this information, and what are the conclusions that they come to. If they"
1860.54,1867.72," believe that the state is trying to engineer their choice, that the only reason Fox News is platforming this liberal speaker that is invited"
1867.72,1870.54," is not because we truly believe that it's a legitimate viewpoint,"
1870.74,1872.96," but rather that the state requires us to do this,"
1873.12,1876.64," or else on their side, you would take away their licenses and fine them."
1876.88,1879.26," That means for the individuals that they're trying to characterize,"
1879.56,1882.46," who are truly bigoted, did not want to change their viewpoints,"
1882.7,1888.64, that these individuals are likely going to selectively hear and selectively reinforce what is said on the media. So it does
1888.64,1893.02," not matter that after each article, there's a liberal viewpoint. After each interview, there's"
1893.02,1896.8, another liberal individual speaking. Do the individual and the people that they wanted to
1896.8,1901.5," cater to, their stakeholder of the bigoted, actually care? We told you not. But lastly,"
1901.56,1905.48," before I move on to substantive rebuttal, is it even legitimate to"
1905.48,1909.38, change the viewpoints of individuals and their quote-unquote good outcome? Because we would say
1909.38,1914.32," that democracies inherently reflect the will of the people. If society was overtly conservative,"
1914.54,1918.96," as Proposition would like to characterize, it would not only be impossible, but also immoral"
1918.96,1923.5, for the state to socially engineer the media to indoctrinate their populations. Given this
1923.5,1928.24," characterization of society, it would also instead push society to seek through their preferred information through"
1928.24,1931.9," underground streams, like we've already affirmed. But the last argumentation that they never wanted"
1931.9,1937.04," to actually properly engage with on the moral minimums in society, what was their response?"
1937.36,1941.74," That we need to prove why safe spaces were inherently important. Not that safe spaces,"
1942.0,1945.56," firstly, was only one layer of that response. We argued that"
1945.56,1950.16, there are certain moral minimums that should exist in society regardless. The same way media and
1950.16,1955.72," organized media organizations ban, for example, hate speech, is because we recognize that certain"
1955.72,1960.04," language, certain things are dehumanizing to certain people's identity, are things that we"
1960.04,1964.46, should not go and cross the line towards. Unless proposition would like to argue against hate
1964.46,1968.8," speech, they would have to likely use the debate. Their only response therefore was why don't they"
1968.8,1973.76, pivot elsewhere to other places? We told you number one how the introduction of these conservative
1973.76,1978.08, values in other liberal safe spaces means that you actually don't have safe spaces altogether
1978.08,1982.96," under the neutrality that they quote unquote want to protect, but also that it's important that you"
1982.96,1989.58," don't consent to this participation because on our side, you can uniquely only be platformed in spaces where you feel or felt safe."
1989.88,1994.56," On proposition, the only place that you can be platformed always and requires you, and it's"
1994.56,1999.08," mandated by the state, to always have an opposition towards your view. So even if you can quote,"
1999.12,2003.02," unquote, consent, most individuals don't even feel safe enough to even be part of that discussion"
2003.02,2006.5, in the first place. But they agree that it's a culturally normative force.
2006.5,2013.62, So that is why it's important to platform these kinds of things and ensure the correct ideologies and the correct viewpoints are actually being channeled in the first place.
2013.78,2016.72," Which means that if it's not important for transport, it should go elsewhere."
2017.06,2029.44," If the media is culturally normative, that means that they are able to impact the way people are able to perceive them and the safe spaces matters the most because safe spaces in a small community versus safe spaces being being able to be perpetuated over society is"
2029.44,2036.0, what matters reform what is our point i don't think you're really listening to us we're not
2036.0,2039.92, we're never talking about like reducing conservatism we're finally flooding liberal
2039.92,2043.68, with conservative ideas as long as they are debunked and debated and allow people to listen
2043.68,2048.32, to each other please engage then you have to contradict your first argumentations your third
2048.32,2051.98, proposition speaker needs to tell me therefore why your first argument even matters if you're
2051.98,2056.38, not going to champion changing individuals viewpoints on to a third substantive as to
2056.38,2060.68, how the fairness doctrine worsens the political climate and causes information debt loss two
2060.68,2064.92, layers here first prop creates an aggressive political climate that highlights and cements
2064.92,2065.16, division in ideology we are mandating all news and ideologies to exist in a competitive format two layers here first prop case an aggressive political climate that highlights and cements
2065.16,2069.78, division in ideology we are mandating all news and ideologies to exist in a competitive format
2069.78,2073.74, which will be extremely flawed which is why it was the critical nuance from first opposition
2073.74,2077.46, as well as what is the moral difference and the categorical difference in terms of the
2077.46,2081.96, ideology that you mandate on one hand some new sites choose to engage in this on their own
2081.96,2088.9, volition but we can hold them accountable versus the state crossing the moral boundary and crossing the moral line by forcing all media
2088.9,2093.6," sites and being a culprit towards an oppression. Therefore, presenters choose the easier,"
2093.8,2098.06," low-hanging fruit rhetoric in order to sway the audience rather than complex, intellectually"
2098.06,2102.56," honest engagement that Prop is expecting. But second, discourse is not equal even under the"
2102.56,2128.88," fairness doctrine. We never said that Prop had to defend absolute fairness. All we told you is that the implementationimize the suffering of individuals. Second, it's selecting speakers with"
2128.88,2133.26, different levels of charisma and eloquence. A charismatic speaker is going to be far more able
2133.26,2138.02, to captivate audiences that could easily sway towards Republican values that they deter. But
2138.02,2141.9," third, it could also like speakers relying on viscerality of certain perspectives, like late-term"
2141.9,2148.76," abortion and showing a video of babies being torn apart. On our side, we protect the integrity of media and protecting the"
2148.76,2150.24, integrity of individual thought.
2150.24,2158.24, I'll thank the speaker for the speech. Can I have the entire proposition speaker?
2158.24,2195.0," Here, here. Продолжение следует... I'm actually visible and audible."
2195.0,2226.88, Thank you. My speech will start now.
2226.88,2230.52, Notice how opposition's case only stands and only has a real impact to the extent that
2230.52,2233.84, they try to strongman our case and things that we've told you and the way that the world
2233.84,2234.84, actually works.
2234.84,2239.44," Look, our end goal has never been, you know, trying to push liberalism onto every single"
2239.44,2242.04, person or to change radical people's minds.
2242.04,2249.2," It's to make people chill on both sides of the house, and to make sure that they don't get pushed down the road to radicalism because they only see one"
2249.2,2254.96," kind of TV, only one side of the political spectrum every single day because that's the way"
2254.96,2260.88," they behave. That's where the confirmation bias works. Look, liberal media is not perfect, unlike"
2260.88,2269.36," what the upside says, and neither is conservative conservative media both because they talk from their own side and only report their own narratives exclusively and ridiculing the other"
2269.36,2273.28, we solve this not changing people's minds opposition to the wrong word and pushing and
2273.28,2278.48, positively oh we're gonna change people's minds this this and that way no what we're telling you
2278.48,2283.6, is to give you information so that people can make up their own minds and do the thinking and reasoning
2283.6,2286.08, through things themselves but sure
2286.08,2289.76, let's say changing people's minds is what we are about here we are far more likely to do that when
2289.76,2293.52, we first conservative media with liberal ideas oh yeah i prefer to mention i'll take your eyes
2293.52,2297.76, verbally um we are probably when we flush conservative media with liberal ideas and we
2297.76,2302.4, flip liberal media with conservative leaders right because what to the extent these ideas are able to
2302.4,2308.56, be debunked if they're wrong as i wasn't trying to tell you or it's just you know reduce the impact of these ideas which are purely
2308.56,2313.36, or in many cases just mostly based on rhetoric we make sure people are less likely to bind these
2313.36,2318.4, ideas to such a large extent and go to such lengths to harm other people because they believe
2318.4,2322.56, that trans people should not exist right but also let's point out a few things from opposition
2322.56,2326.04, number one the opposite of people are rational enough to think critically and look
2326.04,2329.76," at alternative sources, but also that there's such misguided blank slates that they will"
2329.76,2332.32, just believe racism the moment they see it on TV.
2332.32,2333.32, Which characterization is it?
2333.32,2334.88, Which one do you want to use?
2334.88,2339.02," But also, let's move on to main questions in the debate and prove to you why on all"
2339.02,2341.02," of the main questions, top position wins, right?"
2341.02,2342.02, Three main questions.
2342.02,2343.02," Number one, on polarization."
2343.02,2344.88, We'll get a few ideas from opposition.
2344.88,2347.52," Number one, they tell you these individuals are likely to be rational enough to"
2347.52,2351.36," seek a counter-analysis. We already gave you a response on this, but we'll add more to that later."
2351.36,2354.48," Secondly, you say that you push lessest people, I take it a bit, lessest people towards"
2354.48,2358.64, conservatism because liberal bubbles become saturated with conservative views and you have
2358.64,2362.32," to ensure the correct viewpoints are being channeled. Three, you say that you're going to"
2362.32,2367.46," go underground because more liberal viewpoints in places like Fox News. Why are all these ideas untrue? Number one,"
2367.46,2371.92," on individuals. Look, what is the time-centered for them to seek out counter narratives? It"
2371.92,2375.32," usually means you have to go out of your way to seek out another source, check whether"
2375.32,2378.78," it serves a similar or opposing view, and then read through their articles. We get no"
2378.78,2382.26, proof from opposition as to why these people have the incentive to spend their time and
2382.26,2387.92," energy doing so other than, oh, they're always probably politically more they're probably politically engaged look look at the"
2387.92,2392.72, status quo there are people who turn from moderates to extreme right-wing radicals simply by watching
2392.72,2397.28, fox news and even though they were politically engaged at the start they slowly went down this
2397.28,2402.08, path on proposition inside the house even if these people have this kind of as interest there aren't
2402.08,2408.32, perfect in their ability to always do so and do so in a balanced way on her position at the very least we take away the giant road and they
2408.32,2412.08, have to take on when they have to go out and find these things it would make it so much easier for
2412.08,2416.64, them to get a few points secondly i'm going to move underground let's explore this right why
2416.64,2420.32, exactly do people move underground the people who are underground and actively go underground
2420.32,2424.32, the opposition mentions are already radical that's where they seek out these other ideas
2424.32,2427.88, to reinforce their own in their first place there's no change in radicals on either side.
2428.1,2432.18, The group we will target is moderate vote. But also a lot of conservative anger that causes
2432.18,2435.88," people to move underground is about as I give it, about conservative voters are not represented"
2435.88,2439.74," enough. The matter is that they're not making our voices heard in the mainstream. Therefore,"
2439.74,2443.72, we need to move to underground sources like Parler to voice our ideas. Top position takes
2443.72,2446.32, away the initial reason that many moderate people move underground
2446.32,2449.76, in the first place. They don't see staunch right-wing narratives and channels like Fox News
2449.76,2453.52, spreading and legitimizing ideas that the election was stolen without any check and balance that is
2453.52,2456.72, immediately visible. They don't feel like they need to go to an alternative source because they're
2456.72,2459.84," not being represented in the mainstream. It is not a coincidence that problematic news,"
2459.84,2463.52," whether it's just like Infowars or One America News, that's mostly loudly amplified by internet"
2463.52,2469.12," news, came to rise along with Fox. They were legitimized by it. If you've never heard of the fake news via Fox or if you"
2469.12,2473.04," see them directly disproved, where do you get the motivation to go looking for more information on"
2473.04,2477.36," the ground? So therefore, on proposition, they give you as a rule in which A people are more"
2477.36,2480.88, likely to be able to see ideas that directly counter a certain narrative than they see.
2480.88,2484.64," Therefore, they're less likely to buy into harmful narratives in the first place. Therefore,"
2484.64,2487.92, we give them accurate information. We give information on either side so that
2487.92,2489.32, they can make the decisions themselves.
2489.32,2493.32," Whereas the opposition, they tell you that there's only one correct source of information."
2493.32,2498.24," You know, you can have liberal news here, conservative news there, and you have two"
2498.24,2499.72, different groups of people watch them.
2499.72,2503.72," Therefore, an entire half of society never gets access to the kind of information that"
2503.72,2508.96, opposition wants so basically for the people to get access to right because sure you can keep shielding people
2508.96,2513.28, who may be more sensitive who may be hurt forever but the fact is that there's still people out there
2513.28,2518.32, in society who listen to these narratives and act on them therefore even if sure they feel temporary
2518.32,2522.88, um satisfaction because these news channels are saying things that sound nice to them people in
2522.88,2545.36," society still believe the opposite and will go out to do things like shoot up entire restaurants, shoot up things like the buffalo shooting because they believe they replace their theory, right? We care about social change to the extent and what happens in actual society because news is just information, right? It's what happens as a result of it that matters. If you're coming on, yes, I'll take the POI yeah exposure and engagement exists for the most politically salient issues"
2545.36,2549.52, like we've already explained like BLM still had engagement from both hours of the spectrum you
2549.52,2553.92, still need to justify our first argument why is it okay for every discussion about gender dysphoria
2553.92,2559.28, for individuals and trans people to be dehumanized in every single media house okay look at it this
2559.28,2563.68, way yeah if you only ever see one side of the argument and then you the moment that you see
2563.68,2568.8, the other side for example if you don't believe that people may be able to identify as a different gender this is
2568.8,2573.44, all you see all the time without any other counter alternatives going along with it this is what
2573.44,2576.64, you're going to believe you're going to be set in it the moment you see another alternative saying
2576.64,2580.72, oh transit we deserve to live they have their gender you just got this because that's confirmation
2580.72,2588.88, bias we take away the ability for them to do it in their first place sure some issues have um discussions on both sides but the issue in the status quo that it's so divided into
2588.88,2593.28, different sources for that are targeted towards different groups of people as on our side of the
2593.28,2597.36, house you're never able to make these people change their minds and also on our house movements
2597.36,2601.36, get better because they're able to you know check these arguments so it will spread them as logic
2601.36,2605.04," and disgusted make them interact, not just exist in a vacuum"
2605.04,2609.6, where people will never be able to change their minds. Moving on to the second clash on minorities.
2609.6,2614.88," You say that you spread, we spread dehumanizing, and minorities will traumatize and"
2614.88,2619.2, look at people as more racist than normal people. Let's address two major concerns of the Fairness
2619.2,2624.48," Doctrine of Opposition. Number one, the Fairness Doctrine operates upon controversial issues of"
2624.48,2625.0, public importance.
2625.0,2628.0," Opposition examples things like suicide, which isn't controversial."
2628.0,2632.0, The fact that they lead with this in the first place means they don't understand fairness doctrine.
2632.0,2635.0," Secondly, discriminatory rhetoric is not portrayed as neutral."
2635.0,2641.0, No part of the fairness doctrine does that. What happens is that discriminatory rhetoric is countered with anti-discriminatory rhetoric and logic.
2641.0,2647.28," But secondly, I'm going to work in a safe space. At no point in time has news media existed for the purpose of being a safe space for minority groups."
2647.28,2650.56," Their purpose is to provide fair, accurate information upon which people can be informed"
2650.56,2654.16," and make the best decisions possible. If people want solidarity and community, they're alternatives."
2654.16,2657.84," They can go to social media, they can go to forums. But let's flip this. Dehumanizing political"
2657.84,2661.52, rhetoric is far more potent on opposition. Instead of potentially being watered down by having
2661.52,2665.32," opposing people present to call out certain ideas, for example, by having two speakers"
2665.32,2666.44, discussing each other's points
2666.44,2667.9," and providing alternative arguments,"
2667.9,2669.46, these narratives fester in the minds of people
2669.46,2672.24, who see them over and over again within an echo chamber.
2672.24,2674.44, The same dehumanizing political rhetoric exists on the out.
2674.44,2675.88, The difference is that people don't have any immediate
2675.88,2678.42, source of alternative viewpoints to check themselves
2678.42,2679.44," and tone in their beliefs,"
2679.44,2681.12," and thus are more likely to radicalize,"
2681.12,2682.22," believe in these narratives,"
2682.22,2684.0," asking them, for example, in the Buffalo shooting."
2684.0,2689.44," And conservatives are more precise. Look, the ideas that are frankly ridiculous wins out more"
2689.44,2693.28, on their side because people like Jordan Peterson are pushed into spheres where there are only
2693.28,2698.88, conservative people who reinforce these ideas and listen to him and champion him. Right? Only when
2698.88,2704.24, we have an alternative viewpoint to interact with it and point out the fact that there are certain
2704.24,2706.72, ideas that are not actually that strong logically.
2706.88,2709.72," Can people see that, oh, maybe it's not such a good thing."
2709.92,2713.48," On your side, when you push these ideas into these places where you get an echo"
2713.48,2715.64," chamber, you never break out of these ideas."
2715.84,2717.48, We can't fear that all the people will win.
2717.56,2720.32," But more importantly, the likelihood of stupid people like Ben Shapiro getting"
2720.32,2723.36, beaten and having to interact with actual profit people is far higher.
2723.56,2724.8," Therefore, what do we get?"
2729.52,2733.2, I'm proposition we get your vote in which we help democracy because we give them information that is all we give them information upon which they can make decisions opposition does not do
2733.2,2736.8, that because they give you one side of information second or minorities will give you a world in which
2736.8,2741.2, social change is actually more likely to happen whereas opposition only gives you like an illusion
2741.2,2745.2, of solvency because you appear comforting things on the news therefore for
2745.2,2769.88, proposition thank you uh i'll try and government speaker for this fish kind of opposition here Am I audible?
2771.82,2772.68," Yes, you are."
2774.52,2780.12," I'll take P.Y.s in the chat, starting in 3, 2, 1."
2780.82,2785.36," It was high time we took off the rose-tinted glasses of the prop and call it for what it is,"
2785.64,2791.0, a doctrine of bigotry and of oppression. The problem with the proposition case thus far was
2791.0,2795.62, their infatuation with liberalizing the world without acknowledging how this policy works.
2796.02,2801.22," Yes, we agreed that we will push liberal viewpoints on conservative news and also push"
2801.22,2806.1, conservative viewpoints on liberal news. The problem here was that they can't claim
2806.1,2808.56," which of these outcomes are going to be more likely,"
2808.8,2811.2, which means most of these outcomes are then ambiguous.
2811.72,2814.22, Let's highlight the strategic mistake of their case
2814.22,2816.74, and be clear about what the burden actually is.
2817.18,2819.38, This proposition team took it upon themselves
2819.38,2821.12, to impose better behavior.
2821.62,2823.6, This was important because they took it upon themselves
2823.6,2824.86, to prove liberalization
2824.86,2829.92," because in the first prop speech, they call out negative forms of rhetoric such as like being"
2829.92,2834.08, homophobic and therefore they fail here and have nothing left standing but the problem was that
2834.08,2837.92, they can't have a case shift later on and lower their burden because the third prop shoots
2837.92,2842.96, themselves in the foot by creating a massive case shift saying we are not pushing for liberalism but
2842.96,2845.04, we're just informing people by letting you
2845.04,2849.92, hear other viewpoints and other rebuttals which means you become a more informed citizen the
2849.92,2854.4, reason why this can't work is an extremely soft case because if their stance is just that we want
2854.4,2860.4, more information then that has no impact because it meant that on their side this this was why they
2860.4,2868.6, needed to defend this burden specifically because all of their impacts about making a better democracy all of their impacts on questioning yourself meant that it
2868.6,2873.06, was contingent on outcomes so it wasn't that our case was strawmanning this by forcing them to
2873.06,2877.32, defend the outcomes it was because in order for any of their impacts to be meaningful it needed
2877.32,2882.64, to change people's behavior meaningfully otherwise the debate can't take place therefore you get put
2882.64,2889.28," into a difficult position because at the end of the prop bench, you are left to question which speaker should you discard entirely and why."
2889.54,2893.04," Was it their first speech on whether you wanted to push people to better forms of behavior,"
2893.26,2897.28, or was it their third speech on just giving them more information and democratic empowerment?
2897.66,2902.84," In comparison, our stance was simple. If we proved the Fannas doctrine did more harm than good,"
2903.04,2905.6," we won. This was not merely a negative case,"
2905.76,2908.8," because we prevented a massive negative externality from happening,"
2909.02,2910.46," one that was irreversible,"
2910.62,2912.72," and we also explained why, on our side,"
2912.9,2915.3," even without this policy, things were getting better,"
2915.4,2916.18," and that was important,"
2916.34,2919.2, because it means the excess of harm they framed to you from the first speech
2919.2,2920.94, are entirely out of the round.
2921.22,2929.2," With this, Team Vietnam is on a very good track to losing this debate, quite clearly. Three issues in this speech. First, on the principle justification in democracy."
2929.66,2933.44," Second, on information and echo chambers. And third, on the innate failures of this policy."
2933.86,2938.66," First, I want to note that the prop concedes the importance of abiding by moral minimums every time"
2938.66,2942.62, they claim there are some things we should not discuss. There's an important clarification here
2942.62,2945.32, because OPP is not saying all conservative ideals
2945.32,2950.84," are harmful. There are certain moral minimums you ought to follow, like don't platform dehumanizing"
2950.84,2956.64," rhetoric. And the reason for this is quite simple, because even if the state had the obligation to"
2956.64,2961.8," platform information, the state also had to abide by standards that if we prove a large social harm,"
2961.8,2965.42, then the negative duty to not do this outweighs their positive duty
2965.42,2970.4, to put this information. So given that all private actors have to abide by negative duties to not
2970.4,2974.64," perpetuate social harms, we explain that this falls in line with that and the state ought not"
2974.64,2979.28, to do this. Our argument was not that you immediately see racist views and you become
2979.28,2984.14, racist. Don't let them get away by simplifying this. We explained that it was the creation of
2984.14,2990.92, permission mechanisms that gradually legitimized dehumanizing rhetoric in the public sphere. What does this look
2990.92,2995.32," like? Realistically, we're not saying that all forms of discussions had to be toxic and"
2995.32,3000.4," dehumanizing, because being anti-immigration doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put"
3000.4,3005.28, down all Muslims as being people who are terrorists but this they concede to the reason
3005.28,3010.0, as to why this will work in the in their own speeches when they claim media companies are
3010.0,3015.68, dying and therefore have an incentive to make their forms of rhetoric emotional to polarize
3015.68,3021.12, people if this is true then that incentive is also symmetric on their end which means that they will
3021.12,3028.32, also want to capitalize off this rhetoric in fact i think it gets worse under their side because if it's true that media companies come polarized based
3028.32,3033.04, on their own their own audiences basis they were now on one end of the spectrum because now
3033.04,3037.36, everything is neutralized it means they're going to rely on these things far more which means that
3037.36,3041.52, you're able to have far more polarizing and emotional discussions on their end so it doesn't
3041.52,3050.5, automatically equate to dehumanization but per their own mechanism it will be we hear two responses the first is that very late in third prop they say
3050.5,3055.48, dehumanizing conservative rhetoric also exists on the opposition the reason as to why it's different
3055.48,3060.7, is twofold first this is state sanctioned oppression because the state mandates this so
3060.7,3070.22, even if on our side it exists the state has the ability to call them out and it's not platforming this on already liberal sites. And the second thing here was that most of these things
3070.22,3074.18," are already going down, which means people already recognize people are quite media literate and they"
3074.18,3078.4, don't want to see really forms of polarized news. The difference here is that they are no longer
3078.4,3082.7," able to call out those bad news because of the permission mechanism we highlighted from first,"
3082.9,3085.02," that you see all of these things are worth discussing,"
3085.22,3087.78, that everything has to be put into the public sphere.
3088.0,3090.0, That is when you can no longer call them out the same way
3090.0,3090.92," which you could do previously,"
3091.18,3094.74, which is why our organic mechanisms of framing out their worst excesses of harm
3094.74,3097.42," get lost under the outside, which is why it's not symmetric."
3097.82,3099.32, We explained that if the outside is true
3099.32,3101.1," and society has been informed and empowered,"
3101.28,3103.72, then the 70% of people who are politically conscious
3103.72,3109.12, will be participating in politics anyways. But now all political discussions are more toxic per our first
3109.12,3112.96, argument if their claim is that people are open-minded then probably they want to be
3112.96,3117.2, open-minded on our side as well and move out to do these things we no longer have the ability to do
3117.2,3121.44, that on their side because these forms of discussions get more more toxic which leads
3121.44,3129.78, into the second argument about information echo chambers but before that i'll take a point i think you just shoot yourself in the foot on your side the state
3129.78,3134.92, lets anti-trans rhetoric happens at the same time occur what principle are you setting on
3134.92,3139.78, so i just responded to this by saying there's a categorical difference between the news company
3139.78,3144.32, doing this and you forcing another news company who has never done this to then do this because
3144.32,3148.96, your claim here is that if they are anti-trans rhetoric and the way that you are going to solve it is by
3148.96,3153.6, letting the neutralizing viewpoint change people's minds with conceits once again your burden was
3153.6,3157.12, then on impact but the reason as to why we highlighted was that people are more like to
3157.12,3161.36, have better discussions when you don't force these things per the permission mechanism but second i
3161.36,3164.64, think this leads nicely in the second argument because it proves those discussions get way more
3164.64,3167.66," toxic under your side from the first first op setup, we explained that even"
3167.66,3172.24," without the fairness doctrine, media companies have incentives to explore diversity of viewpoints"
3172.24,3175.94, because consumers are more media literate and will be highly critical of extremely one-sided
3175.94,3179.84," bias reporting. So therefore, people do have some small incentive to liberalize independent"
3179.84,3184.24, of this policy. But the prop failed to answer a crucial question. If people are so used to
3184.24,3188.94," cultures of convenience, the moment you shove something they aren't used to, why won't they go"
3188.94,3193.46," somewhere else? Therefore, immediately after the introduction of the fairness doctrine,"
3193.66,3198.8, it's a golden time for political opportunists to amplify anti-establishment rhetoric. They can hop
3198.8,3203.16," on the train to frame the state as Orwellian, as forcing their ideologies upon us. Sure,"
3203.52,3205.24, fringe underground media will exist
3205.24,3209.2, regardless. They are correct. But now they'll capitalize on the trust deficit between people
3209.2,3212.72," and the state. Given that these underground news sources do not fall under the doctrine,"
3212.96,3217.18, they become far worse. I want to know why this argument is important. Because props arguments
3217.18,3220.8," are all contingent on the circumstances where they are polarized. Maybe you believe their side,"
3220.8,3228.48, maybe you believe ours. This does not matter on who you're trying to affect because these media sites get empowered and therefore they concede from first proposition
3228.48,3233.6, that a small amount of people the vocal polarized minority now get pushed towards these things so
3233.6,3237.84, even if it's a small people amount of people who are going into underground news sites it's a
3237.84,3242.0, massive impact so their second their second prop response i'm saying it's hard to go underground
3242.0,3247.54, doesn't count because we prove that the people who are are going to become far worse here the third issue was down on the inherent failures of
3247.54,3252.5, the doctrine so there are mechanisms that says exposure could work we explain it could work in
3252.5,3257.2, the opposite way as well but this means that they have very little defense they they can't just claim
3257.2,3261.3, we will regulate it not only is it very difficult to regulate every single piece of content that's
3261.3,3266.38," put out but these are unquantifiable metrics metrics. You can measure the time given to a speaker,"
3266.38,3268.38," but you can't measure qualitative metrics,"
3268.38,3270.16, just as the charisma and other parts
3270.16,3272.5," of how people subconsciously perceive them,"
3272.5,3274.36, which is why if media companies were so bad
3274.36,3275.28," as they wanted to say,"
3275.28,3277.34," they get infinitely worse on the proposition,"
3277.34,3279.6, and that was something we were never willing to defend.
3279.6,3287.6," For all these reasons, you had to oppose"
3294.24,3296.8, uh i find this bigger for this page can i have the opposition reply sticker here
3305.5,3309.88," audible right yeah Okay. Starting in three, two, one."
3309.88,3312.98," Panel, what was the outcome of Team Proposition's arguments"
3312.98,3317.98," on polarization, news quality, journalism, and democracy?"
3318.12,3321.24, All of them were never argued in abstract.
3321.24,3322.84, All of them had an outcome.
3322.84,3325.54," They compounded and said that polarization,"
3330.22,3334.68, the outcome of polarization is a more empathetic society. They told you that news quality meant better decision-making. They told you that better journalism also enabled better climates for
3334.68,3339.3, discussion. They talked to you about democracy and the outcome of democracy was better voter
3339.3,3344.44," literacy. They never once argued the abstract concept of having more information, which is why"
3344.44,3346.02, we never strawman their case.
3346.3,3351.36, And that is why the burden that we imposed and extrapolated to them from first opposition was always correct.
3351.58,3356.5, But second proposition and third proposition never wanted to actually engage and defend their own burden.
3356.7,3360.76, The failure to actually uphold the minimum standard in this debate for their team is why they lost.
3361.02,3368.02," Three issues in this speech. Number one, the fairness doctrine and how it contravenes moral minimums. Secondly, on opt-in to traditional media or pushing them further"
3368.02,3373.06," underground. And third, on polarization. On the first issue, on the fairness doctrine and how it"
3373.06,3378.54, contravenes moral minimums. Note that Proposition's only engagement was parallel in its best form.
3378.54,3383.24, They kept rehashing and their only response was that it does not matter if there's dehumanizing
3383.24,3386.68, rhetoric because there is always something else there to counter it.
3386.68,3389.0, But what we said is that we should not have kept
3389.0,3391.06," legitimizing them in the first place,"
3391.06,3394.0," that it is better for the already not racist,"
3394.0,3397.46," not transphobic media houses to remain the way they are,"
3397.46,3399.5, as opposed to forcing them into discussions
3399.5,3400.94," and forcing them into the debates,"
3400.94,3403.5," where previously we could platform, for example,"
3403.5,3405.36, the issues of trans individuals in it
3405.36,3410.56, in a vacuum but now you're forced to engage with the oppressor in those instances which is why them
3410.56,3415.12, just saying we will engage anyway is not actually important for two reasons that we already gave to
3415.12,3420.72, you number one in terms they cannot guarantee the outcome always sways towards humanity and empathy
3420.72,3429.18, but number two that if that is the case that therefore we ought not to force individuals to have to be traumatized in the process of advocacy. Why is it that you always
3429.18,3433.76," have to consent to being told you're illegitimate, to being told you're mentally ill? On our side,"
3433.82,3439.02," you never have to consent to, or the prerequisite was never trauma in the first place. We then also"
3439.02,3444.18," explained to you how the permission mechanisms was how you created a more polarized, bigoted society."
3444.4,3445.24, It was not that the
3445.24,3449.5," minute in which liberal houses have another news source that is conservative, that therefore they"
3449.5,3454.84," become racist. It was the idea that constant exposure to dehumanizing rhetoric, the permission"
3454.84,3459.68," mechanisms created, constantly seeing these kinds of discussions and assuming that this is normal"
3459.68,3463.92," debate, means that people are able to emulate these discussions and emulate said beliefs,"
3463.92,3469.38," which means that you can't categorically call them racist, but just engaging in the neutral,"
3469.54,3474.08," quote-unquote, fair discussion that society has mandated, which is why, therefore, the negative"
3474.08,3480.22," duty the state had was more important, to not cause harm to these individuals, to not be a"
3480.22,3490.08, culprit in oppression by forcing all media houses to now be participants instead oppression as opposed to the positive burden of media houses or the state wanting to give more information
3490.08,3494.48, which could have been achieved elsewhere secondly on opt-in to traditional media or going further
3494.48,3499.44, underground note that this issue entirely whacked out propositions case because here we engage with
3499.44,3504.96, the idea that opt-in was the prerequisite for any of their harms to actually manifest their only
3504.96,3505.54, responses is that it takes far too much work or that individuals actually become smaller because that often was the prerequisite for any of their harms to actually manifest. Their only responses
3505.54,3509.36, is that it takes far too much work or that individuals actually become smaller because
3509.36,3513.7," you broadcast them en masse. We told you two things. We told you, number one, in terms of"
3513.7,3517.8, the trust deficit and the social engineering of your choices and how individuals will pivot
3517.8,3522.24," elsewhere. But number two, you're not broadcasting these individuals and giving them a platform to"
3522.24,3527.2," feel safe because, number one, you're invading their safe spaces currently."
3527.46,3530.42, You're invading Fox News and their only source of conservative media.
3530.6,3536.82," But even in the places where you, quote, unquote, broadcasted them, you never guaranteed them the conservative value actually winning out."
3536.82,3548.44," Us being platformed on New York Times never meant that I felt safe as a conservative in those spaces if you couldn't prove empirically that they would always agree with my ideology. Therefore, they had to agree with going underground and they had to"
3548.44,3552.5," give the echo chambers and that is their harm. Last on polarization, the structural scenarios"
3552.5,3556.32, we pointed out to you were pertinent in illustrating how the fairness doctrine plays out.
3556.5,3560.58, They can't find them because we told you that none of these were actually contravening what
3560.58,3564.42," the fairness doctrine is, but these loopholes were inherent. So we flipped the first argument"
3564.42,3567.36, on polarization insofar as that is how discussions played out.
3567.36,3595.08," I'm trying to figure out for the speech, can I have the propositional Start my speech in 3, 2, 1."
3595.32,3599.78," Considering that our reply spent his entire reply rebutting, let's do this."
3599.78,3603.94," Our opponents depended on an almost impossibly uncharitable version of the Fairness Doctrine,"
3604.14,3607.46," when for some reason we have to platform racist, homophobic, or intolerant views."
3607.74,3611.88," Considering that our P1 proved that we could regulate news organizations to operate on good faith,"
3612.04,3616.48," or simply that conservative views is not all straight-up racism, we collapsed our opponents' engagement."
3616.74,3618.08," But also, let's respond to this."
3618.14,3622.3," They kept telling us that liberalization doesn't happen on our side, and that we have to prove this happens."
3622.66,3623.5, We don't do this.
3623.5,3629.56, P1 tells you liberals refuse to engage based on moral superiority and the wokeness of issue. P2 tells you liberal
3629.56,3633.86, movements tend to have the tendency to message among themselves. P3 puts this up top of her
3633.86,3639.6, speech. We do not understand why they keep burden pushing this. What we do on our side is not a
3639.6,3646.0," liberalization, but we make people chill out. don't uh keep people don't keep just advocating for"
3646.0,3650.4, their side without any regard for others because we break conservative and liberal bubbles because
3650.4,3655.6, the better form of behavior isn't liberalized nation it's the engagement with the other side
3655.6,3658.96, it's listening to the other side it's the understanding that the other side is somewhat
3658.96,3664.48, legitimate too so you can engage with them and not just fight with each other but also let's check
3664.48,3669.28, out the rest of their responses remember what they told you that people will underground i think we have given you
3669.28,3673.12, a sufficient response to this but we also flip this preemptively and undercuts all three's
3673.12,3677.28, analysis of how the status quo get worse because we lower underground because we render them
3677.28,3682.0, unnecessary because we let people like jordan peterson on national broadcast we think for those
3682.0,3688.4," who love to listen to themselves debunk them the, they will be happy to do this. But also, the second thing they said is"
3688.4,3692.86," that political discussions are more toxic and more offensive to people, so they take away safe space."
3693.14,3697.92," Okay, panel, the reason why political discussion are toxic in the status quo is because you"
3697.92,3704.94, draw man the other side argument. The reason why people are being called mentally ill is because
3704.94,3706.28," conservative beliefs this because they have no interaction with trans people. So now liberals, The reason why people are being called mentally ill is because conservatives believe this"
3706.28,3708.76, because they have no interaction with trans people.
3708.76,3712.0," So now liberals, when they hear conservatives say this, they're like, oh, you're so toxic,"
3712.0,3713.82," you're so stupid, we don't talk to you anymore."
3713.82,3717.6, So conservatives fester because there is no one to challenge what they think.
3717.6,3721.78, So we think it is far better to confront and let them fester in quite conservative.
3721.78,3728.96," And so in terms of liberal movement, the protected minority we better achieve the end goal of actually interaction with people of actually"
3728.96,3734.8, telling them that we matter of actually debunking their stupid ideology but also third thing they
3734.8,3741.52, say that they say that oh you are platforming oh you can't impose certain morality upon people
3741.52,3745.12, because this is the more there's a certain minimum of morality of the state okay
3745.12,3750.14, if it's the minimum morality of the state this is the commonly accepted thing in establishment
3750.14,3755.5, because as we said from p1 things like racial slurs these are the things that new in this
3755.5,3762.22, news in the status quo don't even discuss these are the minimum uh morality what opposition is
3762.22,3766.64, actually referring to is just the difference in opinion and what we do
3766.64,3771.36," change is the exclusivity of one side of the story because we don't platform one opinion,"
3771.36,3776.0, we platform multiple opinions so that they have the opportunity to engage with each other.
3776.0,3782.64," But also, let's move on, they also say that it's immoral to manipulate how people's mind works."
3782.64,3785.12," Okay, we change the status quo manipulation"
3785.12,3787.12, by disallowing one-sided reporting.
3787.12,3788.46," We think they dropped this in 03,"
3788.46,3789.78, and we think that's very reflective
3789.78,3792.1, of just how this principle just does not stand.
3792.1,3793.08," At the end of the day panel,"
3793.08,3795.1," we think opposition is very concerned,"
3795.1,3796.06," and should be concerned,"
3796.06,3798.14," not on the impact of the fairness doctrine,"
3798.14,3800.2, but the technicality of implementation.
3800.2,3801.3," They told you two things,"
3801.3,3803.5," is that one, the wrong people are being persuasive."
3803.5,3808.16," Things like, people like Ben Shapiro tends to be far more persuasive than some feminist academic for some reason. But also the second thing they told you two things is that one the wrong people are being persuasive things like people like ben shapiro tends to be far more persuasive than some feminist academics for some reason"
3808.16,3812.32, but also the second thing they tell you that news companies will exploit loopholes and address two
3812.32,3817.52, things there's the rest these two things number one if the wrong people are more persuasive
3817.52,3822.96, you are getting the wrong people two maybe your site isn't as good as you think it is go back home
3822.96,3826.0, think about the other side scout and figure out how your site addresses them.
3826.0,3831.0," If you believe that your site is right, figure out how to appeal to those people who don't agree with you."
3831.0,3836.0," And thirdly, the counter-factual is worse because Jordan Peterson sits in his little conservative bubble"
3836.0,3841.0," and keeps telling people, he keeps invoking feminist students and telling them, oh, feminism is false."
3841.0,3849.06," Secondly, news companies will exploit loopholes. They didn't engage with our ship and incentive under regulations, but we also told you that even if some does, we create a new standard"
3849.06,3854.62, of legitimacy and a different kind of competition. As long as the majority of news doesn't exploit
3854.62,3858.5," the loophole, the race at the bottom of the status quo becomes counterintuitive, and the third"
3858.5,3863.54," argument comes in. Competition changes. We better news quality. We better inform voters, and we"
3863.54,3867.02, better democracy as a whole. So proud to win on proposition.
