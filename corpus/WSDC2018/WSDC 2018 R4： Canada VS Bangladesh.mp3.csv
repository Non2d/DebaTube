0.0,7.0, Tanya Cushman Reviewer's Name Reviewer's Name
18.0,22.0," On Team Proposition, we stand for the people whom the state has ignored."
22.0,25.66," We stand for the people whose blood, sweat, and"
25.66,31.1," tears has forever been invisible. The people whose names we will never know, whose cries"
31.1,36.2," we will never hear, and whose abuses we will never see. On Team Proposition, we want to"
36.2,41.04, bring migrant workers into the fold of the state. We want to give them the sober satisfaction
41.04,45.42," of being able to say, yes, I am human, and yes, I deserve dignity."
45.72,48.52, We propose three arguments on team proposition.
48.92,52.44," First, why these individuals principally are entitled to the right to vote."
52.72,56.08," Second, why we improve the quality of life for migrant workers."
56.08,62.86," And third, my second speaker will discuss how we benefit political empowerment for people in these own countries."
63.22,65.76," But before that, some definitions and a model."
66.2,71.1, We would define this house as all democratic states around the world. We would define non-citizen
71.1,75.68, migrant workers as workers who have migrated for employment that have been legally accepted
75.68,80.64, into this country through a visa or a similar mechanism by that sort of state. Two points
80.64,86.84," in our model. One, migrant workers must have lived in the country they wish to vote in for a minimum of six months."
87.28,91.7," And secondly, they must be planning on living in that country for a few years longer."
91.94,96.78," And in order to prove this, these migrant workers would have to present the government with a sort of proof,"
96.88,98.84," for instance, something like an employment contract."
99.34,104.12," That being said, on to my first argument, why these individuals principally deserve the right to vote."
104.68,105.94," Note, this is a non-consequential first argument, why these individuals principally deserve the right to vote. Note, this is a"
105.94,108.14," non-consequentialist argument, meaning"
108.14,109.64," we're going to prove that these individuals,"
109.92,111.96," irrespective of consequence, deserve"
111.96,114.06," the right to vote, and this is independent"
114.06,115.94, of any practical considerations.
116.54,117.7, The first thing we have to recognize
117.7,119.92, is that the right to vote is not inherent
119.92,122.04, to someone simply having been born in a
122.04,123.92," country, or simply being a citizen,"
124.12,127.72, but we would say it's specific to the relationship you have with your state.
128.08,133.38," The thesis of this argument is essentially that migrant workers have a specific relationship to that state,"
133.74,137.7, which means that giving them the right to vote is the only proportionate recompense.
138.02,139.38, Three reasons why this is true.
139.76,143.32," Note, these three reasons are structurally independent of each other."
143.32,149.2," So we only have to prove that one of these reasons actually upholds in order to satisfy our burden,"
149.42,153.16, and they have to individually refute all of these three things in order to take down this problem.
153.54,156.04," That being said, the first, sir, no thank you."
156.38,160.42, The state benefits directly from the presence of these migrant workers.
160.84,166.06," Oftentimes, these individuals fill low-labor jobs, such as manufacturers or working in"
166.06,167.68, low-level service industries.
168.12,170.02," Oftentimes, furthermore, the states"
170.02,172.06, that are taking these individuals in often
172.06,174.18, are countries with high dependency ratios.
174.46,176.02," So, countries that"
176.02,178.12, have large aging populations
178.12,179.88, or large children
179.88,182.08, or dependent populations in that sort of
182.08,183.86," sense. So, they depend on these individuals"
183.86,185.46, to pay taxes and to work
185.46,189.86, and to contribute for that economy to pay social welfare for those individuals.
190.32,191.98, A great example of this would be Japan.
192.36,195.98, Japan is very well known for having a very big aging population
195.98,199.72, and recently they've opened up their doors towards migrant workers
199.72,203.0, because they realize the utility that these individuals can provide.
203.26,203.78, No thank you.
204.26,210.54, Why then is monetary compensation simply not enough to provide these people kind of
210.54,212.0, recompense for their actions?
212.44,216.74," We would say that it's simply not enough, and the reason why is these people are actually"
216.74,218.64, willing to contribute to your state.
218.9,222.68, There's actually a precedent that this is the metric you should use to decide whether
222.68,224.02, or not you give someone the right to vote.
224.62,227.06," When you're giving someone citizenship and the right to vote,"
227.34,231.34, they have to stay for a minimum amount of time before they can have the right to vote.
231.52,235.12, Because that's how you establish they have loyalty to your certain country.
235.44,238.66," We would say that when these people are willing to contribute to your very state,"
238.96,241.1, functionally it serves the very same needs.
241.52,246.12," Secondly, they demonstrate adherence to the social contract and to the state's laws,"
246.22,247.64, and they have no malicious intent.
247.94,250.02, We know this because states have a very
250.02,252.02, high bar when it comes to accepting
252.02,254.04, migrant workers. You have to
254.04,255.92," make sure that you're not going to commit a crime,"
255.96,258.1," actually take it in a moment, in your future country."
258.32,259.96," Before I continue explaining this argument,"
260.5,261.9, if it is of no utility
261.9,264.08," and simply based on relationship, why must"
264.08,286.38, they stay for a couple of more years? when it comes to vote. What do I mean by this? We say that living under a state is inherently coercive
286.38,289.04, because you have to follow the sort of laws that that state has.
289.3,291.54, We say that that coercion is unjustified
291.54,295.6, if you do not have a say in what those laws actually dictate to you.
296.0,299.42, The precedent for this is that prisoners are not allowed to vote
299.42,301.22, because they don't adhere to those laws
301.22,303.26, and therefore they don't deserve that sort of thing.
303.52,308.48," We would say migrant workers actually do pass this test because not only do they show that they don't have to those laws, and therefore they don't deserve that sort of thing. We would say migrant workers actually do pass this test, because not only do they show that"
308.48,312.08," they don't have a malicious intent, but they also show that they're willing to adhere to"
312.08,317.3," those laws and contribute to that society. Thirdly, migrant workers are in a uniquely"
317.3,323.2," vulnerable situation, and they're very prone to exploitation in the status quo. Why? First,"
323.62,326.9, exploitation on the hands of the people who employ them.
327.16,332.54," Oftentimes, migrant workers are invited to fulfill one sort of job, which means that"
332.54,336.46," if they upset their employer for whatever reason, their employer has the right to just"
336.46,340.94," send them home, because they're only here for that particular sort of job. So that means"
340.94,350.0," the employer can tell them to work for, no thank you, long hours, or pay them really, really low wages, and they have little to no power to speak up against that employer."
350.0,360.0," This is especially true for people who use this job to send back remittances to their family, because not only are they dependent on that job, but all of their family is dependent on that job."
360.0,365.82," We would say that the vote actually equalizes this power imbalance, and it's a unique mechanism"
365.82,368.06," to do this. Why? Because with the vote,"
368.3,370.04, you have access to all of the government
370.04,372.08, structures. You actually have the power
372.08,374.02," to, it's like the widest"
374.02,376.06, reaching mechanism in any given state.
376.32,378.22," It affects legislation, it affects police,"
378.48,380.02," it affects courts. But note,"
380.28,382.06, this is actually not dependent on
382.06,383.96, this being an effective mechanism. Why?
384.24,389.68," Because even if you do not actually affect the ability to have legislation run in the courts,"
389.9,391.66," the very fact that you have, no thank you,"
391.88,394.98, the power to affect is what gives you human dignity.
395.28,397.56," Ladies and gentlemen, that's why we give people the right to desert."
397.96,398.56, Second argument.
399.26,402.06, We uphold the quality of life for these migrant workers.
402.48,408.48, The thesis of this argument is that this is the exclusive mechanism to give people a good quality of life on the ground. Two layers
408.48,413.34," to this argument. First, this incentivizes policy change. This looks like things like"
413.34,418.34," increasing higher minimum wage, like having access to public defenders in cases of exploitation"
418.34,424.3," or having lower costs of healthcare. Why is this the case? In local elections, and note"
424.3,429.48," this is one part of the motion, local elections, oftentimes mayors or people who live in a county, who"
429.48,434.42," rule that county, have a small number of people to cater to. And given that migrant workers"
434.42,439.76," often form ethnic enclaves, we provide you the example of many ethnic enclaves of migrant"
439.76,445.76," workers in Hong Kong, this oftentimes can be the deciding vote in local elections. And"
445.76,451.04," note, these are the local officials that have the most ability to affect things like minimum"
451.04,454.64," wage and stuff like that. But even in things like higher-level elections, like in your"
454.64,459.82," state or your province or even your country, in areas where you have more migrant workers,"
459.82,463.84," politicians have an incentive to cater to those people, because that's what incentivizes"
463.84,465.22, them to get that
465.22,465.74, sort of vote.
466.02,468.34, We provide you the epitome example of the United States.
468.68,472.88," If you take a state in the United States, like California, that has very high amounts"
472.88,477.48," of workers, those policies tend to be more favorable to those workers, because politicians"
477.48,478.36, have to cater to them.
478.8,482.58," Compare that to a state like Texas, where there are very few migrant workers, so there's"
482.58,486.5, a far smaller incentive for those people to actually cater to those individuals.
487.04,488.94," Ladies and gentlemen, why will we win this debate?"
489.3,490.1, We will win this debate
490.1,491.88, because we are on the right side of history.
492.16,493.14, We are defending people
493.14,495.1, who have previously been unknown
495.1,496.46," to the fold of the state,"
496.52,498.26, and it's on that basis that we proudly propose.
498.56,499.04, Thank you.
501.28,503.78, The proposition horribly misconstrues
503.78,507.3, the current state of migrant workers in these countries to begin with.
507.3,513.7," They seem to talk about a group of people that are horribly discriminated against, horribly oppressed in these countries."
513.96,516.38, We'll give you reasons why that is not the case.
516.64,520.64," First of all, because these migrant workers often work on an exchange of skills."
520.9,524.26," These countries recognize the inherent value that these migrant workers present,"
524.54,528.48, and thus they are more likely to attract them because they fill the labor gap within their
528.48,533.1," own specific countries. Second, because the diplomatic relations between the country that"
533.1,537.18, is sending these migrant workers and the country that is receiving them. So Bangladesh and
537.18,542.5, Saudi Arabia have extremely good diplomatic relations over the fact that a lot of Bangladeshi
542.5,549.5, workers go to Saudi Arabia and work there as migrant workers. The risk of ruining these diplomatic relations is too significantly
549.5,554.88," high for them to abuse these workers in any meaningful fashion. But more importantly,"
554.88,559.9, they are also sometimes part of regional blocs. So people within the Eurozone will often move
559.9,565.06, from their country to another country to work as migrant workers because that is simply
565.06,570.2, part of the contract within that regional bloc as well. This also applies for ASEAN
570.2,577.28, and SAR. So there are written contracts that protect these immigrants. Why is this important?
577.28,581.34," Because in a world that is always moving forward to protect migrant workers, they needed to"
581.34,586.12, tell us why voting is the only mechanism by which we can protect the rights
586.12,588.14, and make a more
588.14,589.88, comfortable life for these migrant
589.88,592.0, workers. But this debate is not about
592.0,593.98, the kinds of people that they want to talk about. This is
593.98,596.16, not about illegal immigrants that lead horrible
596.16,598.08, lives. This is about migrant workers who are
598.08,599.76," legally there, who the country wants them."
599.88,602.18, How their situation changes the moment in time
602.18,603.88, you give them the tokenistic right
603.88,609.22," to vote. Two burdens in our case. First, why they shouldn't have a right to vote and finally, how we protect"
609.22,611.0, them better under our scenario.
611.0,611.5, Sure.
611.5,616.0, Should individuals with dual citizenship be allowed to vote in either state?
616.0,622.5, Individuals with dual citizenship are inherently different because they have major stakes within
622.5,626.06, each different country. That is why the idea of a dual citizenship is
626.06,628.02, so extremely rare because it's rare
628.02,630.14, for an individual to have a stake.
630.32,631.68, It's not the same for migrant workers.
631.94,633.52, Rebuttals before we move on to our case.
633.84,636.04, Their argumentation is kind of flimsy because
636.04,637.94, if we were to believe that we give votes
637.94,639.94, on the basis of state benefiting
639.94,641.94," of your work, then we give votes"
641.94,644.04, to people who we outsource work to.
644.3,646.0, So Chinese people could work. So Chinese people could vote
646.0,654.44," in America. But also, you wouldn't give people that are unproductive. So unemployed people"
654.44,658.94, wouldn't get the vote if your voting mechanism was based on productivity. If it's based on an
658.94,663.64," adherence to social contract, you wouldn't give companies or employees of companies that have"
663.64,667.0, received tax breaks any voting rights.
667.0,672.0, Because they have removed themselves from the social contract of giving tax and giving taxation.
672.0,679.0," But finally, if it's about being prone to exploitation, you don't give minorities two votes or multiple votes, do you?"
679.0,689.78," So we don't think those are proper metrics on which you can give people votes. But finally, their idea that you can't sway elections, but it's tokenistic."
690.1,692.56," But understand, this argument does not rest in a vacuum."
692.56,699.8," If this tokenistic vote takes away what these migrant workers actually need, economic emancipation,"
699.96,704.74, then we think we'd be rather better off without this tokenistic vote to begin with.
704.92,709.72," First argument then, as to why the right to vote does not apply to these people."
710.02,712.98, Who do we allow to vote? Citizens. Why?
713.18,716.78, Because these citizens have a significant stake within the countries that they reside in.
716.78,722.2," These citizens grew up here. Their families, their diaspora, all originate from that specific country."
722.44,728.5, Their identities were shaped by the national sentiments that that state had sold to this country.
728.5,733.26," Every single policy, whether that's foreign policy, social policy,"
733.26,738.76," economic policy, has a direct or indirect effect on that person's life. How? If it's"
738.76,742.74," a policy about abortion, whether that person is a woman"
742.74,748.6," that needs an abortion right now or not, that person's family, his sister, his mother, need that voting right."
748.78,749.86, That's why he has a stake here.
750.02,753.24," If it's foreign policy, even if it does not affect that person now,"
753.46,756.24, it will end up affecting them in the long term.
756.38,757.94," For example, five or ten years later,"
758.2,762.88," when foreign relations have worsened as a result of that policy,"
763.14,770.46, that's when that effect will kick in. Why is this part important? Because we think voting is a facilitative right. And
770.46,774.8," in order for it to be a facilitative right, you need to pick and choose whose right you"
774.8,781.14," want to facilitate. No, thank you, sir. Why don't we facilitate the voting rights of migrants"
781.14,786.12," in this case? One, because their stakes are nearly as high. They're"
786.12,792.96," here, under their model, they're here for five to six years at max. We don't think in"
792.96,798.04," comparison to the 60 years that an average citizen will live in that particular country,"
798.04,807.1," and given that most citizens never immigrate out of that country or never travel meaningfully to different countries, we think"
807.1,812.3, that the stakes of citizens is significantly greater than the migrant worker who even under
812.3,817.94, their model lives here for a maximum of six years then moves on. This is exactly also why we don't
817.94,823.7, allow cross-state voting. So a person from Ohio can't come into Boston and vote. Why do we do that?
823.82,825.68, Because a person in Ohio
825.68,831.22, doesn't have the same stake in Boston as he does in his home state in another. That's
831.22,836.28, why we don't allow that. So how does this play out? Why don't we allow people without
836.28,841.78, a stake? No thank you. Imagine an economic policy that loosens trade laws. This might
841.78,845.68, be beneficial for the worker that wants to get into your country and work for that MNC
845.68,847.22, because it means that he can bring
847.22,849.26, more of his friends and co-workers along with him.
849.44,850.22," But in the long run,"
850.42,852.56, it means that jobs eventually seep out
852.56,854.88, of that particular country.
855.22,857.18, Even if we assume that every citizen
857.18,859.52, within that country is the most selfish voter
859.52,862.28," that is absolutely devoted to their own interests,"
862.58,864.26, they have a vested interest to make sure
864.26,868.22, that policies that harm their own country never come to pass simply on a
868.22,873.28, utilitarian scale. This same incentive does not work for migrant workers that
873.28,878.24," are only here as a business transaction, only here to seek their own"
878.24,882.26," profit. Second, as to why these migrant workers don't have the best interest in"
882.26,892.76, mind. Because it's untrue to claim that every citizen is an island and does not care about the broader society or country around him. Because
892.76,899.02," we've fed these citizens that nationalistic sentiment, that love for his own country for"
899.02,908.98," years and years. So they're more likely than that migrant worker to care about what happens, what the outcome is for your country than that migrant worker is."
909.3,911.18," So we think, what's the difference here?"
911.18,925.54," The difference is that migrant worker, even if you keep him around for six years, sees that stay as a business transaction in which he gains certain benefits from that country before he leaves and leaving behind his own service."
925.88,932.12," But for that person living in that country, this is an emotional and national sentiment."
932.46,937.04, The conclusion here is that voting is a right that cannot be dependent on utility
937.04,939.6, and on that basis we do not grant them voting rights.
939.84,946.46," But most importantly of all, why do migrant workers' lives get significantly worse?"
946.64,948.96," Because as they've admitted themselves,"
949.24,952.42," the mandates, these people will not be able to sway elections"
952.42,953.98," because they live in small populations,"
954.24,955.6," spread out all across the country,"
955.6,958.86, and usually come to economically weaker states
958.86,961.18, that don't have political capital in and of themselves.
961.68,964.96, This means that they cannot affect the legislature in any meaningful way.
969.96,975.22," What it does is that socially, it creates a narrative that these migrant workers have come to your country and stolen your votes, have hijacked your democracy, have made sure that"
975.22,980.6, your votes count for less. Why does this effect then matter? Because this is the exact effect
980.6,990.76," in which right-wing populists gain a new state code on which they can blame their own failures, saying that these migrant workers are the reason why you're losing your"
990.76,993.06," jobs, you're losing your votes, your votes mean less."
993.28,997.94," Under a world where these migrant workers were just treated as workers, that same misconstruation"
997.94,998.96, could not have happened.
999.12,1000.0," Very extreme, I propose."
1003.3,1005.88, I want to make one thing very clear at the top of this speech.
1006.28,1010.42, Side opposition chooses strategically to just not engage the bulk of our material
1010.42,1013.44, about how these migrant workers are disadvantaged and status quo.
1013.64,1017.66, They simply counter-assert the fact that they are not disadvantaged at all.
1017.98,1020.92, The only thing that they give a response to for the bulk of our material
1020.92,1023.9, is the last 15-second argument about a stock backlash.
1023.9,1028.62," If I can prove to you that they haven't touched the bulk of our material is the last 15 second argument about a stock backlash. If I can prove to you that they haven't touched the bulk of our case and why that case matters,"
1028.86,1033.22," while dealing with their highest ground on their case, then I think you can take this debate pretty easily."
1033.56,1035.04, Two questions in reputation.
1035.44,1037.6," First, which side benefits more people?"
1037.76,1039.24," Second, what is the vote?"
1039.54,1041.68," First, which side benefits more people?"
1041.78,1044.86, We've told you that these migrant workers in status quo are very disadvantaged.
1045.22,1047.4, The fact that employers have immense leverage over them
1047.4,1048.96, because their visa requirements say
1048.96,1050.7, you need to have constant verification
1050.7,1052.36, of your employer's approval
1052.36,1053.94, so you can stay in our country
1053.94,1055.6, means that they're extremely scared
1055.6,1057.3, to even anger these employers
1057.3,1058.42, who won't sign that form.
1058.64,1060.66, They're extremely scared that these employers
1060.66,1062.28, will send a letter out to that industry
1062.28,1063.86, saying you can't hire this worker
1063.86,1066.44, or you can't hire this ethnicity any longer.
1066.72,1067.98, What did they tell you in response?
1068.2,1069.58, They just simply asserted the fact
1069.58,1071.6, that they aren't disadvantaged in status quo.
1071.74,1073.48, They give you two very shallow reasons for this.
1073.7,1076.04," First, in that it is an exchange of skill."
1076.12,1078.1," Therefore, you need my skill, I need your skill."
1078.1,1081.1, We're not going to take leverage over each other.
1081.4,1084.12, This is simply an ignorance of the fact
1084.12,1085.98, that there's a difference in supply and demand
1085.98,1087.98, in the status quo. These exchanges of skills
1087.98,1089.6, don't happen with two economically
1089.6,1091.92, similar countries. They happen between the
1091.92,1093.86, USA and other countries
1093.86,1095.9," in Southeast Asia, for example. This"
1095.9,1097.78, means that there is necessarily more supply
1097.78,1099.88," than the demand for these migrant workers, which means that"
1099.88,1101.82, they have lower leverage over their employers
1101.82,1103.88, and can't demand for their rights. The second
1103.88,1109.12," reason that they give is oftentimes they're part of diplomatic relations or part of regional blocks. Oftentimes,"
1109.74,1113.52, what these countries care about are only the amount of money that is coming back to their
1113.52,1116.94," country, not caring if there could be more money that's coming back to their country if their"
1116.94,1121.4, workers' rights improve. They're very untransparent about the on-the-ground workers' rights that are
1121.4,1125.3, happening in employee places right now. That's why they won't simply care.
1127.42,1127.52," But second, what did they tell you under this question?"
1130.12,1133.42," They said, you know, our policy won't make any changes because these people live in small communities like we apparently conceded."
1133.86,1136.7, This is simply ignoring the nuances of my first speaker's argument
1136.7,1139.06, about how oftentimes when these parties are created
1139.06,1143.04," to cater to the specific needs of these minorities in status quo,"
1143.04,1145.96, they often become the swing vote in parties where it's very
1145.96,1148.14, interlocked inside the parliament. This means
1148.14,1149.9, that we can at least make compromises
1149.9,1152.1, and some changes on our side where their
1152.1,1154.06," side is uncomparative. But fourthly,"
1154.32,1156.2, I want to deal with this backlash argument that came
1156.2,1158.2, out in the last 30 seconds of their speech.
1158.86,1160.44," Firstly, I am unclear"
1160.44,1162.18, by the end of the first opposition
1162.18,1164.1, speech on why vote is the tipping
1164.1,1165.86," point for such a big backlash, right?"
1166.16,1170.22, Backlash already occurs in the most populist or the most discriminatory countries in status
1170.22,1170.44, quo.
1170.68,1174.44, Giving them the vote actually minimizes the harms that will come to these people at the
1174.44,1177.98, point in which they can vote against those people who are racist and discriminatory.
1178.26,1181.88, I am unsure why the marginal increase in the backlash that will get on their side is so
1181.88,1182.32, significant.
1182.6,1190.06," Dames will provide an explanation on that later. But second, backlash often occurs because the absence of a voting power"
1190.06,1192.08, is the cause of that legitimization.
1192.38,1194.86," At the point in which you say, these people deserve to vote"
1194.86,1197.96, because they're just equal and as legitimate as citizens
1197.96,1200.3," for giving back to the state the same as us,"
1200.3,1204.02," that's the point in which the bullets, the ammunition behind these"
1204.02,1205.86," populist rhetoric and backlash diminish. Second question then, what's the point in which the bullets behind, the ammunition behind these populist rhetoric and backlash"
1205.86,1208.02," diminish. Second question then, what"
1208.02,1209.84, is the vote? We told you
1209.84,1212.1, that the vote isn't an inherent right.
1212.34,1213.82, That it's a proportional right.
1214.22,1215.9, It depends on the amount of
1215.9,1217.74," investment, the amount of trust,"
1218.02,1219.98, the amount of benefit that you give back
1219.98,1222.14, to your country. This was conceded
1222.14,1223.92, when they answered
1223.92,1225.9, the POI about dual citizens.
1226.2,1228.06, The fact that dual citizens are invested in both
1228.06,1229.78, countries means that we give them the right to vote.
1229.94,1231.96, The fact that migrant workers have lived in the country
1231.96,1233.98, for six months and plan to live in that country
1233.98,1236.02, for longer years means that they're also invested
1236.02,1237.52, and we give them our trust.
1237.78,1239.86, They also concede this when they talk about Ohio
1239.86,1241.82, and another state like California.
1242.14,1244.18, The reason why we don't give Ohio residents
1244.18,1246.34, the provincial election vote in California
1246.34,1248.26, because they're not invested or they're not
1248.26,1250.34, living in California. But we would both
1250.34,1252.54, give them the vote for the national election
1252.54,1254.14," because it's a country's issue, right?"
1254.28,1256.42, Same thing here. What they can tell you
1256.42,1258.16," in response. They said,"
1258.52,1260.4," well, it's more"
1260.4,1261.6, long-term than that.
1262.08,1264.4, You won't get any benefits in the long-term.
1264.6,1268.56, And you need to have a more long-term stake in the country for your vote to actually be beneficial.
1268.88,1269.48, No thank you.
1270.2,1272.1, No explanation on why this is non-exclusive.
1272.42,1274.38, Current citizens often have a very short vision.
1274.68,1278.28," And they say, I want to vote based on what I will benefit off of."
1278.38,1281.32, What policy would benefit me and my family in the immediate sense.
1281.32,1286.02," But secondly, they never give us an explanation on why this business transaction relationship doesn't"
1286.02,1287.94, mean that they all have an equal incentive to make sure
1287.94,1289.88, that that country prospers. Any
1289.88,1291.86," logical person would say, if I'm conducting business"
1291.86,1293.96," in that country, and I benefit economically from that"
1293.96,1295.8," country, it is in my best interest to say"
1295.8,1297.72, I want that community
1297.72,1299.72, to welcome me in the future when I need money
1299.72,1301.76, and I need to work in that community. That's why
1301.76,1303.68, the business transaction that they
1303.68,1305.56, taint as so toxic on their side
1305.56,1306.5, is not actually that bad.
1306.64,1306.94, Go ahead.
1307.34,1309.38, If some person contributes more
1309.38,1311.36," within six months time period,"
1311.48,1312.7, why would you force them to say more?
1313.48,1316.22, Because we at least want some proof of investment
1316.22,1318.14," and trust in our country, right?"
1318.18,1319.48, We think that's a reasonable criteria
1319.48,1321.24, that we give to any other immigrants
1321.24,1322.2, who are trying to become citizens.
1322.46,1323.92, I pass that process too.
1324.3,1324.9," Third argument,"
1324.9,1327.22, how we politically empower our own citizens.
1327.6,1329.96, This is an extremely important argument in the context of this debate
1329.96,1331.18, because we take them at their best.
1331.54,1333.68, Their actor that they prioritize is our own citizens.
1333.68,1336.76, And we actually benefit the most vulnerable of our own citizens
1336.76,1339.06, when we give non-citizen migrants our vote.
1339.32,1339.6, Why?
1339.82,1341.4," Because we say that their interests,"
1341.74,1344.86," the poor and the ethnic minorities of our own citizens,"
1345.24,1350.44, and the interests of these non-citizen migrant workers often align so that they benefit off
1350.44,1354.64," of each other. What does this look like? One, raising minimum wage and improving job security"
1354.64,1358.82," laws so that basic income for these people go up. Second, cheaper healthcare and more"
1358.82,1363.76," accessible educational options. Third, stronger enforcement of non-discrimination laws that"
1363.76,1369.24," prevent employers from hiring based on race or ethnicity. Fourth, more social welfare in general such as food stamps."
1369.56,1375.1," Five, price caps on rent or subsidized or allowances for low-income families. Six, more"
1375.1,1380.24," accountability for police bias with incidents like police brutality. Seven, cheaper transportation"
1380.24,1386.18," and public transport to go by. But eight, more language opportunities and programs provided for free so that they can"
1386.18,1389.1, access services in those languages more.
1389.1,1393.72, What is the mechanism by which we get these policies to go through?
1393.72,1398.52, Notice that oftentimes the poor and ethnic minorities in our own countries are disenfranchised.
1398.52,1402.44, That means that we need a bigger voting body to vote for the same interests for us to have
1402.44,1408.78," an increased chance of those policies passing. What does that look like? One, when you have a larger voting body, you're more likely to"
1408.78,1412.96," have a party that directly caters to you. And even if it's only a minor party that's being created,"
1413.18,1418.78, they often provide a swing vote in the parliament that is incredibly beneficial for these people.
1419.02,1423.84," But second, parties often gain a larger voting base. And this is extremely crucial in especially"
1423.84,1425.48, countries that have a bipartisan system
1425.48,1426.52," where there are only two parties,"
1426.72,1429.42, and they have an incentive to actually garner under them
1429.42,1431.4, the biggest voting base that they possibly can.
1431.62,1434.18, So when the disenfranchised groups in our society
1434.18,1436.68," have a much larger voting base just in terms of numbers,"
1437.02,1438.62," even if their voter turnout is lower,"
1438.9,1443.08, even if there is biases against them in the political system
1443.08,1445.6, that hinders them from giving their political voice out.
1445.78,1447.56, The fact that these numbers multiply
1447.56,1449.64, means that their political voice is improved.
1450.18,1452.22, Why is the vote a unique mechanism to do this?
1452.46,1454.42," Firstly, because when we give them the vote,"
1454.5,1456.2, we're saying that you deserve the trust
1456.2,1457.3, in our government systems.
1457.52,1459.02, And that trust is often given back
1459.02,1460.7, in things like reporting more crime
1460.7,1463.04," when this might harm our own citizens too,"
1463.24,1466.82, or reporting when these policies that we support on our side aren't properly enforced.
1467.04,1470.88," But secondly, the vote is the most sustainable way that we can change these policies."
1471.28,1475.38," Even if changes happen sporadically on their side, they always have to rely on the goodwill"
1475.38,1477.74, of politicians to randomly do these things.
1477.88,1482.3," When political changes happen in tidal waves that benefit or disenfranchise these people,"
1482.52,1486.96," when we give them the vote, that means that these policies are the most sustainable and the most trustworthy"
1486.96,1487.8, for these people.
1487.8,1489.66, We want to benefit the non-citizen migrant workers
1489.66,1491.46," who are disadvantaged on our side,"
1491.46,1492.88, but we also take them at their highest
1492.88,1494.6, and say that the power to vote is people
1494.6,1496.1, who are invested in our country.
1496.1,1496.94, Thank you very much.
1500.28,1502.74, Our burden in this debate has been quite simple.
1502.74,1509.66, That these migrant workers haven't really been in such a horrible state as they paint them to be.
1509.96,1513.02," But even if they are, their policy leaves them worse off."
1513.44,1517.62, But we've gone one step further and given you principles as to why they shouldn't have this right to vote.
1517.62,1523.94," They have tackled only one of these nuances, one of these three layers of principles that we have given to you"
1523.94,1529.0, and expected that that would bring down the entire principle case from our side.
1529.0,1537.0, First point of argumentation from that side was that state benefits directly from these migrants and especially in countries where they depend a lot on these migrants.
1537.0,1548.56," So we should give them votes in return. The problem is that whether or not you are benefited is not a metric on which you give people votes. That is to say, if that were really true, would you give votes to foreigners who give charities"
1548.56,1552.48, or people from other countries who give foreign aids?
1552.48,1557.52," If that were really true, then all those people who are beneficiaries to your state would also be given votes."
1557.52,1561.76," But the problem is that we don't, because metric is never the benefit."
1561.76,1566.58, It's how much the state can coerce you and your lives with that vote.
1566.84,1572.28," That is to say, how much the state's policies can impact you with its decisions in the long"
1572.28,1576.92," run. They have never tackled enough about how state's policies impact these people,"
1577.16,1582.52," at least to the extent that common citizens are impacted. But secondly, if the states"
1582.52,1588.6," get benefited by their labor force to the extent that they, no thank you, paint them to be, we think that in exchange it should"
1588.6,1593.52," rather give wages. And that's exactly the transaction, right? These people work in these"
1593.52,1597.9," countries, give them their labour, and therefore they get wages in return. I don't see why"
1597.9,1601.48," you have to have votes in which you can have say in foreign policy making, in which you"
1601.48,1605.52, have to have say in monetary policies and etc. Many
1605.52,1610.44," of which have nothing to do with you. So the transaction, the reciprocity that their entire"
1610.44,1614.94, case rests upon doesn't necessarily exist. No thank you. Then they tell you that we need
1614.94,1619.62, to give them votes to alleviate these people because they are genuinely denied of their
1619.62,1624.58," rights. First of all, the number of people, the number of migrant workers in these countries"
1624.58,1625.0, are often very small.
1625.0,1627.0, I don't see why they are the tipping point.
1627.0,1632.0," So for instance, even in countries like USA, which necessarily does have a lot of migrant workers,"
1632.0,1638.0, aren't having people enough to the extent that they will break down the deadlock between Democrats and Republicans.
1638.0,1644.0," Especially because even in USA, the Republicans have like 450 seats in the Congress and Senate,"
1644.0,1646.02, where the Democrats have just like 150.
1646.48,1649.86," Which is to say that the balance necessarily, the debt lock doesn't necessarily get broken."
1650.16,1654.44," But secondly, in most countries, the margin isn't small in the first place."
1654.66,1658.1," In most countries, especially with the rise of frightening populism,"
1658.38,1661.08," the fact that most people are victims of demagoguery,"
1661.08,1667.8," where they feel that these migrants are taking away most of the things that we deserve, are taking away what belongs to us. We think most of"
1667.8,1672.9," these people are inclined towards voting right-wing parties,"
1672.9,1679.8, so I don't see why these migrants who constitute at max 1-2% of the population will change all of that.
1679.8,1687.16," But secondly, in states, no thank you, where the migrants are majority, we think there is already an incentive for the states to cater to these migrant workers."
1687.48,1688.38, Why? Two reasons.
1688.68,1691.56," A, because if these migrants aren't, you know, catered to,"
1691.82,1694.34," in the sense that they are denied wages and labour rights,"
1694.6,1695.66, they go out and protest.
1695.96,1699.86," And because they are a majority, those protests make the society in a lot of cases vulnerable"
1699.86,1703.36," to the extent that the people in those countries, the ones that have the voting power,"
1703.72,1705.6," have forced the governments to cater to them. But secondly, no those countries, the ones that have the voting power, have forced the governments to catch them."
1705.8,1711.12," But secondly, not only that, regions that have migrant majority are probably states that respect these labour rights"
1711.12,1714.3, because that is exactly what brings those migrants in the first place.
1714.3,1720.62," If these regions didn't catch them, most of these migrant workers would fear the fact that their lives in these states"
1720.62,1726.0," would be unsafe to the point that the returns of like the returns of the labor, do not overpower all of that."
1726.0,1735.0," But thirdly, local governments, we think in states with minority migrants, the only way to affect the local government is by bringing changes in the federal government."
1735.0,1746.0," But the problem is that, where do these migrants usually go to? They go to smaller states which are less economically consolidated, which means they depend on labor more than capital."
1746.0,1750.0, That's to say states like Louisiana and Massachusetts.
1750.0,1755.0," The problem is that these states already have less seats in the Congress,"
1755.0,1763.0," which is to say, even at their best case scenario, if you do take up a say in the decision making process,"
1763.0,1767.44," because you have less seats in the Congress, means that you do not necessarily impact to a great degree"
1767.44,1770.68, what the federal government wants to endorse as policies.
1771.02,1773.94," So I don't see in conclusion why all those benefits that you want,"
1774.24,1775.04, they happen on your side.
1775.3,1778.22," But first of all, that characterization is false in the first place."
1778.4,1781.16, Because migrants aren't really that vulnerable to exploitation.
1781.28,1782.0," Before I move on, yes?"
1782.32,1788.0, The average citizen is not affected by what our countries have to do with Russian foreign policy.
1788.0,1790.0, Should they have the right to vote on those issues?
1790.0,1798.0," If the country imposes sanctions on Russia, probably your ability to trade with those countries gets hurt."
1798.0,1800.0, Your ability to go to those countries gets hurt as well.
1800.0,1813.88," I don't see why those impacts happen, like, you know, don't necessarily boil down to these people. But most importantly, those foreign policies hit, like, you know, necessarily impact your economic fabric a lot to a greater degree than these minorities, these migrant workers ever get impacted."
1814.16,1817.32," But first of all, the incentives behind the countries catering to them."
1817.54,1821.42," First of all, it's the fact that, you know, relations with other countries do exist."
1821.74,1828.48, The repercussions don't only come from those countries that these migrant workers come from. The repercussions also come from the trade blocs that these
1828.48,1833.64," countries are in. For instance, if you are a country that is in the European Union, if"
1833.64,1838.54," you deny the rights to workers, even from an economically, you know, weaker country"
1838.54,1843.06," like Greece, the problem is that it's not only Greece who has a bargaining chip to attack,"
1843.3,1849.7," like, you know, have repercussions on you. The entire trade bloc gets on the bandwagon and tries to impact your ability"
1849.7,1854.08," to get the benefits from the trade bloc. But second, the fact that Labour Party and Democrats"
1854.08,1858.72, who already recognize that labour rights should exist have an incentive to cater to them because
1858.72,1867.24," that is the exact ethics and morality that they bank on for votes. But last of all, we think that if you want to catch these people,"
1867.62,1869.06, your policy makes it worse off.
1869.3,1869.94, Why is that so?
1870.18,1871.94," Because in the vast majority of cases,"
1872.3,1874.8, your policy brings backlashes to these people.
1875.08,1877.84," If these migrants get votes, their lives get threatened."
1878.12,1878.32, Why?
1878.5,1880.98, Because already citizens feel that their people from other countries
1880.98,1882.36, are hijacking too much from them.
1882.66,1884.8," Their national identity, their ability to get jobs."
1884.8,1885.0," The moment in time you give them votes and have a concrete say in the decision-making process, The people from other countries are hijacking too much from there. Their national identity, their ability to get jobs."
1885.0,1889.4," The moment in time you give them votes and have a concrete say in the decision making process,"
1889.4,1891.0, they feel more hijacked.
1891.0,1893.5, That is when they tilt towards right-wing populist parties
1893.5,1896.3, and therefore you make the society unsafe for them.
1896.3,1897.8, But even that does not happen.
1897.8,1901.9," They are worse off, don't thank you, when they see that the state is not welcoming towards them."
1901.9,1902.8, That is safe.
1902.8,1906.58," When they see that the state's, their ability to live a safe life in the state is to a towards them. That is safe, when they see that the states, their ability to live a safe life in the states"
1906.58,1908.62," is to a great degree lesser,"
1908.62,1911.2, they feel unwilling to go to these countries.
1911.2,1913.6," So if they don't find jobs in their own countries,"
1913.6,1915.5," they feel unwilling to go to these new,"
1915.5,1917.5," the other countries, which means even economically,"
1917.5,1919.46," they're to a great degree lesser,"
1919.46,1921.88, to a great degree left with less choices.
1921.88,1924.24," So both points, their life in the states"
1924.24,1926.14," and in terms of economics, they are higher. But both points, their life in this state and in terms of economics"
1926.14,1927.96," they are hurt. But more importantly,"
1928.06,1930.44, we think states hold rights to citizens and only citizens.
1930.74,1932.16, Why is that so? It is because states
1932.16,1934.4, have a right to command you and your citizens
1934.4,1936.22, and thus you should have a reciprocal power
1936.22,1938.0, over the state. The state has a right to
1938.0,1940.26, conscript you. The state has a right to endorse
1940.26,1942.22, subpoena system where they can force
1942.22,1944.24, you to come to a court and provide evidences
1944.24,1948.56, as a witness. They can financially incentivize you to do certain things for the state that
1948.56,1953.64," even in aging countries, they can financially incentivize you to take up children. These"
1953.64,1958.54, are ways in which the state practices commands and coercion on citizens but not on immigrants.
1958.8,1967.0," If the level of state coercion is so imbalanced, migrants should not have the right to reciprocate all this with the same power over the state"
1967.0,1975.0," as any citizen would have had the say because they, to a great degree, are not having the same amount of impact."
1975.0,1983.0," It is not only the wrong equivalent they are standing for, but also a denial of rights to those citizens who deserve to have greater say."
1983.0,1986.0," Within states has special obligations towards its own citizens,"
1986.0,1988.0, and we are not willing to deny all of that.
1988.0,1991.0," Even if these migrants are worse off in our world,"
1991.0,1996.0, we think in the long run their lives in these states are not as horrible as your policy wants it.
1996.0,1998.0, We are very proud to oppose.
2001.0,2004.0, It was a poor strategic move on the part of the opposition
2004.0,2006.82, to try and undermine the plight of migrant workers
2006.82,2009.68, and pretend that that means that they should not have the right to vote.
2010.0,2015.16," The reality is, in America, there are migrant workers from Central America who are being paid less than minimum wage."
2015.16,2020.16," In Hong Kong, there are Filipino workers who are working in structurally dangerous conditions"
2020.16,2023.34, where their factory may be set on fire each and every day.
2023.72,2029.06," And in Southeast Asia, there is a coercive, phallus sponsorship system where people have absolutely no means of legal"
2029.06,2029.52, recourse.
2029.88,2033.46, This screening is so important because they have to engage with the reality of the day-to-day
2033.46,2034.82, oppression that migrant workers face.
2034.82,2039.16, It is not enough for them to try and outweigh all the benefits of the vote with bad push
2039.16,2043.02, when we see that the vote is the only mechanism to try and change the structural oppression
2043.02,2044.96, that migrant workers face on a day-to-day basis.
2045.0,2047.0, I'm going to look at this debate under a couple themes.
2047.0,2050.0," Firstly, should migrant workers have the principled right to vote?"
2050.0,2053.0," And secondly, what are the tangible impacts of the vote?"
2053.0,2057.0," Starting with the first theme, should migrant workers have the principled right to vote?"
2057.0,2063.0, And note that the framing presented by our first speaker that this argument exists independent of utilitarian impacts has never been tested.
2063.0,2065.12, So if I can prove that in principle
2065.12,2066.46," these workers have the right to vote,"
2066.52,2068.32, then we can win this debate in a state.
2068.84,2069.92, We get a couple of main claims
2069.92,2071.7, as to why migrant workers should not have the right to vote
2071.7,2072.56, on their side of the house.
2073.04,2073.92, The first thing that we get
2073.92,2076.02," is some nationalist conception of citizenship,"
2076.38,2077.64, which is effectively an assertion
2077.64,2079.12, that your ancestors have lived in a country
2079.12,2080.78, and this is something that is important to your own identity.
2081.36,2082.44, A couple of responses to this.
2082.48,2085.36, So the concept of citizenship within itself is
2085.36,2090.08, inherently something that is a social construct as opposed to anything that holds any kind of moral
2090.08,2094.72, value. We can see this through the fact that citizenship within itself constantly fluctuates
2094.72,2099.36," between states and between the policies at stake independently passed. For instance, we have things"
2099.36,2104.24, like dual citizenship that they themselves perceive as something that is good. When we have a refugee
2104.24,2108.2," who enters into a country, we often give them citizenship, even though their skin"
2108.2,2111.58," may be a different color, and their ancestors have not lived in that state for an extended"
2111.58,2115.64," period of time. So ultimately, this shows that some kind of assertion about citizenship"
2115.64,2119.82," doesn't hold any moral value in this debate, and the claim of ancestors is illegitimate."
2120.34,2123.74, The only other claim that they really had is that migrant workers tend to vote on a
2123.74,2127.48," short-term basis, and thus, they should not have a seat within the democratic process."
2127.48,2128.6, A few responses to this.
2128.6,2133.96," So first, short-termism is endemic to any kind of voting that is going to exist within a democracy."
2133.96,2138.72," This is due to the fact that you know that after a period of four years, a new government is going to come into power,"
2138.72,2141.76, so thus this is why people often prioritize their day-to-day conditions.
2141.76,2145.6," So given that this happens all the time, I'm not clear about the distinction of migrant workers."
2145.96,2147.86," But secondly, even if this wasn't true,"
2148.22,2150.08, migrant workers actually do have an incentive
2150.08,2152.02, to care about the long-term well-being
2152.02,2154.12, of the state. We started bringing this one second
2154.12,2156.06, and that wasn't responded to. They may want to
2156.06,2158.06, work in this country after they've gone back
2158.06,2160.1, to their country for a period of years. They may want to send
2160.1,2161.64, their children to this country to work.
2161.86,2164.06, So they have structural incentive to create favorable
2164.06,2168.16, business conditions within these countries and hence long-term incentives actually will
2168.16,2173.52, align with the events interests of the state. My final response is that even if migrant workers
2173.52,2178.08, are going to vote more in the short term that is an insufficient criteria to deny them the ability
2178.08,2182.72, to have the right to vote. This is because migrant workers are still presently subject to incredibly
2182.72,2189.6," coercive forces of state. We try and give an example about abortion under their signing house, what if there is a female migrant worker who wants to get an abortion"
2189.6,2193.6, but is structurally unable to do so as a result of oppressive government policies?
2193.6,2198.0," Even if something is short-term, migrant workers should still have the right to change their dignity and conditions."
2198.0,2204.96," In a sense, I think the Biden-Ritchie principle is actually conceded by opposition when they say that dual citizens have the right to vote in whatever country."
2204.96,2207.28, This effectively shows that even if you were only in a country
2207.28,2211.24," for a set period of time, you'd still have the right to vote in either one of those countries."
2211.66,2215.04, The final thing that we get from them on the principle is that the right to vote is going
2215.04,2219.6," to lead to things like harmful economic policies for your state. So number one, the policies"
2219.6,2222.92, that you are going to want to vote for are often conducive to what the interests of the
2222.92,2227.78, most marginalized members of your own population are. This was explained in our second speaker that had very little
2227.78,2231.5, response. This is because you often face a similar degree of structural oppression in
2231.5,2235.12, the workplace. You can benefit from things like having higher wages and seat for workplace
2235.12,2238.88, conditions. So your incentives actually lie with improving the conditions of the most
2238.88,2242.7, vulnerable people who they can see that the state actually does have an obligation to
2242.7,2247.98," protect. But secondly, once again, even if you're going to vote for a horrible policy, it doesn't"
2247.98,2249.26, mean that we restrict your right to vote.
2249.48,2253.42, This is why we still allow uninformed voters to actually cast a vote on the decided vote.
2253.7,2258.48, The extent of this argument is to never allow less privileged minority individuals to vote
2258.48,2262.38, within your container state because they may vote for worse policies and have less access
2262.38,2262.98, to information.
2263.3,2268.28, We allow people to vote because we recognize recognize it is something that is inherently valuable. We gave these three mechanisms under
2268.28,2272.76," our side of the House about why, in principle, modern workers have the right to vote. The first"
2272.76,2276.44, thing that we said is that these state benefits directly from their own labor. The second thing
2276.44,2279.82," that we said is that you've demonstrated a critical adherence to these social contracts,"
2280.16,2283.86," and thirdly, that you're often subjugated by the coercive forces of the state due to the fact"
2283.86,2286.7, that we're subject to things like their laws being a known typical benefit.
2287.12,2291.1," In terms of the response to these mechanisms, what they tried to do was throw out a bunch of analogies."
2291.32,2295.82," They said things like, if I'm a corporation, and I'm not paying taxes, I can still go to another state."
2296.24,2302.34," The problem with all this analysis is that, yes, we still do allow corporations to have the right to vote, even if they aren't acting in perfect ways."
2302.34,2306.18, Because they still fulfill the other two pieces of criteria that we outlined in the first
2306.18,2310.2," speaker, that even if you don't pay taxes, you are still subject to the coercive forces"
2310.2,2310.78, of the state.
2311.04,2314.44," So because all this criteria still stands, and they never actually tacked on part of"
2314.44,2317.86," our argumentation, I think it still stands in principle that the workers should have"
2317.86,2318.76, the right to promise basis.
2318.94,2319.28, Go ahead.
2319.56,2324.54," In a corporation you work for one year, would you give yourself the same right as a board"
2324.54,2327.0, of directors who can vote for policy change?
2327.0,2333.0," I mean, I think that you should have some right to vote, given that you have actually been in that corporation for a period of years."
2333.0,2338.0," Even on the sake of a board of directors, I think that's slightly different, because you often have things like more knowledge if you are a board of directors,"
2338.0,2342.0, but in principle we still think that you should have some say in terms of how that corporation ultimately operates.
2342.0,2346.04, And I want to look at the second theme of this debate about the tangible impacts on migrant workers.
2346.34,2347.8, The first thing that I want to continue to address
2347.8,2350.4, is their characterization that things aren't so bad for migrant workers.
2350.7,2352.3," I think I've already addressed this in my introduction,"
2352.66,2354.88, but there's also been tension with their argument about backlash.
2355.08,2355.94," Because on the one hand,"
2356.1,2358.08, we tried to characterize backlash as being so bad
2358.08,2359.9," that it's going to infringe on the rights of migrant workers,"
2360.08,2360.98," but then on the other hand,"
2361.16,2362.48, we tried to say that things are structurally improvement.
2362.72,2364.22," Only one of those two things can be true,"
2364.22,2366.74, I think that their characterization of poor conditions is far more accurate.
2367.14,2369.9," In terms of backlash, we said that migrant workers are going to face oppression,"
2370.2,2372.24, more populist governments are going to emerge over time.
2372.64,2373.54, Multiple things to say.
2373.82,2376.64," So firstly, over time, I think that citizens of the inner state"
2376.64,2379.34, are likely to view migrant workers as being far more human.
2379.68,2381.82," This is because when you give someone the right to vote,"
2381.98,2385.1," we say that yes, you have a principled right to have a say within your country. I think a perfect illustration of this is that after women someone the right to vote, we say that, yes, you have a principled right to have a say within your country."
2385.48,2386.8, I think a perfect illustration of this
2386.8,2388.24, is that after women got the right to vote
2388.24,2389.38," within Western liberal democracies,"
2389.72,2391.26, other conditions surrounding their equality
2391.26,2392.1," began to improve,"
2392.36,2393.62, because we began to see these individuals
2393.62,2394.26," as being legitimate,"
2394.52,2396.44," and as deserving the right to vote, principally."
2396.96,2397.44," But secondly,"
2397.92,2399.78, the greatest source of backlash in states
2399.78,2402.68," is that political rhetoric is weaponized against you,"
2402.94,2404.62, which ultimately affects the perception
2404.62,2406.0, of other people in your government.
2406.0,2413.0," That is less likely to happen under our side of the house, when political parties now have to cater towards migrant workers as potential stakeholders."
2413.0,2418.0," It's less likely that they're going to actively demonize migrant workers in political discourse when they now mute them for their votes,"
2418.0,2422.0, decreasing the kind of harmful rhetoric that transcends interproxy perception over time.
2422.0,2425.9," Finally, even if the violence done badly is going to exist under your side of"
2425.9,2429.1," the house, you'll have to weigh that against the structural benefits of the vote that we"
2429.1,2429.6, talk about.
2429.6,2432.6, It could also be like a micro-regression that is best placed nearer than the other side
2432.6,2433.0, of the house.
2433.0,2436.3," Under our side of the house, there's no way that we're going to get things like a reasonable"
2436.3,2439.8," minimum wage, like safe factory conditions, that is far more visceral in terms of impacting"
2439.8,2441.6, your quality of life on a day-to-day basis.
2441.6,2444.9, The second kind of mitigating factor that we get from them were a bunch of things.
2444.9,2447.62," For instance, that they're not going to be a swing vote, that oftentimes if"
2447.62,2451.12," you are the majority of interstate, governments already have an incentive to cater towards you."
2451.3,2455.94," So number one, all of these things are mitigatory at best, and maybe that your situation is not as"
2455.94,2459.88," terrible, but you still principally deserve the right to vote. But secondly, this is often not"
2459.88,2463.48," true in the sense that often are things like clubs treated within a diaspora, which can actually give"
2463.48,2466.4," you a lot of state within a local election, we gave that characterization in first row"
2466.4,2471.02, an unresponded to. What were the vast majority of impacts we were able to explain from the
2471.02,2475.52," vote that got unresponded to? We said that now, migrant workers are going to be a swing"
2475.52,2478.86," vote within their countries, that they can finally vote for structural policy changes"
2478.86,2481.98, that are going to benefit their condition from a day-to-day basis. These are things
2481.98,2486.68," like safer factory conditions, like minimum wage, like guaranteeing that they have sufficient welfare and conditions, like"
2486.68,2490.44, more legal recourse within their government. These impact migrant workers every single
2490.44,2494.12, day and are uniquely accessible to finally having a state as a result of the vote. On
2494.12,2495.72," this basis, I am very proud to stand in proposition."
2499.5,2510.0," A few things to note right off the bat. If you take their characterization of migrant workers, you'd see a stark, stark similarity that they have with illegal workers."
2510.0,2515.0," The reason for this, if you see their examples, is paying people under minimum wage."
2515.0,2519.0," It's illegal. You're a legal migrant. Go to the court, they'll pay you back."
2519.0,2525.4," Second, and this is quite crucial also, they say that people would be discriminatory and oppressive towards you."
2525.92,2531.26," Again, court exists, you're a legal worker, you have your rights, you can adapt to it"
2531.26,2531.86, that way.
2532.28,2539.52," Note that this is crucial in identifying our point as to why the situation isn't as great,"
2539.52,2548.7, because try to find in your notes one example as to how it's picturesquely grotesque for these migrant workers as they claim you won't find any.
2548.7,2554.06," But secondly, and this is quite crucial, because we think that they have been unfairly unengaging to us,"
2554.3,2566.0," because they strawman most of our argumentation, all the analysis as to why there are varying stakes between a citizen and a migrant worker. They have said nothing in this rather than"
2566.0,2570.72, just trying to engage the fact that we said that these people are okay and why that was
2570.72,2575.6," the bulk of our case. So we think they have been unfair on that regard. And also, the"
2575.6,2580.54, fact that our argument of why populist leaders would use this as demography was termed as
2580.54,2585.1, backlash. Note that this is the same ignorance that caused people like Trump
2585.1,2591.6, to come to power because you treated this as minuscule and unimportant until it reached
2591.6,2596.28, the height of its harm. Two things I'll be talking to you in this speech about. Number
2596.28,2601.86," one, principally, whether or not this is good. Secondly, does it really make workers' lives"
2601.86,2604.32," better off or does it make it worse? Before that, sure."
2604.6,2608.02, Would your side not have given women the right to vote because of the ensuing backlash?
2608.66,2613.36," Again, there's a difference between giving a struggling minority a vote"
2613.36,2615.54, and there's a difference between giving a migrant worker.
2615.78,2617.04, It's starkly different.
2617.46,2619.94," Again, it's not like migrant workers don't have rights."
2620.02,2622.12, They have rights that are tailored specifically to them.
2622.12,2626.18," Women need rights specifically tailored to them in their country, in that context."
2626.44,2628.26, So we don't think that POI works.
2628.48,2631.02," So first, they have three criteria of rights."
2631.16,2634.34," If I knock, I promise I'll knock each and every one of them down."
2634.6,2637.3," First, the fact that they benefit the state."
2637.58,2641.82," We ask them numerous questions as to if it's benefit,"
2641.82,2646.42," would you let some rich person from wherever come to your country,"
2646.78,2649.24, pay a few billion dollars and you give them the right to vote?
2649.38,2650.24," You wouldn't, right?"
2650.24,2656.5," Because no matter the utility, as you say, it is devoid of circumstance, but your criteria is circumstance."
2656.72,2657.18, That's weird.
2657.44,2661.1," But secondly, ladies and gentlemen, and this is also quite very important,"
2661.5,2666.0," by that logic, unemployed people who don't do anything contributive for the society"
2666.0,2668.04, in a certain period of time
2668.04,2669.86, shouldn't get the right to vote. We think
2669.86,2672.18," that criteria is a huge gap,"
2672.36,2674.1," ladies and gentlemen, that we pointed out"
2674.1,2676.12, from Speaker 1. They did
2676.12,2677.7," not develop it, right? Second,"
2677.96,2680.14, they said that it's about whether or not
2680.14,2682.14," it's coercive, right? Government coerces"
2682.14,2684.04," you to follow laws, and that's why that's problematic."
2684.52,2690.66," Note, when you go to a country, you look at their laws and whether or not that's a favourable working condition for you."
2690.66,2694.48," So it's not like government is telling you that come here, you must follow my laws."
2694.68,2699.14," You opt into that country, you choose to go into that country, so it's not coercion."
2699.4,2708.96," Third, the fact that it's vulnerable people multiple responses number one if that is truly a metric why not weigh minority votes much much more than you weigh"
2708.96,2712.66, votes of people who are not disenfranchised no response whatsoever
2712.66,2718.18, secondly we also told you why it's important to not be discriminated towards
2718.18,2723.82, votes because in a world where you are we give you like responses of backlash
2723.82,2726.32, they never responded to. So compare
2726.32,2727.8, this feeble principle
2727.8,2729.56, to the principle that we give you.
2729.86,2732.0, We give you structural reasons why
2732.0,2733.54, the stake is relative.
2734.2,2735.5, For a person living
2735.5,2737.86," in USA, let's say"
2737.86,2740.14, they want the right to vote for
2740.14,2741.0," abortion, right?"
2741.66,2743.72, In a world where someone from a different
2743.72,2745.1," foreign nation, perhaps conservative, comes by and votes not for abortion, right? In a world where someone from a different foreign nation, perhaps"
2745.1,2751.16," conservative, comes by and votes not for abortion, note that the brunt of it is"
2751.16,2755.38, dealt with the person living in America or person living in that specific state
2755.38,2760.4," because that other person will be gone in four years, right? So we think that is"
2760.4,2766.66," the way in which the stakes vary. One is forever, another is for a period of time you work there, right?"
2766.94,2771.16," Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, we gave to you analysis as to why it's a facilitative right."
2771.54,2775.36," That since resources are scarce, since there's an obvious opportunity cost,"
2775.62,2779.24," we need to pick who we facilitate with this voting right with, right?"
2779.24,2783.76, And this is why we also showed you why principally these people don't deserve the right.
2784.02,2789.98," And here, again, analysis overlooked, right? We first told you that, one, how the stakes aren't"
2789.98,2795.0," high. I've already dealt with that. But secondly, I've also asked them to tell me why it would"
2795.0,2799.86, be in the best interest of these people to put the country they're in first. Because
2799.86,2804.7," note that they have grown up in another country. Note that they're here to make money, right?"
2804.92,2808.22," Even though I'm not saying that these people are very bad people, vengeful people,"
2808.42,2815.24, but I do not think you can claim that that person has the same emotional attachment to the country
2815.24,2819.12, like the person who is an active citizen there who has lived their entire life.
2819.38,2820.1, No responses.
2820.1,2824.5," So on a comparative, given that their principle has glaring loopholes,"
2824.82,2828.98," and our principle is a simple principle of comparing who has more state,"
2829.38,2835.8," given that we successfully showed you that citizens have more state, since voting is a facilitative right with an active opportunity cost,"
2836.12,2841.1, the person who has more state takes the better part of that opportunity cost.
2841.44,2841.66, Sure.
2842.22,2848.7," If a citizen is planning to leave a state in a few years, would your side deny them the right to vote? Again, they are still a citizen."
2848.98,2853.06," They will come back, right? We don't think that works like that. The fact that they have"
2853.06,2856.72," lived there for 20 years, 25 years, the fact that they have actively been a part of that"
2856.72,2862.94," society makes a huge difference. But secondly, and this is the utility part of their case,"
2863.02,2865.52, right? I've successfully showed you why principally it doesn't stand.
2865.84,2867.46, So utility is quite simple.
2867.94,2871.42," These people would become a small critical mass,"
2871.6,2873.86, and apparently that will count as swing boats.
2874.56,2877.76, We've given you realistic reasons why that cannot happen.
2878.04,2882.68," Number one, we've told you why swing boats won't essentially happen"
2882.68,2886.24, because not all migrant workers are in the same state.
2886.46,2887.54, So they're sparingly located.
2887.98,2892.22," In that nuance that they live in enclaves, how many people live in enclaves?"
2892.72,2895.48," At best, if it's a humongous enclave, it's probably 100 people."
2896.08,2903.04," Note that in Knox County in USA, which is one of the smallest counties in Tennessee,"
2903.54,2906.9," note that even then, the swing vote ratio,"
2907.0,2909.64," the difference in votes, was of 5,000."
2910.26,2912.8," Even in that scenario, ladies and gentlemen,"
2913.18,2916.78, that small vote rate cannot act as a swing vote.
2917.0,2918.48, They needed to give you a structured reason for it.
2918.68,2921.32," Okay, even if it makes a difference in county, right?"
2921.42,2923.44," Even if I take them at their best,"
2923.76,2927.86," we think there's an obvious, obvious to note here just because you want one"
2927.86,2932.16, county elections doesn't mean that will translate the state and congressional
2932.16,2936.0, elections and here is where the responses that my second speaker gave
2936.0,2940.46, you went absolutely unreverted because we essentially told you why it is
2940.46,2951.32, unlikely that that small county or like small state would have the similar weight in congressional elections or in Congress that you say they will have.
2951.64,2959.58," But okay, okay, let's say that their marginal benefit is that a small minority group has a bit more people supporting them."
2959.92,2961.24, Why is that not worth it?
2961.64,2965.38," We tell you, ladies and gentlemen, because of something that we like to call demogorgory."
2965.76,2969.94, The reason why this is important is because the general trend in this world is that more
2969.94,2974.78," nationalistic sentiment is growing all around Europe, all around USA, like, obviously."
2975.14,2978.58," But more importantly, we think that this sentiment gets triggered."
2978.72,2982.46," So even if they show that there are a few number of people more angry in the world,"
2983.02,2989.18," that comes at the cost of two things. One, people being more angry at them, something that we already analyze."
2989.52,2994.7," But secondly, populist leaders don't want migrants to come in anymore. So in the long"
2994.7,2998.92," run, there will be more migrants that are blocked from coming to this country because"
2998.92,3004.36," there are migrant workers there. For all of these reasons, it may be nice to feel like"
3004.36,3005.0," migrant workers will get a vote,"
3005.0,3009.0," but if you look at it realistically, that's not possible. That is why we win."
3011.0,3018.0," Three reasons why they lose this debate. First of all, they gave you no incentive structures behind the oppression of these migrant workers."
3018.0,3024.0," Both sides in this debate can come up with random facts about why these migrants are oppressed, why these migrants aren't oppressed."
3024.0,3028.0, We need to have incentive structures as to why they will be oppressed from their side.
3028.0,3034.0," We need incentive structures why they won't be oppressed because of the ways in which these migrant workers have an impact,"
3034.0,3040.0, a meaningful and considerable amount of impact in these countries and why the states are obliged to not hurt them in the first place.
3040.0,3048.0," Secondly, they give you no analysis as to why citizens and migrant workers should have the same say in that same country."
3048.0,3056.0," Whereas we told you why. Because the level of coercion that the state practices on each of these individuals is different, they shouldn't have the same say."
3056.0,3064.0," But lastly, they never contested as to why their lives get significantly worsened when the rise of right-wing populist parties gets consolidated,"
3064.0,3066.8, and their ability to demonize these right-wing workers gets consolidated
3066.8,3069.0, and that means this society becomes unsafe to them.
3069.2,3074.62," Before we move on to the clashes, first of all, they claim that, oh look, why then do we not give women,"
3074.88,3079.06, why then do we give women rights because there happens to be backlashes.
3079.48,3084.36," First of all, we didn't tell you why because there are backlashes we shouldn't give them rights."
3084.36,3088.38, We told you why. They shouldn't have these rights because there are backlashes we shouldn't give them rights. We told you why they shouldn't have these rights because there are principal reasons
3088.38,3094.0, why they shouldn't have rights. The argumentation about backlash was to show you why their lives
3094.0,3098.14, are going to get significantly worsened. If backlash argument is to prove to you why
3098.14,3101.78, they shouldn't have rights and if that is wrong then their argumentation about benefits
3101.78,3107.44," to these workers should also not stand as a principal obligation as to why we should give them rights. If that was really true,"
3107.44,3112.4, probably we should give technocrats more rights because they give more benefits to the society.
3112.4,3115.64," So two clashes. First of all, the principal right to vote. They told you why the benefits"
3115.64,3119.4, to this state is amazing and is immense and therefore we should give them rights. The
3119.4,3123.84, problem is that the benefits aren't necessarily the metric upon which we give people rights.
3123.84,3127.94," That is why we don't give people rights even when there are foreigners who give charities, who"
3127.94,3132.78," give foreign aid, etc. They never contested to that. They gave us no response to these"
3132.78,3136.34," responses. But secondly, they told you why policies do affect them. Economic policies,"
3136.64,3141.2," abortion laws, etc. When the migrant comes to work, first of all, they come to benefit"
3141.2,3147.76," off of the state's economic fabric, not necessarily change it. So why does that purpose necessarily exist from the get-go, I don't see."
3147.76,3152.08," But secondly, first, we can say how immigrants' ability to opt out is much greater."
3152.08,3154.08, That's what Tausig's argument was about.
3154.08,3157.92," We think, in the vast majority of cases, citizens don't have the ability to leave the states"
3157.92,3161.04," because they have emotional attachments, their national connections, etc."
3161.04,3165.52, Whereas these migrant workers have a much greater ability to leave this country.
3165.52,3169.84," But more importantly, note that these are just two examples upon which the entire principle is based."
3169.84,3175.68, We told you how the level of state's coercion is far far greater in the hands of the citizens.
3175.68,3181.12," How is that? Two reasons why. First of all, state has the right to command its citizens even at the"
3181.12,3188.44," expense of some of their own rights. The ability to conscript you, the ability to endorse subpoena system where they forcefully"
3188.44,3192.9, bring you to the court and make you give evidences as an eyewitness and etc.
3192.9,3195.64, The ability to set police rates into your house.
3195.64,3199.06, These are all the ways in which the state can command these migrant workers.
3199.06,3210.0," But secondly, these policies the country will endorse will affect the country in the long long run, which during the time in which these migrant workers might not stay at all."
3210.0,3216.0, Then let me tell you about how these migrant workers will have a better life. We told you how these migrant workers will not be exploited.
3216.0,3225.06," First of all, the fact that Labour and the Democratic Party already cater to it. Second, the fact that they have relations with other countries that they need to cater to. Third for the fact that they belong in a trademark"
3225.06,3227.14," in which if you deny those labor rights,"
3227.14,3229.3, all those other countries in the vast majority of cases
3229.3,3231.82, will have repercussions on you.
3231.82,3233.68," But secondly, we told you how it gets worse"
3233.68,3235.34, because you destroy the social fabric
3235.34,3237.14, within these communities because people
3237.14,3240.12, have hateful opinions about you.
3240.12,3242.08, Right wing populist parties twice.
3242.08,3244.28, Then they told you that these votes can bring a change.
3244.28,3246.64, We told you why these migrant workers
3246.64,3248.26," are in the vast majority of cases minorities,"
3248.58,3249.6," but even if they were majority,"
3249.88,3250.8," they would be catered to,"
3250.96,3251.9," or even if they were not,"
3252.16,3253.62, the fact that they come into these communities
3253.62,3255.2," in the first place means that they,"
3255.48,3256.76, these communities already catered to them
3256.76,3257.52, in the first place.
3257.7,3258.46," For all these reasons,"
3258.72,3260.82, we believe we have won every single aspect of this debate.
3261.06,3262.18, We are very proud to oppose it.
3270.0,3276.0," I want to talk about two things in this speech. First, migrant workers. Second, the vote. First, migrant workers. Side opposition's case mostly hung on the idea that there isn't even a problem to begin with."
3276.0,3282.0," We told you a number of things. Firstly, that there isn't a fair exchange of skills when there is an unbalanced flow of labour"
3282.0,3289.04," from a developed country to a developing country. That there is no incentive there to play nice, to attract more migrant"
3289.04,3292.5, workers because more of them will be flowing so that they can earn the lower than minimum
3292.5,3297.26," wage that these employers require of them, that legal recourse cannot happen when employers"
3297.26,3302.32," can intimidate them by using their visa as their hostage, but second, that trade blocs"
3302.32,3306.32, only care necessarily about the remittances that are coming back
3306.32,3309.24, and are often very untransparent.
3309.24,3312.34," But furthermore, we told you that empirically there is a problem."
3312.34,3316.2, Examples in the beginning of the third Trump speech that were never responded to.
3316.2,3319.68, And we told you that the vote is the best mechanism to solve this problem.
3319.68,3324.38," Because on comparative, there is more of a power for these people to change policy."
3324.38,3326.06, Local policies that are important
3326.06,3328.12," to them, because they live in enclaves"
3328.12,3330.08, in concentrated areas like they
3330.08,3331.68, conceive in their third off speech.
3331.94,3334.06," But furthermore, in countries where there is"
3334.06,3336.08, direct conflict and a very close
3336.08,3338.06, conflict between bipartisan parties
3338.06,3339.9, that have an incentive to garner as
3339.9,3341.96, bigger of a voting base as
3341.96,3343.96, possible. Their
3343.96,3346.38, only response to our idea about how there is a problem
3346.38,3349.64," is the fact that it gets worse, that demagogues will rise."
3350.38,3353.42, We asked them why is the vote tipping point at the point in which
3353.42,3356.26," all their harms that they talk about, about Donald Trump,"
3356.48,3359.64, exist in their version of the world and not ours.
3360.24,3362.26," They just said, we're taking more of their rights,"
3362.4,3364.48," therefore this rhetoric will be marginally increased,"
3364.72,3368.1, never explaining why that marginal increase is so significant.
3368.52,3373.26," Especially the case that we told you, that the absence of the vote of these migrant workers"
3373.26,3376.8, is because of that backlash in the first place.
3377.08,3379.54, The fact that they aren't seen as equal to them.
3379.76,3384.72," The fact that they can't have a political voice in an environment that otherizes them, that victimizes them."
3384.96,3388.34, Absolutely no response from side opposition. If all
3388.34,3393.92," else fails, even if you believe them, give it a hint of doubt. If there is a"
3393.92,3398.46," problem, what happens on their side? Their only mechanism was protest. Bones"
3398.46,3402.94," breaking off, blood shed so that they have a minor chance of getting a political"
3402.94,3406.04, say in these harmful toxic environments. We don't stand
3406.04,3407.34, for that on side proposition.
3408.14,3409.98," But in this theme, weigh this."
3410.42,3411.78," If a problem doesn't exist,"
3412.26,3413.88, giving a vote to a migrant worker
3413.88,3416.02, where the problem doesn't exist doesn't do them any
3416.02,3417.74, active harm at the point in which
3417.74,3419.86, those very conservative countries that have
3419.86,3421.98, demagogues already rising are the ones that we cater
3421.98,3424.12, to and the ones that we benefit on our side.
3424.8,3430.02," Second theme then, the vote. We told you very clearly from the get-go that the vote should"
3430.02,3435.78," be deserved on a scale of factors. The degrees of investment, the degrees of loyalty that you"
3435.78,3441.0," can prove to the state, the degrees of benefits that you can give back to the state. Not that"
3441.0,3447.0," they are disadvantaged, but that they are invested in that country and that's the principal reason why we should give them votes."
3447.0,3453.0," Their only response was, well, the correct criteria is if the state can coerce you."
3453.0,3458.0," They do in status quo, when these policies don't change and harm these people in the status quo."
3458.0,3465.76," All they gave you a response was a bunch of assertive analogies and scenarios about, would you give the vote to this person, would you give the vote to this person,"
3466.02,3468.76, never analyzing the analysis behind my first speaker's argument
3468.76,3470.64, about the principle of the vote.
3471.04,3474.28, They told you that citizens are sacrificed as opportunity costs
3474.28,3477.1, because we can't cater to them as the votes are diluted.
3477.42,3478.32, We asked them why.
3478.64,3480.06, Why is there an opportunity cost
3480.06,3481.96, at the point in which my constructive argument
