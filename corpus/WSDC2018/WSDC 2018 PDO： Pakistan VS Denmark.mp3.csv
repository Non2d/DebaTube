0.0,22.72," In the age of Trump, where government shouts fake news at every criticism."
23.68,25.08," In the age of surveillance,"
26.92,28.88," where your citizens are rendered defenseless against the prying eyes of the state,"
29.54,31.68," and in the age of rising military agendas,"
32.18,33.76," corrupt governments, and scandals"
33.76,35.24," such as the recent Panama Gate,"
35.78,38.76, we think independent state is the ultimate defense
38.76,41.32, that we have against the indoctrination by the state.
41.74,42.88," Because understand this,"
43.18,46.72," media is a very, very important tool. The"
46.72,51.38, way that this tool is used depends on whose hands it is in. And we think that a government
51.38,56.16," whose sole purpose is to get re-elected, it's a very dangerous hand to put it in. Which"
56.16,61.5, is why we at Side Proposition are proud to propose this motion. But let's define to you
61.5,69.5," this motion, right? What do we mean? When we talk to you about a democratic state, it's self-explanatory, but basically a government that's elected in by a majority vote."
70.32,79.3," When we talk to you about ownership over media organizations, we think that government shouldn't have full or partial ownership. It can't buy shares in these channels."
79.3,89.0," And more importantly, there can be no funding. So these media organizations are basically newspapers, or magazines, or for instance, television channels as well. We think our burden in this"
89.0,95.0, debate is simply to prove to you that basically the state owning media goes against the principles
95.0,98.0," of democracy. And if we prove that to you, we win this debate."
98.0,101.0, So let's move on to the three lines of argument that we have with you.
101.0,109.76," Number one, how on a principle level the state should not have the ability to manipulate voters. Secondly, the harms that this has on the democratic"
109.76,115.84," process. And three, which is our second speaker case, how state-run media undermines journalistic"
115.84,119.82," integrity. So let's move on to this first argument first. And this argument is very,"
120.0,128.0, very important. Because understand that we as a opposition believe that taxpayer resources cannot be used by the state to manipulate the vote.
128.0,132.0," Whether or not they succeed in doing so, just giving them the ability is principally wrong."
132.0,137.0, Why is this so? Because we believe in the principle of having free and fair elections.
137.0,140.0, And there's multiple examples of this in the status quo as well.
140.0,151.78," For instance, state funds cannot be used to fund election campaigns. For instance, you have an interim government before elections because you make sure that the previous government does not use state apparatuses to influence the next election."
152.1,160.62," The purpose of these examples is to prove to you that in this case, the state has to ensure absolute neutrality, which does not come about through media."
161.0,165.5, We think that governments will always have this vested interest of being
165.5,171.32, elected again. That very interest is one big reason for why we can't give media into the
171.32,175.54," good hands of these governments, right? Because we think it goes against or contradicts the"
175.54,179.7, principles of democracy because you're using taxpayer money in order to do so. And that
179.7,183.94," we think is principally a part. So on a very deontological level, regardless of whether"
183.94,188.22," they actually end up manipulating voters, the fact that you give them this ability, you think, is"
188.22,192.24, wrong and goes against the principles of democracy. But let's then prove to you within our second
192.24,196.68," line of argument where this manipulation actually takes place and is actually very, very dangerous."
196.86,197.06, Ma'am.
197.16,198.86," But here, but before that, go ahead, Meadow."
199.24,202.4, Do you oppose state-mandated curricula in public schools?
202.62,205.16," Sit down, Meadow. Yes, we do. Okay, let's"
205.16,208.44, move on to our second line of argument. Let's talk here about the importance of media in
208.44,213.26, the democratic process. Understand that the media is basically the only source of information
213.26,219.4," that we as people have. So we rely on TV channels, we rely on news agencies to inform ourselves,"
219.7,224.48, and this information is what we then use to hold the government accountable. The information
224.48,228.88," that we then use to vote in another government. So the importance of media, it's very, very,"
228.96,233.88," very crucial to the process. Having proven this to you, let's explain to you how this"
233.88,238.62," purpose is then manipulated by states in two scenarios. First, where there are counter"
238.62,242.74," narratives in the form of corporations, and secondly, where there aren't. So first scenario,"
243.02,245.0," where there are counter narratives, which is their best case't. So for a scenario, where there are counter-narratives,"
245.0,246.0," which is their best case scenario,"
246.0,248.0, so we'll just screw this here.
248.0,250.0," So even if these other counter-narratives exist,"
250.0,252.0," even if you have other channels, what is the problem?"
252.0,255.0, The problem is that there's preferential treatment
255.0,257.0, given to government-owned channels.
257.0,260.0, They tend to not fund or rely on private channels
260.0,262.0, because they expect that they can turn against them
262.0,265.4," any time, or that they're not entirely loyal to the state."
265.64,267.4, Which is why they focus on their own channel.
267.7,268.52, Why is this harmful?
268.7,269.7," Ma'am, sit down, ma'am."
269.98,273.62, This is harmful because the state then controls the way information goes out.
273.72,281.1," So, for instance, interviews that bring in people from Harlem, or leaders, are taking place within these news channels,"
281.36,283.82, where the government controls the way the interview takes place.
283.82,288.18," Your government, when your people watch that, are influenced by that, because that's what happens."
288.6,292.78," Secondly, the access even to government, right? So for instance, allowing journalists into"
292.78,297.12," parliament, giving them the resources that they need to make news stories. We think these"
297.12,301.5, are the ways in which governments influence the way that their media houses represent
301.5,307.5," information, right? But thirdly, Frank, you think that things like heavy taxation on other corporations"
307.5,310.64," takes place, on other news channels, to make sure that they're not that efficient."
311.02,312.54, What is the motive of doing all of this?
312.54,316.06, The motive of doing all of this is to ensure that people focus on their channel.
316.42,317.34," Why does this happen, right?"
317.36,318.42, You've seen the example of Bangladesh.
318.8,323.22," When in 2014, when there were mass protests, there was a media blackout, and the only channel"
323.22,328.5, which was open was the government's own channel. That proves to you that the motives of the state are very dangerous
328.5,333.0," when it comes to the media. But lastly, we think as far as access to news stories goes,"
333.3,337.6," so because the government itself is aware of things as they take place, right, the government"
337.6,341.9," knows everything first, which is why it takes this information and gives it to their channels"
341.9,348.04, first. So the first source of information in this case is this news channel that is owned by the state. Why is that harmful?
348.38,351.78, Because people then rely on this channel to give them the first source of information.
352.08,356.48," The first opinion that they build on any story comes from this news channel, which we think"
356.48,361.22," is very harmful because that is the opinion that stays in most circumstances, right? So"
361.22,365.14," we think that it guarantees that state gives you biased information,"
369.4,373.08," this information sticks, and other channels cannot counter it. But secondly, right, let's talk to you about our best case scenario, which is how there are no other counters,"
373.22,378.04, right? We have examples of where you have only state-run media. The problem here is
378.04,382.56, that you end up forming an echo chamber. Why does this happen? Because you paint rosy pictures
382.56,390.8," of government activities, right? You carry out war propaganda, make your faults, you hide your errors, and present your good side."
391.04,394.54, That's harmful because there are no other channels to counter that influence.
394.92,397.86, The only source of information people have is this one channel.
398.08,403.28, So the minimal benefit that you may have gotten in their world with counter-narratives doesn't even exist in our world.
403.68,406.0, So how does this harm democracy then?
406.0,409.0," We have the example of Singapore, where you have largely state-run media"
409.0,412.0, and you have the same government in power for the past 60 years.
412.0,415.0, They can't prove to us that there is no link between the two.
415.0,419.0," Because if media is their only source of information, and that information is what leads you to vote,"
419.0,427.74," if media is influenced by this one government, then we think the likelihood of this one government staying in power is very high. And that harms democracy because then it's not really democracy,"
427.84,432.14," right? So then let us prove to you the harms in two ways, right? Firstly, the political"
432.14,435.8, harms. The political harms I've talked to you about before is that they harm accountability.
436.24,440.86," Generally, that's what democracy harms the vote, also about democracy, right? But secondly,"
440.98,445.72, let's talk to you about the social harms of us. The way that this influences social attitudes.
446.12,447.74," So the way that we watch the media,"
447.98,450.68, and the way the media portrays a certain group of people
450.68,451.76," or certain scenarios,"
452.24,456.14, to end up influencing the way that we act in social situations.
456.9,458.68, What are examples of this?
458.74,460.58," And understand this, this argument is very important"
460.58,463.0, for weak democracies or third-world countries.
463.4,464.28," So for instance, with Myanmar,"
464.9,468.64, we think the state carries out this narrative that the Rohingya Muslims are bad people and
468.64,473.94, deserve whatever they're getting. That's very harmful. Governments that go into war
473.94,478.12, can very easily convince their people that this war is justified. This is harmful for
478.12,481.46, social causes because you have people that do not hold the government accountable in
481.46,487.14," this way as well. Firstly. Secondly, in countries like Pakistan, where any of these are a minority,"
487.54,490.04," people that aren't considered Muslims under the state,"
490.28,493.76, are the kind of people that are targeted by your average man
493.76,497.56, because your government carries out this narrative that these people deserve what they get.
497.84,501.48," So we think in terms of influencing these attitudes, you do the same thing."
501.72,504.84," So because we're the side that supports democracy in its purest form,"
504.84,506.42," and we're the side that ensures it,"
506.84,507.6, please vote Pakistan.
511.7,515.38, In a dream world of the structures of society
515.38,517.48," that we're being taught in elementary school,"
517.86,520.32, media is supposed to be unbiased and neutral.
520.76,522.46," Sadly, that is not the case."
522.92,526.06, Private corporations are turning news into reality
526.06,531.74," shows, into digestible entertainment. We need the state to provide people with unbiased,"
531.92,537.94," neutral information. We support democratized news, not politicized news. Very proud to"
537.94,541.82," be on the same opposition. What am I going to do in my speech? First off, I'm going to"
541.82,548.7," be providing with our stance. Secondly, talk about what we heard from the first opposition speaker, and then provide you with the first two points"
548.7,554.74," of material. First on how we actually enforce the rules of democracy. Secondly, how we have"
554.74,559.58," the incentives for the sick and how we have better news because of that. Lastly, Marius"
559.58,564.06," will talk to you about diversity of news on our side. First off, what do we stand for"
564.06,565.48," on Team Opposition? We believe that democratic nations should run for their own and media about diversity of news on our side. First off, what do we stand for on team of a session?"
565.48,568.32, We believe that democratic nations should run
568.32,570.32, for own a media organization.
570.32,572.12," We believe they should pursue the,"
572.12,574.44, like try to aim to provide much neutral
574.44,575.52, and non-biased news.
575.52,578.08," We believe they have asked to do this, right?"
578.08,580.28, We think states are already put in place
580.28,582.16, in which they keep itself accountable.
582.16,584.12, We think the state is divided into branches
584.12,586.0, and they are already showing that they can do this.
586.0,588.0," Secondly, let's just ask,"
588.0,590.0, what do we think this looks like?
590.0,592.0, The context that is important to understand
592.0,594.0, in this debate is that huge companies
594.0,596.0, are owning a variety of media
596.0,598.0, organizations themselves.
598.0,600.0," That is, in the sense that you have the Coal Brothers"
600.0,602.0," owning Fox News and Bright Art, right?"
602.0,604.0, These media provide partisan
604.0,606.08," news, and we think we need to counter that"
606.08,608.24, with the media organizations provided by the state.
608.52,610.18," These were subsidized by the state,"
610.3,612.7," but they are run by independent journalists, right?"
612.88,614.34, These journalists don't work
614.34,615.58, cheek-to-cheek with politicians.
615.96,617.92," They have to go and have a code of conduct,"
618.22,619.84, and we think that these are oftentimes
619.84,621.4, a decided way where you have
621.4,624.4, sub-branches where you can complain as a citizen
624.4,626.5, if you feel that your media is being biased.
626.5,635.0," But also, we don't support a monopoly on news. We think we can have the coexistence of both the state-owned organizations and the private ones that we're talking about on our side."
635.0,637.0, What did we hear from the first proposition speaker?
637.0,643.5," Basically, the claim that they gave throughout the whole speech is that this misinterpretation of what a politician is."
643.5,647.0," That basically, BBC has the intent of brainwashing all of its citizens,"
647.0,648.0, saying it's because it's owned by the state.
648.0,653.0, We think what they identify is that politicians are motivated by getting re-elected.
653.0,656.0," Why was that not a bad thing? That is a good thing, right?"
656.0,658.0, Because that means that you are always held accountable.
658.0,662.0, Every single step you take is held accountable in the news.
662.0,663.0, That is what we think.
663.0,668.0, That these people are able to provide you with neutral and non-partisan news.
668.0,676.0," We counter that when you, like, counter that with the independent, profit-oriented media markets that exist on their side, that focus on sensation, right?"
676.0,691.6," We can have the ecosystem of both of them. Then we ask them in the PY, like, do you think that's, do you support state-opposed curricula? Here they say, no, they wouldn't do that. At that point, we think they concede to how the state is able to provide the most neutral and best curricula for all children."
691.6,695.4," But also, we don't know how will curricula be substituted on those sides?"
695.4,700.4, Would you have independent private organizations providing this?
700.4,706.18, The state is the only one who has the unique responsibility of providing this on our side.
706.38,709.56, Let's move into our first point of material about how we have a better democracy.
709.76,712.9, A democracy that clashes with the majority of what they taught you in the first place.
713.12,715.38," First off, let's talk about state responsibility."
715.94,722.72, We think that the state has the responsibility of easing the path for every citizen to get out and vote to the greatest extent.
723.04,726.18, It is not enough for a state to say you have a vote.
726.42,729.92, The state needs to ensure that you are able to spend that vote in a way
729.92,732.4, which translates into you actually being helped.
732.68,736.46," This is why states provide transportation for you to get to a poll if you live far away,"
736.52,738.5," but it's also why you go to school as a student, right?"
738.62,741.98, Because you're educated to understand the problems of society.
741.98,747.9, That leads us to the conclusion that information is a cornerstone of a functioning democracy.
747.9,751.0, That is why we need to have the state providing the access.
751.0,753.02," On their side, there are people who simply do not have"
753.02,754.8, access to information to the state of the pretty.
754.8,757.48, We think that the state has that opportunity.
757.48,761.02, But that's because we're informed
761.02,764.56," on the basic political picture of the nation,"
764.56,765.96, like what do you stand for?
766.14,767.84, What will your vote actually translate into?
768.06,770.92, That is crucial information that some people won't have access to.
770.98,773.26, Why do we think neutrality is important for this to happen?
773.58,777.14," This is because humans are pretty receptive to emotional narratives,"
777.42,779.4, to appeal in other ways.
779.54,781.32, We think that it is important for you to have access
781.32,783.62," to somewhat boring information-based news, right?"
783.74,788.34," Because that is the way you are able to access these results best and not, like, lose your"
788.34,790.18, independent saying what you actually believe.
790.44,793.5, That is why we think that states have that obligation to provide this access.
793.96,797.32," On the other side, we think that, like, not every citizen has that access, right?"
797.48,803.08," Furthermore, every citizen is forced to conform with a certain biased, like, news station,"
803.16,803.28, right?
803.28,806.5, You don't have any access to something that's state-provided
806.5,809.8," and as interested in providing for every single one in society, right?"
809.98,811.5, That is when you are the worst.
811.78,815.44, That is when you don't have the ability to see things in the best and clearest perspective.
815.84,820.3," In order to have the best democracy, people need to know the neutrality of something, right?"
820.44,823.7," There are topics that are really difficult to portray in neutral ways, right?"
823.82,828.96," For example, healthcare. For example, war is on in their world, every single media would go out and say,"
828.96,833.12," oh this is terrible, or oh this is like really really good, we should fight for this. But on"
833.12,837.28," our side, the state is able to just provide you with the bare information of that in the most"
837.28,841.52, neutral and good way because they're held accountable by the citizens. Before we get into
841.52,845.0," my second point about state incentives, I will take your advice and answer"
845.0,846.0, this.
846.0,851.0, The question we're trying to ask you in this debate is would you then also by your
851.0,857.0, own logic not allow politicians to use state funds to for example run their election campaigns?
857.0,860.0, We think that's what except already happened.
860.0,864.0, We think a lot of politicians already use taxes to run their campaigns.
864.0,868.48, We don't think that's a problem. We don't really know where they're going with that. Let's go into the second
868.48,872.72," point about the same incentive. So first off, let's just make a comparison between how states"
872.72,877.44, are with the motives of states and the motives of private competitions and why we think it's
877.44,883.44," essential to have that role in the world. So first off, what are states motivated by? As a state,"
883.44,887.0," the majority of news covers every single action that you have, right?"
887.0,890.0, Every single step you take that is wrong loses you a vote.
890.0,894.0," That means you're interested in doing things right, in doing things in a neutral way,"
894.0,898.0, to the extent that people think that you're not being unfair.
898.0,902.0," We think that that is because you are like, let's ask, what is the interest of the voters, right?"
902.0,904.0," These are, in the end, the ones who hold you accountable."
904.0,909.76, A voter wants you to portray something in a neutral way. That is why NPR is constantly
909.76,915.28," under criticism of being too democratic, of being too left-wing. Citizens always criticize"
915.28,919.68, state or branches of news. We think that is a good thing on our side. That is why we think
919.68,925.6, we are able to still provide this. States are fundamentally under a system of checks and balances that do not
925.6,930.96, exist for migrants. Now what are the incentives of companies and the motives of them? A company
930.96,936.08," relies on funding but that means you're allowed to say basically whatever you want, insofar as you"
936.08,940.16," have your money from ads, you have your money from citizens, you don't have the burden that states"
940.16,945.0," have. Moreover, we think a lot of news organizations are owned by companies."
945.0,950.0, You can watch a video from a range of different news organizations owned by the same company
950.0,955.0, and they will tell you the exact same thing in every single news story because they're controlled
955.0,960.0, by this one thing that is profit-oriented. What do we think the impacts of this is that we provide
960.0,970.02," on our site? First off, we have more neutral news. This is really important because it's difficult for citizens to access this on the right. Companies really don't have this duty. Companies"
970.02,974.0," are oftentimes pretty explicit about their biases, pretty explicit about what they want"
974.0,978.26," you to believe. We provide you with that on our side. Secondly, we think because state"
978.26,983.58," media is funded upon a stable level of investment, state media organizations are able to cover"
983.58,985.28, things that are costly even at the
985.28,989.68, expense of other money at a budget rate because you always have a stable investment. You don't
989.68,994.24," have to constantly fight for this. But moreover, we think you have less socialization."
994.8,998.96, Profit-oriented markets are always the one that cater to your emotions. They're not interested
998.96,1002.72, in you knowing what actually happens within a society. That's why you have frequent news about
1002.72,1008.0," celebrity divorces, frequent news about pollen allergies, random things that aren't essential to you as a citizen."
1008.0,1012.0," We have democratized news, non-politicized news, proud to be a chief opposition."
1018.0,1023.0," In a debate like this, it isn't always opposition's burden to prove that they should be only private"
1023.0,1030.3, companies. We can see that. But in this particular case where the first speaker gives reasons for why private corporations
1030.3,1036.74," are always worse off than the state when it comes to dispensing news, they need to then"
1036.74,1040.94, create a distinction and show why they're not okay with the monopoly. Because they simply
1040.94,1046.66, stated that without giving any reason for why these private corporations should even exist within the first place
1046.66,1050.26," if the kind of news they give is so partisan, if it's so harmful."
1050.54,1053.64," If they think that state is always in a better position,"
1053.92,1056.18, they're very inconsistent within their own stance
1056.18,1058.84," and they can see that there's some value to private corporations,"
1059.12,1061.58, the value that we're propagating at proposition.
1062.02,1065.0, But another big place this burden upon them is to understand
1065.0,1069.38," what we clearly define as our burden, which was a very principled deontological burden"
1069.38,1075.9," within this debate, that hey, it falls within the principles of democracy for a state to"
1075.9,1080.84," not run media, that it's contradictory to the purpose of democracy. And that's the first"
1080.84,1086.28," clash within this debate, right? And over here, they don't really respond to this idea."
1086.54,1091.02, Because it's not about whether this media is unbiased or whether it's kind of biased.
1091.5,1095.08," It's that it could be biased and that potential itself,"
1095.2,1098.06, giving that ability to the government is harmful.
1098.42,1103.46," We think they never engage on this level and they need to refute the best part of our case,"
1103.46,1106.8, not just what's easy for them to refute.
1106.8,1113.76, Thank you. And here's where our idea comes in regarding how politicians for example can't take out money from
1113.76,1119.52, tax from their state budget to fund their own political campaigns. For example Obama could
1119.52,1125.68, reduce taxpayer money in his re-election campaign because that was something that he had to fund himself.
1126.04,1130.58," Over here, that's exactly what we're trying to show to you, right? What we're trying to state"
1130.58,1136.38, over here is that politicians should not be able to influence the results of the next election with
1136.38,1140.96," the state apparatus they currently have. And if somewhere that does happen, we're very principally"
1140.96,1145.76, against it. That's why we encourage things like interim governments in many states around the world
1145.76,1149.16, because we want a degree of neutrality before the next election.
1149.46,1153.78, We told you that the potential this has to harm the democratic principles is enough to
1153.78,1154.3, win us a debate.
1154.4,1158.22," They don't refute this, but they bring their own counter-idea within their positive case"
1158.22,1163.64, about how well it has the duty of the state to provide information and that it does so
1163.64,1169.26, for example with trains and postal stations and all of that there's a clear distinction because those things
1169.26,1173.86, like trains cost a lot of money and people need to purchase tickets and things like that for it
1173.86,1180.0, but when it comes to media there's no direct need it's people are already being informed right so
1180.0,1189.46," the fact of the matter is whether it's like a state-run channel like the Pakistan Television Network or the BTV or whether it's something like, thank you sir, or whether"
1189.46,1194.58," it's for example another network like CNN or Fox, they know that Zoom has to pay for"
1194.58,1198.74," them, so we don't see why the state has a duty in essence to give it when there's no"
1198.74,1199.48, actual need.
1199.8,1204.12," But on a second level, let's move on to the issue of whether the state media really is"
1204.12,1205.4, unbiased or not.
1205.4,1211.0," Because over here, they've made interesting characterizations that state media is boring."
1211.0,1215.2, They're trying to make this debate a debate over sensationalism versus factual news.
1215.2,1221.7, It's not that debate whatsoever. We think that it's not like the state itself just give facts and figures
1221.7,1228.66," or every day they're like, here are 10 pros and cons cons of war we're going to repeat them in a boring way we're not going to show"
1228.66,1233.48, you any graphic images meaning even the words you use within media the kind of imagery you
1233.48,1238.4, you portray and the words you use in combination with it is itself creates this implicit bias
1238.4,1243.44, where we clearly show to you that there's an explicit bias within news because of the fact
1243.44,1249.82, that they want to show that the things aren't as bad as other news organizations are painting them out to be.
1249.94,1254.12, They have an incentive to do this every time because if people believe that the state right
1254.12,1256.72," now is failing, they're unlikely to re-elect that state."
1257.02,1261.08, And here's why they don't really refute this idea of a re-election incentive properly.
1261.34,1268.0," They just keep going in circles and make a parallel case where they're're like, well you know these individuals will hold the state accountable."
1268.0,1271.0," Well, how do you hold something accountable?"
1271.0,1273.0," When you know that there's a problem, right?"
1273.0,1274.0, How do you know there's a problem?
1274.0,1275.0, You get information.
1275.0,1280.0, If you're not getting that information because your overwhelming media narrative is controlled
1280.0,1284.0," by the state, we think you never know that there's anything wrong within the state."
1284.0,1288.36, That's what a problem for a lot of viewers of PTV who think that the state is doing just fine
1288.36,1291.28," and that our country is not in shambles. No, thank you."
1291.58,1295.78," But apart from that, when they themselves give examples of the national public radio,"
1296.02,1297.9, now it's criticized for being far left.
1298.14,1303.72, That itself shows that state-run apparatus and media is actually biased in one way or another.
1304.14,1309.42," And the fact that people criticize it doesn't stop it from being biased, it's still biased within the same school."
1309.82,1316.12," But apart from that, private organizations are also centrist, right? Like the MNBC, right?"
1316.2,1320.58, There are lots of organizations which don't really take a political stance or actually
1320.58,1326.04," focus on the center. But apart from that, never once did they refute our argument regarding social attitudes."
1326.28,1327.54, So they either need to come up here
1327.54,1329.4, and tell us that minorities don't matter
1329.4,1330.62, like the India Muslims
1330.62,1333.28, or the Ahmadi community within Pakistan
1333.28,1334.74, which are constantly persecuted
1334.74,1336.98, because the state runs its own idea
1336.98,1338.18, and it tells people that
1338.18,1339.64, these are bad individuals
1339.64,1341.3, and you should do everything you can
1341.3,1342.26, to curtail their rights
1342.26,1343.42, which leads to things like
1343.42,1344.64, hate crimes against them.
1344.88,1349.12, They need to tell us why the state is okay in propagating or believing something it does do.
1349.36,1349.86," Yes, madam."
1350.28,1356.38," As businesses, private news sources have to either use sensationalism to attract viewers or raise their prices."
1356.76,1359.96, How can your side ensure both quality and access?
1360.38,1363.1, Why do you assume sensationalism is something that's bad?
1363.1,1365.0, It's something we're still trying to make this debate about.
1365.0,1367.0, You need to actually qualify that for us.
1367.0,1370.0, We believe that a lot of people actually cater to the centre
1370.0,1373.0, and don't want to go towards different political extremes.
1373.0,1376.0, That's an entire market that they really want to tap into.
1376.0,1379.0," With that being said, now that I've shown to you that they're not fulfilling their burden,"
1379.0,1381.0, we are better fulfilling our principal burden.
1381.0,1384.0," And on top of that, showing to you political and practical harms"
1384.0,1385.76, like how the Singaporean government
1385.76,1390.0," still remains after 60 years and there's no change in that government, we've clearly shown"
1390.0,1393.76, you that we're winning this debate. Let me give you one more reason. I talked to you about how
1393.76,1399.04," state media undermines journalistic integrity. We think that when it comes to journalism,"
1399.04,1402.88, there's a certain amount of integrity you hold to the idea that journalists should be allowed to
1402.88,1409.7," freely explore various ideas that they want to research on, right? And that their ability to freely produce and"
1409.7,1415.18," publish those articles. Now, we want to make a clarification over here. We understand that"
1415.18,1419.18," yes, there's like, for example, on the far left or the far right, news organizations"
1419.18,1423.98," might heavily, might to some extent like regulate their own journalists, but we feel like that"
1423.98,1425.76, problem is exasperated
1425.76,1429.48, to an uncontrollable degree when it comes to state media.
1429.74,1433.56," Because when it comes to the states, they want to propagate one narrative, and we think"
1433.56,1435.3, that is their own narrative.
1435.58,1439.58," We think that when it comes to that narrative, we think journalists that work under the state"
1439.58,1444.34," are unlikely to, for example, explore other kinds of topics, and they might not get those"
1444.34,1445.48, same job opportunities
1445.48,1448.58," within the private sector, because it's the stage-run media"
1448.58,1450.16, that's dominant over there.
1450.16,1453.02, We think that's where their own pursuit of happiness
1453.02,1455.78, and the pursuit of fulfilling and self-actualizing
1455.78,1458.16, their identity and exploring the issues
1458.16,1459.76," that they really care about in writing,"
1459.76,1463.38, and writing articles free of censorship is curtailed.
1463.38,1465.14, We think that when the state censors their
1465.14,1471.94," own journalists, that's an incredibly drastic harm that we don't think that opposition"
1471.94,1476.56," will really cater to within this debate. We think journalists, as a separate stakeholder"
1476.56,1481.58," we've shown, are undermined within their work. What have we shown to you in this debate,"
1481.66,1486.38, or what have we done for you as a proposition? We've not been extreme in any of our characterizations.
1486.56,1489.32, We've shown to you the best case where there are counter-narratives.
1489.48,1497.86, Those counter-narratives are just barely functional because the fact that the state actively gives preference to its own new source.
1498.08,1503.66," But even in the end, we've led people on to their worst case, which is in the instances where there is no counter-narrative."
1503.98,1507.92," We don't think they're being reasonable. We don't think they're keeping the versions they are due, we think they're simply"
1507.92,1512.56," being inconsistent. If you care about the vote, if you care about democracy, vote Park is down."
1516.96,1522.0, So side opposition has been very much strategic in today's debate. In so far as they've
1522.0,1529.0," they've actually pushed the fact that since the government has the ability to be biased, we should never give it the ability to control anything, including media."
1529.0,1538.0," But running this logic, running this stance means that the government should not have the court systems, the government should not have the curriculum, the government should not control anything because we can't trust them."
1538.0,1545.0," What we tell you is, on the comparative, the actor that we can trust most within a true democratic society is in fact the government."
1545.0,1548.0," Insofar as they even trust them to make our own curriculums, right?"
1548.0,1551.0," And insofar they even can see themselves that they want the government to create a curriculum,"
1551.0,1555.0," they can see that the government can be more accountable, they can see that the government can be trusted,"
1555.0,1560.0, which is why it's not so big of a deal that the government can also own its own media.
1560.0,1563.0, And that's why I'm very proud to stand on opposition.
1563.0,1566.0," So, I'm going to do two things in today's debate."
1566.0,1569.0," First, I'm going to rebut and rebuild everything we've heard in today's speech so far."
1569.0,1573.0," And then last, I'm going to present our last argument about the diversity of people."
1573.0,1579.0," Okay. So in that first argument, in that first speech, they come up to us with this narrative that"
1579.0,1584.0, we're only going to see state media which just wants to push their own agenda.
1584.0,1585.24, Within incredibly corrupt
1585.24,1589.56," governments in which the party is in power, controls everything, they control the entire"
1589.56,1593.68," narrative, and they're even able to make you prosecute minorities in different ways."
1593.68,1597.18, We tell you that this is largely unstrategic because we don't think that these are very
1597.18,1603.92," much true democracies. In a system in which the government in power controls everything,"
1603.92,1608.0," and even controls how, for example, media, courts, or the prosecution system is being mandated."
1608.0,1613.0," At this point, that's an incredibly corrupt regime, and not inherently a true democracy, right?"
1613.0,1616.0, So they're focusing on the entirely wrong actions in this debate.
1616.0,1622.0," We think what we have to focus on is a government in which there is an actual true democracy, in which we have actual checks and balances."
1622.0,1625.0, But we're also going to engage on this slightly
1625.0,1626.0, slippery slope.
1626.0,1627.0, I'm glad you're saying that.
1627.0,1628.0," Well, that's still good, so thank you."
1628.0,1632.0, Okay. Let me tell you this point about how we won't have fair elections because all the
1632.0,1636.0, politicians in power are just incentivized to be re-elected and that's why they'll run
1636.0,1640.0," the narrative, that's why they'll control the media, right? We tell you that it's largely"
1640.0,1644.0," a good thing that politicians want to be re-elected, right? Because that means that politicians"
1644.0,1654.0," in parliament who aren't in power have an incentive to make sure to criticize the state-owned media and to make sure that it is as neutral as possible, right?"
1654.0,1657.0," To make sure that they still have the chance to be elected, right?"
1657.0,1661.0, I mean to also tell you that we are able to have accountability in this country.
1661.0,1662.0, We are able to make it so.
1662.0,1663.0," No, thank you."
1663.0,1666.0, And it isn't just the government that's currently running the country that controls everything
1666.0,1667.0, they say.
1667.0,1671.0, We currently have a division of power within democratic countries.
1671.0,1675.0," For example, the court system is separated from the government, but it's still a government"
1675.0,1677.0, created by the institutions.
1677.0,1679.0, We tell you that this would largely be the same thing with the media.
1679.0,1682.0, It would be able to be held accountable by the states and the rules that have been set
1682.0,1683.0, down for media.
1683.0,1686.8," We tell you that with the rules set down for media, it's expected to be neutral and it's going to be regulated to be held accountable by the states and the rules that have been set down for media, right? We tell you that with the rules set down for media, it's expected to be neutral and it's"
1686.8,1690.36, going to be regulated to be neutral because every single citizen is paying for the state-owned
1690.36,1691.94, media for it to be neutral.
1692.12,1694.04," So in this way, they have to cater to every single citizen."
1694.3,1696.32," So if it does not, the citizen is going to complain."
1696.56,1698.18," In fact, the parliament is going to complain."
1698.4,1700.22, Make sure that it changes and stays neutral.
1700.6,1703.08," But on the other hand, let's look at the comparative stats side, right?"
1703.24,1709.0," If we only have private-owned media, they have no obligation and they have no right, they have no form of conduct to make sure they stay neutral."
1709.0,1714.0," We even tell you that a lot of private owned media, even though they contest this, that's a very unsubstantiated thing, right?"
1714.0,1716.0, A lot of private medias are very open about their rights.
1716.0,1722.0," We tell you about for example the Daily Wire, who are very open about the fact that they are conservative and they want to push this narrative."
1722.0,1727.0," Or for example the Young Turks, who are very open about the fact that they are conservative and they want to push this narrative. Or for example the Young Turks who are very open about the fact that they are very closely tied to social justice."
1727.0,1733.0," We think of the claim for no affecting, for other cases with these privately owned medias, they are very open about their biases."
1733.0,1739.0," But that doesn't mean that we want to abolish them. We still want them to exist, we still want them to be a counter-narrative and a check on the state."
1739.0,1746.0," So in this way that if a state goes towards moving away from democracy, they can starts to criticize the state and we can still have this media."
1746.0,1748.0, We still support free press. We don't want to abolish that.
1748.0,1769.04," Okay. Yes. And now let's move into the second point about how this media will just portray their own social norms and try to prosecute ethnic groups. is able to push a narrative, if the government controls the majority narrative within society, as for example in Pakistan, that a certain group of the population, Iraq, that a certain"
1769.04,1773.14," part of the population should be prosecuted, right? If they're able to do this, and if"
1773.14,1777.38," they're able to prosecute them with their own state, right, that's not another democratic"
1777.38,1780.44," system. That's a system in which the government is able to push their own narrative, right?"
1780.64,1784.5," And even if they didn't have their own media, if the country is so critically caught, no"
1784.5,1789.0," thank you, that they control the narrative, they would probably just bribe the existing private media to push their own narrative."
1789.0,1798.0," We think that because of this, these countries largely fall out of the debate because on either side they can push their own narrative and manipulate their population if that's what they have the power to and they have the incentive to do."
1798.0,1806.0, So they fall out of the debate. They have to focus on true democracy as we have on our side. Okay.
1806.0,1808.0," No, thank you."
1808.0,1812.0, Now they tell you this thing about how the state will always be biased and they will always bring opinions.
1812.0,1817.0," Yeah, sure. We tell you that there are some news pieces, but there will need to be an opinion on it, right?"
1817.0,1819.0," But we tell you that, well, this looks like we state-owned media."
1819.0,1824.0," Since they have an obligation to be neutral, since they are regulated to be neutral, they will probably bring in panelists to talk about these stories."
1824.0,1826.5, They will bring in people with different opinions to talk
1826.5,1830.5," about their opinions on certain cases, right? But on the contrary to private news, you would"
1830.5,1834.5," hear it directly from the horse's mouth, right? The anchor who you trust will tell you, this"
1834.5,1837.5," is the correct thing, this is the right thing. They won't bring in a panel, they'll just"
1837.5,1840.5," tell you directly, no thank you, we are a biased news source and this is what we think"
1840.5,1843.5," about, right? They won't bring in a panel to talk about it. And even if they do, they"
1843.5,1848.9," like to bring in straw men, as for example, Fox News brought in a transgender woman to talk about transgender rights."
1848.9,1852.6," And that transgender woman said that she regretted the operation and thought that no one should go through it, right?"
1852.6,1856.7, We think that they have a bias and they're open for it and they're going to push it.
1856.7,1862.3," On the contrary, state ordinances are mandated to be neutral and there will always be this sort of neutral source to come to."
1862.3,1866.0," And they tell you that, or instead of that, sometimes they'll be first and sometimes they'll"
1866.0,1868.0, be what people rely on for news.
1868.0,1870.0," That's a freaking good thing, right?"
1870.0,1874.0, When we have a statement in news that's neutral and is sure to be neutral and brings objective
1874.0,1878.0," facts and even if they have opinions and they'll say no thank you, it's a pretty good thing"
1878.0,1882.0, that people go to this as a first time person for news because then they know the whole
1882.0,1886.0," story, they're not being given a bias, they're being given an actual true story they can rely on."
1886.0,1889.0, Which brings me perfectly into my third point about the diversity of views.
1889.0,1895.0, How do individuals get information from the governing party to vote out the governing party?
1895.0,1902.0," Because we still have free press, right? If the governing party is going towards being undemocratic and going towards controlling every part of the government"
1902.0,1911.0," and pushing their own narrative, we still have a free and private press who can critique that. And even so, we don't see"
1911.0,1917.0," why the public, why the state-owned news source wouldn't criticize the current government."
1917.0,1920.0, It's not that we should always protect and support the current government. They can also
1920.0,1923.0," criticize the politicians who are currently in power, which will make sure that people"
1923.0,1925.58, can have accountability. We think that that's the amount we know.
1925.82,1928.12," Okay, so let's move into the point about diversity of views."
1928.4,1932.84, So we believe that the state has the incentive to show news that caters to all sorts of different
1932.84,1933.08, groups.
1933.32,1938.56," Like, Brian says, this is because the state-owned news are funded through people's taxes."
1938.86,1944.38," So they have an obligation, and they are responsible to holding news which can supply to everyone."
1944.38,1947.66," This means that they're likely to bring stories that cater to minorities,"
1947.82,1950.22," they are likely to have stories that cater to both the elderly and the youth, right?"
1950.38,1952.48, Huge number of population.
1952.98,1956.66," And that will be within one news source that everyone can go to and see, right?"
1956.86,1958.04, And why is this largely a good thing?
1958.28,1960.92, This means that instead of having to go to your own English-language bubble
1960.92,1962.48," in order to see something that represents you,"
1962.48,1967.0, the state-owned news source will always be able to cater towards you. So you will always be able to
1967.0,1973.0, look for it through credible information. This creates a sort of ground zero for information
1973.0,1976.0," within society, right? Because people can always look towards this. People can always"
1976.0,1980.0, look towards something that is fairly mutual and sort of caters to everyone. This means
1980.0,1984.0, that we kind of have this sort of post-facts society in which people are saying facts don't
1984.0,1988.0, really matter because all sorts of news media always want to push their own agenda.
1988.0,1992.0," But we have something that is truly neutral, that brings the whole story, that brings the facts."
1992.0,1998.0," People have always been able to hold all other news sources accountable by having the true neutralizer, which is the same old media."
1998.0,2008.0," So because we want to democratize news, not politicize news, we are very proud to stand outside of it."
2012.0,2019.0," The government that they are trusting to be your primary source of information, is the same government that wanted to imprison Julian Assange when he talked against the government,"
2019.0,2023.0, when he revealed the injustices that the government was carrying out.
2023.0,2028.0, It's also the same government that Edward Snowden had to flee from because he revealed
2028.0,2031.0, that it was spying on you unfairly.
2031.0,2035.0," It is the same government, ladies and gentlemen, that imprisoned Chelsea Manning because of"
2035.0,2039.0, the information and injustice he revealed about the Iraq war.
2039.0,2044.0, This is the government they are trusting to be your primary source of information.
2044.0,2045.54, Is that something that
2045.54,2050.3," you are okay with? Their government is the government in which Trump, who shouts fake"
2050.3,2055.68," news at every single person, now has complete control of the narrative, ladies and gentlemen."
2056.54,2061.32, Is that a government you trust? Is that a source of information you trust? We don't
2061.32,2068.68," think so, ladies and gentlemen. But before we move on to the issues, a couple of things. First of all, they keep saying that private media organizations are very,"
2068.82,2073.4," very bad. They politicize, not democratize, ladies and gentlemen. Yet, for some reason,"
2073.68,2077.46," they exist in their model. And not only do they exist in their model, they are trusting"
2077.46,2082.46, these same bad private organizations to be your primary source of counter-directive against
2082.98,2085.24, the government. How is that possible?
2088.92,2095.36," But secondly, ladies and gentlemen, when they say that you need these private organizations to exist as a counter-narrative, they concede that the government is not a trustworthy source"
2095.36,2100.5, of information because you clearly need a counter-narrative in place. That's inconsistent
2100.5,2106.04," with everything that they've been saying. But thirdly, their case literally regresses on the assumption that"
2106.04,2108.24, state-owned media will be neutral.
2108.56,2110.14," So if we break down this assumption,"
2110.52,2111.78, their case is gone.
2112.0,2114.04, And we have won this debate. But before
2114.04,2115.64," they move on to doing just that,"
2115.86,2117.88," a couple more things, right? First of all,"
2117.92,2120.12, they have not ever once in this debate engaged
2120.12,2122.12," with our best-case scenario, places"
2122.12,2123.98," like Singapore, where largely"
2123.98,2129.0," your media sources are just state-run and private counter narratives,"
2129.0,2132.0," something that we're both for and against, does not exist, ladies and gentlemen."
2132.0,2134.0, But we think that's a huge harm.
2134.0,2140.0," Secondly, we think that they haven't refuted the idea that, in fact, by not engaging with it,"
2140.0,2145.0," can see into it that their government, even where a society where counter narratives exist,"
2145.0,2150.0," is your primary and first source of information, which means that that narrative that they push"
2150.0,2155.0," is the one that is most widely bought because it's the first thing you hear and intuitively agree with,"
2155.0,2160.0," ladies and gentlemen. But thirdly, they have not once engaged with the southern plan of argument"
2160.0,2165.7," about journalistic integrity, ladies and gentlemen, and how important that is and how the state"
2165.7,2166.88, takes away from that.
2167.1,2171.3," We think that is a huge independent harm on its own that we can win this debate on, and"
2171.3,2175.16," third, opposition is way too late to deal with all of this, right?"
2175.36,2179.62," So having shown people that we've clearly already taken this away, let's move on to"
2179.62,2180.7, the three issues in the debate.
2180.98,2185.16," First of all, on a principle level, does the state have the right to be"
2185.16,2189.14, able to manipulate your vote regardless of whether they are successful in doing so? We
2189.14,2195.32," think absolutely not. Secondly, where is the media more independent? Is it in a world where"
2195.32,2200.36, literally the governing party gets to tell you what you want to know and what you should
2200.36,2207.1," be thinking of and what your values should be. Thirdly, where is the greater access"
2207.1,2212.16," of information? And over here, I'll be dealing with their idea about how the state has greater"
2212.16,2217.16," incentive to spread out information and facilitate the right information. Well, that's more than"
2217.16,2220.64," the first principle issue, right? And you can understand in the context of this debate,"
2220.9,2226.18, this is an extremely important issue. Because a democracy is only a democracy
2226.18,2228.76," if it lives up to its principles, ladies and gentlemen."
2228.76,2231.78," If it contradicts those, it's not a democracy, right?"
2231.78,2234.7, So let's talk to you about how they're doing exactly that.
2234.7,2236.38, They have a bunch of premises over here.
2236.38,2238.42," They said first of all, the state has to facilitate"
2238.42,2240.46," your right to information, and it's kind of like"
2240.46,2243.2," a public service, and over here the analogy they made"
2243.2,2244.76," was a bus, ladies and gentlemen."
2244.76,2267.0," We think a bus or any transport system or health care system is not the same thing. We think you can't use a bus to influence your vote. You can't use a bus to tell you that this same party that has been in power for 60 years should continue being in power for the next 60 years, ladies and gentlemen. Believe me, the Pakistani government has tried. But secondly, even if the state has to facilitate this right of immigration,"
2267.0,2274.0, we think that they never once proved to us that this provision must be direct. They never once gave us that essential thing.
2274.0,2280.0," We don't think this provision has to be direct, especially when indirect provision through private corporations"
2280.0,2288.0," facilitates this right much much better, ladies and gentlemen. But the second idea they had over here, this analogy with the government curriculum,"
2288.0,2294.0," and somehow, for some absurd reason, they think that the state controlling your history books is a good thing."
2294.0,2297.0, You know what the Pakistani state mandated history book tells us?
2297.0,2303.0," It tells us that the genocide we carried out against Bangladesh does not exist, ladies and gentlemen."
2303.0,2305.0, It underplays its own heart.
2305.24,2307.82," It underplays all the injustices carried out,"
2308.06,2310.92," not just against other people, but against its own citizens."
2311.2,2313.54," Its enmity population, its Shia population,"
2313.7,2315.36," its Christian population, ladies and gentlemen,"
2315.56,2316.62, all of these things.
2316.82,2320.1, So we don't understand why this is a good thing in any scenario.
2320.5,2322.18, But the third thing they talked about over here
2322.18,2323.62, was the separation of powers.
2323.78,2325.0, I will give you a the definition of this issue.
2325.0,2330.0, And they never once explained to us how this separation of powers better happened in their world.
2330.0,2334.0, This principle premise appears as entirely contingent on whether or not the separation
2334.0,2338.0," of powers is actually effective, so I'll deal with that in the second issue, but before that, short."
2338.0,2343.0," If a country is so corrupt that one political party is able to run the entire narrative of that country,"
2343.0,2345.48, can't they just thrive on news media on yours at the house?
2345.64,2348.12," The point is, where will the government not be corrupt?"
2348.48,2350.12, In a world where the government controls
2350.12,2352.24," your information, or in a world where someone else"
2352.24,2354.14, is keeping an independent check on
2354.14,2356.06," their information, which is what I'm going to talk about"
2356.06,2358.0," in this issue, right? Over here,"
2358.08,2359.96," they said, oh look, the BTC is a"
2359.96,2361.88," neutral example, but they let their own second speaker"
2361.88,2364.04, drop later on. But let's take them at their
2364.04,2368.26," best and say that BTC is this big big shiny example that they're running with, right?"
2368.98,2370.56, That's completely untrue.
2370.74,2374.62," When Brexit was happening, because David Cameron was anti-Brexit,"
2375.06,2380.46, the BBC literally released a slew of news that was severely anti-Brexit later on.
2380.62,2381.58, It's not true.
2381.58,2385.9," But secondly, over here with this example, they're not taking our context into account."
2386.18,2388.12," Because the developing world, where you have"
2388.12,2389.7, the democracies that need to be made
2389.7,2391.98," more accountable, is a huge, huge"
2391.98,2394.2, part of this debate that they're
2394.2,2396.1, not taking down. The second thing they talked
2396.1,2397.92," about is, oh, politicians are very"
2397.92,2400.16," sensitive to criticize the media. First of all,"
2400.2,2401.52, let's look at who these politicians are.
2401.76,2403.72," If they're part of the governing party,"
2403.72,2408.22," ladies and gentlemen, then they have absolutely no incentive to criticize the media that is putting"
2408.22,2415.24," them in a good light, right? But secondly, if these politicians are not in the ruling"
2415.24,2420.38," party, we think that their voices are literally going to be drowned out by state narratives"
2420.38,2426.0," because as you have conceded, state narratives are clearly much stronger, which is why you"
2426.0,2430.0," said that you need a corporate narrative against them, right? So, a court decision from anyone"
2430.0,2434.0," else literally does not count, because you conceded that this is the first source of"
2434.0,2438.0," information. But thirdly, they said that, oh, you know what, private media also has"
2438.0,2443.0," biases. The difference is the intention, ladies and gentlemen. Private media does not have"
2443.0,2447.0, an ideological stance because it wants to indoctrinate you.
2447.0,2452.0, It has an ideological stance because it's trying to cater to a sexual consumer base that already exists.
2452.0,2457.0," Governments tell you things because they are trying to create a consumer base that is in their favour,"
2457.0,2463.0," ladies and gentlemen. They recognize manufacturing consent is not okay. But they lastly said,"
2463.0,2488.26," oh wait wait, the state will still bribe you in our world. We think, okay, when is it easier though? In this world where the state doesn't have to do something illegal to pass on propaganda or where they have to do something illegal to pass on propaganda and thus can be held accountable for it. Clearly this word. Last issue of access, where they didn't have a lot of analysis, they should have just said that private corporations have a profit incentive so private prices will be high. We think it's the opposite because"
2488.26,2492.32," they have a profit incentive, they make sure it's accessible to the most amount of people"
2492.32,2497.9," which means prices will be definitely lower in our world, ladies and gentlemen. But secondly,"
2498.08,2502.16," even if there's greater access in their world, that access is useless because it's literally"
2502.16,2505.54, propaganda. We don't want access like that. That's the point.
2506.14,2508.14, Vote for a free world. Vote for Pakistan.
2511.74,2517.94, Team Proposition lives in a dystopic world in which democracies apparently oppress every
2517.94,2523.3," single minority, never redeem power ever, imprison all their opponents, and censor the media."
2523.72,2527.34," Ladies and gentlemen, the cases that they're talking about are largely completely irrelevant"
2527.34,2531.34," to this debate, given that they're not democracies, given that these are states that could probably"
2531.34,2535.6," just bribe the media or, like, threaten to close them if they didn't adhere to their"
2535.6,2536.98," kind of merit, right?"
2537.2,2540.98," We think that most, the bulk of the case that they bring to you is not relevant to this"
2540.98,2545.0," debate, insofar as the harms that they tell you about largely"
2545.0,2546.0, do not apply.
2546.0,2550.0," Panel, information is a cornerstone on democracy, and both sides agree with that."
2550.0,2554.0," Unfortunately, Team Proposition fails to engage with the comparative of whether it's better"
2554.0,2558.0," to have state and private, or only private, that only have their own market incentives"
2558.0,2562.0," to cater to, that do not have the interests of the public in mind, who are proud to oppose"
2562.0,2563.0, this motion.
2563.0,2566.0," Before I get into my two themes about democracy and the quality of news,"
2566.0,2568.0," firstly, I'll just deal with our burden."
2568.0,2572.0," Because they tell us, oh, it's so contradictory that we just want also to have private news."
2572.0,2577.0," No, we don't think it is. We think it's perfectly legitimate for us to say that we want both, right?"
2577.0,2582.0," Why is that? That's because these two types of media have different kinds of values and functions in society, right?"
2582.0,2588.32," We think that the government, media, in the majority of cases will be the most neutral, oftentimes be the better one,"
2588.62,2593.46, but we recognize that states can make mistakes. We recognize that news are never perfectly
2593.46,2597.56," objective, hence it's good to have several perspectives on this. We just think that the"
2597.56,2602.76, state should be one of multiple providers. That's not a contradiction for us to say we
2602.76,2605.12, support free media and state media
2605.12,2612.14," at once. Okay, first theme about democracy. So the entirety of Team Pakistan's case is"
2612.14,2616.08," based on these ideas that states always try to push their own narrative, always try to"
2616.08,2620.44," say in government, are super corrupt and horrible, and have no free media, right? Okay, first"
2620.44,2627.46," of all, this narrative does not apply to this debate. If you are such a horrible state, you could probably just thrive off threatening the media"
2627.46,2630.86," like we don't think free media, private media on their side, is much better, right?"
2631.08,2633.92," Okay, but let's not actually deal with what this debate is really about."
2634.16,2636.62," Okay, let's deal with actually democratic countries, right?"
2636.76,2639.28," We don't see that this is actually a problem in the status quo,"
2639.5,2642.4, where the news media is supervised based on the government.
2642.4,2645.56, We don't see that BBC changes its partisan approach
2645.56,2648.52, every four years based on whether Labour or Conservative
2648.52,2649.48," are in power, right?"
2649.48,2652.16," No, they criticize the government for what they do."
2652.16,2654.12, We have journalists who are committed
2654.12,2655.84, to what's actually criticizing the state
2655.84,2657.38, and looking at what actually happens.
2657.38,2658.88, We don't think they point to a problem
2658.88,2661.14," that really exists in its status quo whatsoever, right?"
2661.14,2662.76," Okay, but let's then take them on their best"
2662.76,2663.94," and take them to this critical,"
2663.94,2667.2," it's just really, really important that the mere fact that they have the ability to do so"
2667.2,2671.44," is so formal. Okay, first of all, we think this is very logical at the point where we can never"
2671.44,2675.68," entrust the state with anything whatsoever if that's the case, right? Like, do they just want"
2675.68,2679.28, the government to never say any information to the public? Do they just want the government to
2679.28,2682.88," never, like, make schools, never write public services because they'll always just use it as"
2682.88,2685.0, an avenue to indoctrinate and assistance.
2685.0,2691.0," No. Mary has told you how there's already a division of government, for example, the government is like funding the police, funding the judicial system."
2691.0,2698.0," In these instances, we already trust that these entities are separate enough that the state can fund them and have influence over them,"
2698.0,2704.0," without that it means that there cannot be a mutual interdependency, a mutual accountability here, right?"
2704.0,2707.44," But then secondly, we think the government essentially represents the population."
2707.74,2709.6, The government is an extension of the population.
2709.98,2713.14, That means that citizens are not satisfied with this news media.
2713.36,2714.4, They cannot out the government.
2714.8,2719.24," We think the comparative on their side is false, right?"
2719.28,2722.28, We don't see why private corporations have less vested interests.
2722.5,2724.32, They have their own partisan opinions.
2724.7,2725.04, They don't
2725.04,2729.04, have to cater to what the American people thinks. We think the government has a duty to represent
2729.04,2733.84," the population, whereas companies do not. But finally, we think it's acceptable that there is"
2733.84,2738.16," like a tiny, tiny risk that the state will abuse its power in such and insane degree at the point"
2738.16,2742.48, when we have accountability measures. That's what all of our trusted government is based upon. I'll
2742.48,2745.2, deal with these accountability measures later.
2747.68,2748.0," But let's finally just see, even in the best-case scenario,"
2749.96,2750.26," we think Singapore is such a horrible democracy,"
2753.04,2753.16," where the government never, ever is changed."
2755.78,2756.08," We think at least on our side of the house, we have multiple sources."
2759.28,2759.46," Even if the state media is bad, we still have other private sources,"
2760.5,2760.82, so we don't think that's a problem.
2762.92,2763.04," Oh, but then they say, oh, the state always has a monopoly."
2764.26,2765.86," People will only trust this news. Well, that's not true. Like, people"
2765.86,2767.74, are interested in different types of news.
2767.9,2769.8," If people have a different opinion than the government media,"
2770.02,2771.98," they will go to another media, and that's"
2771.98,2774.04," fine, right? But secondly, like, we don't"
2774.04,2775.68, think it's so bad if people look to this media.
2775.84,2777.5," If we can prove that in the majority of cases,"
2777.82,2779.48, it will be the best one.
2779.78,2781.98," Then finally, we have this point about tyranny of the majority"
2781.98,2783.9," and the minority can be really, really demonized."
2784.08,2791.0," We think that's even more so the case with private news media, because they don't have an incentive to appeal to minority groups, right? They have an incentive to appeal to the majority."
2791.0,2805.0," As they themselves have seen. No, thank you. Let's deal with our principle. We talk about how in fact it's extremely, extremely important that the government provides information to its citizens, and provides access to this information. We think that it's extremely expensive to create really, really good news."
2805.0,2811.0," That's why News Socials, such as The Economist, is not free, right? That's because good journalism is very expensive."
2811.0,2817.0," We think only with taxpayer money can we ensure that we don't just raise prices, but simultaneously provide good journalism."
2817.0,2823.0," We want quality and accessibility to everyone, and we don't think that private organizations can ever provide that."
2823.0,2827.24, Even private organizations could. We can only be ensured that this can happen
2827.24,2831.0," once the government actually says, we take this burden upon us, we will provide you with"
2831.0,2832.0, information.
2832.0,2833.0, We think that's the duty of the government.
2833.0,2837.76," Finally, about journalistic integrity, very relevant point, no journalists are still independent"
2837.76,2838.76, even though they work for the government.
2838.76,2842.0," Like, if they don't think they are, they can just choose to work somewhere else."
2842.0,2843.0, Really not relevant.
2843.0,2846.0," But finally, private organizations also have bipartisan agreements."
2846.0,2850.0," If you work for Fox News, you can't just have a super liberal agenda, then you'll also be fired."
2850.0,2851.0," Point, not relevant."
2851.0,2858.0," Okay, so at the end of this theme, we think it's crucial to recognize that state media is actually crucial to fulfill the purpose of democracy,"
2858.0,2865.0, not to make sure that the purpose of democracy is the only way we can ensure information that allows people to make proper decisions.
2865.0,2869.0," Secondly, let's talk about equality of views. Quite related, right? We think largely all"
2869.0,2874.0," of our practical implications are what we responded to from Team Pakistan. Yes, we recognize"
2874.0,2878.0, that public news sources are not perfect. They will sometimes make mistakes. They will
2878.0,2882.0," not always be completely unbiased, but at least we gave you structural reasons why they're"
2882.0,2888.0," better on our side than ours. Why is that? Firstly, we told you several accountability mechanisms that they just ignore, right?"
2888.0,2893.0," We told you about how, like, even though it is a government institution, it is an independent branch,"
2893.0,2895.0, and journalists abide by some kind of code of conduct.
2895.0,2899.0, Journalists usually are extremely committed to their job and to exposing the state.
2899.0,2902.0," If they don't do that, they'll probably be fired, right?"
2902.0,2906.0," No, thank you. But secondly, there's also other parties in government that can say, hey, like, we"
2906.0,2908.04, feel really unfairly treated. We don't think
2908.04,2909.9, this is right. Just like we see debates
2909.9,2911.94, within Parliament about policies. We see
2911.94,2914.06, citizens can complain. We think that if
2914.06,2916.06," these news media are so horrible, like, state"
2916.06,2917.98," funding will probably be withdrawn from them, because"
2917.98,2919.86," no one's enforced them. Hence, they have an incentive"
2919.86,2921.92, to maintain support from the public and from
2921.92,2923.82, the entire Parliament. Makes no sense.
2924.06,2929.0," Okay, then we also told you about how private, like public organizations, have staple funding."
2929.0,2930.0," That's really important, right?"
2930.0,2936.0," Because on their side, you always have to make sure that you survive based on money mechanisms."
2936.0,2938.0, You always have to make sure that you have customers.
2938.0,2942.0," That's important because that means you're more likely to appeal to entertainment, to sensationalism,"
2942.0,2944.0," because that's the way you attract viewers, right?"
2944.0,2949.0, State media has no incentive to do so at the point where they always have tax money.
2949.0,2953.4," They can always prioritize the most important stories, even if it's expensive to cover them."
2953.4,2957.6," They cannot do that on their side of the house, because you always have to balance questions and make sure."
2957.6,2960.6," But then, this is the old, the private has an incentive to be centric."
2960.6,2963.8," Well, first of all, not always. We don't think Fox News is particularly centric, right?"
2963.8,2968.02," Like, they often have an incentive to appeal to a specific group in society. But even if they are,"
2968.16,2971.94," that doesn't deal with the point of how they have an incentive to be, like, entertaining. So even if"
2971.94,2975.6," they have, like, a panel debate, for example, they're probably more likely to choose the really, like,"
2975.76,2980.14," extreme anti-life, uh, oh, sorry, pro-life advocate instead of the moderate one"
2980.14,2983.92," because that provides more viewers. That provides a really intense debate, right?"
2983.92,2989.0," We think it's a problem on their side that private news media are going to be sensationalists,"
2989.0,2991.0," are going to prioritize their long stories,"
2991.0,2994.0," because there's no public accountability as to how they do things, right?"
2994.0,3000.0," At the end of the day, dear panel, we have to ensure that everyone has access to proper information in a democracy."
3000.0,3009.0," We want democratized news, not politicized news. Proud to oppose."
3017.0,3027.38," Dear panel, neutral news is nearly impossible to reach. Actors in societies will always have their own incentives. That is why we need the coexistence of both state-run and private media. Instead of talking about the dystopian states that would indoctrinate their citizens,"
3027.76,3030.4," Team Proposition needed to defend their world,"
3030.4,3035.58, a world in which you only have privately owned companies and the incentives that they have.
3035.88,3039.36, We gave you coexistence and I'm very proud to have taken today's stage.
3039.82,3042.6," First off, what do we think Team Proposition needed to do?"
3042.92,3048.0," They needed to not base their case in this world of oppressive states, but talk to us"
3048.0,3051.0, about why private companies could bear this burden.
3051.0,3054.0, We have the democratized news and not the militarized.
3054.0,3060.0," We think in this debate, both sides wanted to achieve an informative, diverse, neutral"
3060.0,3062.0, and accurate set of news.
3062.0,3065.18," What were the reasons why we actually, like, why we actually would decide"
3065.18,3069.58," to provide that? Now, we think first off, we told you two different things, two parties"
3069.58,3076.12," that decided to focus on really one of them. So first off, we tell you that states are"
3076.12,3080.44, held accountable because of the framework that they insist on. Every single thing that
3080.44,3088.98," a state touches is something that they have to be accountable for because they either lose a vote, right? That is why parties speak out on what other parties do."
3089.18,3094.48," You have ombudsmen that, like, criticize what the state does. These are comparative with"
3094.48,3099.06," things that just didn't exist in the world, right? So even if you buy, to some extent,"
3099.38,3103.82," states are, like, a bit indoctrinating, right? You didn't think that that was, like, there"
3103.82,3106.46, was any reason why that didn't happen on their side. Why was that?
3106.66,3108.44, That was because private companies
3108.44,3110.44, always have the incentive of
3110.44,3112.36, reaching profits for
3112.36,3114.4," different reasons, right? First off, sometimes"
3114.4,3116.22, they were simply just controlled by
3116.22,3118.44," corporations, forcing them"
3118.44,3120.5, to put NRA advertisements in
3120.5,3122.48," every other minute, right? But also"
3122.48,3124.44, they were funded to the extent that
3124.44,3126.44, they would prioritize sensationalism.
3126.56,3128.76, They would prioritize not having fair panels
3128.76,3130.46, that discuss topics in a fair way.
3130.82,3133.72," Secondly, we talked to you about how we provide you access"
3133.72,3135.08," to actually voting, right?"
3135.28,3136.36, We think that that was important
3136.36,3137.96, because states need to make sure
3137.96,3140.0, that every single citizen is in a position
3140.0,3141.08," of being able to vote,"
3141.3,3143.58," and in a sense, it actually affects them in the end."
3143.9,3145.12," On their side, media"
3145.12,3149.14," costs money, right? You have to have the efficient money to buy them. You have the efficient"
3149.14,3154.02," money to be informed. In a democracy, the state actually neglects this rule, as to which"
3154.02,3157.78," they don't have the money to be informed, right? What were the responses that Sunil"
3157.78,3162.24," Pakistan gave here? First off, he told them, on a purely theological basis, if the state"
3162.24,3168.0," has an ability to coerce you, the ability to misportray some information, the state shouldn't be able to do that."
3168.0,3175.0," I think that was really not specific to the motion, to the extent that now the state shouldn't be able to give you any information,"
3175.0,3180.0," they shouldn't be able to inform you of anything, because it might be coercive in that sense."
3180.0,3188.8," Also, they tell you, why do you want this coerc course of media because you think it's so wrong that was not an answer to the extent we think they actually conceded to these media people"
3188.8,3194.08, like the private media is being wrong but also we supported the coexistence in their world other
3194.08,3199.6, media can call out these media right we think we have that on our side in the worst case scenario
3199.6,3204.72, right which were the terrible governments that like would go out coerce their citizens to support
3204.72,3205.0," them on things shut down journalists this was a world that just wasn't relevant within today's These were the terrible governments that would go out, coerce their citizens to support them"
3205.0,3207.0," on things, shut down journalists."
3207.0,3210.0," This was a world that just wasn't relevant within today's debate, right?"
3210.0,3215.0," Because these were the governments who would also coerce private news organizations, who"
3215.0,3219.0," would also go out and chase the whole political picture, who think that insofar as we provided"
3219.0,3224.0," with the access, the best information for everyone within society, it was good news"
3224.0,3225.0, for today within society. It was good we took face to face.
3225.0,3232.0," In the end, a world of private media is a world for only those who have the money to afford to get information,"
3232.0,3236.0," those who are lucky enough to be informed, to know what they go out and look for, right?"
3236.0,3242.0," Which is not the poor, not the minorities, but also, it was the ones who would not fall"
3242.0,3246.5, full betrayed to the coercive media we think that private entities are.
3246.5,3251.5," Because we have democratized news, not the politicized. We're very proud of the citizens of the United States."
3257.5,3265.18," Opposition constantly accuses us of arguing in a dystopian world where we're not arguing actual democracies. The United States of America,"
3265.38,3271.3," the shining example of the best democracy within the world, is what we also contextualize"
3271.3,3275.46," as we give you examples of how they turn against their people, they actively monitor their"
3275.46,3280.72," people and shrink their privacy. We talked to you about the United Kingdom, where the"
3280.72,3285.5, BBC ran a lot of anti-Brexit news in the recent election campaign and was
3285.5,3289.06," sponsorily accused of that. We gave you the example of Singapore, one of the"
3289.06,3294.62," large country where democracy does work. But apart from that, that's not what this"
3294.62,3298.0, debate was about. Because we feel like what they're trying to argue that these
3298.0,3302.08, democracies are weak so they aren't a part of this debate. What we were trying to argue was that they're
3302.08,3308.36," weak because of state-run media and it's about in which world they would be less corrupt, less weak."
3308.66,3310.06, That's the actual comparative.
3310.18,3313.36," That's what we've been constantly running throughout this debate, something they don't"
3313.36,3313.9, understand.
3314.12,3318.2," So just because they don't understand the real world, that doesn't mean that our case"
3318.2,3319.14, doesn't stand.
3319.52,3323.74," But apart from that, when it comes to burdens, understand that they accept the burden we"
3323.74,3324.14, took on.
3324.32,3329.2, They didn't challenge it when we told you it's just our burden to prove on a principal level
3329.2,3334.64, our state shouldn't have the ability to go for this measure that's the first issue they conceded
3334.64,3338.76, to this so if we win this we win this debate so let's do that our claim was that the government
3338.76,3343.82, shouldn't be able to indoctrinate people in order to maintain its own power they keep saying talking
3343.82,3349.18," about things like police and the bus but that's not indoctrination, that's just policy. If I'm giving a healthcare"
3349.18,3353.3," scheme, I'm not telling someone that you have to, I'm not indoctrinating that individual"
3353.3,3357.88, to cast a certain kind of vote or limiting his information. We think that's something
3357.88,3361.48, they didn't understand. But even in the cases of other kinds of indoctrination that government
3361.48,3367.64," does, like education, they completely ignored our response about how the government is very biased in doing that and that's something"
3367.64,3371.94," that we strongly oppose, how the Pakistani government does indoctrinate people into forgetting"
3371.94,3377.06," about genocides, that's something we're not okay with. There was no response to this whatsoever"
3377.06,3381.28, and apart from that we also talked to you about this idea regarding how politicians
3381.28,3386.04, shouldn't be allowed to fund their campaigns with taxpayer money.
3386.3,3390.12," Now, I was never once engaged with this, and well, that's different, that already happens."
3390.4,3394.44, We think that a principal analogy still stands within this debate.
3394.84,3399.12," But apart from that, they're like, well, the government has a duty to provide a free good."
3399.52,3402.36," Here, when we talk to you about how the prices are generally lower,"
3402.36,3408.16," even when it comes to articles like The Economist, but they're arguing a very small minority. The majority of news like"
3408.16,3413.5," Fox News and CNN are all free, right? Even though they are owned by private corporations"
3413.5,3416.84," through things like advertisement deals, something they themselves talked about. So"
3416.84,3421.32," on a principle level, we think you shouldn't put this tool in the hands of the government."
3421.32,3427.0," It's not their job. But secondly, when it comes to better political and social outcomes"
3427.0,3433.0, over here they said well people can always hold the government accountable and bias doesn't exist because of accountability mechanisms
3433.0,3439.0, like politicians and citizens saying that well this is bias or that this is our narrative
3439.0,3449.36, here is where we told you politicians voices are drowned out within this overwhelming narrative But on a second level that citizens don't get the conscious to say that well
3449.36,3453.38, This is wrong because they have themselves have been trapped and indoctrinated by this
3453.38,3456.68, That's where they concede that it is the primary source of information
3457.02,3461.72, Which is why people are more likely to believe it because it gets their spin on it
3461.72,3467.7, That's where they concede to the very fact that people don't have the capacity to vote out a government
3467.7,3473.5, for being bad or for it even being a problem when they don't know a problem exists.
3473.5,3475.5, That's something they don't really refute.
3475.5,3479.0, And we've given you examples of Singapore about how that's produced bad political outcomes.
3479.0,3482.0, And we're here where there's like where journalists have a code of conduct.
3482.0,3484.5," We already refuted that within my positive case,"
3484.5,3487.52, but how these journalists are actively pushed out and told not to follow
3487.52,3489.06," that, so we don't see what they're on about."
3489.34,3494.08," When it comes to social outcomes, we think that they don't really deal with that either"
3494.08,3497.88," because their only reputation to things like my-my was, it's not a part of this debate,"
3498.1,3499.94, I don't think it should have been the start that it was.
3500.26,3504.26," And lastly, it's the fact that they're being principally inconsistent and not fulfilling"
3504.26,3505.24, their own burden
3505.24,3510.24," to only have, for example, private companies, because while to not have private companies"
3510.24,3514.06," at all, the whole of the state is so great, they should only allow that market."
3514.44,3516.92, We feel that this debate deserves to go to Pakistan.
