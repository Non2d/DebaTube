0.0,22.0," To us, Silicon Valley's new baby might seem as a thrilling and provocative new technology."
22.0,26.0, But what about the people from Yemen? What about the people from Syria?
26.0,28.0, What about the people from Iraq?
28.0,30.0," To them, it will be a catastrophe."
30.0,32.0, And this debate isn't about how these autonomous weapons
32.0,34.0," would work in the perfect world,"
34.0,36.0, but rather how our world
36.0,38.0, and how the international community
38.0,40.0, would react to them.
40.0,42.0, And given the systematic ways in which violations
42.0,44.0, against human rights take place
44.0,45.0, and the role of the
45.0,50.0," international community, we stand for a blanket ban, as the one given to chemical weapons"
50.0,55.0," and for the same reason. So, in my speech, first I'm going to give definitions, then"
55.0,59.0," I'm going to give my first argument, which is about lowering the barriers of entry, and"
59.0,63.0," then I'm going to give my second argument, which is about the harms and problems."
63.0,68.0," So, lethal autonomous weapons are machines meant to kill that operate without human intervention"
68.0,73.0," and solely based on algorithms. By development we mean the investigation, the evolution or"
73.0,76.0, the pumping of the weapon or the algorithm.
76.0,81.0," So the first argument, lowering the barriers of entry. First I'm going to explain how they"
81.0,86.0," do that and then the impacts given the status quo war. So, how do they do it?"
86.0,90.0," Well, there is one massive characteristic which is public retaliation."
90.0,92.5, Why do voters care about war?
92.5,100.0," Well, they don't want to see their people dying, so they are moved by the US soldiers in the streets of Saigon dying."
100.0,106.0, But they do not care because the distance from them to a terrible country prevents them from that.
106.0,110.0, Circles of moral caring only encompass those who are close.
110.0,113.0, And what are the effects of the lethal autonomous weapons?
113.0,120.0," Well, public retaliation in democracies is and has been the only factor capable of stopping humanitarian interventions"
120.0,124.0, such as the one in Vietnam and Iraq in which opposition led to retreat the soldiers.
124.0,127.5," But now, voters won't feel the effects of war."
127.78,131.34," Therefore, A, they won't push against reckless engagements in war,"
131.64,136.24," and B, there will be higher chances that they will vote for presidents who are pro-war."
136.82,138.08, And why is this crucial?
138.4,140.4," Well, this is crucial because of our status quo."
141.02,143.52, Think about the war in Iraq and all its horrors.
143.52,144.82, Who won that war?
148.0,158.0, The only two winners were the CEOs of the Halliburton Company. So we have to recognize two things. The first one is that most wars occur for bad motives and even those who don't have horrifying effects because of their nature.
158.0,165.42," So why are most wars for bad motives? Well, for three things. The first one is special interest, such as"
165.42,171.5," the bias of ideology. The second one is business and corporate interest, which have a huge"
171.5,178.36," grip in decision-making, thanks to tools such as campaign contribution, as the main donor"
178.36,182.42," to Joe mentioned, and revolving doors. And we can see that in characters such as Dick"
182.42,188.0," Chang, who was the manager of Hollywood and also the vice president during the Bush era."
188.0,193.0," And lastly, we also have geopolitical interests, which means that the lack of interest in defending"
193.0,197.0," human rights, and we can see that, for example, Saudi Arabia, thanks to its close relationship"
197.0,204.0," with the US, was forgiven by its human rights by election ratio, but Libya did have to pay"
204.0,205.52, for what they did.
211.88,212.74," So, even if they are for good reasons, wars will most likely be catastrophic, and because of two things."
212.98,216.8," The first one is that they destroy communities, because they kill civilians, for example,"
216.94,218.6, when urban zones are bombed.
218.92,223.06," But second, they also destroy the country, because of A, infrastructure."
223.36,226.54, We can see that when bridges and roads are bombed
226.54,228.2," and it crashes the economy,"
228.2,230.46, and also because of the vacuum of power.
230.46,232.48, And we can see that in our major media
232.48,235.26, because of the fragmentation and impossibilitation
235.26,237.68, of the reconstruction after the conflict.
237.68,239.6," So in conclusion to the first argument,"
239.6,241.36, we're going to have more wars
241.36,244.06," and since more are catastrophic events,"
244.06,248.0, proposing development is advocating for human rights violations.
248.0,256.0," So, moving on to my second argument, which is about the danger of robots. To the fact that there will be more wars, we have to add the damage of robots themselves."
256.0,267.06," So first I'm going to talk about the dirty mental characteristics, and second, I'm going to draw an important comparative with soldiers. There are two new factors that we are going to have to add to the line of mission"
267.06,269.58, once legal autonomies are introduced.
269.74,271.3," But first, I will take your point."
271.68,273.18," Well, of course it comes with consequences."
273.38,277.02," Why is it that even with the existing law, the war is more likely to occur?"
277.84,279.76," I'm sorry, but I didn't understand your point."
279.76,280.72," Well, of course it comes."
280.72,281.34," It's okay, it's okay."
281.6,286.0," So, the first thing that we are going to have to add is the execution of missions."
286.0,291.0, Sending people off means that you have to take a series of precautions as the government or the soldiers.
291.0,297.0," So, because common sense dictates that you have to get along with the native community so that they can define your state,"
297.0,301.0," soldiers tend to have a good relationship with the natives, such as giving them protection or food,"
301.0,306.16," and governments sometimes use structures, such as as water wells for the Afghan people."
306.16,310.26," So now with the autonomous weapons, there is not going to be any need to care about"
310.26,311.9, the backlash of the actions.
311.9,317.3, So rich Western countries will have zero motives to care for civilians going to war.
317.3,321.0," And then we have the second thing, which is contextual judgment."
321.0,325.3, The decision to kill is a balance between the moral and human element and cannot
325.3,329.94, be coded into an algorithm. So now we're going to lack it. We're going to lack things such
329.94,334.82," as empathy, which is the capacity to relate to another human, and that cannot be understood"
334.82,339.32, by machines. And the effect of this can be seen through the next comparison. That is
339.32,347.0," when soldiers kill, certain nuances are valued through moral intuition and cannot be valued through magicians."
347.0,359.0," So, the relevance? Every war is filled with such nuances that require the human aspect, and it is logistically impossible to wire them into the machines."
359.0,366.0," So, I ask, how could a robot judge a child forced to engage in war and carry a weapon?"
366.0,367.0, Yes?
367.0,370.0," There will always be an operator, even if the operator is not intervening."
370.0,373.0, This is seen as an allowance by the operator itself.
373.0,376.0, Why is it that it is immoral to do this?
376.0,379.0," I'm sorry, I really didn't understand your point."
379.0,386.0," So, how could a robot judge a child that is forced to engage in war and carry a weapon?"
386.0,392.0, And how is a woman forced? How can they judge a woman forced by terrorists to hide weapons?
392.0,397.0, And how are they supposed to know the difference between bombing a hospital and another building?
397.0,400.0, There is a moral difference that only humans can understand.
401.0,404.0, And here is where we have to draw a very important comparative.
404.0,410.0," Of course, it could be argued that these autonomous weapons won't have a racist bias,"
410.0,419.0, but they are in fact discriminatory because the bias of targeting won't change.
419.0,421.0, And why?
421.0,423.0, Yes?
423.0,429.0, Would you have an international treaty like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for LAWs?
429.0,435.0," No, we wouldn't. We would have a mandate such as we did with the chemical weapons for the reasons I've given."
435.0,442.0," So, why is it impossible for them... why do these kind of machines have a discriminatory bias?"
442.0,449.2," Well, it is impossible for a machine to determine whether someone is a terrorist or not out of the blue. It has to be coded to recognize"
449.2,457.2," terrorist-like patterns of life, or allegedly terrorist-like, through things such as GPS,"
457.2,462.2," social media, but especially phenotype. So basically we're going to have a basic"
462.2,474.0, court-like system of killable bodies based on characteristics that will target and kill people who probably are innocent only because of the coded and arbitrary characteristics that were given in the algorithm.
474.0,486.0," So in conclusion, we're going to have low barriers of entry and a higher business incentive to engage in wars, and we also have to add the horrifying characteristics that lethal autonomous weapons"
486.0,492.0," have, and also that there is no comparative improvement to soldiers. So, because these"
492.0,498.0," weapons lead to more wars, worse wars, and legitimate wars, we should blanket ban them."
498.0,499.0, Thank you.
502.0,509.0," Ladies and gentlemen, the scientific institutions never tell us exactly how they're going to oppose to these developments of LWBs."
509.0,519.0," Now, opposing means different things. You can either ban it, ban it, or even follow up with the simple model of the Nuclear No Proliferation Treaty, for example,"
519.0,522.0, which means you ban it in countries which does not currently have it.
522.0,525.6, We don't know clearly what kind of stance
525.6,528.3, is Chet Phuong Hsien standing up for.
528.3,531.6, That we'll have to answer to this in their next speech.
531.6,533.78," Now, two points of contention, ladies and gentlemen."
533.78,537.18," First, on their points of stance,"
537.18,539.0," on first, lowering the entrance to war,"
539.0,541.94," and second, on the danger of lethal autonomous weapons."
541.94,544.22," Now, on lowering the entrance to war,"
544.22,546.0, the logic here is very simple.
546.0,548.0," They are saying because countries are afraid of this,"
548.0,552.0," they're afraid that citizens have to sacrifice their lives in the war,"
552.0,556.0, this means that now we have lethal autonomous weapons to substitute these people
556.0,559.0, who naturally just incentivize these countries to go to war.
559.0,561.0," This is ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen."
561.0,563.0, Why? Because war is harmful on many levels.
563.0,566.0," It's not just about the manpower, ladies and gentlemen."
566.0,570.0," In our world that we're living in, everything is interconnected."
570.0,575.0," Now, if you go to war with a country, you will definitely ruin your stance within the world."
575.0,580.0," For example, in your relationship with other countries, it will harm your businesses, many other things, ladies and gentlemen."
580.0,584.0, This is not just about people going to war and sacrificing their lives.
584.0,589.0," For this reason, ladies and gentlemen, this lethal autonomous weapon had nothing to do with lowering the entrance to war."
589.0,592.0," Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this point does not stand."
592.0,597.0," Now, on the second substantive, on the danger of lethal autonomous weapons, I will deal with this."
597.0,602.0, This directly clashes with our context to characterization of lethal autonomous weapons.
602.0,609.78," And for this, I will deal with this when I am giving characterization of lethal autonomous weapons and for this I'll deal with this when I'm giving characterization of lethal autonomous weapons. Now while we are willing to engage in"
609.78,614.52," propositions definition of lethal autonomous weapons, ladies and gentlemen, we must clarify to you"
614.52,619.62," that while LAWs can operate without a human intervention, they often include a"
619.62,624.84, function which allows human operator to override a decision if necessary. This is
624.84,626.0," called the kill switch, ladies and gentlemen. This is called the kill switch."
626.0,638.0," The reason why the military want to keep this, the military keep this function because they want to maintain the operational control over their weapons and make adjustments for unaccounted mission variables."
638.0,647.34," Now, therefore, this therapy to deal with the second substantive. Why? Because what they're saying in their logic is that because lethal autonomous weapons don't have"
647.34,651.0," empathy, do not know how to differentiate"
651.0,653.6," between innocent children in front of them,"
653.6,655.18," no, ladies and gentlemen, there's always"
655.18,656.86, someone behind the screen who is going
656.86,658.72, to monitor the lethal autonomous weapons.
658.72,661.94, That is why we believe that this one does not sense also.
661.94,664.6," Now, for this reason, in practice,"
664.6,668.0," most lethal autonomous weapons, for example, the Korean SGR-A1,"
668.0,673.0, are closely monitored by a weapon system operator who oversees the LAWs.
673.0,680.0," Hence, although he does not actually operate the LAW, he provides input and approval by not intervening."
680.0,691.0," That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that there is always a human intervention and human empathy, which their sides are willing to believe in, in lethal autonomous weapons."
691.0,695.0," Now, this is better known as supervised LAW."
695.0,709.68," Further, because our position is led to believe that the world is heading toward a doomsday killer robot, like the type of lethal autonomous weapon, but ladies ladies and gentlemen this is not our reality in fact the technology for this type of lethal autonomous weapon has not currently exist at all"
710.32,716.24, most militaries do not prefer a fully autonomous law because of the aforementioned military
716.24,722.08, operational control most importantly their aim is never to remove the human ailment entirely
722.08,727.5, out but to use lw as a force multiplier and respond to time-sensitive threats.
727.5,733.5," Their goal is not, and never will be, to have the military entirely run by artificial intelligence."
733.5,740.0," As a matter of a public policy, governments also have a preference for semi- or supervised LW, because they provide..."
740.0,741.0, On that point...
741.0,742.5," Yes, yes ma'am."
742.5,756.0," It's in the name, it's autonomous weapons, therefore there is no human intervention and it all runs on an algorithm and that was defined by the same companies that are working on drones because they are the same companies that are going to develop it."
756.0,768.1," Yes, ma'am. Well, drones still have someone monitoring it behind the screen. That doesn't mean that because there's noise on the drone, that means that there's not going to be anyone who supervises or give it agreement or something else."
768.4,768.86, Moving on.
769.06,775.06," Now, as a matter of public policy, governments also have preference for semi-supervised LAWs because they provide accountability."
775.68,777.38," Now, our sense is very simple."
777.64,779.98, We do not oppose the development of LAWs.
779.98,788.0," In fact, we support the development of such technology, including its accompanying frameworks, protocols, and laws like international humanitarian law."
788.0,796.0," This includes a possible code of conduct to govern the use of LAWs, or a convention that outlines the future development of LAWs."
796.0,809.94," Now, our reaction today is, whichever side best strengthens global security infrastructure in both now and in the future will take this debate. Opposition stand today with four simple substantive. First, on saving lives. Second,"
809.94,814.22, on bolstering operational readiness and national defense. My second speaker will tell you about
814.22,817.84, developing stronger and safer frameworks and strengthening and dignifying global security.
817.84,823.04," On to our first substantive, saving lives. By supporting the development of LAWs, we save lives."
823.04,830.0," We can save countless number of lives by either eliminating or mitigating the need for soldiers on all air, land, sea, and the human cause, the Billy,"
830.0,833.0, if the preservation of peace and security has been far too high.
833.0,836.0," Thousands, if not more lives have been lost."
836.0,841.0," For example, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the war alone, we have lost more than 10,000 American lives."
841.0,847.22," However, by supporting the development of LAWs, we can significantly reduce the need for soldiers"
847.22,848.44, who are put in harm's way.
848.44,851.28, LAWs can think and act unlike any piece
851.28,853.2, of our military hardware before.
853.2,857.32, LAWs like the Atlas can replace ground troops
857.32,858.84," as they can jump, carry heavy loads,"
858.84,861.14," navigate uneven terrain, and combat survivors."
861.14,864.24," Even in situations where an LAW can't replace a soldier,"
864.24,865.64, they can still stay flagged by
865.64,869.84," augmenting its soldiers' fighting capabilities, such as providing improved surveillance."
869.84,874.28, LWUs like the Perdix allow soldiers to have a life-force of the battlefield before using
874.28,877.62, blind spots that could be used by snipers of other tribes.
877.62,882.32," Additionally, LWU technology will be more affordable and plus accessible even for the"
882.32,883.32, developing nations.
883.32,888.42," For instance, the Iraqi army has already integrated the use of LAWs in their fight against ISIS."
888.98,891.3," Now, they are machines, and thus they cannot serve."
891.58,892.22," Oh, sorry."
892.56,896.46," Now, on a surface objective, on bolstering operational readiness and international defense."
896.92,897.34, Next.
897.72,903.2," Because LAWs provide equally tangible capacity, boost to a diverse number of countries,"
903.34,905.5, which currently suffer from a defense deficit
905.5,906.5, for various reasons.
906.5,911.6," Now, by developing LWUs, these countries can bolster their operational readiness so as"
911.6,913.6, to defend and safeguard their sovereignty.
913.6,915.6, We'll give you some examples.
915.6,920.6," Several kinds of countries currently suffer from a defense deficit, whether due to a small"
920.6,925.0, military or an Asian population such as Lux St.Burys or South Korea respectively.
925.0,930.0," In Singapore, Forth Portico in particular, it is an island state with one of the fastest"
930.0,936.0," freighting populations in the world, all of which are surrounded by countries with a hostile past."
936.0,941.0, Countries such as these desperately require LWUs to make up for their shortfall in man
941.0,946.6," by enhancing their machines' capability. LWs bridge this gap by inoperational readiness,"
946.6,950.8, as they require few human operators to mount an effective defense.
950.8,955.6," This is to be possible only by the suffering development of LAW technology, ladies and gentlemen."
955.6,958.5," This is the continual development of such technology,"
958.5,960.8," like the Israeli-made trophy land system,"
960.8,964.5, which can repel incoming projectiles such as missiles.
964.5,969.44, LAWs thus multiply the force of such nations while allowing them to build sustainable protective
969.44,972.72, systems that bolster their overall national defense capabilities.
972.72,975.2," For those reasons, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very proud to oppose."
980.4,984.64, It is very clear based on the speech that we have just heard that side opposition does
984.64,987.14, not understand this motion or what it is talking about.
987.54,995.24," Before our third argument tells why this creates more illegitimate wars, I'm going to do a point by point reputation about the speech that we have just heard."
995.64,1007.8," First of all, side opposition says that they did not understand what we mean by oppose because there's many different definitions of the word oppose to which I say our first speaker was very clear we mean a total ban of any"
1007.8,1011.76, development of any kind of lethal autonomous weapons and now this to the
1011.76,1015.76, ban that we have in the status quo about chemical weapons we think that is
1015.76,1019.14, very clear if you understand the model that is being used for chemical weapons
1019.14,1024.12, then you understand our model secondly she tried to refute our point about how
1024.12,1025.58, the fact
1025.58,1028.62, that we no longer send soldiers doesn't mean that the barriers
1028.62,1031.1," for entry for war will be lowered,"
1031.1,1034.28, because there's other reasons why war is bad.
1034.28,1036.24," So if you say, obviously, yes, we"
1036.24,1038.84," understand that there's other reasons why war is bad,"
1038.84,1040.32, but this was not our point.
1040.32,1043.04, Our point was that people from the countries that
1043.04,1057.72," are sending their troops onto the Third World, onto the Middle East, those people, the main cost that these wars have to them is the fact that they're sending their soldiers, their family members, their friends over there to the battlefield to die in many cases."
1058.14,1065.56," And then when this cost is no longer there, then they're going to care significantly less, especially because we know that the media in these countries perpetrates the narrative"
1065.56,1072.14," that if we're invading that country, if we're at war with that country, it is because that country is bad because the people there are terrorists."
1072.14,1077.46, And we do not believe that then these people are going to have any incentive not to want to engage in that war
1077.46,1087.2," if that is what they believe, since now there's almost no cost to them and to their personal lives and the people they help. So we understand that war is bad for other reasons,"
1087.5,1092.5, but we're not confident that the citizens of these countries are going to understand that as well.
1093.4,1096.6, But perhaps the most important point that I have to refute right now
1096.6,1100.2, is that oppositions claim that there is always going to be a human operator
1100.2,1103.04," to override any mistake that this machine might make,"
1103.36,1107.0," and a human operator that can supervise what this machine is doing,"
1107.0,1110.0, and differentiate between innocent children and soldiers.
1110.0,1114.0," To which we say, here there is a very clear line that we have to draw"
1114.0,1117.0, between drones and autonomous weapons.
1117.0,1124.0," Drones, of course, are piloted by a human, and a human is controlling what this drone does."
1124.0,1136.36," However, with autonomous weapons, it says it in the name, these weapons are completely autonomous and there is absolutely no human input that is going on. These machines are being controlled by a program and by an algorithm."
1137.14,1146.0," Why would you create a killing machine that cannot be stopped? Yeah, that is exactly the question that we would ask your side of the house because your side of the house is the one that wants to do that."
1146.0,1150.0, That is something that you have to answer if you want to win this debate.
1150.0,1160.0," And then they brought this point about how they support accountability and humanitarian laws, and this point is going to directly clash with our third argument that I'll get to in a second."
1160.0,1165.0, Then they brought their first argument about how this supposedly saves lives.
1165.0,1172.0," However, it was very unclear to us why exactly they claimed that these lethal autonomous weapons are going to save lives."
1172.0,1179.0," Because everything they talked about was about how they were reducing the cost of war and making these weapons more affordable and more accessible,"
1179.0,1182.0, which is exactly the problem that my first speaker presented.
1182.0,1188.7," Because we see that when these weapons are more affordable and more accessible, it is less costly to engage in a war, and therefore"
1188.7,1193.84, wars are going to start more easily and there are going to be more wars. We do not see how
1193.84,1198.3, you have provided any sort of analysis as to why this point that my first speaker all
1198.3,1203.62, said is going to save lives in any way. And then they talked about their second argument
1203.62,1206.18, about how this is going to allow
1206.18,1210.68, countries that in the status quo cannot defend themselves to be able to defend
1210.68,1213.86, themselves because now they're going to have these weapons since they are more
1213.86,1218.3, accessible. However we think that even if the individual weapons are accessible
1218.3,1223.4," because they are cheap or something else which they did not really explain, we know"
1223.4,1227.0, that the development for these weapons is going to be extremely expensive
1227.0,1234.0," because the technology required for them to be autonomous is not something that we have right now, that is why the motion is about development."
1234.0,1238.0, So what country and what military force is actually going to be able to develop these weapons?
1238.0,1241.0," Well, that is most likely going to be China and the US."
1241.0,1246.4," And China and the US are only going to sell these weapons to their allies, because of course why would they want to sell"
1246.78,1251.2, weapons to countries that they are at war with? Like there is no reason why they would do that.
1251.32,1257.76, So we see that actually in the countries that the US and China are against are not going to receive any
1258.0,1267.0, benefit from this and in fact it's going to increase the inequality because only these countries that were able to develop the weapons and the allies that they decided to sell them to
1267.0,1274.0, are going to have access to these weapons whereas all the rest are going to be able to only suffer in a minute
1274.0,1279.0, of the effects of these weapons while not being able to actually use them themselves.
1279.0,1285.46, Nuclear weapons have mass destruction and only some countries have it. Why is it that countries in the status quo do not choose to start a nuclear war?
1285.46,1290.7," Okay, we think there is a huge difference between nuclear weapons and these compel autonomous weapons."
1291.02,1296.58," The difference being that nuclear weapons have the power to destroy an entire state and an entire government,"
1296.94,1301.48, whereas these weapons only have the power to harm the select citizens that they are killing.
1301.78,1308.04," So the impact and the way in which these two weapons are used are fundamentally different. Okay, now I'll move on to our"
1308.04,1311.7," third argument about more illegitimate wars, and this argument is going to prove"
1311.7,1316.02, that lethal autonomous weapons undermine accountability in wars and thus increase
1316.02,1321.48," war crimes. So, we believe that in order to avoid war crimes and human rights"
1321.48,1326.64," violations, the main thing that the international community should seek is to increase accountability."
1327.18,1328.12," Now, why is this?"
1328.38,1333.8, Because accountability deters war crimes by providing a strong disincentive for the responsible
1333.8,1335.42, actor to commit these crimes.
1335.52,1339.98," Because if you commit a crime, you are then held accountable for it, and then you receive"
1339.98,1341.56, a proportional punishment.
1342.22,1345.98," Without accountability, there would be no incentive to stop yourself"
1345.98,1351.54," from committing unnecessary killings or other types of war crimes. So, how does this relate"
1351.54,1356.7," to lethal autonomous weapons? Well, the point is that you cannot hold a machine accountable"
1356.7,1362.76," for its own actions. You cannot throw a machine in jail, you cannot make a machine undergo"
1362.76,1367.0," a punishment, you cannot make a machine understand that what it did is wrong"
1367.0,1371.0," because a machine simply does not work that way, that is something that is inherently human."
1371.0,1378.0," So therefore, in order to have accountability with these machines, you would need to assign a human that is responsible for the actions of the machines."
1378.0,1387.54," Why would that be impossible? First of all, because the generals that deploy these machines do not actually give any sort of direct instruction to the machines,"
1387.62,1392.62," because these machines work by an algorithm, it would make no sense to hold the general accountable for the machine"
1392.62,1396.9, if the general did not tell the machine what to do. That would be nonsensical.
1397.76,1404.12," And secondly, the only other person apart from this general that could be an option to hold them accountable"
1404.12,1406.64, would be the person that programmed the machine.
1406.64,1411.62, So if we say again this is never going to happen because the person that programmed
1411.62,1416.02, the machine not only programmed this individual machine but they programmed hundreds of them
1416.02,1420.56, and if one of them commits a human rights violation then it would be extremely difficult
1420.56,1425.0, to prove that this algorithm is the thing that caused it when hundreds of
1425.0,1429.52, other machines are working fine. So we believe that it is also going to be extremely difficult
1429.52,1434.76, for side opposition to hold the person that programmed all of these machines or the general
1434.76,1439.18, accountable for the actions of the machine. So what does this mean? This means that there's
1439.18,1444.44, going to be no enforced accountability for any actions that any of these individual machines
1444.44,1445.76, might take.
1445.76,1450.0, So therefore there is not going to be any sort of incentive to try to perfect these machines
1450.0,1453.12, and try to reduce the amount of atrocities that they commit.
1453.12,1458.32," So this will mean that the amount of collateral damage, the amount of deaths and accidents that happen due to these machines"
1458.32,1463.6, is going to increase because there is not going to be any strong disincentive to prevent them from doing so.
1463.6,1468.86," So, because we believe that these machines cause more wars, worse wars, and more illegitimate"
1468.86,1471.7," wars, is why we propose a ban for them."
1475.96,1480.38, The biggest strategic mistake the team of opposition has made in this debate is that
1480.38,1484.0, they don't understand what is the clear definition of a lethal autonomous weapon.
1484.28,1495.0," They drew the comparative between drones and LWs, but actually what they are referring to in their speech are fully autonomous LEWs."
1495.0,1498.0," Now there is a wide scope of LEWs that are available in this world,"
1498.0,1505.4," and I don't understand why Team Peru is willing to only engage us in the smallest scope possible, which is fully autonomous weapons."
1505.4,1508.6," Now first of all, ladies and gentlemen, fully autonomous weapons are not even..."
1508.6,1512.5, the technology for this type of weapon is not even currently existing yet.
1512.5,1518.3," And currently, no countries or no governments are actually going for this type of lethal autonomous weapons."
1518.3,1521.8," Why? Because of all the things that they have mentioned, because of the accountability,"
1521.8,1524.5, because they want to maintain operational control within mission.
1524.5,1527.58, That is why all the amount of LAWs that we are currently having in this
1527.58,1534.58," world are all supervised LAWs. We have given you many examples. First, the SGRA1 that are"
1534.58,1538.52," put in DMZ between North Korea and South Korea border, it is an LAW but it is supervised."
1538.52,1544.36," Else, how many innocent North Korean defectors would have been killed? Of course, there are"
1544.36,1545.6, none to report.
1545.6,1550.4, It shows that that is why governments around the world are supporting supervised LAW.
1550.4,1552.8, And that is the direction that we are going in the future.
1552.8,1561.6," Now once I have cleared this definition, their third point of substantive on accountability has been rendered irrelevant."
1561.6,1565.0," Because now we have a human operator that is operating the LEW,"
1565.0,1570.0," we believe that that person can always be held accountable. But even if we take them on the best case,"
1570.0,1575.0," we say that it's very hard to actually hold the machine accountable. Ladies and gentlemen, because this is a new piece"
1575.0,1580.0," of technology that is currently available in the market, that means that we can evolve the frameworks around"
1580.0,1589.4," this sort of technology and integrate it into the military chain of command. Exactly this is what Singapore has done in 2014, when it integrated civilians into its military system."
1589.4,1594.4," That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we should not just stop any sort of technological advancement"
1594.4,1596.2, just because there are potential risks.
1596.2,1596.8, And...
1596.8,1597.3, And...
1597.3,1597.8, Good point.
1597.8,1598.9," No, thank you, ma'am."
1598.9,1601.7," Thus, I have dealt with all of their substantive material."
1601.7,1605.56, Now let's move on to what they have to say about our point of substantive.
1605.56,1606.62, Two point of contention.
1606.62,1608.58," First, on our substantive on saving lives,"
1608.58,1611.06," and second, on how we bolster operation readiness"
1611.06,1612.04, and national defense.
1612.04,1615.86," First, they have stated that our point of substantive"
1615.86,1617.48," on saving lives doesn't make any sense,"
1617.48,1619.76, because there is no theological.
1619.76,1621.32," Ladies and gentlemen, our first speaker"
1621.32,1623.66, had stated very clearly in her speech
1623.66,1625.12," that first, it saves lives by"
1625.12,1629.12, replacing the amount of soldiers that are actually in need on the battlefield.
1629.12,1631.28, Because LAWs are a force multiplier.
1631.28,1636.94, That means one person can operate multiple devices that can enhance operational control
1636.94,1638.84, while reducing the amount of troops.
1638.84,1639.84, We believe that it's simple enough.
1639.84,1648.2," You put less troops on the battlefield, that less people will die. Secondly, we have stated already that these LAWs can even assist soldiers"
1648.2,1651.04, when humans are forced to be on the battlefield.
1651.04,1657.36," We give you an example of the PURDIX, where it allows humans to understand the environment around them"
1657.36,1661.48, so that they can carry on the mission without the fear of any snipers.
1661.48,1663.76," Now, moving on to our second point of substantive."
1663.76,1668.0," They have stated, their only rebuttal to our case is that these weapons"
1668.0,1671.82, are very expensive in nature we cannot develop them. Ladies and gentlemen that is why we
1671.82,1676.3, should support LAWs because now if we support it there will be a higher demand from these
1676.3,1681.1, countries that means this will lead to mass production of LAWs and that's why LAWs becomes
1681.1,1686.0, cheaper. We've already given you the example of the IRT forces helping LAWs in combating ISIS. No thank you. That is why we on our side we believe that LAWs become cheaper. We've already given you the example of the hierarchy forces helping LAWs in combating ISIS. We don't think...
1686.0,1687.0, On that point...
1687.0,1690.4," No, thank you. That is why we, on our side, we believe that LAWs is something that we"
1690.4,1695.0," should support. Now, moving on to our substantive material. Now, we've already stated... moving"
1695.0,1699.0," on to our third point of substantive on developing stronger and safer frameworks. Now, the thesis"
1699.0,1703.0," of this argument... No, thank you. So, the thesis of this argument is that only by supporting"
1703.0,1707.84, LAWs can we ensure technology is developed responsibly using stronger and safer frameworks.
1708.22,1714.76, But the sheer profitability of LAW technology and its mass military applications means that there will always be a demand for LAWs.
1715.04,1724.96," Thus, LAWs are likely to develop regardless of international support or objection, and by opposing it, proposition is driving such research underground, creating dangerous black markets."
1724.96,1725.04," Actually, they stated they're going to ban it completely. This only makes the problem even worse, ladies and gentlemen. proposition is driving such research underground, creating dangerous black markets."
1725.04,1727.68," Actually, they stated they're going to ban it completely."
1727.68,1731.52," This only makes the problem even worse, ladies and gentlemen, because not only is this dangerous"
1731.52,1735.44," to the international community at large, but also increases the likelihood of them being sold to"
1735.44,1740.24," nefarious individuals or governments, as these developments of such technology will not be supervised."
1740.24,1750.0," Thus, by supporting development areas that are used openly, we allow for creation of stronger and clearer frameworks like international humanitarian law that can govern the safe development of such technology."
1750.0,1754.0," So therefore you take the blanket back from chemical weapons, right?"
1754.0,1759.0," No, ma'am. Because we already stated that chemical weapons are actually very dangerous."
1759.0,1764.0, We're not saying that we should support chemical weapons just because we support LEW.
1764.0,1767.2, We support LEW because it can save people in the battlefield.
1767.2,1770.0," Does chemical weapons do that? No, man. That is illogical."
1770.0,1772.24," Now moving on to the substantive, no thank you,"
1772.24,1776.82," Provision has, it's likely to say that in both cases there will be an underground"
1776.82,1781.18, or black market of some sort and they exist for the more aggressive and
1781.18,1784.78, dangerous LEWs desired by the same buyers. The difference between our world and their world
1784.78,1787.3, is that the black market is much more prevalent and
1787.3,1792.0," much more dangerous without any proper safeguard. Now, the advancement of LAW technology allows"
1792.0,1796.66, government or interagency and government collaboration to actually clamp down on these markets because
1796.66,1800.7, now they don't have any incentive to let such undergrounds flourish. In propositions
1800.7,1804.84," world, however, governments may not even have the incentive to do so because they too desire"
1804.84,1807.0, such technologies but cannot develop them openly.
1807.0,1815.0," Thus, by supporting the development of LAWs, we encourage the creation of enforcement of stronger frameworks that go a long way in creating a safer world."
1815.0,1819.0, Moving on to our final substantive on strengthening and dignifying global security.
1819.0,1821.0, This happens on three distinct tiers.
1821.0,1827.06," First, LAWs allow organisations like the UN to respond to international emergencies with an appropriate force."
1827.06,1828.58," Second, in a timely manner."
1828.58,1832.3," And third, it eliminates the inequality between developed and developing nations"
1832.3,1835.7, where the latter has no choice but to sacrifice the life of a soldier
1835.7,1839.0," for the sake of global security, while the former simply foots the bill."
1839.0,1842.38, LEWs correct this inequality among nations which in turn
1842.38,1845.0, restores the dignity attached to global security.
1845.0,1850.0," On the first level, international organisations worldwide are facing a human resource deficit."
1850.0,1853.0," The number of troops required for peacekeeping missions are on the rise, while the number"
1853.0,1858.0, of troops that countries are willing to contribute are continually declining. This prevents organisations
1858.0,1862.0," from responding with the appropriate force, size and time required to stay on its war-torn"
1862.0,1868.56," region like Khamonok or South Sudan. No thank you, men. Now, LAWs like the US Defenders with peacekeeping capabilities"
1868.56,1872.56, resolve this human resource deficit by replacing the need for and the number of troops on the
1872.56,1878.4," battlefield. Once purchased, field operators are required to supervise these LAWs, and the LAWs"
1878.4,1882.72," themselves can be maintained as a quick response force, ready to deployment in a matter of days."
1882.72,1885.0, And this leads nicely to the next year.
1885.0,1892.0," First, the human deficit problem is compounded by the time required to assemble and deploy a suitable response force."
1892.0,1898.0," The UN, for example, takes an average of 10 months to muster up a community mission,"
1898.0,1901.0," during which time thousands of lives will be lost, ladies and gentlemen."
1901.0,1903.0, This is what happened in Somalia and Sierra Leone.
1903.0,1908.0," Now more importantly, this is a systematic problem that organizations beyond the UN, like the"
1908.0,1909.0," African Union, is also facing."
1909.0,1913.0, It's systematic because such response force are traditionally comprised of infantrymen
1913.0,1918.0, from multiple countries with vastly different training regimes and requires physical application.
1918.0,1922.0," With the development of LAWs, however, the problem of political will is also resolved."
1922.0,1926.56," This is because historically, countries have preferred to lend the UN equipment or logistics"
1926.56,1927.76, rather than its soldiers.
1927.76,1931.0," As fewer human lives are at stake, a decision will be reached faster."
1931.0,1936.22," Thus, LEWs significantly reduce the time required for making a decision and the time required"
1936.22,1940.18," for actually sending response force, thus saving many more lives as a result."
1940.18,1944.66," Moving on to a final tier, by almost eliminating the need for ground troops, the other nations"
1944.66,1948.48," like Ethiopia or Bangladesh, which are currently contributing the most number of peacekeepers"
1948.48,1951.44," around the world, may not have to reserialize anymore."
1951.44,1955.42," Instead, funds designated for training and deployment of troops could have been redirected"
1955.42,1958.54, to the purchase and maintenance of LEWs.
1958.54,1970.0," Thus, on our side, we believe that with the LEW with its new integration into the security, we believe that it actually strengthen and dignify global security."
1970.0,1973.0," And therefore, peace go to the side of opposition. Thank you."
1982.0,1989.72," Before proceeding with our three points of flash, I will be discussing what should not be an issue of this debate, and it's the idea of what is a lethal autonomous weapon."
1989.72,1999.46," What they've said basically is that they support supervised lethal autonomous weapons, which we believe already makes it clear that they don't support the full characteristics of lethal autonomous weapons,"
1999.74,2005.82, because they would be conceding that there is some need for human supervision. But the truth
2005.82,2011.34," is that even if this is the case, there is no real control over humans on the battlefield."
2011.68,2015.18," Sure, what they're saying is you can turn them off, you can choose when to unleash them,"
2015.3,2019.04," but on the battlefield, these are weapons that make their own decisions. To use an analogy,"
2019.04,2024.32," it would make absolutely no sense to say that paid assassins are not really autonomous,"
2024.52,2027.1, because you can decide when to pay them and what their job is.
2027.18,2031.98," Obviously, they're making real decisions on the battlefield, and this is what's relevant to today's debate."
2032.54,2037.36," And, additionally, we would like to say that a blanket ban will be highly effective,"
2037.36,2041.46, since only governments have the resources to fully develop these abominations.
2041.82,2050.08," In any case, let's move on with the three points of clash that we found in today's debate. First, more wars, second, more wars, and finally, more illegitimate"
2050.08,2053.8," wars. Let's start with which side of the house would have more wars, because this is an area"
2053.8,2058.98, that we believe is completely crucial given the terrible impacts of war which both sides
2058.98,2063.44," have thus far agreed upon. We brought this point about barriers of entry, how for great"
2063.44,2069.88," powers, the only thing that will deter them from utterly destroying another country is the loss of lives on their"
2069.88,2075.2," own side. So they responded that the harms of war are very significant, that even if"
2075.2,2080.0," soldiers were dying there was no deterrence, no thank you, but we draw a very clear distinction"
2080.0,2086.36," between the United States and countries like it, and countries like Korea, like Vietnam, that in their time had"
2086.36,2091.04, to face the full horrors of war. Because the United States never had any civilian infrastructure
2091.04,2096.2," destroyed, it never had any children dying, all it had was soldiers dying, and as a result"
2096.2,2102.12," if you take out the soldiers, the only impact on the United States without war is eliminated,"
2102.4,2109.14, and they have absolutely no deterrence whatsoever to pursue a bloody policy of expansionism and violence.
2109.4,2114.34," But in any case, let's move on with the fact that they've said, no thank you,"
2114.74,2120.64, that these would actually be positive because they'd be helping positive organizations like the UN and so on
2120.64,2125.2," carry out peaceful missions in order to restore the security of the world and so on, carry out peaceful missions in order to restore the security of the world"
2125.2,2130.68," and so on, we've already given several systematic reasons as to why the vast majority of wars"
2130.68,2134.28, are not going to be these kinds of interventions that they advocate for.
2134.48,2134.8, Why?
2135.0,2138.64," Because the vast majority of wars are pushed by corporate interests, because they're pushed"
2138.64,2143.18," by geopolitical allegiances, they're pushed by a number of factors that they have not"
2143.18,2148.96, appropriately interacted with in today's debate and that therefore continue to stand up till this speech.
2148.96,2153.78," And finally, we need to consider all of the harms of war, the power vacuum which enables"
2153.78,2158.4," terrorist groups such as ISIS to rise, the destruction of infrastructure permanently"
2158.4,2161.94," for these countries, and the deaths of millions of people."
2161.94,2165.08, These are all things that will happen regardless of whether the
2165.08,2169.72, war is done for humanitarian reasons or for all the reasons that they have failed to interact
2169.72,2173.8," with. In any case, let's move on with the second class, which is which side of the house"
2173.8,2177.36, would have worse wars. And what they're saying is that their wars would be better because
2177.36,2181.2," they have more life saved. Because they'd be taking out the soldiers, and as a result,"
2181.5,2187.16, wars would be less bloody. We fundamentally disagree with this characterization for the simple fact that the vast majority
2187.16,2190.68, of the victims of war are actually civilians.
2190.68,2195.0, Civility casualties tend to be far superior to the casualties of soldiers.
2195.0,2198.76," And even if this were not the case, we believe that we should prioritize civilians for one"
2198.76,2199.76, simple reason.
2199.76,2203.72," As of now, the vast majority of armies in the world don't practice conscription."
2203.72,2207.98," That is, all of the soldiers that fight are doing so willingly and consensually because"
2207.98,2209.18, they love their countries.
2209.18,2214.08," In contrast, civilians have no say in what is going on and are often the most vulnerable"
2214.08,2217.52, stakeholders such as poor children and families.
2217.52,2222.76," This we believe is why we should prioritize civilians over soldiers, even if we believe"
2222.76,2226.0, that the civilian cost is higher anyways it is just in numerical terms.
2226.0,2229.0," And finally, I'll take your point first."
2229.0,2234.0, You conceded in your second speak that the technology for fully autonomous weapons does not exist.
2234.0,2235.0, So why are you pushing this debate?
2235.0,2240.0," Yes, very simple response to that. This motion is about development, not actually putting them into practice."
2240.0,2250.28," Therefore, what we oppose is the development of these sorts of weapons. In any case, they also talked about how this would get countries to be prepared to defend"
2250.28,2255.48," themselves, but to that we have a very simple response. Firstly, at the moment these weapons"
2255.48,2259.32," are expensive, so they would result in the kind of disbalance that we had brought forth,"
2259.66,2264.04," but even looking into the future, if these weapons became a lot cheaper, these are evidently"
2264.04,2269.04, offensive weapons and not pieces of defensive military infrastructure. They are not like
2269.04,2273.22," forts, they are not like trenches, they are a lot more like cannons, chemical weapons,"
2273.36,2279.58," and so on. And what we believe, therefore, is that countries would not be as much prepared"
2279.58,2284.3," to defend themselves as prepared to attack other countries, and this would result in"
2284.3,2286.2," a rise in conflict around the world,"
2286.54,2289.1, alongside all the other reasons that we've discussed today.
2289.54,2294.14," And then they brought an analogy with nuclear weapons, that is, nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent,"
2294.44,2298.9," and therefore our point falls. We believe, as we have said again and again,"
2299.24,2310.18," that nukes are fundamentally different in that they destroy entirely what is meant to be defended. If a nuke is used against a country, they know that they stand no chances of avoiding an"
2310.18,2314.5," enormous, catastrophic destruction of a city. But this is not the case with lethal autonomous"
2314.5,2319.08," weapons. If both sides have lethal autonomous weapons, it is akin to both sides having soldiers,"
2319.34,2323.26," to both sides having tanks, to both sides having chemical weapons. There is virtually"
2323.26,2329.5," no deterrent, and all there is is an escalation of the war to destructive levels."
2329.5,2334.52," And finally, we'd like to move on with the last point of class for today's debate,"
2334.52,2339.86, which is that of illegitimate wars. They conceded entirely that under the lethal autonomous
2339.86,2344.44," weapons that we are debating today, those that are actually lethal autonomous weapons,"
2344.44,2349.12," there would be issues with accountability, and thus the entirety of our third argument"
2349.12,2356.12," continues to stand. However, they have decided to refute what is really not within the bounds"
2357.12,2361.36," of this debate, and they've decided to turn this into a definition debate, and if that"
2361.36,2367.0," is the case, we say the following. even if we go with what they have said."
2367.0,2374.0," With higher levels of human intervention, we get higher levels of accountability."
2374.0,2381.0," That is, the more you reduce the level of human control over these weapons, the less accountability we are going to have."
2381.0,2389.66," And thus, under any measure of autonomy that we grant the weapons, regardless of whether it is relatively minor or relatively large, we will still have issues"
2389.66,2394.92," with accountability that do not exist in the status quo, and thus, on the whole, this will"
2394.92,2399.92," be a problem. Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that for these three fundamental reasons,"
2400.22,2410.22," lethal autonomous weapons are a problem. Because ultimately they provoke more wars, and we believe that more wars are going to be harmful regardless of the intentions of these wars,"
2410.62,2415.08," because they provoke worse wars, as we have shown, by demonstrating that lethal autonomous"
2415.08,2422.12," weapons have systematic problems that are not common with soldiers, as is the case with"
2422.12,2428.4, the fact that they do not properly empathize and understand the deep morality involved in the situations of war.
2428.8,2431.9," And additionally, we believe that we will have more illegitimate wars"
2431.9,2436.46, because of the rampant levels of lacking accountability that will be taking place.
2436.72,2441.22," Ultimately, for these three reasons, we believe that side proposition should definitely take this debate."
2441.48,2444.78," You have a very important choice to make here, ladies and gentlemen."
2444.78,2449.04," We believe that for these three reasons, illegitimate wars, worse wars, and"
2449.04,2452.04," more wars, we should definitely take this debate. Thank you."
2455.18,2460.2," Before moving on to analyze this debate, I'm asking three questions, two strategic mistakes"
2460.2,2464.58," coming from side proposition. First, they choose to limit this debate into finding only"
2464.58,2466.28, fully autonomous debate.
2466.28,2468.08, We have clearly stated out that there
2468.08,2470.32, are three types of lethal autonomous weapons.
2470.32,2474.92, This is where they do not want to engage with us
2474.92,2478.02, in this debate by not acknowledging
2478.02,2481.54," that there are three types of lethal autonomous weapons,"
2481.54,2486.0, but they choose only to argue only on the most extreme side of the scope.
2486.0,2491.0," Secondly, they refuse to engage with all of our substantive provided from the beginning of this debate."
2491.0,2495.0, We will further on analyze why is this harmful in the very first place.
2495.0,2498.0, Three questions in this debate.
2498.0,2499.0," First, what is the status quo?"
2499.0,2502.0," Second, which side saves more lives in the short term?"
2502.0,2506.0," And lastly, which side benefits global security in the long run."
2506.0,2509.0, Moving on to asking the first question on what is the entire useful.
2509.0,2515.0," As stated before, there are three types of lethal autonomous weapons, semi-supervised and fully autonomous weapons."
2515.0,2525.62, It is clearly stated from the very beginning that the world has not and will never switch to fully autonomous or very simple reasons. Beyond the fact that it's the first time
2525.62,2527.44," that you've mentioned that there are three types,"
2527.44,2528.4," I would like to ask you,"
2528.4,2530.68, how would you define the word autonomous?
2532.52,2534.38," We clearly stated this,"
2534.38,2536.76," there are three types from the very beginning,"
2536.76,2539.48, proposition is misrepresenting us in that case.
2539.48,2542.32," And furthermore, we believe that there are this,"
2542.32,2550.0," there, regardless of how autonomous these weapons are, there will always be human intervention and human control over it."
2550.0,2560.0," Because when humans do not directly intervene in the operation of these weapons, it means that they already gave their approval for these robots to carry out the mission."
2560.0,2566.0, It is for that reason that we believe that accountability and these things can still take place.
2566.0,2572.0," First, the government wants to maintain operational control because they can intervene if necessary."
2572.0,2581.0," Furthermore, it will also protect accountability because there is no reason for the government to create weapons that they cannot control."
2581.0,2585.36, Here's where I add another layer of madness. Governments always want to keep
2585.36,2589.2," human control with the autonomous. Because they acknowledge that in case of emergency,"
2589.36,2594.38, it is easy to track and fix the problem when you know who to develop for or who's in control.
2594.62,2598.52," And because of that, this is exactly the reason why there's no incentive for countries to"
2598.52,2603.6, switch to developing a fully autonomous weapon. We have always stated that even if countries
2603.6,2605.04," do want to develop a fully autonomous weapon, we are willing stated that even if countries do want to develop"
2605.04,2608.64," a fully autonomous weapon, we are willing to defend it on our side."
2608.64,2614.48," For the simple reason that even if these weapons are fully autonomous, we believe that it can"
2614.48,2617.2, still save more lives compared to side proposition.
2617.2,2621.68, Moving on to the next clash on which side saves more lives in the short term.
2621.68,2624.0," First, argument on saving lives."
2624.0,2628.0, We have proven to you there are two distinct reasons on why we save more life.
2628.0,2636.0," First, less soldiers will be on the battlefield, and second, this acts as a force multiplier which means essentially one human can multitask."
2636.0,2650.0," They completely dropped this argument and their only response to this is that people still have to go to war and you don't save lives. We believe that on a comparative, when less soldiers are put into the battlefield and one human can simply do more,"
2650.0,2655.0, we believe that on-site opposition we save significantly more lives.
2655.0,2665.0," Furthermore, from the mechanism of replacing soldiers with lethal autonomous weapons can prevent trauma such as PTSD."
2665.0,2672.0," Lethal autonomous, like all cats, do not suffer from psychological effects caused by high pressure situations like humans do."
2672.0,2680.0, They are machines that cannot suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or any other application that might plague soldiers.
2680.0,2685.2," And because of that, we believe that not only do we save lives, but we also protect soldiers in short and long run."
2685.54,2695.94," Furthermore, we believe that although war has consequences to itself, we believe that this is very inevitable."
2695.94,2703.16," This is why there are regulations and frameworks such as the International Humanitarian Law, which is a code of conduct in war."
2703.5,2705.0, Because we all
2705.0,2709.9, government acknowledge that is inventable for wars to happen and this
2709.9,2714.16, these frameworks are developed to ensure that it is not when it does happen
2714.16,2718.0, at that point they will make sure that it's safe. Yes ma'am.
2718.0,2722.0," Given the fact that we have already explained why we are prioritizing the civilian life,"
2722.0,2725.44, the same people from direct current wars would
2725.44,2730.08," order and cope with these autonomous weapons. Therefore, why would they act any different"
2730.08,2732.64, or direct any defense that they are currently doing?
2732.64,2739.36, I believe that there are various reasons for countries to go to war and it is clear that
2740.64,2744.64, government-side proposition is to not understand what we are talking from the very first beginning.
2745.0,2750.0, We just said there are various factors that have account for reasons that countries do not support the war.
2750.0,2756.0," For example, saving lives, or not only saving lives, but they also do not want to lose their stand in the international community."
2756.0,2765.5," Because in this world, we are living in an internally connected world, whereby communities and countries are connected by not only diplomatic betrayals, but a lot of"
2765.5,2768.0, factors that they do not want to create conflicts with another.
2768.0,2773.5," For this reason, it is very crucial and clear why countries do not want to go to war."
2773.5,2778.0," The example of nuclear weapons that was brought up before, that only certain countries do"
2778.0,2782.0," have this kind of weapon, but they still do not choose to go to war with this kind of"
2782.0,2784.5," weapon, has not been responded by Tsai's proposition."
2784.5,2788.72, I believe that it is very clear that government will not go to war whenever
2788.72,2794.24," they feel like to. Moving back to our case, we believe that even if that war does happen,"
2794.34,2798.9, it is better on our side because essentially we send less soldiers to the battlefield and
2798.9,2803.8, essentially save more lives. Moving on to the question on which side strengthens global
2803.8,2805.0, security in the long run.
2805.0,2811.0," First, on developing a stronger and safer framework, this argument was completely dropped by side proposition."
2811.0,2816.0, Lead autonomous weapon can involve the military in many ways.
2816.0,2819.0," Furthermore, this business is clearly very forgettable."
2819.0,2825.02," This is why despite a call for ban or opposition, there can always be a demand for these"
2825.02,2828.98," lethal autonomous weapons. And therefore, it is clear that development of lethal"
2828.98,2833.12, autonomous will continue regardless of what opposition that it may face.
2833.32,2837.12," And because of that, we believe that when a proposition pulls for a total ban,"
2837.3,2841.18, it's more harmful on their side because they drive these research underground.
2841.6,2845.4," Therefore, it will have a higher chance to be sold to dangerous"
2845.4,2850.24," individuals or government. However, this does not happen on our side because it is legal"
2850.24,2857.24, and there is no reason for companies or individuals to buy these technologies underground anymore.
2857.24,2864.24," Furthermore, when it is open, companies or technological companies can furthermore create"
2864.76,2867.0, and invest in more research and development
2867.0,2872.0," because they do not face any risk of being jailed or being faced with laws, stated by"
2872.0,2876.0," type propositions, therefore believe that it is far more safer on our side."
2876.0,2886.38," Moving on to the last part of this clash, on strengthening and dignifying global security. Provide three tiers, three distinct tiers to this argument on how"
2886.38,2888.34," there will be, the response on"
2888.34,2890.38, peacekeeper response will be more appropriate
2890.38,2892.42, force and will be done on a more
2892.42,2894.16," timely manner, and last on how"
2894.16,2895.28, majority of peacekeeper
2895.28,2897.88, will lose less life.
2898.04,2899.86, There is no response coming from side
2899.86,2902.28, proposition. First on how this will
2902.28,2904.3, essentially create more appropriate force.
2904.54,2925.82," We believe that the amount required for peacekeeping force is becoming higher and the amount of countries that are willing to give is less. Because of that, we believe that historically, countries are more willing to give logistic and financial aid rather than sending their own troops. Because of that, we believe that LAWs is an investment that countries are likely to make"
2925.82,2927.44, and more likely to willing to contribute
2927.44,2928.9, to these peacekeeping force.
2928.9,2931.62," Secondly, on how this essentially created"
2931.62,2934.1, a more timely manner response.
2934.1,2937.18," Because there are many factors that can,"
2937.18,2940.46," that soldiers need to carry out for this reason,"
2940.46,2941.98, believe that essentially outside opposition
2941.98,2943.84, would save more lives and protect the goal
2943.84,2945.0," of security in the long run. For all this reason, we believe that essentially outside opposition would save more lives and protect the goal of security in the long run."
2945.0,2947.0," For all this reason, very proud to oppose."
2951.0,2965.0," Before moving on to identify the very important issues of today's debate, I would like to clarify the definition of of LAW is actually closer to reality?"
2965.0,2972.0," What outside, where, how definition of LAW encompasses all types of LAWs that are actually invented?"
2972.0,2979.0," On the international position regarding LAWs, on what type of LAWs the governments or militaries actually want?"
2979.0,2983.0, And the result is that people prefer supervised or semi-autonomous LAWs.
2983.0,2986.84, They're still autonomous because they don't make their decisions.
2987.28,2989.64, The decisions are not made by anybody else.
2989.68,2990.7, They made the decision themselves.
2990.94,2993.22, But then it contains a kill switch.
2993.48,2994.96," So that lets any human operator,"
2995.2,2998.22," after he stops it from actually committing any sort of war crimes,"
2998.26,2999.22, it doesn't happen on the outside.
2999.52,3001.38, This is why it's more preferred by the military
3001.38,3003.78, because they can operationally control their value
3003.78,3006.44, and it actually has accountability on the outside.
3006.64,3010.98," Or would you like to believe their science definition of LEWs, which is a hypothetical"
3010.98,3016.78," version of LEWs that doesn't even exist yet in our reality, where they are willing to"
3016.78,3021.04," say that LEWs are basically terminators without any sort of kill switch, that they are just"
3021.04,3024.9, going to throw them into the jungles of Rwanda and kill people without actually people stopping
3024.9,3027.92," it, which is actually closest to reality. Of course, that they are just going to throw them into the jungles of Rwanda and kill people without actually people stopping it. Which is more, which is actually closer to reality?"
3028.2,3032.2," Of course, that is side opposition. Now since that has been dealt with, I'll move on to"
3032.2,3036.3," the three important issues of today's debate. First, which side protects soldiers? Second,"
3036.5,3040.7," which side protects peace? And finally, which side protects the state development of LWWs?"
3041.08,3045.0," Now moving on to our first important issues. First, which side better protects soldiers?"
3045.0,3050.0," Ladies and gentlemen, our side is the only side that actually touches soldiers in the first place in this debate."
3050.0,3056.0," We offer you three distinct lines of logic on how LEWs save the lives of soldiers in the battlefield first,"
3056.0,3063.0, by replacing them as LEWs act as a force multiplier that actually allows less soldiers on the battlefield with the same efficiency.
3063.0,3069.7," Second, we say LEWs can assist these soldiers by providing them surveillance"
3069.7,3075.0, so that they can operate with more efficiency.
3075.0,3078.0," Finally, we protect soldiers by having less soldiers on the battlefield."
3078.0,3083.4, It means that less soldiers are going to suffer from post-traumatic disorders
3083.4,3085.98, that are actually devastating the families of many soldiers
3085.98,3087.3, that have returned from the battlefield.
3087.3,3089.78, This is something that the Sino-British proposition
3089.78,3090.98, has never actually touched.
3090.98,3093.34," Second of all, which side actually protects peace?"
3093.34,3094.96," Now on our side, we protect peace,"
3094.96,3098.1, because we offer a chance for countries like Singapore
3098.1,3100.38, to actually bolster their national defense.
3100.38,3103.24," Because for a country with such small population,"
3103.24,3106.0," surrounded by other countries with a very hostile past,"
3106.0,3111.0, how would they actually defend themselves with such a small number of people and a great population?
3111.0,3116.0," The answer is L.A.W.s, and that is why we advocate the development of these sort of weapons."
3116.0,3122.0," But furthermore, we advocate because it protects peace in the way that it allows organizations like the U.N."
3122.0,3129.1, to send aid to countries that are in international humanitarian crisis because they allow these countries to respond with appropriate force
3129.1,3133.94, in a timely manner and actually requires less lines of soldiers for LNDCs.
3133.94,3138.88, Now on their side they insist that LWs actually lower the barrier of entry but the logic they
3138.88,3140.9," present is very simple, ladies and gentlemen."
3140.9,3143.0, Now the soldiers' lives are not going to be at risk.
3143.0,3148.44, These countries are going to enter war more easily without actually considering international
3148.44,3152.5," relations, business relations, or the reaction of the international community."
3152.5,3153.5, That line of logic doesn't make sense.
3153.5,3157.5, This is the crux of the whole case that we have actually put in this debate.
3157.5,3161.64," But then moving on to our final point, our final important issue of this debate, which"
3161.64,3163.5, side ensures the development of LAWs?
3163.5,3166.0, Now this is something that their side has not touched upon ladies and gentlemen.
3166.0,3186.5," We have actually explained to you very carefully how, by only my supporting the development of LAWs, important frameworks will be and selling these very dangerous weapons to dangerous individuals,"
3186.5,3190.0, something that their side is going to exacerbate because they are going to ban it completely.
3190.0,3193.5," And for all those reasons, ladies and gentlemen, please put your side on position."
3197.0,3200.5, There is something very clear that both sides of the house agree on.
3200.5,3205.7, There is no reason for the government to create weapons that they cannot control.
3211.94,3212.44," Unfortunately, it seems like, to a large extent, this debate has become a definition debate about what is autonomous."
3217.26,3221.54," However, I believe it is pretty clear because anyone that owns a dictionary can look it up and you can see that autonomous is something that works independently on its own."
3221.64,3230.64," It is something automatic, it is not something that is being controlled by a human behind the screens. That is what this debate is about. This debate is about machines"
3230.64,3236.88, that work with an algorithm that does not involve human input. This debate is not about semi-autom
3236.88,3242.32, semi-autonomous machines or like sort of kind of but not really autonomous machines. This debate is
3242.32,3245.24, about machines that work fully independently
3245.24,3251.0," of human control. So there have been three main clashes. Firstly, the whole clash about"
3251.0,3255.52," which side of the house creates more wars. Secondly, worse wars. Thirdly, the whole point"
3255.52,3259.9," about accountability and illegitimate wars. So let's go through them one by one. So firstly,"
3260.06,3265.4," we get to this whole argument about how autonomous weapons lower the barriers of entry, both"
3265.4,3270.14, sides of the house seem to agree that autonomous weapons are more accessible and cheaper than
3270.14,3274.28," other types of military resources, so that is something that we have both agreed on,"
3274.72,3279.2," and furthermore, we brought this point about how no longer taking your soldiers to the"
3279.2,3285.2," battlefield reduces public retaliation, something which we have not heard any proper reputation for."
3285.66,3292.62," So I think it is pretty clear that to a large extent, we both agree that since these weapons are more accessible now,"
3292.98,3297.12," and given that there is the same incentives to go to war on our both sides of the house,"
3297.26,3300.74," but now the requirements are less, so it's easier to go to wars,"
3301.14,3304.9, then more wars will happen on the opposition's side of the house.
3305.72,3306.88," Then, worse wars."
3307.1,3311.06," Well, first of all, we brought to you another point about how these machines don't have"
3311.06,3314.62, any empathy and therefore are going to be more reckless with their actions.
3315.02,3320.2," Again, this is a point that was not properly refuted to a larger extent than just their"
3320.2,3324.4," definition of, oh, but there's a human, which we have said over and over, that is not the"
3324.4,3326.24, types of weapons that we're talking about in this debate.
3326.9,3330.7," Then the point about inequality that side opposition brought, and we gave extensive"
3330.7,3334.84, reputation explaining how China and the US are going to be the countries that develop
3334.84,3338.46," these weapons, and from then on, they're going to be the ones that control who these"
3338.46,3340.22, weapons are given to.
3340.48,3343.3," Again, that is a point that we saw in our risk over and versus the process."
3343.78,3346.0, The point that side opposition did try to bring
3346.0,3347.78, was about how we are
3347.78,3349.38," saving soldiers with these weapons,"
3349.74,3351.82," to which we realized, yeah, of course we're saving"
3351.82,3353.94," soldiers. However, as our"
3353.94,3355.84," third speaker already said, we do not"
3355.84,3357.62, understand why we would need to prioritize
3357.62,3359.5, the lives of saving soldiers who
3359.5,3361.6, consented to go to the war over
3361.6,3363.58, the lives of these civilians that
3363.58,3370.4, the autonomous weapons will be killing to a much greater extent as I already explained in our previous class.
3370.4,3375.2, Not only that but also statistically the amount of fatalities that happen towards civilians
3375.2,3379.2, is far greater than the amount of fatalities that happen towards wars.
3379.2,3384.0, And then they brought their point about humanitarian wars to which we already again included this
3384.0,3388.7, saying that there's no reason why if the intention of the war is to be humanitarian and
3388.7,3392.42, help people that that's actually going to lead to a positive outcome in the war
3392.42,3396.14, and we've given you many examples of which wars with good intentions ended up
3396.14,3401.36, not happening again a point that was not refuted so we sign opposition has no
3401.36,3406.3," point as to why wars would be less horrible under their side of the house, but we"
3406.3,3408.44, brought to you many reasons why they would be more
3408.44,3410.52, bad. And lastly
3410.52,3412.44," the point about more legitimate wars, again"
3412.44,3414.44, I brought to you a whole argument
3414.44,3416.62," about that in my second speech, and"
3416.62,3418.5, side opposition's only response to
3418.5,3420.5, this was again hinged on their
3420.5,3422.66, evidently clearly wrong definition
3422.66,3424.48," of autonomous weapons, saying that there is a human"
3424.48,3431.04," controlling these actions. However, we can all reasonably know that this is not the case because"
3431.04,3434.72," those are not the types of weapons that we're talking about, so it is very easy for us to take"
3434.72,3440.08, this clash since their whole point about this was hinged on something that is fundamentally false.
3440.08,3449.0," So because we have proven over and over again that wars with autonomous weapons will be more frequent, they will be worse, and they will involve less accountability for war crimes,"
3449.0,3453.0, is why we believe that a longer development is a terrible idea. Thank you.
