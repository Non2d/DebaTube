0.0,30.0, Hello everybody and welcome to the grand final of WSC 2008.
35.0,39.0," Thank each and every one of you for participating in this tournament and of course, massive congratulations to INDIA"
45.0,48.0, and China And China. And China.
48.0,52.0, And China.
52.0,55.0, We're making it all the way up to the grand final.
55.0,60.0," Now without further ado, I would like to invite over Aishah Ahmad, who is chairing this round,"
60.0,63.0, to introduce you to the rest of the panel and the teams.
63.0,70.0, Thank you. to introduce you to the rest of the panel and the piece.
73.0,76.0, Hi everyone. Are we excited?
79.0,89.0, This is our first All Asia Final. This is also our first all ESL final.
89.0,97.0, We're all sure it's going to be a great debate.
97.0,99.0, So let me introduce the teams to you today.
99.0,107.0, On team proposition we've got Team India.
110.0,113.0," Speaking from India today are Hemant Bahadur Jagdevarti,"
115.0,118.0," Dejas Subramanian,"
120.0,122.0, and Kanan J. Ashok.
123.0,131.0, Hemant will be working on the team. Supporting them on the team this year are Mania Gupta and Shalanya Aghidri.
134.0,137.0, In opposition today we've got Team China.
140.0,142.0, Their speaker is Brian Lee.
144.0,148.0, Second speaker is Matt Song.
148.0,152.0, Third speaker is Edwin Chen.
152.0,156.0, Brian will be a little more inclined. Supporting them this year are
156.0,160.0, Lyndon Lee and
160.0,164.0, Stone Kim.
164.0,170.0, I would also like to announce the judging panel for today. I am not the chair. The chair today is Claire Ryan from New Zealand.
174.0,177.0," And there's obviously myself, I'm from Pakistan."
180.0,183.0, We've got Professor Joshua Park from the Republic of India.
187.0,190.0, We've got Alex Vieigert from Qatar.
193.0,195.0, Amir Amour from Malaysia.
199.0,201.0, Luke Churchyard from South Africa.
217.0,228.0," Julio Julio Meyer from Mexico. Dina Tabianyan from Denmark. And perhaps the most exciting one of all, from Croatia, Luca Petrovic. The have in the House today is that this House believes that the West"
228.0,233.0, should end all arms sales and military cooperation with Saudi Arabia. Let me get down and we
233.0,235.0," can start, okay?"
242.0,252.0, The difference between a rogue state and a trusted member of the international community cannot be whether the state has oil.
252.0,259.0," It has not been established beyond all sensible doubt by the UN, Amnesty International and the world community at large"
259.0,270.5, that Saudi Arabia has committed and will continue to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity at an industrial scale in Yemen. And so just as we would not have sold arms to Rabada in
270.5,277.1," 1994, Serbia in 1998 and Syria in 2013, it's time to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia."
277.24,283.04," It's time to put Saudi at arms length. What do we support? Starting tomorrow, starting"
283.04,287.0," today, starting now, we will stop the sale of weaponry to Saudi Arabia. What do we support? Starting tomorrow, starting today, starting now, we will stop the sale of weaponry to the server."
287.0,294.0," What do we need? We need guns, tanks, the fighter jets that are raining hellfire right at this moment in Yemen."
294.0,310.0," No more $100 billion on states, no more bases to train Saudi troops, no more shattering military tech necessary for the upkeep and use of existing military infrastructure. In short, we will end the military cooperation because there's a gap between right and wrong"
310.0,313.0, and Team India is here to go back or go home.
313.0,316.0," To be back in our good graces again, what should they do?"
316.0,317.0, Three things.
317.0,323.0," One, halt war crimes in Yemen immediately and stop deliberate asterisks on hospitals and schools."
323.0,326.62," Two, allow the free flow of food, water and medicines"
326.62,329.68," by ending the blockade across land, sea and air"
329.68,331.1, that they are currently enforcing
331.1,333.26, by controlling the Modena airport
333.26,335.78, and bombing the Al-Jabari port.
336.14,338.26," Three, stopping funding terrorists,"
338.4,339.9, stopping directly funding terrorists
339.9,341.56," by handing money to rappers,"
341.96,343.72, stopping indirectly funding them
343.72,346.94, by refusing to enforce anti-terror policies.
347.04,348.68," If they comply with our decisions,"
348.84,351.18, we will reinstate our military assistance to them.
351.38,353.2," But additionally, we will work with them"
353.2,354.78," to negotiate a ceasefire in Yemen,"
355.04,357.68, offer more oil contracts to Saudi Arabia in the future
357.68,358.9, if they listen to us.
359.14,361.38," In the unlikely event that they refuse to comply,"
361.64,363.86, we will vigorously enforce arms embargo
363.86,365.26, and apply diplomatic
365.26,370.68," pressure. Eventually, place sanctions on the elite, and if push comes to shove, we will"
370.68,376.02, stop buying oil. This is possible. Germany and Norway are leading the way by ending military
376.02,381.3," cooperation, and it's time for the rest of the West to follow. We have seen this work"
381.3,389.5," in this very country. In 1962, Saudi Arabia banned slavery as a direct result of JFK attempting to end military cooperation."
389.5,390.5, Four arguments.
390.5,393.5," One, the West should not aid in a bad crimes against humanity."
393.5,397.5," Second, Saudi Arabia would respond by stopping atrocities in Yemen."
397.5,401.0," Third, our policy reduces the incentive to engage in proxy wars."
401.0,406.14," Fourth, our policy fights terror more effectively in the region. First, the West"
406.14,412.1," should not aid in the battle of crimes against humanity. 10,000 dead. Another 20,000 dead"
412.1,418.54," from preventable diseases. Children, 3 million displaced. 70 million facing famine. Saudi"
418.54,425.0, Arabia is engaging in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Saudi Arabia has deliberately bombed its civilians.
425.0,431.0," Last year, it killed 78 civilians at a wedding in a cruel, deliberate manner. And right now,"
431.0,437.0, it is slowly snubbing large parts of Yemen by using the very planes and ships that this
437.0,442.0," brigade is about to blockade all of Yemen's ports, stopping the flow of food, aid and"
442.0,445.0, water despite Yemen's corona outbreak.
445.0,451.0," In domestic, Western military cooperation is instrumental for the scale of devastation in Yemen."
451.0,456.0," Most directly, we supply Saudi with billions of war debt that lack havoc,"
456.0,463.0, from Abraham's mega-tanks to French Rafale missiles and lethal echo-fiends that we refuel mid-air
463.0,465.76, so that they can continue or their bombing
465.76,466.88, speeds more effectively.
467.32,472.86, Saudi Arabia consistently looks the other way as weapons fall into the hands of groups
472.86,478.54," like the Al-Nusra and Al-Taisila, hands that recruit child soldiers and use human shields"
478.54,480.74, and attack schools and hospitals.
480.74,486.4, We do not accept and must never accept that such war crimes can ever be permissible
486.4,493.04, for strategic purposes. Is it sometimes acceptable to violate human rights? Or is it only acceptable
493.04,498.96," to enable those crimes, not to commit them? Sure, the West is donning the chain, or rather"
498.96,505.0, firing the shot. We are still guilty. There are several rights that we draw that we must stand by.
505.0,508.0, We wouldn't have carried out the Serbian or Armenian genocides.
508.0,511.0, We do not want to do the same in Yemen.
511.0,515.0, Militistic cooperation is cooperation in murder.
515.0,516.0, Deliberately killing innocents.
516.0,521.0," It is without a doubt profiting of blood, famine, disease and misery."
521.0,524.0, The blood of innocents stains our hands.
524.0,529.0, Second argument. Why not Saudi Arabia respond by stopping atrocities in Yemen?
529.0,531.0, Two ways in which Saudi Arabia could respond.
531.0,536.0, They could double down and continue the abuses in Yemen or they could meet our conditions.
536.0,541.0," So, one, in the least entities, they continue or double down on their actions in Yemen."
541.0,543.0, What happens then?
543.0,545.0, Stopping military aid means no military air
545.0,550.0," refueling, no mid air refueling, no crucial intelligence about the location and strategy"
550.0,555.0," of Houthi reports. Without our consistent support, the current one-way line fire jets"
555.0,561.0," become expensive pieces of metal that cannot function without software updates, coding,"
561.0,565.0, specific ammunitions and spare parts arriving from the West.
565.0,571.0," The THAAD missile system, for instance, is designed to use proprietary missiles and batteries that we now design."
571.0,578.0," So independent of what Saudi is likely to do, designing the campaign automatically fizzles the tunnel."
578.0,590.0, This is better than providing the world's deadliest weapons against children in Yemen. Yes. Given the revenue from trade between the West and Saudi Arabia would still be likely to be directed by Saudi Arabia
590.0,594.0," towards purchasing arms and funding their military, would you cut off that trade too?"
594.0,597.0, Or how is that any different from giving them the guns that you sold to us?
597.0,601.0," The problem is, not only are we giving them the world's most advanced technology,"
601.0,609.38," the moment at which they don't have that technology, they have to reconstruct entire missile systems. I'll get to that in a second. The second way in which Saudi Arabia"
609.38,615.34," could react is to meet our conditions, whereas we are far more likely to comply. Saudi Arabia"
615.34,620.84, needs our firepower. Saudi wants to hold on to its militaristic advantage over Tehran
620.84,625.72, and its neighbors. Saudi uses this parade of French tanks and British missiles
625.72,627.96," to maintain its perceived strength,"
628.14,632.18, both within its own population and across other Arab nations.
632.56,636.5, This military support is something that only the West can offer Saudi.
636.78,641.04, Russia is tied to Iran as its largest trade and military partner.
641.38,643.2," China, for its peaceful rights,"
643.28,650.0," as we learned from Team China in round 7, as a communist party policy, cannot enter significant"
650.0,658.0," conflits with anyone. So Saudi has no one else to sit with in the geopolitical cafeteria. But also, from the radars to basic"
658.0,666.0," parts to training soldiers to use certain rifles, the Saudi army is heavily reliant on using US army infrastructure."
666.0,671.0," Building a new army, new missile defence systems would take decades, which Saudi cannot afford."
671.0,677.0," That is false, with their point of information. Let's pretend that this is the Saudi and India war zone for a second."
677.0,683.0," Sure, Yemen is strategically important, but it doesn't combat the blue sin, the militistic"
683.0,686.0, or alliance driven status that Saudi has in the Middle East.
686.0,688.0, That's why they're disinterested.
688.0,691.0, Saudi also needs the economic and political friendship we can extend.
691.0,697.0," Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is a new age ruler who, through the West,"
697.0,700.0, promises to bring economic growth and diversification.
700.0,702.0, They will disinterest for that.
702.0,707.0," But in the next weeks and months then, Saudi halts the violence in Yemen, finally allows"
707.0,711.0, food and water to enter and negotiates a ceasefire.
711.0,714.0," For a long time, we stopped obfuscating Saudi's history."
714.0,716.0, Yemen wasn't Saudi's first country.
716.0,722.0," Iraq, 1908. Iraq, 2004. Tunisia, 2010. Libya, 2011."
722.0,726.0," But it's clear that the US and French deterred doesn't protect Saudi's excesses,"
726.0,731.0, Saudi cannot warmonger in its Sunni-Wahhabi interest as the West hides its actions.
731.0,751.4," Make no mistake, Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the region. It's time to put Saudi at the top of my speech is that of the Greek myth Euromyrus, the snake that eats itself."
751.6,754.86, Because I think that's analogous to what proposition case is.
755.16,761.48," Because the point at which they concede to us that Saudi Arabia wants control, that they want arms and that they want to keep their might,"
761.48,766.9, that is the point at which they concede that Saudi Arabia is probably going to buy arms from other people.
766.9,768.44, So the difference in today's debate
768.44,770.48, is not whether or not Saudi Arabia can continue
770.48,772.56," to commit the same humrient violations,"
772.56,775.66, but who supplies the guns that allows them to do so.
775.66,777.8," On our side, we tell you that the West,"
777.8,779.68," when providing these guns, is best"
779.68,782.98, able to ensure and minimize the damage that on their side
782.98,784.3, is going to run rampant.
784.3,786.36, That is why we are so proud to oppose.
786.76,791.02," I'm going to bring you one substantive argument, and that is why the comparative is worse if"
791.02,791.56, they debate.
791.86,795.7," Before that, let's just clarify about the principle that they decide to spend the vast"
795.7,797.72, majority of their speech talking about.
797.92,799.34, I want to note three things here.
799.34,803.04, The first thing to note is that when they talk about human rights violations outside
803.04,808.18," of that of military arms, it's probably not what this debate is about. Because when it comes to things like"
808.18,813.12," the liberalization within the country of Saudi Arabia, military arms are probably not what"
813.12,817.2," makes them directly complicit. In fact, we're going to show you why it probably gets a little"
817.2,822.0," bit better on our side. But secondly, I think an important thing to note here is that when"
822.0,828.64," it comes to the relationship between countries, that there's almost always a right to self-defense. That when Saudi Arabia recognizes that there's"
828.64,833.4," oftentimes militaristic threats that literally exist in their backyard, they sometimes do"
833.4,838.42," have the right to self-defense, the right to resist against antagonistic forces coming"
838.42,842.82, from below them. And that is extremely important because they do need to necessarily show us
842.82,850.06," why in this specific instance, war is an injustice that is different from every other just war that exists but thirdly i'm going"
850.06,853.1, to talk about this most importantly because i understand in the next speech they're going to
853.1,857.6, come up and tell us well saudi arabia does things that are against human rights they do things that
857.6,862.02, are egregious within warfare but i think the greatest moral hazard that is going to exist
862.02,865.1, in today's debate is the hypocrisy in taking the
865.1,870.14," easy way out. When the West decides to do the most comfortable action, which is to say, remove"
870.14,875.7," themselves from the guilt, the necessarily ensuing cost is the death of the people who otherwise"
875.7,879.84," would not have died, because the arms are now being supplied by actors that are much less reliable"
879.84,887.66," and much less likely going to keep Saudi Arabia accountable. We think, to the extent at which we can prove that the pullout of the West is worse,"
888.02,892.66, then we think the West becomes complicit to the death of every single individual that otherwise doesn't die.
892.88,895.08, That is a moral burden that they do need to disprove.
895.6,897.82," Why, then, is it that the comparative is so much worse?"
897.98,898.68," Before that, sure."
899.02,903.94, How would you explain the U.S. foreign policy towards Saudi to a Yemeni chap?
904.6,905.0," We would say that the U.S. is trying the very best that they can, explain the US foreign policy towards Saudi to a Yemeni chap?"
905.0,907.5, We would say that the US is trying the very best
907.5,908.22, that they can.
908.22,910.86," And unfortunately, the reality is the moment at which they"
910.86,913.5," pull out, the actor that tries to hold Saudi Arabia"
913.5,914.92, accountable is the one that never
914.92,916.46, cared about its own citizens.
916.46,917.96, It's the one that is much more likely going
917.96,919.88, to allow for the same human rights violations
919.88,922.68, that have happened in the past to happen much more frequently.
922.68,925.38," So then, there's going to be two parts to my first banoning"
925.38,927.8, substantive about why the comparative is worse.
927.8,930.44, The first thing to prove is why Saudi Arabia is likely
930.44,932.3, going to turn to other sources.
932.3,934.4," Because at the end of the day, the US is only one"
934.4,936.14, of many sources of arms.
936.14,938.54," But the objectives that Saudi Arabia currently has,"
938.54,941.0, like removing the ability for Shia militia
941.0,944.54," to enact violence within Yemen, is something that is uniquely"
944.54,945.24, important to them.
945.4,949.68, And this is the analysis that proves why a ceasefire is just an imagination on their
949.68,950.0, side.
950.16,951.04, There's two reasons.
951.38,956.1," Firstly, because Iran being able to take over the country that exists literally miles away"
956.1,959.52, from their capital is one that grants Iran too much control.
959.52,964.98," It encourages Shia revolutions all across the entire Middle East, and it enables a military"
964.98,966.86, threat that exists at their back door.
967.12,970.88, This is something that is antithetical to the incentives of Saudi Arabia.
971.14,975.5," But furthermore, secondly, Saudi Arabia oftentimes has the incentive to build its own imperatives,"
975.68,978.12," because it wants to be the bastion of Sunni majority,"
978.34,981.94," because it understands that in order to control regional influence within this area,"
981.94,990.02," it's contingent upon the religious stance of the territory around you. Importantly, this means, and they can see, Saudi Arabia has the incentive"
990.02,994.32," to get arms regardless of whether or not they come from America. Importantly, this then"
994.32,998.34, means that Saudi Arabia gets guns on both sides. It depends on the influence and the
998.34,1002.72, actor that changes upon arms. Why then is it that the alternative actors are likely
1002.72,1009.0, going to be back? We think there's a broad spectrum and it's often times uncertain what type of regime changes happen.
1009.0,1017.0," We think the likely actors are going to be A Russia, B China, and 3 probably weaponizing the Wahhabism that already exists within these regions."
1017.0,1019.0, Why is this problematic? Two things.
1019.0,1024.0," Firstly, because it loses out on the unique benefits that the West gets you. These come threefold."
1024.0,1028.54, The first benefit that the West has uniquely is the better weapons. And note that this indirectly
1028.54,1032.1, engages with our analysis about the better weaponry. Because we think better weaponry
1032.1,1036.92, when it comes to warfare is oftentimes a good thing. Because when Saudi Arabia results in
1036.92,1041.24," purchasing weapons from Russia and China, the weapons that Russia and China sell are"
1041.24,1045.7, oftentimes the ones that are World War II and Cold War leftover weapons.
1045.7,1048.24, And the problem then is in the sophistication.
1048.24,1051.5, And that sophistication means that there's more likely going to be collateral civilian
1051.5,1052.5, damage on their side.
1052.5,1057.56, Examples being how the Su-25 bomber which has been sold to Syria from Russia is one
1057.56,1062.54," without any targeting system, without any gun, that only is able to drop down bombs."
1062.54,1066.5," But on the comparative, Saudi Arabia gets access to things like the A-10 fighter jets"
1066.5,1067.96, that have laser-guided munitions that
1067.96,1070.4, are able to take on the targets that they intentionally
1070.4,1071.18, go towards.
1071.18,1072.92," That means, even when we think that there"
1072.92,1075.18," are incentives that are in the correct position,"
1075.18,1078.04, you're much more likely to have civilian damage on their side.
1078.04,1080.62, That is why there's six times more civilian casualties that
1080.62,1083.24, are created by Russian bombings in Syria and Yemen
1083.24,1085.54, than there are of Western and Saudi Arabian ones.
1085.8,1088.26," Second unique benefit, and one on accountability."
1088.62,1092.96," The easy reason why this is so is because Western countries have A, democratic civil"
1092.96,1097.22," societies, and B, transparent media, both of which are much more likely to hold these"
1097.22,1099.46, countries to account when it comes to crimes.
1099.46,1105.26, That is why in Saudi Arabia there have been recent implementations of official investigation
1105.26,1110.34," mechanisms when it comes to civilian casualties, why the U.S. CENTCOM posts daily live streams"
1110.34,1113.88," of every single airstrike that goes on there, because these countries are much more likely"
1113.88,1118.78," going to be accountable than the alternative actors. Third point, the U.S. oftentimes acts"
1118.78,1122.88," as an architect of stability, and importantly, the U.S. plays a huge part, because currently"
1122.88,1126.6, power is kept held in two pillars when it comes to the Middle East.
1126.88,1130.66," Firstly, in Saudi Arabia, the moderate Sunni one that is largely acceptable."
1130.98,1134.96," But secondly, in Israel, the democratic and the Jewish Christian West."
1135.22,1138.56, Why is it problematic when Saudi Arabia is the area in which they pull out
1138.56,1140.68, and Israel becomes the only remaining actor?
1140.88,1141.66, There's two harms.
1141.94,1145.0, The first one is that this area is much more likely to descend into
1145.0,1149.12, sectarianism. Why is that so? Because you lack the ability for the US and the West to
1149.12,1153.42, have moderate creation influences upon those that are the Muslim communities within these
1153.42,1158.38, areas. But it also shifts the perception of how Israel becomes uniquely one that is a
1158.38,1162.9," bastion in the extension of the West within this area, vastly increasing the amount of"
1162.9,1165.54, incentives for most of the Middle
1165.54,1167.28, East to band together against Israel.
1167.56,1172.56," We think, unfortunately, here, the U.S. oftentimes plays a very big role in deterring and having"
1172.56,1178.42, rapid response to prevent any of these wars from actually breaking out within these areas.
1178.7,1183.4," But secondly, we think there's unique harms that come along with the alternative actors."
1183.68,1185.56," When it comes to Russia, it's not enough for them"
1185.56,1189.36," to just assert that Russia won't sell weapons, right? Because there's a very problematic incentive"
1189.36,1194.22, that arises when Russia is able to fund Saudi Arabia. It means that it funds both sides of the
1194.22,1198.46, conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran in the same way that they funded both sides of Ethiopia
1198.46,1204.02," versus Eritrea. And that means that they profit off of more war, meaning that actors like this"
1204.02,1208.72, are much more likely going to continue to try to ensue war and make sure it prolongs.
1208.72,1212.24," But even when it comes to China, which we do agree is a great nation, but oftentimes"
1212.24,1216.24, it can be negligent of the minority oppression when it comes to the trade-off of personal
1216.24,1217.24," gain, we do admit."
1217.24,1220.24," Like examples, where they empower the majority within Sudan."
1220.24,1224.72," The problem then is that they're much more likely to empower the minority, which is Saudi"
1224.72,1225.1," Arabia, and enable for more crimes to be committed in places like're much more likely to empower the minority, which is Saudi Arabia,"
1225.3,1230.06," and enable for more crimes to be committed in places like Yemen, which tend to be the minority."
1230.46,1235.46," Ultimately, the chain in today's debate is not whether or not Saudi Arabia has weapons, but who provides them."
1235.72,1239.96, We think that the West is much more capable and much more accountable. We're very proud to oppose.
1244.38,1251.0," Team China would lie to a Yemeni China. If they tell them that the US is trying, it's very"
1251.0,1257.5," best. Because the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world is not Syria, it is not Afghanistan,"
1257.5,1263.06," it is not even the Central African Republic, it is Yemen. And if the US was really trying"
1263.06,1266.0," their very best, they would be implementing our policy,"
1266.0,1269.0, where the genocide in Yemen is halted.
1269.0,1273.0, That's why we say it's time to put Saudi Arabia at an arm's length.
1273.0,1277.0, Two big claims that came out of Team China's first leader.
1277.0,1280.0," Firstly, that they are likely to turn to other sources."
1280.0,1283.0, Saudi Arabia is likely to turn to other sources for weapons.
1283.0,1288.46," And secondly, that these alternative actors are significantly worse. Let's deal with these in turn. Firstly,"
1288.66,1292.76," on the idea that, you know, they're likely to turn to other sources, we've got four responses"
1292.76,1298.54," to this. One, Western relations are much more critical for Saudi Arabia than relations with"
1298.54,1302.2," Russia and China. We gave you this analysis in our first speech, right? The fact that"
1302.2,1308.54," it's not just military arms, it's the general relations of the U.S. It's having three seats at the Security Council, no thank"
1308.54,1314.4, you. It's having access to 60% of the global export market rather than 5% of the export
1314.4,1319.14," market. But secondly, I'm going to explain in my speech why things like Iran are more"
1319.14,1323.42," likely to de-escalate rather than take control over the situation in Yemen, meaning that's"
1323.42,1328.0," not bearing the source of Saudi incentives. Thirdly, we explained in our first speech that it's incredibly"
1328.0,1332.0, hard for Saudi Arabia to militarily adapt at the point where they literally have to
1332.0,1336.0, shift to completely different technology. They have to completely change the military
1336.0,1341.0," infrastructure that they have, completely change the way it works. It's going to take"
1341.0,1345.0," a significant time gap. But even if they do make the shift, that time"
1345.0,1349.0, gap is one where they'll save millions of lives in Yemen.
1349.0,1354.0," Fourthly, the last thing to say is that alternative actors are unlikely to be available, which"
1354.0,1355.0, brings me to the second issue.
1355.0,1357.0, They say alternative actors are much worse.
1357.0,1360.0," These are actors like Russia, China, and Israel."
1360.0,1365.96," Firstly, let's talk about why Russia is unlikely to take on China in terms of giving them significant military arms."
1366.22,1367.22, Another reason is this.
1367.48,1373.96," One, no, frankly, they have a significant alliance with Iran and Syria in terms of things like supplying them arms,"
1374.14,1377.66, which means Saudi Arabia is unlikely to accept these deals in the first place.
1377.92,1385.66," In 2012, we saw that a $120 million deal in military sales was rejected by Saudi Arabia on grounds that Russia"
1385.66,1387.22, was funding Iran.
1387.56,1391.84," Secondly, the fact that Russia's economy isn't exactly in a situation where they can afford"
1391.84,1393.18," two different actors, right?"
1393.32,1397.1," Which means the one they are likely to pick is Iran, which has geographical proximity,"
1397.24,1400.86," no vacuum, and is a country which they've had historic relations with."
1401.1,1404.42," China, we explained, is going on a moderate, peaceful rise, right?"
1404.54,1405.12, And at that point
1405.12,1409.2, they don't really want to undermine their reputation as an actor who's engaging in this
1409.2,1414.64, kind of peaceful rights and are unlikely to pick south africa in order to find these parts secondly
1414.64,1419.84, they say israel will be the remaining power and that's incredibly problematic outside of the fact
1419.84,1424.8, that israel will is unlikely to be the remaining power that the west turns to at the point where
1424.8,1428.32," they don't have a seat on the gulf council they don't have a seat on OPEC,"
1428.48,1432.76," and they don't have access to energy, we don't think Israel is nearly as harmful as"
1432.76,1438.4," an actor. At the point where in the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2018, 170 people have been killed."
1438.62,1443.74," In Yemen, it's been 10,000. But lastly, this is likely to have a marginal effect at the"
1443.74,1445.0, point where the U where the US has already
1445.0,1450.0, a significantly strong alliance with Israel that doesn't really change much.
1450.0,1453.0, Contrast this against the material which we taught you.
1453.0,1457.0," First in terms of a principle, we taught you that our military-tistic cooperation with"
1457.0,1463.0, Saudi Arabia is cooperation in the murder of millions of citizens because it is instrumental
1463.0,1466.1, in the destruction of people's lives in Yemen.
1466.46,1468.18, They say this is an extension of the right
1468.18,1469.72," to self-defense. First,"
1469.92,1471.98, we explain this is not the motivation of
1471.98,1473.94, Saudi Arabia realizing. They conceive
1473.94,1475.96, this when they say the incentive for Saudi
1475.96,1477.72, Arabia to go into Yemen is their
1477.72,1480.22, image as a bastion of Sunni majority
1480.22,1482.16," and control. Given that,"
1482.24,1483.7," we think that on their side of the house,"
1483.7,1490.5," if they are willing to commit atrocities just to expand the efficiency of warfare, we think that's incredibly problematic."
1490.78,1495.58," Atrocities should never be endorsed by the West. But secondly, we explain to you that"
1495.58,1501.2," we stop the atrocities in Yemen, right, insofar as even if they accept these conditions, it"
1501.2,1505.26, is structurally impossible for them to transition to an entirely different
1505.26,1509.86, source of arms. The fact that we need our firepower and are therefore likely to need
1509.86,1515.3," our conditions. But crucially, now they know that the American and French veto won't protect"
1515.3,1520.74," them anymore, which deters them from engaging in these kinds of atrocities in the future."
1521.2,1526.4, Yemeni children are being slaughtered everywhere. That is the largest impact on
1526.4,1532.08, this debate. Insofar as we are able to solve the single biggest humanitarian crisis occurring
1532.08,1536.76," in the world right now, we take on this debate. It is time to put Saudi at an arm's length."
1536.9,1537.12, Yes?
1537.88,1542.06, So what do you think is more important to Saudi Arabia? The fact that Yemen is now being
1542.06,1545.0," controlled by their enemy at their front door, or the"
1545.0,1547.0, fact that they might not always win the vote in the UN elections?
1547.0,1551.0," I have two responses to that. Firstly, I'm going to explain in my argument why Iran is"
1551.0,1557.0, also likely to de-escalate and therefore Yemen won't be completely controlled by their
1557.0,1561.0," biggest enemy. But secondly, we think this matters to Saudi Arabia at the point where"
1561.0,1568.44," they are losing access to a critical ally, they have to literally transition fundamentally to a different kind of military infrastructure, and they don't"
1568.44,1571.1, have arms to intervene in Yemen at all.
1571.32,1573.22, That's the comparative you have to deal with.
1573.78,1574.82, Two points in this speech.
1575.14,1580.6," First, our policy reduces the incentive for Iran and Saudi Arabia to engage in proxy conflict."
1580.9,1585.0," Second, our policy enables us to fight terror more effectively in the region."
1585.0,1590.0," First, our policy reduces the incentive for Saudi Arabia and Iran to engage in proxy conflict."
1590.0,1597.0, Proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia have taken thousands of lives in the Middle East.
1597.0,1607.0," In their world, proxy conflict is constantly inflamed and innocent people die because the West takes the side of Saudi Arabia by actively giving"
1607.0,1608.0, them military support.
1608.0,1612.0," In contrast, our policy represses the number of proxy conflicts."
1612.0,1613.0, Two sets of reasons.
1613.0,1618.0," First, negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia become more likely."
1618.0,1623.0, Notice that diplomacy is the most peaceful way of stopping the proxy conflict in Yemen.
1623.0,1625.0," However, this requires a third party,"
1625.0,1630.0, who is seen as neutral and can help these countries find some kind of common ground.
1630.0,1635.0," No, thank you. The West is currently seen as hypocritical for crippling Iran with sanctions,"
1635.0,1640.0, even as it returns a blind eye to Saudi Arabian abuses.
1640.0,1645.9," When the West ends military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, it makes it clear that it's"
1645.9,1648.5, not going to push Saudi's line never done.
1648.9,1653.74," Now when the EU pushes for negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Iran is more willing"
1653.74,1655.82, to come to the table and negotiate.
1656.08,1660.98," But secondly, no fact for it, because the incentives to endlessly fuel proxy wars reduce"
1660.98,1666.66," because as long as the West floods Saudi Arabia with guns and banks, Iran also"
1666.66,1672.16, increases its military spending year after year. When Saudi Arabia and Iran come to the
1672.16,1676.74," negotiating table, when Saudi Arabia no longer has access to the mass purchase of weapons,"
1677.04,1682.42, Iran is no longer forced to strain its economy by engaging in these same mass purchases.
1682.42,1687.4, It means they come to the negotiating table and the incentive to increase proxy conflict is defeated.
1687.76,1691.08," Secondly, our policy fights terror more effectively in the region."
1691.6,1693.74, Saudi Arabia was meant to be a partner in the region
1693.74,1696.46, to assist the West's efforts in backing terrorism.
1697.12,1701.94," However, Saudi Arabia has made the West's situation significantly worse"
1701.94,1705.7, because unconditional military support makes it harder to fight terrorist groups.
1705.88,1707.66, When military intelligence and weapons
1707.66,1709.72," fall into the hands of terror groups,"
1709.82,1710.64, it makes them stronger.
1710.9,1713.26, When Saudi Arabia funds these violent actors
1713.26,1716.24, to literally undermine the stability of regimes
1716.24,1718.5," and cause more radicalization in these regions,"
1718.8,1719.5, it's unacceptable.
1719.98,1721.92, Our policy requires Saudi Arabia
1721.92,1725.36, to actively cut funding on the weaponization of terrorists.
1725.36,1731.8," But even if the unlikely event that Saudi Arabia doesn't comply with us, our weapons aren't going into the hands of terrorists."
1732.16,1737.46, It is time to put Saudi at an arm's length and end the worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now.
1743.52,1752.5," What happens on their side is that support for the West is completely broken, and the military does not want to return to them, meaning that there's very little bargaining chip on the comparative."
1752.78,1757.0, That means that the U.S. is not able to gain the strategic concessions on their side of the house.
1757.0,1764.06, We told you furthermore that there are very strong incentives for countries like Russia to create even worse conflict within these regions.
1764.34,1767.38," Note that Russia is extremely cash-bound, and they make quite a lot of money out of"
1767.38,1767.56, this.
1767.82,1768.04, Why?
1768.32,1771.46," Firstly, for the manufacturing incentives that we already told you about."
1771.76,1775.96," Secondly, because this is likely to cause instability, quite a lot of instability, not"
1775.96,1780.86, to mention a blockade by Iran on certain important trade areas that doesn't allow Saudi Arabia
1780.86,1781.68, to get oil out.
1781.9,1786.8," What that means is that oil prices increase, threatening countries like the US, but not Russia,"
1786.8,1788.56, which has its own large oil reserves
1788.56,1790.62, that it can now sell for a higher price.
1790.62,1793.36," Also note that they just made a ton of money out of this deal,"
1793.36,1794.82, meaning that there's much more incentive
1794.82,1797.84, to whip up this information.
1797.84,1799.62," Thirdly, on precision, something that was"
1799.62,1801.38," unresponded to on their side again,"
1801.38,1803.04, note that all the civilian casualties
1803.04,1805.9," that they caused on their side of the house are increased, and moreover,"
1806.16,1808.24," they have an excuse for it now, just saying that our weapons"
1808.24,1809.94, are less precise than they were before.
1810.3,1811.76," Fourth, terrorism, again,"
1811.84,1814.0," unresponded to. And fifth, the architecture"
1814.0,1815.98, of civilian. Their response to this was
1815.98,1818.0," A, we get more proxy conflict, and"
1818.0,1819.86," B, Iran's going to back down somehow."
1820.06,1821.7," Again, both ludicrous points."
1822.0,1824.06," Firstly, because the proxy conflict that they talk"
1824.06,1828.4," about is caused, again, by deep sectarian conflicts and deep sectarian violence."
1828.4,1831.3," That's why even without the West, we're more likely to see this."
1831.3,1835.9," And even if it's not caused just by the existing and storable tensions,"
1835.9,1840.2," it's likely to be whipped up by the actors that we talk about, like Russia and China."
1840.2,1842.9," That being said, Iran's going to back down somehow."
1842.9,1844.7," Yeah, I seriously doubt that."
1844.7,1847.76," For the simple reason that Iran wants to exert more power in the region,"
1847.88,1851.58," even if it has, that's probably why it's engaging in the war in Yemen right now."
1851.84,1855.62," I want to talk lastly about how we get better liberalization on our side of the house,"
1855.68,1856.92, and how they preclude that.
1857.14,1860.66, Because MBS is uniquely reliant on the military right now.
1860.9,1866.08, Why? Because he's isolated himself from other traditional sources of power within
1866.08,1870.46," the Saudi Arabian regime. That is, he took the wealthy individuals and put them under"
1870.46,1874.9," lock and key. That is, he took the Wahhabist individuals and isolated them from his government."
1875.28,1879.98," Right now, there's a very, very tenuous support between him and the military because he wants"
1879.98,1883.78, to liberalize and he needs the military to do so. And the only way he can do that is
1883.78,1885.92," by telling the military, look, part of the West"
1885.92,1887.88, is supporting us right now. It is very
1887.88,1889.5, important to our military's strategy.
1889.82,1892.08, So you should accept some of their implementations.
1892.32,1893.96, You should accept some of their advisors.
1894.16,1895.92, And that's how you got the reforms that Brian
1895.92,1897.92," talked about, such as training in the laws"
1897.92,1900.0," of armed conflict, something unresponded to"
1900.0,1901.96," on their side, such as the initiatives that we"
1901.96,1903.72, talked about to at least have
1903.72,1907.92," investigations with regard to civilian casualties. Again, unlikely on their side of the house."
1908.26,1911.8, They're likely to get far more backlash at the point at which the military and the general
1911.8,1916.08, public see the West pulling out from this conflict and no longer supporting them.
1916.34,1920.44, Note this is incredibly important because Iran is seen as an existential threat to Saudi
1920.44,1920.78, Arabia.
1920.78,1930.38," What then occurs is that the general public and the people in government, the military persons within power, are likely to not only fund a more extreme sect that"
1930.38,1936.06," supports groups like Russia or extremist interpretations of Islam, but also to seek even more extremist"
1936.06,1940.56," violence against these groups of people, counteracting exactly what the West stands for, because"
1940.56,1944.32," now they hate the West. They see the West as the one to abandon them, left them alone"
1944.32,1945.5, against Iran.
1945.5,1947.5," So therefore, they increase violence,"
1947.5,1949.5, and they reject all of the change that MBS
1949.5,1951.5," has been getting under this rule,"
1951.5,1953.5, like allowing for Western media to come in
1953.5,1954.5," and change the opinions of people,"
1954.5,1956.0," like allowing women to drive,"
1956.0,1958.5, and like allowing for more basic protections for the people.
1958.5,1960.5," These are all incredibly important,"
1960.5,1962.5, because we show a slow but steady progress
1962.5,1964.5, that they completely preclude.
1964.5,1966.0, I'm very proud of the two of us.
1971.0,1974.0, Step back for a second and assume their very best case.
1974.0,1980.0," That China and Russia, despite all of the incentives we told you, actually want to fund South Asia."
1980.0,1982.0, They never answered the fundamental question.
1982.0,1986.76, How many years does it take to set up an entirely different military infrastructure?
1987.2,1989.76, That was the first point from the Prime Minister's speech.
1990.0,1992.9," That in their best case, other actors wanted to fill this gap."
1992.9,1998.48, We have that precious gap of seven months where Saudi Arabia's military isn't that capable anymore.
1998.66,2001.48, We can get foreign murder and children on the ground who are starving.
2001.76,2003.48, We can stop the bombing of hospitals.
2003.76,2008.24," Why was that not something that they cared for, panel? The most important impact in this debate."
2008.48,2012.56, The reason that we used Kikol to no B.O.I. whatsoever was because they realized this
2012.56,2017.52, slow but steady progress had a cost too far for the West to bear. It was young children
2017.52,2022.24, bleeding out on the streets because of weapons that we gave them. That was never a word we
2022.24,2028.88," were willing to stand for. It is time to put Saudi Arabia at arm's length. Three questions in this debate. Firstly, is it legitimate"
2028.88,2033.72," for the West to subsidise and enable war crimes? Secondly, how does it affect the actions of"
2033.72,2037.96," Saudi Arabia? And thirdly, how does it affect the Middle East? On the first question, is"
2037.96,2042.52, it legitimate for the West to subsidise and enable war crimes? We told you Saudi Arabia
2042.52,2045.0, is doing something truly horrible. On the scale
2045.0,2049.8," of the Mormon abhorrent, it affected 17 million civilians in Yemen. To that, the response"
2049.8,2054.6," was self-defense, guys. You need to tell me why this unique form of warfare isn't self-defense."
2055.0,2060.14," Firstly, this was never self-defense. Saudi Arabia installed a government in Yemen, and"
2060.14,2064.06," when that government got overthrown, Saudi Arabia stepped in because they wanted to protect"
2064.06,2065.26, their interests outside.
2065.54,2070.14," But furthermore, even if this was self-defense, this is not a proportional response."
2070.46,2075.04, Killing civilians who never had any problem with Saudi Arabia is not a proportional response.
2075.26,2077.4, That should never be accepted as self-defense.
2077.66,2081.96," Furthermore, their burden was more than just to say Saudi Arabia deserves the right to self-defense."
2081.96,2086.06," They needed to tell you why we should fund these atrocities, why we should actively"
2086.06,2088.0, put guns in their hands that we know they're
2088.0,2089.72, going to use to train on civilians.
2090.04,2091.6," They come at us with rhetoric like,"
2091.8,2093.74, the West shouldn't take the easy way out. Without
2093.74,2095.84," realizing, they are the easy way out. When you"
2095.84,2097.82, actively get profits from companies within
2097.82,2099.7," the US and the UK, and continue"
2099.7,2102.04," perpetuating horrible humanitarian crises,"
2102.38,2103.9, that's the world where the West takes
2103.9,2108.84," the easy way out. We realized something important. that it doesn't matter, principally, if"
2108.84,2113.28, others were going to do it as well. If other people were going to use sexual assault as
2113.28,2116.92," a weapon of warfare, we weren't going to go teach the Saudi Arabians how to do it"
2116.92,2121.42, slightly better. We weren't going to use chemical bombs slightly better if we knew
2121.42,2125.08, that they were going to do it anyway. There are certain things where we draw the line.
2125.34,2129.7," We say that for the sake of humanity, you are not mathematical numbers on a counting"
2129.7,2131.92," sheet, but we will not draw certain lines."
2132.2,2135.5, Why in the world is that not a principle that they dealt with in the panel is something
2135.5,2137.12, that we really need to ask.
2137.36,2141.86, The important framing of this panel is that even if their side's analysis on that one
2141.86,2144.74," argument is true and others within the gap, it takes time."
2144.74,2145.0," Our entire case has been how that gap that we argument is true and others within the gap, it takes time."
2145.0,2150.0, Our entire case has been how that gap that we get is uniquely important and gives us
2150.0,2153.0, relief that they will never get on their session house. The fact that after two speeches they
2153.0,2158.0," have no response to this is simply abhorrent. Then they poke a couple of holes. They say,"
2158.0,2163.0," Aha! We got you. You're trading with them. Here's the thing, panel. This trade is something"
2163.0,2165.0, that they can't use to buy our weapons anymore
2165.0,2168.0, because of the fact that we aren't letting them buy it.
2168.0,2173.0," And furthermore, we already told you, if this goes too far, we will put sanctions on the most elite."
2173.0,2175.0," And as a result, we're willing to scale it up."
2175.0,2177.0," At the end of the day, it's a simple principle."
2177.0,2180.0, Your guns are shooting Yemeni women on the street.
2180.0,2182.0, Should you be complicit in that abuse?
2182.0,2189.1, It doesn't matter if someone else were to fund Rwandan genocide. You shouldn't do it just because other people might be doing it.
2189.1,2190.76, That's a principle that we have to set.
2190.76,2196.1," And the second one. How does Saudi Arabia point out? We need to ask the question, do"
2196.1,2199.7," they care more about Yemen or the military? And let's be clear, they tell you why you"
2199.7,2203.72, would never go to Russia and China. Because you literally can't aim with the weapons
2203.72,2209.5," that you have. I mean, seriously, if their weapons are so bad, then I don't know where the tank's missile is going to go."
2209.5,2216.5, Why in the world would I as Saudi Arabia give away my fancy laser-guided jets in return for a tank which I can't aim or drive?
2216.5,2218.5, They give you that least amount within their own switch.
2218.5,2224.5," Furthermore, Yemen is not an existential threat to Saudi Arabia because our condition wasn't that they can't have defense,"
2224.5,2226.0, but they should stop humanitarian
2226.0,2228.06," abuses. So, if South Arabia"
2228.06,2230.3," were to stop committing humanitarian abuses,"
2230.58,2232.1," release the blockade, then they get"
2232.1,2234.2," to keep our military as defense, which means"
2234.2,2236.36, there is no existential threat anymore.
2236.54,2238.28, Which means that Yemen can't actually propose
2238.28,2240.06," a threat. Which means at the end of the day,"
2240.26,2242.14," they give you the reasons why you're very, very"
2242.14,2244.2," little likely, as South Arabia, to pivot"
2244.2,2245.0, away from the US.
2245.0,2252.0," But there's a little more. When they brought up MBS's legitimacy, they say the military controls MBS and as a result he needs their support."
2252.0,2259.0, That's absolutely wrong. The isolating himself from the top they speak about is literally a purge that put him in the sole position of power.
2259.0,2269.1," He has the ability and strength now to control South Arabian foreign policy. And it's in his incentive to cooperate with the US. Why? Because his policy of liberalization, Vision"
2269.1,2274.06," 2030, is uniquely something that relies on the US to cooperate on economic and military"
2274.06,2278.66, backgrounds. What that means is that we uniquely give the incentives of the person on the top
2278.66,2282.94," and make them have a reason to change. At the end of the day, they themselves shoot"
2282.94,2287.84, themselves in the foot with a very inaccurate gun when they tell you that's why they won't be moving forward.
2288.36,2292.26," Next, okay, let's look at Russia. We gave you a couple of reasons why they won't want"
2292.26,2296.14," to fund this. Iran, they say they will fund both sides because they live in two small"
2296.14,2300.88," African states. Iran is not Ethiopia. They will put up a big, big fight. Also, because"
2300.88,2309.5," of how it's planned based on ideology, Saudi Arabia will never accept this. But let's go further. Saudi Arabia is funding the Shia Muslim rebels within Russia."
2309.5,2315.5, What that means is that there is no world in which Russia actually extends military aid to Saudi Arabia towards its increased interests.
2315.5,2322.5," Furthermore, even if they want to do, they can't. Their economy won't allow them to do, because they simply don't have the resources to do so."
2322.5,2325.02, That takes out Russia. Then let's move to China.
2329.22,2329.52, We told you I won't do it because it goes up against every single other economic policy.
2335.64,2335.94, The one-bedroom road we all inherently know a lot about is something that they would not violate for this one-station area.
2341.76,2347.0," Also, they can't because China makes up 5% of the world's export market, while 60% is the West. If we can cut down Saudi Arabia's military to an eighth, we will do that any day. Yes."
2347.0,2354.0, The issue is that Chinese drones and Rostec weaponry is already being used in these countries. They'll just implement it to a far larger extent on your side of the house.
2354.0,2357.0, That's nice incentive analysis that doesn't hold up in the real world.
2357.0,2363.0, One eighth. That's the fraction to which the Saudi Arabian military will shame. We're perfectly happy for that to happen.
2363.0,2367.82," Lastly, are these actors actually worse? Because when they say finally we have a bargaining chip, what that"
2367.82,2371.4, means is you'll threaten to remove funding for the military if you do something wrong.
2371.56,2375.4," That sounds a lot like our policy panel, which means at the end of the day, the only measure"
2375.4,2379.26, for accountability they ever had on the Saudi Arabian military at the end of the day was
2379.26,2383.54," our policy. They never truly proved why Saudi Arabia would act badly, give you a reason"
2383.54,2385.1," for the act, according to this."
2385.44,2387.46, Third question. How does this affect the Middle East?
2387.72,2390.06," We told you about Iran, and that was huge."
2390.22,2392.5," Because they dismissed this saying, oh, Iran will never change."
2392.68,2397.44," But the moment in which Iran actually used the rhetoric of, oh, look, we've got the West to get out of Yemen,"
2397.74,2401.52, that is when the more extremist elements within Iran actually get to the table.
2401.76,2404.92," That is when we had negotiations, when we stopped them from nuclearizing."
2407.0,2412.0," If they wanted to talk about the tensions in the Middle East, they needed to deal with this argument. All they had was something on Israel. But here's the thing,"
2412.0,2416.0, Israel isn't going to hide our tensions in any way. Where is the way between that and
2416.0,2420.0, the massive harm in Yemen? They were never a side that wanted to be competitive on their
2420.0,2429.54," harm's weak work. We thought about terrorism, on how on their side of the house, Saudi Arabia actively funds terrorism, which destabilises the Middle East even more. At the end of the"
2429.54,2434.04," day, they fell back to oil prices. But here's the thing, Saudi Arabia owns 60% of their"
2434.04,2438.2," exports on oil prices. If the West can't buy, they're calling tax. There's absolutely"
2438.2,2443.18," no incentive on Saudi Arabia to do this. At the end of the day, panel, on principle, I"
2443.18,2445.0, do not want my guns going into someone's hand
2445.0,2447.0, if they're going to shoot innocent civilians.
2447.0,2450.0, I don't care if other people might fund these people as well.
2450.0,2455.0," On outcome, South Korea's incentives are perfectly aligned to listening to this deal."
2455.0,2470.54, We should take an arm away from South Korea. The refrain from Proposition 5 is very clear.
2470.98,2474.28," That when your hands are clean, they're clean because you're not involved."
2474.28,2479.02," We told you, clean hands don't ignore the casualties of innocent civilians."
2479.42,2481.96, They don't ignore the collateral of carbon bombing.
2482.22,2488.6, And they don't ignore the silence and the echoes in the streets that have been massacred. Because for all the problems they point out in the status
2488.6,2494.86," quo, we told you the alternative was far worse. And I'm sorry, but Team India may like to"
2494.86,2499.84," rest on a principle of victory, but that principle of victory doesn't resound in the minds of"
2499.84,2507.76," those who are suffering, very proud to oppose. I have three questions in my speech. First, I want to talk about the principle of whether or not it's justified."
2508.12,2514.24," Secondly, I want to talk about whether or not they will accept this deal. And finally, I want to talk about the idea of stability."
2514.34,2521.62," So first, let's talk about their principle. Because they said that there were some lines you don't cross and if you cross them, we're guilty."
2521.68,2527.46," Even though in the very first speaker, they gave us a huge concession because they were complicit in these crimes."
2527.72,2529.1, The moment at which they continued
2529.1,2530.3," trading with these countries,"
2530.62,2531.84, continued giving them the funding
2531.84,2534.26," that they could use to spend on military expenses,"
2534.62,2536.48, no verification on that front.
2536.66,2539.92, But we told you that this was an easy way out
2539.92,2542.2," because if you did not step up to the throne,"
2542.2,2544.98, what happened was that other actors would.
2545.26,2552.64, And those actors would be far worse because their principle was entirely contingent on the practicality that things wouldn't get worse.
2552.88,2557.5," And we told you that in any day, we would prioritize lies over principled victories."
2557.84,2561.42," Second question, let us talk about whether or not they'll accept this actor."
2561.68,2566.18," Because Third Pop seems to think that the moment this deal is cast, the military of"
2566.18,2568.3, Saudi Arabia will be cut by 1A.
2568.54,2570.1," Well, let's just do some basic maths"
2570.1,2571.52," here, because we're all Asians, right?"
2571.78,2574.1, We think that if they keep all the
2574.1,2576.06, military infrastructure they already have
2576.06,2578.0," from America, and they don't take any of that away,"
2578.22,2580.0, and then they start buying more things
2580.0,2582.2," from other countries like Russia, then the military"
2582.2,2584.16," doesn't actually diminish by that much, right?"
2584.38,2591.72," But notice, their whole case is premised on this fact that your arsenal is useless without the USA."
2592.18,2597.36," Firstly, that's not true. In the vast majority of instances, it's just far less accurate."
2597.66,2601.96," The reason why this is the case is, bombs don't simply defuse if the US stops supporting you."
2602.24,2605.0, Jets don't simply stop working if the US stops supporting it.
2605.0,2608.0, Because all of those things in their arsenal still work.
2608.0,2610.0," They just don't have the nice reconnaissance of the USA,"
2610.0,2613.0, which means you get more collateral on their side of the house.
2613.0,2617.0," But note, the time gap that they want to premise their entire case on"
2617.0,2619.0," is largely imagined, because we told you,"
2619.0,2622.0, Saudi Arabia would immediately turn to Russia.
2622.0,2625.0," And we conceded. Even if this time gap existed, they"
2625.0,2628.0, said that at most it would be seven months.
2628.0,2630.0," We think that in those seven months,"
2630.0,2631.0, you may save some people.
2631.0,2633.0," But after that, we think Saudi Arabia"
2633.0,2636.0, is far more likely to default and to kill more people.
2636.0,2638.0," Because most importantly, they never"
2638.0,2641.0, understood the structural analysis we gave you.
2641.0,2644.0," We told you that a Western relationship may be important,"
2644.0,2645.42," and UN votes may be important,"
2645.8,2648.1, but the land that you live on is far more important.
2648.42,2648.64, Why?
2648.88,2655.34," Because of the precarious context of the Middle East, a context that is divided by religious"
2655.34,2660.46," fault lines that go back hundreds and hundreds of years, that is divided by Sunni and Shia"
2660.46,2662.6, Muslims who constantly fight over each other.
2662.9,2667.48," Note that on our side of the house, that Saudi Arabia is the protectorate of Sunni religion."
2667.62,2672.18," And on their side, what they do is, they ultimately are far more likely to do this, because they"
2672.18,2676.68," prioritize that religion over anything else, not just UN votes."
2677.0,2681.06," But let's talk about the idea of negotiations, because they seem to think that negotiations"
2681.06,2684.38," are far more likely, because you force people to the table."
2684.6,2685.78, We gave you a few responses.
2686.2,2689.26," Number one, there is no incentive to negotiate in proxy wars"
2689.26,2692.42, because it's most of the time not your soldiers who are dying.
2692.74,2696.42," But second, negotiations on premise are of equal bargaining power."
2696.72,2699.94," So when you neuter the effectiveness of Saudi's military,"
2700.26,2701.78," we don't think that Iran's going to be like,"
2701.9,2703.86," oh, perfect, I can just stop spending less on my military."
2703.96,2705.28, Let's all just think cool by now together.
2705.54,2712.08," It will seize this opportunity because the balance of powers has disrupted, and they will capitalize on it."
2712.3,2717.78," Those who have been fighting the policy war for the past four years, and they're going to continue capitalizing on it."
2717.94,2721.26," The moment we're starting right now, can no longer sustain that fight."
2721.54,2727.18, We think what happens is you now subject a large majority of the Middle East to the tyranny of Iran.
2727.18,2729.46, You subject Sunni Muslims to that oppression
2729.46,2731.62, and to the massacres that occur again
2731.62,2733.98, by their side and by those people.
2733.98,2736.32," But more importantly, we told you that on our side"
2736.32,2738.54," of the house, responses they never engaged with,"
2738.54,2740.52, that Russia was likely to come up.
2740.52,2742.78," And even though they said, well, they're funding Iran,"
2742.78,2749.82," so they won't fund this place, we told you that Russia is happy to fund both sides, because they've primordialized themselves over other people."
2750.06,2752.96," And if you're funding both sides of the war, that's double the profit."
2753.22,2761.22," We told you examples like Vietnam and China, examples like Ethiopia and Ethiopia, examples like Sudan and South Sudan, no response to any of this."
2761.44,2765.84," And then suddenly they try to say, well, their economy is kind of failing right now, so they clearly can't do this."
2765.84,2767.4," Yeah, here's a problem."
2767.4,2769.44, The reason why it's failing is because there are sanctions
2769.44,2770.7, that limit exports.
2770.7,2772.88," Now, you have a very convenient country"
2772.88,2775.08, that wants to export millions and millions of guns.
2775.08,2778.24," So to that extent, your country's economy gets a lot better"
2778.24,2780.7, because you can develop your manufacturing industry.
2780.7,2782.72, Note the fact that Russia is the second largest
2782.72,2784.5," arms export in the world,"
2784.5,2786.0, that 20% of the
2786.0,2788.0, manufacturing industry is based on exporting arms.
2788.0,2790.0, No response to any of that.
2790.0,2793.0, But let's talk finally about the idea of stability.
2793.0,2794.0," Before that, Shor."
2794.0,2798.0, Say South India's military really wanted to use human shields.
2798.0,2801.0," If you couldn't convince them not to, would you teach them how to do it properly?"
2801.0,2803.0," What? That's ridiculous, right?"
2803.0,2806.0," We're saying that on house to the house, in just the way of people who are going to do it properly. What? That's ridiculous, right? We're saying that on our side of the house, it's just a wave"
2806.0,2808.0, of people who are gonna doubt it. That our side
2808.0,2810.0, has less people than on your side
2810.0,2812.0, of the house. And based on
2812.0,2814.0," the analogies you made, it's not gonna solve any"
2814.0,2816.0, of them. So let's actually just talk about
2816.0,2818.0, the idea of casualties. Because while it's
2818.0,2820.0," nice to glib and then to make jokes, we gave you"
2820.0,2822.0, four structural reasons as to why the West
2822.0,2824.0," limits atrocities. Number one, because"
2824.0,2826.0," there is documentation of war. Number one, because there is documentation of war."
2826.0,2831.0," Number two, because there is now an official investigative bureau for civilian casualties."
2831.0,2837.0," Number three, because as we said, Saudi soldiers have required training on the laws of armed conflict."
2837.0,2843.0, Why was that the case? Because of the soft pressure that the West is able to exert on Saudi Arabia
2843.0,2845.06, that immediately disappears because
2845.06,2849.04, any semblance of that leverage is immediately gone if you pull out entirely.
2849.34,2853.78, And we told you that that leverage never exists when they were supported by Russia for two
2853.78,2854.1, reasons.
2854.34,2857.16," Number one, because Russia had no democratic accountability."
2857.6,2863.0," And more importantly, they always had a disregard for international law, which means that they're"
2863.0,2865.0, happy to do things like violate international law
2865.0,2870.0, to use nerve gas because they simply don't care. And we told you more importantly about how there are
2870.0,2874.0," less precise weapons. And I know that I've made a joke about how people wouldn't use inaccurate weapons,"
2874.0,2878.0," but come on guys, Iran is using those weapons and they're killing lots of people, right?"
2878.0,2883.0," We think that inaccurate weapons are still better than no weapons, right? So on our side of the house,"
2883.0,2887.44, you're still going to get those weapons even if they're marginally less accurate. But here's
2887.44,2892.26, the problem. That marginal inaccuracy is something that's reflected in civilian casualties.
2892.46,2896.3, It's reflected in the body bags that occur because you don't know if you're killing
2896.3,2900.82," the right person. Finally, let's talk about the idea of stability. Because we told you"
2900.82,2907.0, that NSC's ability to reform is highly based on the idea of a dependency of the military.
2907.0,2911.5," Not like the purges that occurred, or purges that were done with the support of the military."
2911.5,2917.0," In Saudi Arabia, you immediately lose that support the moment in which you knew the effectiveness of the military."
2917.0,2925.2," What happens is, you're far more or less likely to have either MSBS being kicked out entirely, or more feasibly, is going to have to default"
2925.2,2930.0," onto religious extremism, onto Wahhabism, because those are the other political elites"
2930.0,2933.52," that are likely to support him. So if you don't have them inside the House, you roll"
2933.52,2937.56," back the effectiveness of reforms. And this is most important, because in those places,"
2937.9,2941.72, there are disempowered minorities who never had the right to vote. There is economic
2941.72,2946.12," diversification that stops, so that people who don't have oil, who still"
2946.12,2947.76," lie, indigent. We hope to"
2947.76,2949.56, have a house that will crucially
2949.56,2951.9," empower people, not only in Saudi Arabia,"
2952.12,2953.76," but around the world, because they never"
2953.76,2955.64," dealt with the counterfactual, they never dealt with"
2955.64,2957.4, casualties we were happy to oppose.
2963.2,2969.56," Panel, it's easy to point at the people who have died and at the same time ignore those"
2969.56,2971.2, who have been saved.
2971.2,2975.76, We think on team opposition that the West should no longer stand on its stanchions of
2975.76,2980.72, righteousness if they rest on the backs of those who would otherwise suffer.
2980.72,2988.02," If pulling out means more people die, then we think the greatest moral hazard is letting more people die because you have pulled out."
2988.22,2990.62, We're going to talk about two things in this reply.
2990.94,2992.36," Firstly, what is a comparative?"
2992.8,2994.3," And secondly, why we have won."
2994.6,2996.2," Firstly then, what was a comparative?"
2996.64,2999.6, Because Team India's line came upon two assumptions.
3000.08,3004.22," The first one, that Saudi Arabia would be willing to take their ludicrous deal."
3004.48,3007.46," And the second one, that Iran would be willing to step down."
3007.76,3008.64, But that was problematic.
3009.0,3014.1," Because firstly, we explained to you that Saudi Arabia would never be willing to go back to the U.S."
3014.1,3017.96," Because its objectives in Yemen and the religious tensions that always existed,"
3018.24,3021.48," historically and religiously, were far too important."
3021.68,3025.18, And we told you that Saudi Arabia could cannot capitulate at the hands of the
3025.18,3030.48," West because it loses MBS his position of power. That when he is gone, you can't go"
3030.48,3034.36, back to the West because the ones that are able to come into power are the ones that
3034.36,3039.94," will never accept the deal from who they think is the devil. But secondly, we explained to"
3039.94,3044.34," you that Iran would never be able to step down. And I may be from China, but I think"
3044.34,3048.1, religion is worth more than access to the iPhone export market.
3048.34,3054.18," Because importantly, the reasons for conflict were much deeper than just access to trade and UN votes."
3054.18,3058.12, The reasons were religious fault lines that existed for centuries beyond them.
3058.3,3061.08," That the ancestral blood had been spilled upon those grounds,"
3061.36,3065.34, and those were grounds that they were going to defend with their own minds.
3065.54,3070.34," That was why we told you, the sectarian conflict may be in the status quo held by deterrence,"
3070.68,3073.46," but the point at which you incapacitate one of those members,"
3073.68,3078.74," when Saudi Arabia has no ability to defend itself, that was when Iran was willing to run rampant."
3078.74,3085.98, When the Shiite world can empower people to take out every single person that disagrees with them in the status quo.
3086.42,3088.34," Secondly then, what was the comparative?"
3088.76,3091.82," Because even when we took them at their best case, we told you,"
3092.08,3094.28," sure, you get seven months of peace."
3094.62,3099.08," Sure, we are going to allow you to have that peace and you can step in for that short amount of time."
3099.28,3102.58, But that never stood against the 20 years of war that might ensue.
3102.86,3110.32," Weapons that are going to kill six times more civilians. Because yes, on both sides you're able to kill your target, but the important problem"
3110.32,3115.0, is that you kill all the civilians around them when you take away their ability to have accurate
3115.0,3120.42, weapons. We told you that no one would try to keep Saudi Arabia in check because the West had
3120.42,3128.92," pulled out and the only ones that stayed are the ones that profit off of continual war. We told you that Russia would continue to fund them fighting, and it's not enough for"
3128.92,3132.68," them to just say, Iran might protest because you fund Saudi Arabia too."
3133.02,3136.58," Because at the point at which they protest, they have no guns and their people die."
3136.8,3140.4," So it meant that they're put in a position where they have to accept the Russian arms,"
3140.58,3144.88, where they have to continually be played at the war game that Russia profits off of if
3144.88,3146.98, their people die on the streets of them.
3147.12,3152.0," And even in their best case scenario, when Saudi Arabia is put down to the ground, we"
3152.0,3154.48, told you that their people would continue to get massacred.
3154.7,3159.12, Because the religious fault lines that incentivize war right now are ones that stayed on their
3159.12,3159.7, side too.
3160.04,3163.56, It's just the problem is that only one side can actually fight that war and the other
3163.56,3164.6, side dies.
3164.9,3167.16, We told you then that our comparative was much better.
3167.54,3170.32," Because sure, we sell weapons that can kill people."
3170.58,3174.16," But we can moderate who you kill that, because there are checks and balances."
3174.5,3179.48," We told you that you prevent the war game from ever happening, because Russia doesn't get to control both sides."
3179.48,3187.2," And ultimately, sure, the West may not be principally just, but less people are going to die in the Middle East."
3187.42,3191.48," So no matter how high the pillar that the West is able to stand on on their side,"
3191.76,3196.02, we tell you that it is not justified if more people are going to die on our side.
3196.16,3201.5," If the liberalization that has come so crucially is going to be rolled back to the people who live in Saudi Arabia,"
3201.76,3209.0, that the innocent civilians in Yemen are going to be killed on six-fold because the weapons can't even identify the individuals. We tell you
3209.0,3213.0, that that was not a principle that we were willing to stand by because the death of the
3213.0,3216.0, innocent was much more important. We are very proud to oppose.
3222.0,3226.38," At the end of that debate, you still find King China's principle plausible?"
3226.98,3230.28, Ask yourself the very simple first question we asked you.
3230.7,3233.2, How would you explain this to a Yemeni child?
3233.62,3237.58, You would probably struggle the same way they did to respond to that POI.
3237.58,3241.28, We say it is time to put Saudi at arm's length.
3241.6,3242.5, Two questions then.
3242.76,3246.64," One, should the West aid in a vet war crime? Second, let's"
3246.64,3252.02," talk about Yemeni children. First, should the West aid in a vet war crime? They left"
3252.02,3257.04," this territory quite unguarded, right? Because their simple response that came in first speech"
3257.04,3261.68, and never involved beyond that was this idea that there's a right to Saudi. What is the
3261.68,3265.82," reality of this? It's Yemen, which is not inside Saudi Arabia,"
3266.28,3268.6," which is not directly threatening Saudi Arabia,"
3268.7,3271.44," but in some forests in Yemen, some region,"
3272.22,3275.94," having been subject to war crimes from Saudi Arabia,"
3276.04,3279.18," where marriages, schools, hospitals, and courts are being bought."
3279.5,3282.46, They had a very weird conception of what self-defense meant.
3282.76,3286.12," But even then, they considered this principle."
3286.26,3287.4, They realized they couldn't win it.
3287.64,3289.28," But by third speech, all they could say was,"
3289.5,3292.02," oh no, the principle of victory comes if you save lives."
3292.5,3294.52," Problem is, a principle was"
3294.52,3295.32," lives, right?"
3295.46,3298.56, The fact that you are perpetrating crimes against humanity
3298.56,3300.74, and providing them with the most effective
3300.74,3302.14, tools to perpetrate this
3302.14,3304.34, meant that you required principally
3304.34,3305.4, to remove them.
3305.4,3310.62," These are deliberate crimes against humanity, planned and perpetrated."
3310.62,3314.94, These are things like leaking our weapons to terrorists which means that the deadliest
3314.94,3319.3, weapons go to the worst terrorists. They got to a moment that they thought they had and the
3319.3,3324.38," response was ah, but what about trade without realizing that if arms cause a problem"
3324.38,3325.5, you pull back arms.
3325.5,3329.0, But our model went the full length. We were a bold team in this debate.
3329.0,3333.0, But what is the extent of that principle? It was truly horrific.
3333.0,3336.0, Because they said Chinese-Russian alternatives are less precise.
3336.0,3341.5, So China or Russia was right now providing human shields or chemical weapons to these nations.
3341.5,3347.24," They would say, let's, as the best, teach these nations to use these same things more effectively"
3347.24,3350.6, because that would save slightly more lives.
3350.6,3352.96, We tell you the same way they didn't respond to that POI
3352.96,3355.14," in the third speech, irrespective of the outcomes"
3355.14,3357.12, as a line that we need to draw.
3357.12,3358.88," If you're still not persuaded, again,"
3358.88,3360.04, think about the M&E check.
3360.04,3363.2," But the second thing, let's talk about the M&E check."
3363.2,3366.84," The case was a series of impacts on wide, ordinary results."
3367.3,3370.88," Here are some crucial premises that we challenged, and they couldn't really come back from."
3371.28,3373.7," First, why would Russia want this, right?"
3373.96,3380.2," The very simplistic reason is, oh, because trade is generally good, because profit is generally good."
3380.2,3382.7, But what are the nuances of this debate?
3382.78,3387.82," The fact that Saudi Arabia is literally funding Chechnya dribbles against the Russian government,"
3388.08,3391.38," that Iran is on the border of Russia, always a more strategic island."
3391.58,3394.5," So you can say, ah, Russia wants to fund both sides."
3394.86,3398.08," But the problem is, Iran doesn't want Russia to fund both sides."
3398.08,3401.48," If you want Iran, you probably want to maintain that exclusively, right?"
3401.88,3407.0," But it was really telling that their only example of this was Ethiopia and Iran, without responding"
3407.0,3410.0, to the scale of power that we are talking about in this debate.
3410.0,3413.0," But other than that, fortunately, Russia was just too poor"
3413.0,3415.0, for this reason to make sense.
3415.0,3418.0," But second, they then said China will do this."
3418.0,3421.0," Why? Because finally, there was one factory that they saw"
3421.0,3423.0, where China was producing its arms.
3423.0,3429.38, But we told you that it is a matter of explicit return communist party policy that it is something that you are not allowed
3429.38,3434.24," to do, to enter armed states. That's why they moved past China by the end of that period."
3434.66,3439.44," So we took out both the idea of China and in China with this. But I'm finally saying,"
3439.56,3443.12," what they failed to do is, why Saudi Arabia would want any of this? They keep pushing"
3443.12,3446.9," the idea that, oh, there's a religious tension, they want to fight with Iran."
3446.9,3449.72, Why don't they enter into bed with the same people
3449.72,3451.62," who are the polar opposite of the religion,"
3451.62,3453.78, polar opposite of the tension?
3453.78,3455.74, Because they will always reject Russia.
3455.74,3458.08," But generally, we told you, that it takes time"
3458.08,3461.36," to build an entirely new infrastructure as a military,"
3461.36,3462.62, no response.
3462.62,3464.32," Even if they want to talk about MBS,"
3464.32,3469.04," the profit incentives lie with the West, the majority of trade lies with the West. What do they do in"
3469.04,3473.68," Yemen? They can't do this argument, but our argument was the bomb because we gave you two nuances."
3473.68,3477.94," A world where they pursue this, but we still disable them, and a world where they listen to us."
3477.94,3491.4, It is time to push Saudi at arm's length.
3495.4,3498.6," So of course, one of the things we've been looking for throughout this tournament is the integration of style, content and strategy."
3498.72,3501.0, And we really saw it in today's debates.
3501.1,3502.12, Let me start with style.
3503.1,3505.56," And first of all, because there was a split,"
3505.96,3507.66, some of our judges
3507.66,3509.86, thought that Indian style
3509.86,3511.9," was more powerful. They used rhetoric,"
3512.42,3513.26," they used humour,"
3514.02,3516.18, and who can forget the line that was
3516.18,3518.2, in the first speaker's
3518.2,3518.78," picture,"
3519.6,3521.6, shall we start tonight? No.
3522.36,3523.84," Today, no. Now."
3524.1,3531.72," Powerful use of words. So some people felt that they used the style, especially in India, to rebut what China was saying."
3531.72,3535.08, Some of us thought the rebuttal was powerful rhetorical.
3535.72,3540.34, Others thought it was a bit too glib and needed to be a bit more in-depth analysis.
3541.4,3543.96, Some thought that China's style wasn't as strong.
3544.52,3545.88," Others thought that China's style was't as strong, others thought that China's"
3545.88,3551.36," style was more analytical, focusing on the issues, perhaps less on the emotional literary."
3552.16,3557.06," But who can forget that phrase, standing on the sections of righteousness?"
3558.46,3565.28, I know they've heard that in a climate before. So really powerful use of language by both sides to make their point.
3566.48,3571.6," When we came to Conti, there were perhaps three main issues that the judges saw."
3572.14,3577.74," First of all, if the West does what India says, how will the other regions respond?"
3578.74,3582.94," Secondly, will Saudi Arabia take the deal under India's model?"
3583.66,3628.2," And finally, and we consider those two definitely, who best reduced the harm? I tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whare, tō te whareai tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō tō India was fraud and that ultimately the principal fell to China because few people died."
3628.52,3630.58, So we did have to spit a bit or not.
3630.7,3637.56," It was a good thing to do not to respond to the principal, to deny it, but to accept it and run with it."
3637.72,3639.9, And that was an issue that split us.
3640.52,3651.04," When it came to how the other actors respond, India had fairly early on lifted the different agents and said why they wouldn't respond."
3651.56,3655.32, Why Russia wouldn't respond because it was tied to Iran and Syria.
3656.36,3659.08, Why it was already a no-brainer for the debate.
3659.24,3685.64, Why China wasn't going to respond because of its policies. whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakaranga whakar in Saudi Arabia so that in fact the idea of China in principle
3685.64,3687.9, not getting involved was false.
3688.96,3689.6, The way they did
3689.6,3691.64, the split was whether
3691.64,3693.74, the attack by China
3693.74,3695.88, on the analysis by
3695.88,3697.98, India as to why the other agents
3697.98,3699.76, wouldn't respond held.
3700.3,3701.62, Some of us felt that
3701.62,3703.6, India had established strongly
3703.6,3710.44," the probability and likelihood that the other agents wouldn't interfere, or wouldn't get involved, I should say."
3710.96,3718.38," Others felt that Chama's analysis showed the more cynical approach of those other agents, that they wouldn't get involved."
3719.12,3726.94," Then was the issue of whether or not South Canada would take the deal. And India said, look at all the disadvantages,"
3728.14,3736.9," and that's the coercion that the West would put on Saudi Arabia,"
3737.8,3740.8, and how Saudi Arabia would be considerably weakened.
3740.8,3743.14," And so therefore, it would be lovely to take the deal."
3743.62,3767.96," China came back and said, well, it's a real real risk first of all. Saudi Arabia has shown through our system it's unlikely to take the deal. Look at the geopolitical alliances in the region. There's no way that Saudi Arabia is going to yield its position through the weakness of its military also there's a real risk of undermining of the power of the MDS"
3767.96,3773.06, and the reduction of the support that he would have had in order to retain power.
3773.58,3778.8, He'd have to go to extremists so that the moral that he imposed would cause more harm
3778.8,3783.88, and particularly would cause harm in the massacre of Saudi Arabians
3783.88,3786.0," because Iran would move in. And when they came back and said no, Iran wouldn't move in kawhi i te whare, i te whare i te whare i Te Tauranga, koe i te whare i Te Tauranga,"
3786.0,3788.0," i te whare i Te Tauranga,"
