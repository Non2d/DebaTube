0.0,23.0, The fact that war is hell does not give us the right to make it more hellish.
23.0,25.5, The burden that that proposition seeks to
25.5,31.0, prove in today's debate is simple. It's that lethal autonomous weapon systems make
31.0,36.02, war worse. I'm going to do this through two points of substantive in my speech. Number
36.02,41.82," one, on how lethal autonomous weapons reduce the accountability of warfare. And secondly,"
41.96,45.62, I'm going to explain how this creates an evolution in warfare that
45.62,47.58, leads to a loss of control.
47.96,51.34," But before that, what do these lethal autonomous weapons look like?"
51.52,56.82," We think that by virtue of them being autonomous, it means that after programming these machines,"
57.06,60.04, they then act in the war zone without human control.
60.2,66.0," That is to say, decisions on how to shoot and how to attack will be made by technology."
66.0,70.0, You also think that this encompasses all weapon systems in the military.
70.0,74.0," So for example, drones and for example, tanks."
74.0,80.0," In sub-step A, why would the presence of lethal, autonomous weapons decrease accountability?"
80.0,84.0, I'm going to prove three things to prove that this argument stands.
84.0,87.26," First of all, I'm going to talk about why the occurrence of war increases."
87.78,91.82," Secondly, I'm going to explain why there's little to no oversight of these weapons."
92.36,96.82," And thirdly, I'm going to speak about why it's harder to identify and punish wars."
97.22,99.98," Number one, why does the occurrence of war increase?"
99.98,105.2," In the world as we know it, there are many pre-existing tensions between nations."
105.54,108.78," These materialise, for example, in the form of territorial disputes,"
109.06,112.96, in the form of human rights violations and contrasting values.
113.28,117.74," But right now, countries do not go to war over many of these conflicts"
117.74,120.9," because they are limited by, among others, two main things."
121.0,125.74, Number one being policy makers' basic consideration for human life that will be lost
125.74,128.38, in the event of soldiers being sent to a war
128.38,130.04, and secondly because they know that
130.04,132.22, there will be public outcry at the point
132.22,134.22, at which people know that their brothers
134.22,135.92, and their fathers are being sent off
135.92,137.52, to a far land to die.
138.1,139.66, Why do lethal autonomous weapons
139.66,141.9, change this? Because they decrease
141.9,143.86, the human cost of war and they take
143.86,146.64, humans out of a large portion
146.64,153.52, of fighting of this war it means that policymakers can now do two things number one they can actively
153.52,159.04, lobby for wars to be fought for their nations to go and participate in a conflict that is happening
159.04,165.38, secondly it's also more likely that they are that they know people will not oppose these wars
165.38,170.22, because they know their citizens are less likely to be critical over the decisions they make
170.22,172.32, to go and participate in a conflict.
172.74,173.9, There are two harms to this.
173.96,176.74, The first of all being that casualties increase.
176.74,181.06," Because when wars fall, combatants are never the only people on the ground."
181.18,189.2," There are also people, civilians, left there who get caught in the crossfire. And even in the event that there are no human soldiers on the ground in the"
189.2,194.02," opposition's world, civilians are still vulnerable to these military attacks."
194.3,199.4," But secondly also, it causes massive infrastructural and economic damage to the country that is"
199.4,206.0, fighting the war. This means that it's difficult for these countries to recover after the conflict has occurred.
206.0,211.0, It means that you irreversibly damage the economies and the nation.
211.0,212.0, This is terrible.
212.0,216.0," Secondly, why is there little to no oversight of these weapons?"
216.0,223.0, I'm going to prove that there is an incentive to place these weapons on a longer leash and release much of the control.
223.0,227.0, Why so? We see precedence of this in the proliferation
227.0,232.56, of drone technology. We see that there is minimal bureaucracy surrounding drone technology
232.56,238.8," in the military in order to create a higher success rate of drone missions. In trend analysis,"
238.8,248.92," we also see that US President Donald Trump has been reducing drone restrictions such as the Presidential Policy Guidance, which protects civilians in war zones."
249.68,255.0," By virtue of being autonomous, these weapons are also likely to have little to no human"
255.0,259.0, involvement in the oversight and management and the carrying out of these missions.
259.32,261.94, It means that the oversight then decreases.
262.5,265.8," Third, why is it harder to identify and punish droids?"
266.12,269.98," Number one, because commanders and generals in the army"
269.98,273.14, are less connected to the actions of these drones.
273.26,276.14, They are then able to escape many of the consequences.
276.54,281.74, This materialises in the form of them being able to cover up botched operations
281.74,287.66," by saying, you know what, we didn't have that much oversight. Anyway, number two, the robots went rogue,"
287.66,291.04, and this is something that we cannot control.
291.04,293.24, Even if there is evidence available
293.24,295.62," from logging and tracking these robots,"
295.62,298.32," number one, the military has no incentive"
298.32,301.74, to release information of its own operations going rogue.
301.74,303.26, We see that they have the means also
303.26,308.0," to shoot this information under act, through acts, like the Official Secrets Act."
308.0,312.0," But number two, it's also highly possible that commanders and generals are able to access"
312.0,316.0," this information before anyone else does, and believe it."
316.0,318.0, What is the conclusion then to this argument?
318.0,323.0," It means that when you have lethal autonomous weapons present in the wars on the war, it's"
323.0,325.04," not only more likely, it is also more"
325.04,330.16," damaging to civilians and nations, and you reduce the accountability of the people who"
330.16,332.64," started this war. Before I move on, yes?"
332.64,337.28," Precisely because little autonomous weapons are made to be accurate, that would mean mass"
337.28,341.84, destruction wouldn't happen compared to when human soldiers are just doing a shooting spree
341.84,344.96, without any precise target. How do you respond?
344.96,345.0, Right. I think it is very unfair to let them push the premise on us that these I'm just doing a shooting spree without any precise target. How do you respond?
345.0,351.0, Right. I think it is very unfair to push the premise on us that these weapon systems are by virtue of themselves.
351.0,358.0," Hovec, and therefore, will not cause any damage to A, civilians, and just B, infrastructure on the ground."
358.0,365.08," When you drop a bomb on a city, it's not the one person you target who's affected in the entire radius of that bomb."
365.58,370.3," Finally, second argument, why does evolution warfare lead to a loss of control?"
370.42,372.52, I have three main strands to this argument.
372.78,376.82," First of all, I'm going to show you why lethal autonomous weapons will be merciless."
377.04,380.96," Secondly, I'm going to talk about the changing calculus of the self-learning robot."
381.64,385.24," Thirdly, I'm going to talk about the possibility and the ramifications"
385.24,390.98," of having. Number one, why are legal autonomous weapons likely to be merciless? In status"
390.98,397.02," quo, we see that much of military technology is developed privately. This means that defence"
397.02,402.8, contractors and private corporations who are producing the most merciless weapon systems
402.8,406.0, are prioritised because these are the weapon systems that
406.0,411.0, will be most successful. We also see that the military already prioritises efficiency
411.0,416.0, over ethical warfare at the point at which they're using tactics and they scourge the
416.0,422.0," earth tactic to demoralise the other side. But even if these weapon systems are not merciless,"
422.0,425.5, we just contend that the terrorists now are able
425.5,430.08," to use, for example, human shields in order to protect themselves and your missions consistently"
430.08,436.94," fail. Let's talk then about changing calculus of a self-learning robot. In some cases, we"
436.94,441.88, argue that these autonomous weapon systems will be artificial intelligence which are
441.88,445.0," able to learn, adapt and reprogram themselves."
445.0,449.0, We think that this could be the consequence in which they are able to weigh their own
449.0,455.0, objectives in order for a successful mission over civilian life.
455.0,459.0," Finally, let's talk about hacking and why the ease of hacking increases."
459.0,464.0," Traditional weapons have always been offline and by virtue of that, harder to hack."
464.0,468.0, The modernisation of military technology means that weapons are now wireless.
468.0,472.0, The lethal autonomous weapons are the best example of this.
472.0,477.0," Besides that, because these weapons are not human operated and there is a degree of separation"
477.0,482.0," between the human and the machine, it means that any hacking will be a harder to detect,"
482.0,487.0," secondly, harder to counter. We saw precedence of this happening in December"
487.0,494.0, 2011 when Iran hacked the US RG-170 drone. Why is this hacking so pernicious? Because
494.0,499.0," the military operates on centralised systems, the point at which it hackers have access"
499.0,505.3," to one drone, it can gain access to all of the other weapons that operate on that system."
505.3,513.0," And because damage percuted in war is irreversible, we think that the harms of this are very, very real."
513.0,518.7," To conclude, because missile autonomous weapons are merciless and susceptible to hijacking,"
518.7,525.28, we oppose the development of these systems. Thank you.
527.42,530.1," Proposition brings an argument, an idea that we need to have a humane and just war."
530.1,532.16," But they do the exact opposite, because the fact"
532.16,534.4, that a lethal autonomous robot would have been just as
534.4,535.94, effective in killing these people
535.94,537.86, and would have killed the people that we were sending them
537.86,541.1," to kill as well, that is the inhumane war that they bring."
541.1,542.74, When you bring only human soldiers
542.74,544.76," into the battlefield in war, you prolong it"
544.76,546.52, instead of ending it fast.
546.52,549.08, Proposition needs to engage in a scenario in which the war
549.08,551.62," happens anyways, and who creates a more effective war,"
551.62,554.68," and who creates a more efficient one, and that it ends faster."
554.68,556.44, What is the mechanism on our side of the house?
556.44,557.52," Firstly, we're going to make sure"
557.52,559.32, that these lethal autonomous robots that
559.32,561.9," will be employed are weapons that undergo rigorous testing,"
561.9,564.0, which makes it unlikely for them to malfunction.
564.0,567.32," We're going to make sure we discuss it in international talks, for example, on how April"
567.32,570.84," this year we have a convention, officer and conventional weapons, discussing the implementation"
570.84,574.16, of these lethal autonomous weapons and the boundaries that we should set for them.
574.44,578.72," Secondly, we're going to implement a self-destructing mechanism in these lethal autonomous robots,"
578.72,583.52, so if any hacking or whatsoever terrorist who wants to attack and get these information
583.52,586.0," and blueprint about these robots, it's not going to happen."
586.0,593.0," Thirdly, we don't have to defend the full and complete utilization of these weapons, because no matter how sophisticated the technology is,"
593.0,600.0," in some instances of war, such as interrogations, communication, and releasing hostages, it still requires human involvement."
600.0,603.0, So what do we envision these drones and lethal autonomous weapons to do?
603.0,607.32," Firstly, detect these targets and identities using these kinds of things,"
607.34,609.68, such as facial recognition that we already have in the status quo.
609.94,611.62," Second, calculate the risk of the weapons."
611.92,613.3," Thirdly, minimize casualty."
613.64,616.54," Fourthly, make decisions without prioritizing these self-offenses."
616.98,619.18," Fifth, function without these fatigue."
619.18,623.62," And lastly, immune to chemical and biological weapons that humans inherently have."
623.9,628.7," Before I go on to my arguments, two points of rebuttal. Firstly, Proposition says that these lethal"
628.7,633.38, atomic weapons reduce the accountability of the war. We have four responses to this.
633.6,637.54," Firstly, if Proposition talks about the cost of these human soldiers, we believe that we"
637.54,641.06," already have costs, too, on our side of the house. The cost of developing these weapons,"
641.2,645.24," the maintaining these weapons, and furthermore, these soldiers and these victims"
645.24,646.84," still die on the battlefield, we believe"
646.84,649.9, that we still have costs and consideration for the government
649.9,651.98, before they send these lethal autonomous weapons.
651.98,653.68, But what is worse on their side of the house
653.68,656.38, is the fact that they use human soldiers as that cost
656.38,658.36, for these battlefields.
658.36,660.24," And we believe that that's inherently unjustified,"
660.24,662.56, because then government can use these human soldiers
662.56,667.58," as propaganda to then justify war and, for example, like retaliating because your soldiers are dying."
667.78,671.56, We believe that these kinds of propaganda is going to be happening on their side of the house
671.56,673.12, the moment they use human soldiers.
673.48,676.94," Even if they have a cost of humans on their side of the house, the result is bad."
677.1,680.64," Because then governments will just remove their troops out of that war zone,"
680.82,683.48," as we can see with the U.S. when it drew back its troops from Afghanistan,"
683.76,687.0, it resulted in the proliferation of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda. We don't believe
687.0,692.0, that that stands. But let's look at the things such as economic damages to their nations
692.0,696.0, that what they say that there's economic costs. We don't think that this is mutually exclusive
696.0,699.0," at all because on our side of the house, the moment you go into war with these little autonomous"
699.0,702.0," weapons, you could also have economic causes that prevents these governments from going"
702.0,707.0," to war. But when they want to talk about accountability on how these commanders and generals, you"
707.0,710.0," can account them for what they do, we don't think that this is true at all."
710.0,713.0, Because the thing with human soldiers is that it's very hard for you to account them for
713.0,714.0, their crimes.
714.0,718.0, We can see in the ICC there's a lot of criminal cases and war crimes that are left untouched
718.0,720.0, by them because of human soldiers.
720.0,727.36," On the comparison, lethal autonomous weapons is very easy for you to create accountability"
727.36,731.78, there because the person that you are creating accountability to is the government and the
731.78,735.88," state, and we think that that is more accountable on our side of the house. Even if the state"
735.88,740.26," in most instances still neglects these things, there's always going to be push from the government"
740.26,744.82, to develop the technology to become better and protect these people more and make these
744.82,745.1, lethal autonomous weapons better protected. So let's go on to the first argument on why government to develop the technology to become better and protect these people more and make these lethal
745.1,747.3, autonomous weapons better protected.
747.3,749.88, So let's go into the first argument on why the
749.88,752.52, utilization of human soldiers creates a more
752.52,753.62, dangerous situation.
753.62,755.88," The war right now is state versus non-state actors,"
755.88,757.62, that is the terrorist organizations.
757.62,759.86," In the status quo, the moment we rely on ourselves"
759.86,762.12," only as human soldiers, there are many factors that"
762.12,764.1, hamper our ability to fight the war against
764.1,768.74," terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda. Two reasons. Firstly, the human soldier inherently"
768.74,773.72," has limited capacity due to the innate human characteristics. Certain fatigue, fear, environmental"
773.72,778.24," heat, and harsh streets are obstacles that make an inhuman. In the moment where we find"
778.24,782.86," another alternative, who are, for example, more precise and more long-lasting, we have"
782.86,788.5, robots in the status quo equipped with these facial recognition that can take down leaders of terrorist organizations.
788.94,790.66, We believe that we create a more effective world.
790.94,793.24," But secondly, human soldiers are inherently weaker."
793.56,801.34," When ISIS captures them because of their own psychological vulnerability and fear, they are more likely going to spill information to these terrorists in exchange of their lives."
801.68,807.0, Al-Qaeda received 55.1 million euros in ransom payments from these governments.
807.0,812.0," Furthermore, ISIS can release videos of mutilation of the soldiers and inflict fear to the public."
812.0,816.0, These kinds of things can only happen when you use human soldiers and not when you use lethal
816.0,822.0, atomic weapons. These kinds of exploitation happens with soldiers. That is the condition in an ongoing war.
822.0,828.16, But now I'll explain why proposition makes post-war rehabilitation for the soldiers worse.
828.36,834.02," Because when we utilize human soldiers in a war, proposition subjects them to a lack of post-traumatic stress disorder,"
834.3,837.46," unable to communicate normally with their parents, spouses, and children."
837.82,841.82," The most important of them all is that we doom them to a lack of suffering after the war,"
842.06,847.74, knowing that a lethal autonomous weapon would have been just as effective and accurate in combating these terrorists and rebels.
848.1,852.42," On the comparative, our side uses no human soldiers here, so there's no such thing"
852.42,856.12," such as mental illness, psychological vulnerability that come in the war."
856.36,861.06," On our side of the house, human soldiers will be deployed in much safer conditions, evacuating"
861.06,866.16," and giving aids to the civilians, peacekeeping, or giving information to the local community about the war."
866.16,869.16, Only on proposition can you protect the soldiers and the war.
869.16,872.52," Before I go on to my second argument on how we create accountability, is there any QS?"
872.52,877.0, What will happen if your robot is faced with a child soldier who would shoot it?
877.0,882.0," We believe that these robots, in the instances of these lethal autonomous robots,"
882.0,886.0," they can already sense the people who are, for example,"
886.0,890.0," needs to be shot. For example, if they see a child soldier, we can tell them to shoot,"
890.0,896.0," for example, the hands of these children so that the weapons get tackled. But on the case"
896.0,900.0," of human soldiers, you're just going to rely on, you're just going to recklessly either"
900.0,904.0," not shoot this child soldier and let this suicide, this child soldier create a lot of"
904.0,905.0," suicide bombings, or you're going to shoot that child, and let this child soldier create a lot of suicide"
905.0,908.1," bombings, or you're going to shoot that child, and we don't think that humans calculate"
908.1,908.56, this better.
908.88,912.0, But let's move on to the second argument on how we create more accountability in the
912.0,912.22, world.
912.58,916.46," When soldiers come into the war with virtuous intent, it is the harrowing conditions of"
916.46,918.5, war that strip them of their moral codes.
918.86,922.88," Despite condemnation from society, we still have war crimes being prevalent in society."
923.18,925.08, The ICC still has tons of uncovered
925.08,930.16," war crimes. I will explain this idea in three ways. Firstly, the constant exposure to extremely"
930.16,934.54, violent atmospheres and great violent tendencies in their nature. Twelve American soldiers
934.54,938.52, blew up and shot Afghan civilians at Rada and collected their fingers at the sword.
938.94,942.52," Soldiers are a tool of war that is difficult to find accountable, and their true receipt"
942.52,946.68," were these type of war zones. But secondly, in the stressful field of war,"
946.68,949.62, a lot of soldiers turn to sexual assault for consolation.
949.62,952.26," Look at the case of World War II, in which Japanese soldiers"
952.26,954.56," raped thousands of Chinese and Korean women,"
954.56,956.14, turning them into sex slaves.
956.14,959.24, United States soldiers in Haiti have been sexually abusing
959.24,960.52, these women and minors.
960.52,961.9," This is the flaw in human soldiers,"
961.9,963.44, because they harbored votes that they
963.44,964.86, should have been protecting.
964.86,965.0," But thirdly, soldiers are independent, those that they should have been protecting."
965.0,968.0," But thirdly, soldiers are independent and we cannot control their mindsets."
968.0,975.0," Too many war crimes have been left unprosecuted, like these great cases of the Bosnian Serbian Army have been left uncovered."
975.0,983.0," On the comparative note, lethal autonomous weapons may not be regulated by law, but they can never violate the code of conduct anyway."
983.0,988.96, It is programmed to operate and abide by the metrics of the war and operate under full surveillance.
989.34,996.3," Even in the rare instances of faulty maneuvers, it can be swiftly directed and attended to, intercepting further damage."
996.76,1000.98, Lethal autonomous weapons don't inherit these disruptive characteristics that humans do.
1000.98,1005.0, They don't have these kinds of limitations that human characteristics give.
1005.0,1008.0, We can never settle with a proposal that puts civilians
1008.0,1010.0, in even more danger and misery.
1010.0,1011.0, We're so proud to oppose.
1015.0,1018.0, I will not pretend that humans are perfect.
1018.0,1020.0, Humans have been held accountable for war crimes.
1020.0,1022.0, They have conducted heinous acts.
1022.0,1024.0, But that isn't the debate we're having today.
1024.0,1028.36," Because in our world, watch, we're going to prove to you is that a lot of these heinous"
1028.36,1033.0," acts occur under military supervision. If you think about it, a lot of our soldiers"
1033.0,1037.2," are sworn under the same Geneva Convention, they are sworn under the same human rights"
1037.2,1041.1," of course, yet they still conduct such heinous acts. What does that tell you? It tells you"
1041.1,1065.28," two things. One, military generals either are not aware about it or turn a blind eye, given that a lot of these in the world of opposition is just as"
1065.28,1070.44," likely to be merciless, is just as likely to be heartless, because it achieves the same aims of"
1070.44,1076.02," demotivating the enemy, incapacitating the enemy, burning down villages, achieves the same aims"
1076.02,1080.74, whether it's done by a soldier or it's done by a lethal autonomous weapon. The Geneva Convention
1080.74,1088.1," exists under both sides. Governments, oppositions fear this debate. It's a technology we created, but the manifestation of this technology"
1088.1,1091.72, and the motives of this technology are the same under both circumstances
1091.72,1094.12, and they're bred out of those same military generals.
1094.42,1095.34, So what do we mean by this?
1095.44,1099.9," One, the programming of the levels of respect that these lethal,"
1099.9,1103.74, enormous weapons have for opposition forces is just likely to be as low.
1103.82,1108.0," They are likely to be told to be merciless, to shoot down innocent civilians, to gun down those that"
1108.0,1113.0, raise that white flag. What is the comparison then on a first response from side government?
1113.0,1118.0," It is true that in our world some humans commit cruel acts, but some of them have consciences"
1118.0,1123.0," as well. Two, in the event that human rights abuses do occur, humans in our world can speak"
1123.0,1132.5, out about the truth in comparison to a lethal autonomous weapon that states can disassociate from in this world.
1132.56,1135.38," They can delete footage, they can disassociate themselves from the robot,"
1135.66,1138.8, they can call it a malfunction on behalf of technology.
1139.1,1143.36," So in understanding under both circumstances horrible outcomes are likely to occur,"
1143.56,1148.76, it is more reasonable to believe that humans can be held to account for these horrible outcomes if not talk about
1148.76,1153.92, the truth in comparison to a lethal autonomous weapon that is entirely held at a speed's
1153.92,1158.98, disposal to conduct such harmful acts. That was the first response. The second question
1158.98,1163.38, I'll ask from side government is how was likely to occur? Because the response we hear from
1163.38,1167.04," side opposition is we still have things like cost of maintenance of technology,"
1167.26,1173.28, humans are still used in propaganda because some people are caught in warfare and need to save them. The cost of maintenance of technology
1173.28,1179.88, isn't that much of a convincing factor to hold people in our borders in comparison to soldiers that might die in the war zone.
1179.88,1185.6," So on a net or on a scale, it is more likely that we instigate unjust wars in the world of opposition"
1185.6,1189.1," because when it comes to territorial disputes or human rights abuses,"
1189.34,1192.28, this will be the trigger-happy approach that states will take.
1192.36,1195.2, And we don't think side opposition is winning this comparison.
1195.56,1198.22," The third question that I'll ask is, are robots better than humans?"
1198.4,1199.76, I think this is a very interesting stage.
1200.0,1202.28, Robots and humans differ on only two premises.
1202.54,1204.0," Firstly, physical differences."
1204.4,1206.3," And secondly, psychological differences."
1206.44,1209.1," When it comes to physical differences, I agree with the speaker before me,"
1209.38,1211.82," they are more prone to chemical suffering, they are more mortal,"
1211.82,1217.32, they have differences in terms of accuracy and their ability to target projectile attacks.
1217.72,1218.9, What is the comparison there?
1219.08,1222.52," Because this technology will only be available to us in 30 to 50 years,"
1222.76,1225.9, and all the mechanical advancements that side opposition gets
1225.9,1227.7, and attaches to a lethal autonomous weapon
1227.7,1230.42, can also be attached to a soldier in our world.
1230.56,1233.0," Things like smart bullets, things like infrared technology"
1233.0,1236.46," to detect enemy hostages, to avoid civilian casualties."
1236.74,1239.72, All those technologies to correct mechanical human failure
1239.72,1242.1, will still be available to side government
1242.1,1244.7, and we will still be able to reduce human casualties
1244.7,1249.52, and human error when it comes to the war zone. We will still be able to mitigate the loss of lives
1249.52,1254.32, and we think that that is a non-issue in this debate. The only difference then is the psychological
1254.32,1261.36, differences between a robot and a person and we think it's especially important in the war zone
1261.36,1265.42," to have levels of empathy, levels of rationality and levels of relatability."
1265.68,1271.44," People need to be empathetic, to take a pause in the war zone, to save a wounded child or an unharmed civilian."
1271.44,1278.6, People need to look at the bigger picture and adapt in the war zone and not just have a single objective that they will achieve at all costs.
1278.6,1289.12, Side Opposition's world looks at it like one where these little autonomous weapons will make the calculus that killing one drug leader or a drug cartel leader is worth sacrificing hundreds or thousands of
1289.12,1293.52, lives. They will make the calculus that human shields are a non-starter and need to be taken
1293.52,1297.28, down if it means we need to take down that drug lord. And this is not something that
1297.28,1301.52, we are willing to settle for inside government. We need levels of human empathy and human
1301.52,1305.6, rationality and relatability in this war zone to make it a humane war.
1305.6,1309.7," Exactly. Because humans have emotions, don't you think that they will have fear that they"
1309.7,1311.82, will use militarist organizations to exploit them?
1312.12,1315.78," That is true. I understand that in certain instances, humans might turn over to the other"
1315.78,1320.02," side, they might spill over information. But that is a minute harm in comparison to the"
1320.02,1323.78, ruthlessness of this robot that you're letting out into the battlefield.
1324.2,1327.92," The fourth question of response is, what about hacking? The only response we"
1327.92,1331.58," heard to this from side opposition is that we have drone tests, we actually have"
1331.58,1335.5, thorough tests and as a result hacking won't happen. This completely dismisses
1335.5,1339.94, the Prime Minister's analysis or example of instances where hacking has been
1339.94,1344.16," occurred, where American drones have been commandeered by Iranian or Russian spies."
1344.16,1348.94, The fact that states invest in cyber warfare as a significant part of winning that war
1348.94,1352.84," and winning that physical war, hacking is a real threat and the point at which it's"
1352.84,1357.14," an autonomous weapon, have a seat without any human interference with it, it's much"
1357.14,1361.68, more difficult to detect this hacking and reduce the possibility of harm.
1361.68,1368.78," Given that I've dealt with a lot of responses, I'm going to move on to my arguments. Why do laws instill a state of fear within society? We think that"
1368.78,1373.36," in status quo, people on the ground are in a state of fear and hostility when you look"
1373.36,1378.2, at innocent civilians. And we think the introduction of lethal autonomous weapons makes this all
1378.2,1382.88," worse. For three reasons. One, the fact that individuals can't relate to lethal autonomous"
1382.88,1385.74, weapons more than they can relate to soldiers in a battlefield.
1386.08,1389.16," Griefs stricken by trauma, it becomes worse inside opposition."
1389.66,1395.66," Two, an increase in heartless data-based decisions like shooting and indiscriminate shootings inside of opposition"
1395.66,1398.88, makes it far less relatable to civilians on the ground.
1399.18,1403.56," Three, we would argue that data is heavily corrupted in the war zone."
1403.56,1404.32, What do I mean?
1404.54,1405.4," If, on record, Afghan forces are seen as more likely to be unfriendly akan mengadu bahawa data terlalu terburu-buru dalam zon perang. Apa yang saya maksudkan? Jika di dalam rekod,"
1405.4,1409.2, kekuatan Afgan terlihat lebih kemungkinan menjadi tak bersama
1409.2,1413.0," kerana dalam balas kemungkinan dan sejarah,"
1413.0,1414.6," mereka memang tak bersama di masa lalu,"
1414.6,1417.6, senjata kemerdekaan ini akan lebih kemungkinan menjadi agresif
1417.6,1420.2, kepada kekuatan Afgan serta perempuan Afgan
1420.2,1422.4, berdasarkan karakteristik yang menentukan
1422.4,1427.0, dan tingkatkan kemungkinan untuk semua orang di tanah di lapangan itu.
1427.0,1434.0," Dan terakhir dan paling penting, kejadian penggunaan hakim hanya menguasai kemungkinan kegelapan, kemungkinan dan trauma."
1434.0,1435.0, Mengapa semua ini penting?
1435.0,1436.0, Sila lihat.
1436.0,1440.0," Pertama, kata-kata pemimpin dari awal perbincangan mereka adalah kita perlu mengakhiri perang dengan lebih cepat."
1440.0,1444.0," Untuk mengakhiri perang dengan lebih cepat, kita perlu berkongsi di tanah."
1444.0,1445.12," Jika orang-orang takut, jika orang-orang tidak percaya pada pasukan yang akan datang di lapangan itu, quicker. In order to end wars quicker, win cooperation on the ground. If people are afraid,"
1445.24,1449.48," if people don't trust incoming forces on that battlefield, they're less likely to divulge"
1449.48,1453.8, information that your little autonomous weapon would need to make a surgical attack. They're
1453.8,1459.26, less likely to cooperate in evacuations when it comes to allied forces coming in. A reduction
1459.26,1464.92, in information because trust is void inside opposition makes it harder to end wars quicker.
1464.92,1465.04, It makes it harder to end wars quicker.
1467.52,1470.16, It makes it harder to end wars in a just manner because people are less likely to divulge information.
1470.42,1472.48, What kinds of information are we talking about?
1472.54,1473.78," Presence of military bases,"
1474.06,1476.08," the areas where soldiers are locked up,"
1476.2,1477.98, clans of terrorist organisations.
1478.28,1480.22, These are pivotal in solving wars
1480.22,1482.22, and we don't get that inside opposition.
1482.48,1485.44, The second part of this is when it comes to PTSD
1485.44,1490.6," or the argumentation that was made by the speaker before me, PTSD is a horrible act but to a certain"
1490.6,1494.98, degree soldiers have consented to some level of psychological harm and they've gone to the war zone.
1495.3,1500.16, Individuals who haven't consented to similar levels of psychological harm are civilians who
1500.16,1506.0," will see metal behemoths in the war zone and suffer similar levels of PTSD, grief and trauma."
1506.0,1508.0," War is messy, war is hellish."
1508.0,1514.0, But do not give side opposition another reason to complicate matters for the most vulnerable groups in that war zone.
1518.0,1525.6, Side affirmative cannot continuously operate under a scenario where little autonomous weapons is imperfect. They have to engage
1525.6,1531.3, in a scenario where countries indeed have the incentive to develop that weapon into
1531.3,1536.3, a weapon that came to their benefit. Because we believe that there is no country that would
1536.3,1541.8, develop such an expensive and exquisite weapon that requires so long to develop for nothing.
1541.8,1547.0, They would make sure that it is completely ready to serve their
1547.0,1552.0," mission and vision. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that it is them"
1552.0,1558.0, being very negligent towards all our arguments about the sophistication and accuracy of little
1558.0,1562.0, autonomous weapons that helps us win war more effectively.
1562.0,1566.0," Further, another thing that they have never touched on their second speaker is about the"
1566.0,1568.0, dying human soldiers.
1568.0,1572.0, They have never explained to you what it is just like to continuously deploy human soldiers
1572.0,1578.0," on war, letting them get exposed to the staring gas, to cluster munitions, to all these horrible"
1578.0,1582.0," weapons that no one should ever encounter in their life, ladies and gentlemen."
1582.0,1585.2," They say that under our set, if you could win the war with the same"
1585.2,1589.3," effectivity, it is much better to deploy little autonomous weapons"
1589.3,1592.0, that doesn't sacrifice human soldiers.
1592.0,1595.7, My extension today will explain to you as how we will create a society
1595.7,1600.2, that push for a resolution of war that protects the civilians underground.
1600.2,1603.7," Later, moving on to my debacle, three points of debacle."
1603.7,1605.68," First, it will argue upon howacle, three points of debacle. Firstly, we are going to talk about how"
1605.68,1607.88, the merciless characteristics of war criminals
1607.88,1610.44," will be inputted into these little autonomous weapons,"
1610.44,1612.36, hence making it merciless.
1612.36,1613.92, I have two responses to this.
1613.92,1617.96," Firstly, they admit that war crimes are heinous in nature."
1617.96,1620.88, It is something that the state and each general
1620.88,1623.24, would like to avoid for two reasons.
1623.24,1629.0," Because firstly, the characteristics of war crimes inside a lethal autonomous weapon"
1629.0,1633.5," will divert this lethal autonomous weapon from the mission it is entrusted with,"
1633.5,1638.5, which means it will give a cost of time and energy towards the general.
1638.5,1642.5, And hence we say it is unlikely for them to want to put a war crime characteristic
1642.5,1644.2, into this lethal autonomous weapon.
1644.2,1649.0," But secondly, realize that exactly this mis heinous in nature, international scrutiny will exist,"
1649.0,1653.0, which means most likely the state wouldn't want to develop a little autonomous weapon
1653.0,1658.0," that could do a shooting fancy like what human soldiers could do, ladies and gentlemen."
1658.0,1662.0," So we say that in nature, little autonomous weapons is much more versatile."
1662.0,1664.0, Moving on to my second response.
1664.0,1665.0, So what is the kind of little autonomous weapon that is most likely to be developed? Little Appanama's weapon is much more versatile. Moving on to my second response.
1665.0,1669.0, What is the kind of Little Appanama's weapon that is most likely to be developed?
1669.0,1675.0," We will develop something that is acting out of our ideal human soldiers, just without its flaw."
1675.0,1678.0, The flaw that we are talking about is the emotions.
1678.0,1681.0," To make it simple, firstly, if they want to talk about child soldiers,"
1681.0,1689.62," then realize that precisely because human soldiers will empathize with these child soldiers, they realized that precisely because human soldiers would empathize with these child soldiers, they would let the child soldier explode together with the bomb, killing"
1689.62,1694.48," thousands of civilians, women, and minors around that area. We say this is much more"
1694.48,1698.52, horrendous in nature under the sun of the house. This is where the empathy I want to
1698.52,1704.22, talk about becomes completely irrelevant. But they can argue that humans can be trained
1704.22,1706.0, to be as perfect as single autonomous weapons.
1706.0,1710.0, My first speaker explained to you about how there are limitations in humans.
1710.0,1714.0, They even have explained to you about the empathy that he hears in the nature of humans
1714.0,1720.0, which make human inherent imperfect to become a tool of war. We oppose the use of human soldiers.
1720.0,1729.0," Before moving on to my second rebuttal, sure. Even if states have incentives to develop the perfect weapon, it's not necessary that they have the ability to do so."
1729.0,1732.0, Please explain why then lethal autonomous weapons are perfect under your side.
1732.0,1735.0," Ladies and gentlemen, let's compare the worst case scenario."
1735.0,1738.0, I don't engage in which? Our lethal autonomous weapon. I'm not perfect.
1738.0,1741.0, Then we say at least accountability will be better under our side.
1741.0,1750.0," Why so? Because when the state knows there is an error within this fact, they do it to the utmost level. They will do everything in their power to repair it, to make sure"
1750.0,1755.12, it is able to actually engage in a more proper one the next time even if it is concealed under their
1755.12,1759.68," side. When we want to talk about errors of human, it is something that is irreparable, something that"
1759.68,1766.0," no matter how much the state wants to change, it cannot be changed. That is why accountability is also better under our rule."
1766.0,1772.0," Second point of people, they want to argue that the occurrence of war will increase due to the lesser cost of little autonomous weapons."
1772.0,1776.0," I will explain to you five distinct reasons to why it wouldn't, right?"
1776.0,1781.0," Because firstly, it would be the development and maintenance of their technology fairs to high cost."
1781.0,1783.0," Second, there's international sanctions."
1783.0,1786.0," Thirdly, losing geopolitical trade. Fourth, unfavorable refugees."
1786.0,1790.0," And five, political barrier from opposition parties to support."
1790.0,1792.0, That is why their next speaker couldn't come up to you and say that
1792.0,1797.0, Occupy or South Wales still exists because we say that all of this is also part of the rationale of a state.
1797.0,1799.0," Hence, we take this one."
1799.0,1804.0," But lastly, right, we want to argue that Cypriot will be less authoritative because they're not afraid."
1804.0,1805.0, This is not mutually exclusive. We want to argue that civilians will be less operated because they are afraid.
1805.0,1810.0," This is not mutually exclusive. Considering that they admit white transits exist under their set of the house,"
1810.0,1815.0, which means most likely civilians on the ground are also afraid of soldiers.
1815.0,1822.0, The women in Congo and the miners are afraid of all the human soldiers that constantly generate them every day.
1822.0,1826.0," The people in Japan, Korea, are afraid of the soldiers that constantly rape them every day. The people of Japan, Korea, are afraid of the soldiers"
1826.0,1830.0," that constantly rape them every day. Ladies and gentlemen, we say if you want to talk"
1830.0,1836.0," about fear in Tennessee units, it also exists within the human soldiers because of all the"
1836.0,1841.0," human crimes that they have admitted to. That is why we say at the end of the day, if you"
1841.0,1844.0," want to talk about a more effective war, we say it's better under our standard because"
1844.0,1850.0," we can find for you a weapon that is much more flawless, a weapon that will always continue to develop,"
1850.0,1854.0," a weapon that is more effective, and a weapon that is more accountable."
1854.0,1859.0," We have also proved that the existence of this weapon doesn't increase the authoring software,"
1859.0,1862.0, hence we don't see any harm coming from this side of the house.
1862.0,1864.0," But moving on to my extension. Before that, sure."
1864.0,1869.0," So, given there are two sides in a war, one side commits all these heinous acts, the other side is your allied force,"
1869.0,1874.0," even having your allied force use lethal autonomous weapons will traumatise all the civilians on the ground,"
1874.0,1876.0, thus reducing their ability to die by changing their weapons.
1876.0,1879.0," Maybe some of them are sure they are supposed to. All the weapons that they use under their side,"
1879.0,1883.0," the bombs and the fire jet they want to talk about, also won't scare the civilians as they go."
1883.0,1887.0," They have to start explaining why their argument is inherently explosive,"
1887.0,1889.0," unless so, we don't think they can be dissipated."
1889.0,1891.0, Moving on to my expansion.
1891.0,1895.0, Let's talk about how we will create a society that's pushed for a solution of war
1895.0,1897.0, that protects the civilian underground.
1897.0,1900.0, This is an argument that takes affirmative at their best.
1900.0,1904.0," Ladies and gentlemen, affirmative would want to talk about political's push to stop the war."
1904.0,1909.0, I tell you that abruptly stopping the war doesn't stop the humanitarian crisis.
1909.0,1914.0, Keep in mind that human rights in here not only the soldiers but also the civilians.
1914.0,1920.0," Now, thank you. Even if society's voice manages to stop the war, it is not an upright solution."
1920.0,1928.8, It is a solution that protects the soldier but puts more misery for the civilians. They're the side that will fail to reinstate the condition for the society.
1928.8,1930.8, I will explain the problem in two pieces.
1930.8,1937.1," Firstly, in the status quo, the media and society mainly focuses on the soldiers dying out there and never depicted."
1937.1,1940.8, This is precisely why society only feels empathetic to the soldiers.
1940.8,1945.0," This directly results in a second problem, in which the political force forced the government"
1945.0,1947.0, to refrain from the war abruptly.
1947.0,1951.0," On the surface, this sounds good, the war stopped, but I tell you this is the kind of"
1951.0,1956.0," solution that caused Afghanistan to become the breeding ground of Taliban, and Iraq a"
1956.0,1960.0," breeding ground of Al-Qaeda, a solution that indeed protected our soldiers but put more"
1960.0,1962.0, misery on those civilians.
1962.0,1965.0, This is not the kind of solution we'd like for our society to push for.
1965.0,1968.0, And this will be changed under our side for three reasons.
1968.0,1974.0," Firstly, the utilization of little autonomous weapons will shift media's attention to the civilian casualties,"
1974.0,1977.0, something it should have been highlighting since long time ago.
1977.0,1980.0," Second, the discussion of the society will then change."
1980.0,1982.0," It is no longer about how to protect human soldiers,"
1982.0,1988.0, but also about how to protect the civilians from the harrowing state they currently have to live in.
1988.0,1994.0," But thirdly, we establish political force to create a solution that have re-established the condition for the civilians under the law."
1994.0,2001.0," This such core issues like defeating terrorists, re-establishment of government, restoration of the cities, and even compensation for civilians."
2001.0,2004.0, This is the solution we wish for society to push for.
2004.0,2008.36," Only when we end the war is why we fortify human life,"
2008.36,2011.6, both the soldiers and the civilians very proud to propose.
2014.12,2016.2, The point in which civilians see
2016.2,2018.72," unrelatable, metallic, or demons"
2018.72,2021.4," storming their homes, pillaging their villages,"
2021.4,2024.8, and taking everything they care about away from them
2024.8,2029.84, is the point in which you reduce their capacity to cooperate with you memanjakan wilayah mereka dan mengajar mereka segalanya yang mereka peduli tentang di luar daripada mereka adalah titik di mana anda mengurangkan kemampuan mereka untuk berkomunikasi dengan anda dan untuk memastikan
2029.84,2036.88," operasi militer berjaya. Dua soalan yang akan saya jawab dalam ini. Yang pertama, di mana perang lebih baik dan"
2036.88,2042.96," kedua, dengan terhadap tanggungjawab. Perhatikan bahawa jika saya membuktikan bahawa kita mempunyai lebih banyak tanggungjawab dalam dunia kita,"
2042.96,2046.0, saya juga membuktikan bahawa terdapat lebihang banyak kemalangan perang yang berlaku.
2046.0,2048.0," Kerana jika terdapat lebih banyak kesepakatan,"
2048.0,2052.0, para jeneral lebih takut untuk memilih kemalangan perang.
2052.0,2054.0," Tetapi sebelum itu, satu perkara yang tidak sesuai."
2054.0,2057.0, Pemimpin Dukty Lindau membuat argumen pada kira-kira pukul 7.30
2057.0,2062.0, tentang bagaimana media lebih sering fokus pada kesusahan pasukan di dunia mereka.
2062.0,2063.0, Tiga jawapan.
2063.0,2066.26," A, saya rasa mereka hanya melalui keadaan manusia,"
2066.26,2069.7, mereka lebih sering berfokus pada mesin robo-cop yang sempurna
2069.7,2071.9, yang kelihatan sangat menarik dan baru.
2071.9,2074.8," Tetapi kedua, saya tidak faham mengapa media Amerika"
2074.8,2077.6, lebih sering berfokus pada kesulitan yang mereka menyebabkan
2077.6,2080.0, dan mereka adalah penyebabnya.
2080.0,2082.4," Dan akhirnya, jika anda menyebabkan"
2082.4,2085.0," jumlah kesulitan ksatria yang berlaku dalam dunia anda,"
2085.0,2090.3, maka orang-orang akan lebih sering mengatakan lawan awal dan anda akan mempunyai kewangan politik yang kurang untuk melalui perang.
2090.3,2094.6, Jadi jika anda berkata bahawa tidak strategik untuk media asing menyebabkan kesulitan sifar
2094.6,2099.0, disebabkan oleh senjata yang anda katakan sangat memerlukan untuk kita berjuang.
2099.0,2102.6," Itu bermaksud, pertanyaan pertama yang akan saya jawab, di mana perang lebih baik?"
2102.6,2104.5, Tetapi satu poin penjelasan sebelum itu.
2104.5,2105.0, Hanya kerana
2105.0,2111.0," lebih kurang senjata mati di dunia mereka, tidak bermakna ada kekurangan kekurangan kekurangan manusia."
2111.0,2115.0," Kerana saya rasa dengan nuansa mereka menolaknya bahawa walaupun ada kurang kekurangan senjata, ada lebih kekurangan"
2115.0,2120.0, penyeludupan. Premisi pertama yang mereka bawa adalah bahawa perang lebih
2120.0,2125.0," klinik. A, kawasan mesin ini tidak boleh terus berjalan dengan software."
2125.0,2126.0, Apa yang saya maksudkan?
2126.0,2131.0," Mungkin LAW boleh mengemas strategi terbaik untuk berlakon, tapi mereka tidak mempunyai senjata."
2131.0,2135.0, Mereka tidak mempunyai kemampuan untuk berlakon pada pelan yang sama.
2135.0,2138.0," Mereka tidak mempunyai senjata yang boleh menggulung, memukul dan menembak seseorang."
2138.0,2141.0, Ini adalah sesuatu yang mereka perlu uruskan juga.
2141.0,2145.0," Kedua, walaupun kita mempunyai senjata seperti itu, ini adalah perkara yang akan diberi kesempatan para peguam."
2145.0,2151.0," Kedua, dan ini adalah keadaan yang menarik dalam pembuatan, mereka perlu memberitahu kita mengapa pembangunan senjata serta-mata"
2151.0,2157.0, akan berjaya menjadi ciri. Kami telah memberitahu anda dari Pertama Menteri bahawa mereka tidak akan berjaya menjadi ciri
2157.0,2162.0," kerana dalam pembangunan mereka, kontraktor pertahanan membuat lebih banyak wang dalam membangun senjata yang tidak berjaya,"
2162.0,2166.0," yang lebih efektif, yang dapatan dan dapat kerja lebih cepat."
2166.0,2170.0," Ia bermakna, kontraktor perlindungan dan militer tidak mempunyai kebenaran untuk membangun senjata ciri-ciri"
2170.0,2174.0, kerana mereka hanya akan kehilangan kesepakatan mereka dalam kes mereka.
2174.0,2177.0," Tetapi terakhir, dan mungkin paling penting,"
2177.0,2182.0, perhatikan bahawa semua maklumat yang diberikan oleh LEW hanya berdasarkan misi silam.
2182.0,2188.88, Mereka tidak mempunyai intuisi manusia untuk mengambil keputusan yang tidak diperlukan yang Pertama Menteri menunjukkan adalah
2188.88,2193.2, sangat kemungkinan di bidang perang di mana banyak perkara tidak diperlukan boleh berlaku.
2193.2,2197.04, Itulah sebabnya kita mempunyai manusia yang mampu mengambil keputusan
2197.04,2200.56," lebih daripada hukum, lebih daripada apa yang mereka diprogramkan dengan dan mengambil"
2200.56,2204.32, keputusan empati manusia dan intuisi manusia yang itu
2204.32,2205.84," tidak mempunyai. Tetapi walaupun lebih ciri-ciri di diarung, kita beritahu anda kita akan and take into account basic human empathy and basic human intuition that that kind of house doesn't have."
2206.04,2207.88," But even if it's more surgical,"
2208.02,2211.06," in their world, we told you we are likely to enter more wars."
2211.2,2213.06, And opposition has two responses to this.
2213.3,2216.28," The first, that they have other costs involved in war."
2216.52,2220.6," So A, perhaps, but the human cost is likely to be the most important cost"
2220.6,2224.48, and the most important deterrent factor in entering a war.
2224.48,2227.0," But second, at the very least sebuah kos tambahan."
2227.0,2229.0," Jadi dalam perbandingan,"
2229.0,2233.0, ada lebih banyak kapital politik untuk tidak memulakan perang di dunia kita.
2233.0,2237.0," Tetapi ketiga, saya rasa ada lebih banyak propaganda kerajaan di sisi anda"
2237.0,2240.0, di mana kita mengundang rakyat untuk memulakan perang
2240.0,2245.0," kerana apabila kerajaan mahu berjuang untuk sumber seperti mereka lakukan di Iraq dan Afghanistan,"
2245.0,2248.0, orang tidak perlu menganggap saudara dan saudari mereka sudah mati.
2248.0,2253.0," Mereka boleh terus berjuang dengan rancangan kerana tiada kos manusia yang terlibat kepada para senjata,"
2253.0,2255.0," para saudara, ibu bapa dan ibu bapa mereka."
2255.0,2260.0," Masalahnya adalah, mungkin senjata Amerika tidak mati, tetapi para Irakis mati."
2260.0,2261.0, Afghans mati.
2261.0,2266.0, Pada titik di mana kita mempunyai lebih banyak perjuangan dan lebih banyak kemampuan untuk melakukan terhadap yang tidak adil dalam kawasan ini.
2266.0,2269.0, Tetapi kemudian respon kedua di depan anda adalah ketika pembalasan mengatakan kita
2269.0,2272.0, menolak kawasan yang tidak sepatutnya kita menolak.
2272.0,2274.0, Jadi kita menolak pembalasan yang diperlukan.
2274.0,2280.0," A, kita rasa itu tidak benar kerana sekarang sudah cukup kapital politik untuk perang yang adil."
2280.0,2284.0, Kerana kita boleh mengatakan bahawa adik-beradik anda berjuang untuk sebab yang baik.
2284.0,2290.56," Mereka berjuang untuk melindungi tanah kita, untuk melindungi orang yang tak berhubung, jadi kita sudah mempunyai kredito politik yang cukup untuk melakukan itu. Tetapi kedua,"
2291.2,2296.64," kerajaan akan mengatakan bahawa kebanyakan perang itu sangat tidak adil, kan? Biasanya orang-orang"
2296.64,2302.24," mengambil benda untuk sumber, untuk kawasan dan perkara yang tidak sepatutnya kita terlibat dalam. Tetapi walaupun dalam"
2302.24,2308.7," kes teruk di Amerika, jika itu benar, setiap intervensi yang dilakukan oleh pasukan tersebut adalah baik, kita rasa intervensi"
2308.7,2312.0," lebih sering dan tidak teruk kerana dua sebab. Satu, ia sering menyebabkan"
2312.0,2316.0," kecemasan keadaan. Jadi jika anda mempunyai lebih banyak MW, pasukan tersebut akan mempunyai"
2316.0,2319.0, serangan yang lebih besar dan anda akan menyebabkan kecederaan yang lebih besar di antara
2319.0,2322.6," pasukan. Tetapi kedua, ada sentimen anti-Belajar di dunia anda"
2322.6,2326.8, apabila anda menghantar lebih banyak kebenaran. Jadi tidak kira adakah itu para peguam atau para bohemis metallic
2326.8,2329.4, Faktanya bahawa anda hantar lebih banyak dari mereka dan lebih banyak orang
2329.4,2330.96, dan lebih banyak senjata dan lebih banyak senjata
2330.96,2333.44, bermakna anda memperbaiki sentimen anti-Belajar
2333.44,2335.0, Apa pengetahuan kepada isu ini?
2335.0,2338.0," Bahawa di dunia mereka, anda mempunyai lebih banyak kemalangan"
2338.0,2339.08, sebagai sebabnya
2339.08,2341.16, Dan walaupun anda tidak percaya bahawa mereka mempunyai lebih banyak kemalangan
2341.16,2342.64, mereka mempunyai kecederaan ekonomi yang lebih banyak
2342.64,2344.56, kecederaan infrastruktur yang lebih banyak di dunia mereka
2344.56,2348.8," yang menyebabkan para rakyat hidup dengan kualiti yang teruk there are more debts, there are more economic damage, more infrastructural damage in their world, which leads to citizens living a horrible quality of life in their world,"
2348.8,2351.4, where they don't have basic necessities to support themselves.
2351.4,2353.4," Before I move on to my next issue, defend yourself."
2353.4,2357.0," Anti-war sentiment will also not exist under our terms,"
2357.0,2360.4, because government will use the propaganda of retaliation and revenge
2360.4,2363.8, for the blood of the dying brothers and sisters that you explained about.
2363.8,2368.3," Yeah, okay, so I'm getting to how it's far worse in your world, and how people can't relate and so on, right? untuk darah saudara dan saudari yang mati yang anda jelaskan. Ya, jadi saya sedang bercakap tentang bagaimana ia jauh lebih teruk dalam dunia anda dan bagaimana orang tidak boleh berhubung dan sebagainya."
2368.3,2370.0," Jadi, berkenaan dengan keselamatan,"
2370.0,2373.4, inilah enam sebab mengapa keselamatan lebih teruk dalam dunia mereka.
2373.4,2375.8," A, bukti boleh diterbitkan."
2375.8,2381.6," Dan bukti akan terdapat dipercaya kerana walaupun ada bukti yang dipercayai akhirnya bahawa bukti telah diterbitkan,"
2381.6,2385.6, tidak ada lagi bukti yang berasaya untuk membuktikan klaim asli.
2385.6,2389.6," Jadi anda mungkin dapat membuktikan korupsi tetapi anda tidak akan dapat membuktikan kebunuhan perang,"
2389.6,2394.0, kerana bukti berbahaya untuk membuktikan kebunuhan perang itu diambil.
2394.0,2398.6," Tetapi yang kedua, ia sangat sering menjadi informasi yang bias dan program yang implisit."
2398.6,2404.2," Jadi contohnya, mereka mengatur bahawa anda mesti memanfaatkan perjanjian Geneva untuk tidak membunuh pengembaraan,"
2404.2,2408.4," tetapi mereka juga akan mengatur bahawa kebanyakan Afghans di kawasan ini adalah pengembara. Jadi,"
2408.4,2411.4, ini adalah perkara-perkara yang peratus yang NAW akan terima
2411.4,2415.4, untuk menghidupkan untuk menghidupkan perjanjian ini dan menciptakan kemalangan perang dan itu
2415.4,2419.54," berlaku lebih dalam kekuatan anda. Jadi, berbanding dengan ini, para pejabat lebih"
2419.54,2423.0, terpaksa menyebutkan pemerintah mereka ke tempat di mana mereka seperti pemerintah
2423.0,2429.0, berusaha untuk menggigil mereka kerana mereka tidak mahu dipercayai dalam ICC. Mereka tidak mahu menderita dan kerana keselamatan mereka
2429.0,2433.0," yang gila, mereka sering mengalahkan keserangan perang. Kedua, kami memberitahu anda bahawa perkara ini sering"
2433.0,2437.0," sangat yakin. Jadi mereka sering dikeluarkan di bawah Perintah Ketahuan Orang,"
2437.0,2440.0, bahkan tidak ada kongres yang mempunyai keadaan yang cukup terhadap rahsiaan militer.
2440.0,2451.0," Tapi akhirnya, dan saya rasa paling memuaskan, lebih mudah untuk memprosesi dalam awal kerana manusia lebih sering menghentikan satu sama lain kerana kebencian, kerana PTSD yang dibercakapkan oleh pasukan."
2451.0,2456.0, Mereka lebih sering tidak dapat hidup bersama diri dan menghentikan penyakit untuk kejahatan mereka.
2456.0,2461.0," Dan walaupun mereka tidak semua benar, mereka juga dapat menghasilkan keadaan dengan menghentikan orang-orang di luar dalam kejahatan mereka."
2461.0,2467.84," Oleh itu, mereka lebih serlalu berguna dalam masa yang berbeza. Perbandingan adalah robot yang tidak mempunyai kesedaran, tidak ada kemampuan untuk merasa bersalah"
2467.84,2472.0, tentang perkara-perkara yang mereka telah lakukan dan kemampuan yang kurang untuk menghidupkan orang-orang ini.
2472.0,2474.96," Tetapi akhirnya dan saya rasa ini telah dihapus kemudian, kan?"
2474.96,2479.76, Pembalasan itu sangat-sangat berjaya berlaku dalam dunia mereka kerana sistem-sistem
2479.76,2483.92, lebih online dan tidak ada cara mekanik kita menggunakan pembantu manusia.
2483.92,2489.0," Kedua, sistem sangat sentralis kerana mereka perlu mengadakan serangan dengan cara yang berkaitan."
2489.0,2490.0, Tetapi ini adalah nuansa.
2490.0,2493.0," Jika kita memakai satu drone, ada sedikit kecederaan."
2493.0,2497.0," Jika kita memakai satu NAW di dunia pertempuran,"
2497.0,2500.0," negara-negara boleh ditakdirkan, negara-negara boleh ditakdirkan."
2500.0,2504.0, Dan saya rasa ini sangat menyesal kerana mereka perlu sepenuhnya sempurna.
2504.0,2509.2," Walaupun dalam kes di mana one NAW is attacked, the world, like nations are destroyed and"
2509.2,2512.0, states can be gone. Never be proud of the perfect.
2514.0,2520.0," Ladies and gentlemen, on the side of assertion, we recognize that the incentive for a war exists."
2520.0,2524.8," But the thing is, if there are particular nations, such as the US that they mentioned,"
2524.8,2529.5," that have interest in Iraq, really just want to do that, they'll do it regardless."
2529.5,2534.34, Because recognize that they have myriad of weapons that don't need soldiers.
2534.7,2546.4," They have nukes, they have biological weapons, they have chemical weapons, they have all those bombs, hydrogen bombs, that literally can cause collateral damage without any damage to their soldiers."
2546.4,2548.0, What does this show to you?
2548.0,2555.6," In the instances in which war occurs, our side is the side that provides the best chance"
2555.6,2558.0, for civilians to stay alive.
2558.0,2559.0, A chance!
2559.0,2564.2," The fact that they are not the target, ladies and gentlemen, our side is the only side that"
2564.2,2565.06, does that.
2565.06,2567.88, Their side dooms the affiliate to their death.
2567.88,2569.5, Two questions in this debate.
2569.5,2572.18," Firstly, is it principally justified"
2572.18,2574.44, to use little autonomous weapon?
2574.44,2577.38," Secondly, what will happen to the nature of war?"
2577.38,2579.92," Firstly, is it principally justified"
2579.92,2581.72, to use little autonomous weapon?
2581.72,2583.46, And I think this correlates strongly
2583.46,2587.08, with the nature of how these weapons will operate.
2587.08,2590.26," They tell you that the robots will be merciless,"
2590.26,2591.74, and they can self-learn.
2591.74,2593.02, Three responses to this.
2593.02,2597.22," Firstly, military of nations don't have the incentive"
2597.22,2600.68," to make these robots self-learn, ladies and gentlemen."
2600.68,2602.8," The fact that they are at risk,"
2602.8,2606.5, the fact that the robots can go and attack themselves means
2606.5,2609.5, that they don't want these robots to attack themselves to begin with.
2609.5,2616.0," But secondly, we can actually create robots that actually upholds the human right, the"
2616.0,2620.5, convention of legal autonomous weapons that we told you since first.
2620.5,2628.38," The difference is, sure, we get it, soldiers say their oath before they become soldiers."
2628.68,2632.02, But they never are prepared for the horror of war.
2632.34,2638.32," Seeing their brothers in a pool of blood, seeing their liens, ladies and gentlemen, attacked by terrorists,"
2638.66,2654.9," no training whatsoever is equivalent to the horror of war. But thirdly, military contractors will have the utmost incentive to ensure that these robots aren't held as merciless as what they want you to believe."
2654.9,2663.5," Just like the echo of fear that is apparent in the tone of the proposition, you'll know that society doesn't necessarily favor AI."
2663.5,2668.4, What does this show to you? This shows that there'll be immense media attention
2668.4,2670.52, on how these weapons are developed.
2670.94,2673.58," And I think that this, military contractors,"
2673.94,2676.26," have the utmost incentive to create it,"
2676.46,2679.94," to become just as merciless as what they want you to do,"
2679.94,2683.78, because the way they can profit is by producing the weapons.
2684.2,2690.0," And the only way they can do that is when society actually favors them, ladies and gentlemen."
2690.0,2693.0, That's why these robots will be human.
2693.0,2697.0," Having established that, what are the moral principles in this debate?"
2697.0,2704.0," We say that firstly, it's abhorrent to use soldiers when you can't protect them from horror of war,"
2704.0,2705.2, from being haunted by
2705.2,2709.4, the vivid memories of seeing their comrades in a pool of blood.
2709.4,2715.2," We say that individuals need to be protected, especially when the war that we are facing"
2715.2,2720.2," in the status quo is getting more and more inhuman, such as the use of chemical and biological"
2720.2,2726.6," weapons, such as China, which developed 800-meter flash-burning laser gun which attacks your"
2726.6,2727.1, soldier.
2727.52,2732.9," The fact that they could have been protected, that they could have been saved, that other"
2732.9,2736.98," lives could be saved, it is the line of what we champion on the position."
2737.4,2741.1," We say, we are very clear that all lives are important."
2741.42,2742.5, They need to be protected.
2742.98,2750.0," Sure, soldiers consent to becoming soldiers, but they never know what lies in the war, ladies and gentlemen."
2750.0,2758.0, They never know what damage they could cause to their lives. I think the moment when you can't protect these individuals do show.
2758.0,2768.0," But secondly, it's just horrible for their sentence to sound that way. To simply settle with a status quo when there are myriad of misconducts that we have posed to you since first,"
2768.0,2772.0," when you could have saved more civilians, ladies and gentlemen."
2772.0,2774.0, We give you three reasons on this.
2774.0,2780.0, The fact that they aren't able to get tired means that they are likely to be inaccurate in doing so.
2780.0,2790.0," This is different with people with autonomous weapons, when they have 100% empathy that it's accurate, it's programmed, and it doesn't fire civilians."
2790.0,2798.0," But secondly, humans need to do self-defense mechanisms, and I think this is something that they ignore since their second speaker."
2798.0,2807.0," For every 100 terrorists that are killed, 57 civilians are killed by these soldiers. They are shot because soldiers"
2807.0,2813.0, need to protect themselves. They can't restate a citizen in the fear that they might carry
2813.0,2818.0," a bomb, ladies and gentlemen. For once, don't have the intention to stop the attack. Therefore,"
2818.0,2821.0, you protect civilians better is our side of the cost.
2821.0,2827.2," But thirdly, regarding the idea of war crimes, the horror of war that is caused to the civilian,"
2827.2,2830.2," the fact that they could be raped, ladies and gentlemen,"
2830.2,2833.4, and inflict this harm to the society.
2833.4,2838.3," Sure, if people are already so against artificial intelligence,"
2838.3,2841.1, why would governments give citizens more information
2841.1,2843.0, to fight against this artificial intelligence?
2843.0,2846.8," Yeah, government is an entity that gives out the information."
2846.8,2854.0," Obviously, we have medias in the stethoscope, such as Fox News, Fox News, and BBC, and CNN,"
2854.0,2858.5," ladies and gentlemen, all of which are liberal medias that protect human rights."
2858.5,2863.0, That's why you know the violations of human rights that are occurring in Sydney.
2863.0,2865.0, Then they give you the idea of accountability.
2865.0,2868.0, The EU states reasons which I only heard for.
2868.0,2874.0," They told you that evidence can be deleted, that there is bias, and this is highly confidential."
2874.0,2878.0," Look, these are not exclusive at all, ladies and gentlemen."
2878.0,2882.0, You can still believe evidence by the war crimes that you do with soldiers.
2882.0,2884.0, We don't get what they get out of here.
2884.0,2886.76," But fourthly, the only thing we heard"
2886.76,2888.46, is that they can't rat out each other.
2888.46,2891.18," Well, couldn't they rat out this and those two?"
2891.18,2894.66," Two ICJ, which is literally controlled by United States,"
2894.66,2895.54," ladies and gentlemen,"
2895.54,2898.3," that have no mechanism, so on and so forth."
2898.3,2901.36," At least under our side, you can still protect this soldier,"
2901.36,2903.16," you can still fix the system,"
2903.16,2909.76, while this nature of human are inmate to fat family and sexual satisfaction in the midst of war.
2909.76,2915.4," But moving on to, we have proven to you how our side is the side that best protects civilians."
2915.4,2918.4," But moving on to the second clash, what will happen to the nature of war?"
2918.4,2922.4, We literally gave you five independent reasons to why this is the case.
2922.4,2927.22, The fact that they have trade infrastructure than that means that your trade with that nation
2927.22,2928.64, is going to be damaged as well.
2928.64,2930.7," But secondly, economic cost."
2930.7,2932.08," In the case of Donald Trump,"
2932.08,2934.56, literally one of the things that made him win
2934.56,2936.86, is literally the fact that you have spent
2936.86,2939.74, seven million on a war in Afghanistan.
2939.74,2941.48, And this is extremely important.
2941.48,2946.88," But thirdly, the fact that you ruined your political relations."
2946.88,2950.62," Fourthly, refugees that fled to Mexico, EU."
2950.62,2952.82," Fifthly, the political barriers."
2952.82,2955.02," And sixthly, which came from them,"
2955.02,2959.0, is the idea of collateral damage that you can have with this agenda.
2959.0,2962.64, That's why it's unlikely to happen under our set.
2962.64,2968.8," Because if it's true, but then what's weird. They told you that the fact that there's no"
2968.8,2978.4," veterans, the fact that there's no human soldiers means that there are no veterans. But then they say their side will have these weapons as well, only with the soldiers."
2978.4,2985.0," They say that this can protect soldiers. That necessarily under their status of house, these political barriers don't exist too,"
2985.0,2988.0, because soldiers will still be protected.
2988.0,2992.0," Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I've proven to you how our side will not have more war."
2992.0,2996.0, And I'm going to give you just three reasons that we have to do this first to provide more
2996.0,2997.0, of a better game.
2997.0,3001.0," Firstly, because war is even less likely when it has media focus."
3001.0,3006.0," But secondly, war best ends under our side of the house, the fact that you can actually"
3006.0,3010.0," recognize your war and what you've done to them, for all of those reasons, because we"
3010.0,3014.0," are the type that will discriminate lives, and I'm so proud to oppose."
3020.0,3024.0, Affirmative wants to deploy human soldiers regardless of these lethal autonomous weapons
3024.0,3026.76, that can achieve the same results or even better.
3027.16,3029.48, This is inherently merciless in and of itself.
3029.96,3034.84, Merciless to the suffering of these human lives and soldiers and suffering of the victims of war crimes.
3034.84,3039.72, They haven't been able to explain or give any one single harm of lethal autonomous weapons
3039.72,3044.0," other than they have no empathy and emotions, which has already been tackled on our side of the house."
3044.36,3046.26," Under this basis, we think that opposition"
3046.26,3047.18, should win this debate.
3047.18,3049.38," But furthermore, there's two clashes in this debate."
3049.38,3052.14," Firstly, on who protects the soldiers and civilians in war,"
3052.14,3055.08," and secondly, which war becomes then more humane."
3055.08,3056.06, Let's look at the first clash
3056.06,3058.08, and who protects the civilians and soldiers.
3058.08,3060.02, What proposition brought to us in this debate
3060.02,3061.44, was that lethal autonomous weapons
3061.44,3063.32, would kill the civilians in warfare.
3063.32,3064.84," What we have to respond to is,"
3064.84,3067.0," is that the sophistication of these robots. Because anyways, we've responded that these lethal autonomous weapons would kill the civilians in warfare. What we have responded to is that the sophistication of these robots."
3067.0,3072.0, Because anyways we've responded that these lethal autonomous weapons would constantly be developed to be perfect.
3072.0,3078.0," And these states will always have the political push if these lethal autonomous weapons turns out to be more dangerous in the battlefield,"
3078.0,3083.0, the society and backlash will create more political push to be constantly developing for these robots.
3083.0,3088.96," And furthermore, we've already explained on why countries and states wouldn't just employ untested or prematurely crafted"
3088.96,3093.1, robots simply because it could just jeopardize their own whole entire mission. Why then under
3093.1,3097.66," proposition will lethal autonomous weapons, if perfect, still unjustify? Because let's"
3097.66,3101.22, go in the best case scenario for proposition in which these lethal autonomous weapons are
3101.22,3106.6, not perfect. Then we've responded that there's always push to create and develop stronger mechanisms and weapons.
3106.6,3108.66, They have brought the idea of Geneva Convention.
3108.66,3110.22, Then we question that if these standards
3110.22,3112.18," and convention exist, then why countries"
3112.18,3114.56, will not randomly use these lethal weapons
3114.56,3115.62, that are not advanced yet?
3115.62,3117.28, Why wouldn't they abide to these standards yet?
3117.28,3119.38," They've completely neglected, furthermore,"
3119.38,3123.28, our arguments on how we create a better rehabilitation
3123.28,3125.46, and safer conditions for the soldiers in living there.
3125.66,3129.46, Because they've said on how we said that there's already post-traumatic stress disorder
3129.46,3132.42, and a lot of psychological harm that could happen on the soldiers.
3132.76,3136.96," They've responded to this by saying that these soldiers, they signed up for it, they already know the cost."
3137.16,3141.94," Well, we've already clearly said in our third speaker and our second on how these kinds of PTSD,"
3142.26,3146.8," you can no longer, you don't know that prerequisite to joining the army."
3147.02,3148.46, You don't know all these things.
3148.58,3150.98, It can only happen because of the harsh environments of war.
3151.2,3154.9, That is why we prefer these lethal autonomous robots that could replace these things.
3154.9,3156.06, But let's take proposition.
3156.38,3162.06, We'll keep on playing the best case scenario on how you can have all these sophisticated tech features
3162.06,3163.6, that can be employed in these soldiers.
3163.9,3166.22, We must be playing that this is not inherently able.
3166.34,3171.68," Because if these, for example, all these weapons and all these sophisticated robots and guns"
3171.68,3176.62," are pulled in soldiers, such as infrared, then why will people still oppose these low-tomato robots?"
3176.78,3177.76, We've already explained it.
3178.02,3180.74," Furthermore, when these stay on the issue of hacking,"
3181.04,3183.6, we've said that drones are not going to be prone to hacking.
3183.82,3187.38, Because the fact that we have nuclear weapons in the state of school that couldn't be acquired
3187.38,3191.46," by terrorists and very hard to be hacked, there's already existing mechanisms to stop"
3191.46,3194.9," this hacking from occurring. But even if it is hacked on our side of the house, it takes"
3194.9,3198.68, a long time to redirect that hacking and we've already explained in our model on how there's
3198.68,3202.78, going to be self-destructive mechanisms that will disable these terrorist organizations
3202.78,3206.26, to do so. But let's look at the second clash and which war is more humane.
3206.62,3209.42, They said that war will be prevented because of the cost of human soldiers.
3209.96,3214.74, We've already responded to this sufficiently by saying that when there's push to stop the
3214.74,3218.66," war because of human soldiers, this is going to be harmful for the stability of these states"
3218.66,3219.66, and also for the war.
3219.66,3230.0, Because of this propaganda from these states by justifying these wars and creating the proliferation of terrorist organizations once we take out the soldiers from the area.
3230.0,3235.0," But even if it's their best-case scenario in which there's a push to stop the war, this is just more in the background."
3235.0,3239.0, Because the fact that we make humans the cause of the war is principally unjustified.
3239.0,3249.28," On our side, we have already explained on how these lethal atomic robots would be the one targeting these terrorist organizations. On the comparative, their site engages humans versus humans in a war which is"
3249.28,3254.42," even more intimate. Panel, what you have to realize is that the demons in the war is not robots or"
3254.42,3258.98, algorithms. It is not these actions made with data and calculus that's programmed to adhere
3258.98,3263.82, to international laws and think the way an info-military general would in his prime condition.
3264.06,3269.0," The demons that you have to be afraid of in the war are human action when they're desperate to protect themselves,"
3269.0,3272.0," when they shoot innocent children, when they thought they carried a bomb,"
3272.0,3278.0, when they put their thing in the mouth of citizens as an act of vengeance from the death of their brothers.
3278.0,3279.0, We're so proud to oppose.
3283.0,3287.0," This was a messy debate, and hopefully I can make it a little easier for you guys."
3287.0,3289.0, I'm going to look at four general terms of state issues.
3289.0,3295.0," Firstly, effectivity. Secondly, accountability. Thirdly, frequency and longevity of wars."
3295.0,3297.0," And lastly, mental health. Hopefully we clarified this."
3297.0,3301.0," Firstly, let's look at effectivity. What did we tell you from side government?"
3301.0,3305.0," Being surgical, accurate and maybe to some extent impenetrable to sarin gas."
3305.0,3310.0, All mechanical advantages of a lethal autonomous weapon can be applied to human soldiers as well.
3310.0,3317.0," In 30 to 50 years if we invested in people, they can be as powerful, as immortal to a certain degree"
3317.0,3320.0, and they can be as accurate as a lethal autonomous weapon.
3320.0,3325.0," That was not a part of this debate, whether they're able to shoot in a very accurate manner"
3325.0,3329.0, was not our debate. The second part in terms of effectivity is that the essence of nuclear
3329.0,3334.0, autonomous weapons is irrational thinking from an artificial intelligence standpoint.
3334.0,3339.0," That is what we contended, because we told you humans have emotions that are especially"
3339.0,3343.0," important in the war zone. The fact that they are empathetic might make them vulnerable,"
3343.0,3346.24, but it also makes them fight the war that is worth fighting.
3346.24,3351.24," They will try to avoid human casualties, they will try in certain instances to avoid crossfires"
3351.24,3353.24, because they have to live with the consequences.
3353.24,3358.24, They won't make decisions at the snap of a finger that will cost millions of lives.
3358.24,3359.24, What is the comparison then?
3359.24,3363.24," From a lethal autonomous weapon, if they have a singular goal and they need to achieve it"
3363.24,3368.4," in the most effective manner, they are more likely to deprioritise human life to achieve that goal."
3368.4,3372.4," If a terrorist is hiding under a school, if a terrorist is hiding under a hospital, which"
3372.4,3376.76," currently does happen in places like Yemen, a lethal autonomous weapon is likely to destroy"
3376.76,3381.8, the whole building because it is 100% success rate in comparison to our world where people
3381.8,3389.88," have lived with the consequence of killing innocent civilians and make better decisions as a result of it. In terms of effectivity, at best we"
3389.88,3395.22," are not heartless beings, we care about human lives. These guys don't. But in terms of hacking"
3395.22,3399.72," under effectivity, we told you robots can be hacked, it has been done before. The template"
3399.72,3404.0," response from opposition is that it takes a long time, they will self-destruct, we go"
3404.0,3409.84," through a series of tests, all of which happens in status quo, yet the death count from hacked droids"
3409.84,3414.64, and the death count from hacked online war machines is uncountable. And this further
3414.64,3419.18," increases the desire of opposition when a lethal autonomous weapon, perfectly capable"
3419.18,3424.02," of destroying states or even buildings at a time, is more likely to be commandeered under"
3424.02,3428.5, their side. No response after that. The second question then is in terms of accountability.
3428.5,3433.5," We told you wars occur, but it's idealistic to believe that military generals don't know about it."
3433.5,3437.5," War crimes occur, but it's idealistic to believe that military generals don't know about it."
3437.5,3440.5," They knew about Abu Ghraib, they knew about torture camps in the Middle East,"
3440.5,3448.76," but they always turn a blind eye because they had levels of hatred, because it increases morale for the soldiers. Every soldier swears by the Geneva Convention, but"
3448.76,3452.92," yet war crimes still seem to happen, which means it's very likely that the robot is going"
3452.92,3456.76," to be programmed to be merciless under your side of the house, and they're more likely"
3456.76,3461.38, to conduct the same levels of war crimes. The only difference is a soldier can speak
3461.38,3465.12," out, but a robot cannot. Data can be deleted from those robots and"
3465.12,3469.78, accountability is far worse under psychopolition. The third question is in terms of frequency.
3470.1,3474.86, We fight just wars. We have enough political capital to fight those just wars. In your
3474.86,3480.3," world, where there is zero loss of human life, we are likely to instigate unjust wars and"
3480.3,3487.8," territorial disputes that cause irreversible damages. In terms of longevity, we also told you that the relatability to human soldiers"
3487.8,3493.48, means civilians are likely to divulge information that is important in ending wars quicker
3493.48,3496.16, and ensuring minimal loss of human casualties.
3496.78,3500.18," As a conclusion to this issue, human loss in their world is far worse"
3500.18,3503.76, and loss are likely to be longer and they are likely to be instigated on unjust grounds.
3504.14,3510.0," In terms of the final issue of mental health, I believe that I understand that side opposition takes great care of soldiers"
3510.0,3515.0," and we understand that it's unfortunate that they will never be prepared for a theatre of war, they'll be never prepared for PTSD."
3515.0,3521.0, But these are individuals and civilians that you would put through those similar levels of harm and similar levels of trauma
3521.0,3525.14, when they view lethal autonomous weapons coming onto their grounds and onto their borders.
3525.4,3527.2," At the very least, a soldier consents."
3527.56,3530.06," At the very least, a soldier goes through psychological training."
3530.44,3533.54, Civilians don't. They suffer far worse traumatic stress.
