0.0,20.0," In his book Crime and Punishment,"
20.58,25.66, Fyodor Dostoevsky said that prisons are the universities of crime.
26.22,33.3," Because in the status quo, prisoners are stuck in a system where they have to join gangs in order to survive in prisons."
33.74,40.36, Where they stay in cramped cells next to murderers and rapists who believe that the state has failed them.
40.94,46.0, This is the result of a system that prioritizes retribution and deterrence.
46.0,51.5, Two systems that say that harsh punishment are the only ways in order you can get successful
51.5,53.5, outcomes in a system.
53.5,54.5, We stand against that.
54.5,56.5, We want to change the system.
56.5,60.5, We believe that rehabilitation is the only just way of sentencing.
60.5,62.0, What are our steps?
62.0,63.0, Three parts.
63.0,68.0," First, we support rehabilitation as the only consideration of criminal sentencing."
68.0,79.0, What is rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is a system that uses methods like community-based sentencing to prioritize turning criminals with ill intent into functioning members of society afterwards.
79.0,85.44," This works like systems like the Criminon Rehabilitation Program in the United States, which saw a 0% recidivism"
85.44,90.3," rate after it was implemented. Generally speaking, we envision decreased sentence lengths and"
90.3,95.52," will prioritize helping criminals instead. Secondly, we concede that we will not solve"
95.52,100.46," all problems of justice. However, we believe that the stigma of criminalization levied"
100.46,105.3," on criminals will eventually disappear. Finally, we will provide the same services,"
105.3,108.5," i.e. psychological counseling and community-based sentencing,"
108.5,110.6, to those people who have not yet committed crimes
110.6,114.9, as a way of proactively stopping people from turning towards injustice.
114.9,116.5, We're going to forward two arguments.
116.5,120.3," First, why rehabilitation is the only just way of sentencing,"
120.3,123.3," and secondly, where we'd better tackle crime."
123.3,125.18," First, on justice."
126.18,129.4, We think that the majority... I want to begin this argument by characterizing the vast majority of instances
129.4,131.5, as to what causes crime.
131.88,136.58, Because the vast majority of crimes are results of these structural failures of the state.
136.96,138.82," Where in almost every part of the world,"
139.14,141.34," the majorities of crimes are crimes of acquisition,"
141.68,142.9," like stealing, stealing."
143.22,144.74, And that's a result of you being poor.
144.98,145.0, And the reason why you being poor.
148.56,151.56, And the reason why you are poor is because the state does not provide you with the adequate resources for you to have the basic standard of living.
151.76,155.58," That's why in nations like the U.S., they see the over-criminalization of poor African"
155.58,160.5," Americans, and where 88% of crimes within that state are crimes of acquisition."
161.0,165.4," Therefore, the state has failed you in the position of basic resources."
165.4,171.1," And because of that, the state has an obligation to provide you with the reparations, the education,"
171.1,175.2," and the opportunities that have to apply to you, and that happens through rehabilitation"
175.2,180.1, and informed reparations. Why is this important? It is because the moment at which you are
180.1,189.44," born into a state, the state gives you a promise. Because a sacrifice of rights in terms of taxation, for example, and this is a reciprocal responsibility to provide you"
189.44,194.82," that fair and basic standard of living. Secondly, we don't think that Team England is going to"
194.82,198.44, come up here and talk about murder and rape in terms of heinous instances of crime.
198.44,202.74," But recognize that even in those instances, the vast majority of violent crime are"
202.74,205.0, correlated to these same reasons.
205.0,210.0," Because in the lack of alternatives, you default to things like gangs in Chicago, where drug violence is rampant,"
210.0,216.0," and to the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, where crime is also a violation of justice."
216.0,220.0," They might stand for a soft mix of rehabilitation law and other forms of justice,"
220.0,227.0, but note that the consideration of other measurement prevents rehabilitation from operating at its maximum capacity.
227.0,232.0," Two reasons why. First of all, countervailing considerations damage the effectiveness of rehab."
232.0,237.0," Because when you add other considerations, such as retribution or deterrence, no thank you,"
237.0,239.0, that's when rehabilitation becomes so optimal.
239.0,245.68," Because when you add things like retribution, which extends sentencing claims to suboptimal things that are beyond"
245.68,251.12," the time necessary to be successful in rehabilitation, and you spend more on the prison infrastructure,"
251.12,255.76," money that could be going to more successful rehabilitation programs, that's when rehabilitation"
255.76,260.56," becomes far more unsuccessful, given that it's a most just system of publishing."
261.16,267.0," But secondly, note that all these considerations are oppositional towards the efficacy of rehabilitation."
267.0,272.0," Deterrence, for example, values things like extreme punishment to prevent future crime."
272.0,278.0, So take the example of a criminal who goes through anger management exercises under a form of rehabilitation.
278.0,284.0," But because deterrence still exists on their side of the house, they have to go back into the prison cells and stay back and watch the prison fights"
284.0,288.0, and room with prisoners that believe that the state has failed them.
288.0,292.0, That decreases and diminishes the effectiveness of this justice system on their side.
292.0,295.0, We think there's only a prismally justified metric of punishment.
295.0,301.0," If prisons are so bad, then why do you support sending people there for any medical time?"
301.0,306.18," Okay, Steve, the prison's bad in the status quo. That's why we're forming the system to emphasize some other metric of it"
306.18,308.66," to make it more effective, that's what I was thinking."
308.66,309.76," All right, next argument,"
309.76,312.5, as to why we better take down crime.
312.5,314.02, I first want to characterize to you
314.02,316.3," the purpose of the criminal justice system,"
316.3,319.98," i.e., the reason why the state creates things"
319.98,323.12, like courts and prisons are to protect individuals
323.12,324.9, and to optimize social outcomes
324.9,325.6, by decreasing
325.6,329.6," the occurrences of crime. And this is also for victims, if they want to talk about victims,"
329.6,334.6," be just, because a world in which we optimize the justice system is one where victims feel"
334.6,341.0," safe in. The problem is their system values the draconian and archaic system of justice,"
341.0,349.08, because the draconian system of retribution is a misconception that this is the only way to punish people. A system that violates the human rights of individuals.
349.52,355.04," And this is also a system that is incredibly ineffective, which is why one-sixth of the"
355.04,360.38, crime in the United States is done by repeat offenders. This is due to two structural reasons
360.38,364.66," of their assignment of the House. First of all, note that prisons and the environment"
364.66,368.64, that it creates perpetuates crime. Because the environment that you're in are people
368.64,373.88, who have committed heinous acts like murder and rape. So you have to join things like
373.88,378.44, gangs. That's the only way to protect yourself in this heinous position. You are next to
378.44,384.36, murderers and rapists who tell you and for their narratives of mistrust against the state.
384.58,386.5, This is a community of anger.
386.5,390.5," And this is also bad, because in places where they have this retributive system,"
390.5,395.5," recidivism rates, i.e. occurring committee crimes after you have been involved in crime,"
395.5,401.0," increases, which is why retributive systems have failed in Uruguay, USA, Honduras, and France."
401.0,411.0," This is an archaic system that fails in their obligations to protect people. But secondly, know that when people get out of prison, a post-prime role is suboptimal to minimizing crime."
411.0,414.0, Why is this the case? Because there is a stigma against prisoners.
414.0,420.0," That when you are an ex-convict and you're trying to get a job, and you have the stigma of a prisoner standing on your resume,"
420.0,426.0," you do not get employment, and you do not get a job to to get decent living standards, which turns people to more crime."
426.12,430.82," We solve this through three reasons on our side of the house. First of all,"
430.82,437.28," one, intuitively, we solve the root issue of crime. So things like not having an economic stability can be solved through drug trade."
437.5,443.54," Things like being not being able to turn to, forcing to turn to things like drugs can be solved through drug rehabilitation."
443.54,446.0," I mean, that's comparatively better."
446.0,448.0," Secondly, you get people to live better lives"
448.0,450.0," through things like community-based sentencing,"
450.0,452.0," means that you're able to treat these people in a far more humane way,"
452.0,455.0, and tells people that they can be integrated into society.
455.0,458.0," And note that there are still deterrents on the outside of the house,"
458.0,460.0," because when you put under things like house arrest,"
460.0,462.0," your freedoms are still stripped away from you,"
462.0,464.0," and we think that's a suboptimal rule which any prisoner,"
464.0,470.0," or any rational individual would not prefer. But finally, outside of prison, when you implement"
470.0,474.0," a rehabilitative system, it is better for the comparative because you reduce the stigma"
474.0,479.0, against these prisoners. The fault in the status quo is the perception that this justice
479.0,484.0," system has created, that the only way to punish criminals is to be retributed in deterrent"
484.0,485.0," systems, to strip"
485.0,489.0," them of their rights, to tell society that these are people not deserving of human rights."
489.0,493.0," That's why they're not being hired. We shift that on our side of the house, to dehumanize"
493.0,497.0," criminals, that they are deserving of human rights, that they are bidding for integration,"
497.0,502.0," which is why we prioritize a system of justice. So, the justice is a just system of punishing,"
502.0,506.28," because we better reduce crime on our side of the, you should go to side proposition. Thank you."
510.6,514.44, Side proposition in this debate claim to care about re-offense rates.
514.72,517.06, They claim to care about the perception of African Americans
517.06,519.5," and of minorities who are viewed as, in their identity,"
519.9,521.3, inherently linked to this crime.
521.7,526.04," And yet, they propose a policy that not only tells people that African"
526.04,530.1," Americans are inherently criminals, and by the way, that is why we're targeting them"
530.1,535.9," before they even commit a crime, but they propose a policy that does not give people"
535.9,539.96," the commitment to the most fundamentally egregious acts in society, the label they deserve."
540.24,544.56," And that is evil human beings. I'm going to be doing two things in my speech. First,"
544.66,550.0," a principle about how a significant number of these people deserve punishment, and why ac mae hynny'n dynion dynol. Byddwn i'n gwneud dau beth yn fy sgwrs. Yn gyntaf, ymgyrch o ran sut mae nifer y bobl hynny'n gwerth cyfnod a phwy yw dulliau mwy o newyddion yn gweithredu yn fwyaf."
550.0,555.0, A'r ail ymgyrch o ran sut mae mwy o wneud pethau'n ymwneud â'r adnodd mwyaf pwysig ynghylch ystod y dynion.
555.0,560.0," Yn ôl hynny, byddwn i ymateb i'w adnodd a phryd hynny, byddwn i'n cyflwyno'r adnoddau hynny."
560.0,567.0," Pwy ddylch. Four things. First, they bring you a claim and a line about how the necessity of punishing people crowds out other options."
567.0,576.0, That is why we do not stand behind a system in which we just blankly propose and place onto people the same strategy that of rehabilitation.
576.0,585.76," We support a justice system that looks at individuals on the basis of various crimes they have committed, the harm to society, and adjusts the way in which we deal with people's appallingness."
585.76,590.0," We don't have to stand up and say, oh there are instances for example in which you punish"
590.0,593.76," people too heavily, it's not an opposition or a proposition in this debate."
593.76,597.6, What we support is if you are an individual who is so unbelievably perverted that you
597.6,601.6," have sexually or serially abused individuals, you have killed other people, that is the"
601.6,608.0," point at which we don't think a single taxpayer dollar should be spent on getting you a counsellor or getting you a room with softballs in it, that is the daylight between these two teams. Mae'n debyg i ni fod yn cael cymdeithas ar gyfer cymdeithasau neu'n cael eu cymryd i'r cyngor neu'n cael eu cymryd i'r ystafell gyda thwblion."
608.0,610.0, Dyna'r ddau ddwy tîm.
610.0,614.0, Y peth ddiweddaraf ydy'r hyn rhaid i ni ddechrau yw bod yn rhaid i ni gefnogi hynny yn ymgymryd â'r cyfnod yma.
614.0,628.86," Nid yn angen i ni gefnogi cyfnodau fel cyfnodau cyfrifiadol neu'r penderfyniadau y byddant yn ysgolio ac yn cefnogi moddau yn y maes hynny. we support all of the economic measures that they talk to you about in terms of providing for people before they might commit those crimes. But necessarily, we are the only side"
628.86,632.32, of this debate that can genuinely claim the benefits of that. Because in the overwhelming
632.32,636.34," majority of states, we do not have the money to spend on their system. The kinds of states"
636.34,639.72," they talk to you about, they talk about prison overcrowding. We are much more likely to be"
639.72,643.5, able to spend this if we're not spending it on expensive counsellors. Before I move on
643.5,649.38," to my two arguments, I'm going to do a couple of pieces of blood. The first thing they're saying is that re-offence"
649.38,652.52," rates are very high, and that's the result for the fact that prison's awful. This is"
652.52,656.32," a very weird argument for propositions for an advance, in a context where they explicitly"
656.32,660.78, say that they are still sending the overwhelming majority of people to prison. Specifically
660.78,664.06," here, when they're talking about the messages people spread, the techniques that they learn,"
664.12,665.0," or the individuals that they interact with,"
665.0,671.0, we do not think that changes based on whether you spend ten years with those individuals or whether you spend five years with those individuals.
671.0,677.0," That is what they needed to prove. But, second of all, the perception that these individuals are criminals and the likelihood of them to reinvent themselves"
677.0,682.0," is much, much more likely when you release the overwhelming majority of them on community service sentences,"
682.0,688.0," when you allow them back into interactions with the public before they're actually ready for it. ar y cymdeithas cymunedol. Pan fyddwch yn ei gael yn ôl i'w gydweithio gyda'r cyhoedd, cyn iddyn nhw fod yn barod i'w wneud. Yr ail adnodd y maen nhw'n ei ddweud yw bod y"
688.0,693.0, dynion wedi ffailu pobl yn y cyfnodau cyfnodol oedd yn y byd ac felly mae'r syniad y byddai'n
693.0,699.0," dda i chi ddarparu pobl gyda chymdeithas, er enghraifft, yn ddigon. Yn gyntaf, mae'r dynion wedi"
699.0,726.0," ffailu llai a llai o bobl yn y cyfnodau hyn. Mae llawer o bobl ddim wedi cael cyfle economaidd, mae llawer o bobl ddim wedi cael addysg ac erbyn hynny, ac mae hynny'n gwneud iddo fod yn ddigon cyflawniol i bobl."
726.0,728.5, Y peth olaf y byddwn i'n ei ddweud yw ymdriniaethau o'r cyfrifon.
728.5,730.0," Byddwn i'n dweud mai mae'n fwy tebyg i chi gael,"
730.0,731.5," ac rydym ni wedi siarad am hyn yn y sgwrs,"
731.5,735.0, yn fwy tebyg i chi fod ymdriniaethau o'r cyfrifon yn cael eu harwain yn ystod y pwynt
735.0,738.5, nad yw diogelwch wedi cael ei weld a'i gwneud.
738.5,741.0, Y pwynt y mae'r rhan fwyaf o'r cyflenwi yn meddwl yw
741.0,745.0," bod ymdriniaethau yn fwy fwrdd â'u cyfrifon, ac mae'r pwynt i gael cyfrifon yn ymddygiad â'u cyfrifon."
745.0,748.0, Fy ddarganfod cyntaf am y prinsipiwyr hyn yn gwerthu'r cyfrifon.
748.0,751.0," Dwy leiaf ar y prinsipiwyr. Yn gyntaf, arosadu."
751.0,755.0, Rydym yn credu bod prinsipiwyr'r system diogel yn un o'r cyfnodau.
755.0,760.0," Yn unig, rydym yn credu bod yn rhaid i chi gael cyfrifon, yn unig, y llai cyffredinol rydych chi'n ei ddefnyddio ar bobl eraill,"
760.0,765.0," a'n ail, y terroi rydych chi wedi'u ddefnyddhoedd a'r cyhoedd yn ymwneud â chyfrifoedd."
765.0,770.0," Yn yr un ffordd nad ydym yn gallu ddiogelu'r hawliau o ran y cyhoedd, yn y bôn yn angenol, rydych yn troi'r ddiffyg yn dda iawn."
770.0,775.0," I bawb sy'n ymuno â bod rhywbeth yn dda iawn yn cael ei wneud, nid ydych yn gallu ei ddiogelu,"
775.0,780.0, nid ydych yn gallu ddiogelu peidio â chyfweliadau pobl yn unig ar y sylfaen y byddai ganddynt fuddau ymarferol.
780.0,786.4, Rydym yn dweud bod rhai pobl sydd yn berthnasbyn mynd i'r gaeaf. Mae rhai ffrindiau yn golygu y dylid ymdrinwch
786.4,790.9, ac yn dweud nad ydych yn dweud y ffordd y byddwch yn ei drafod.
790.9,795.7," Yn benodol, mae'r rhan fwyaf o'r rhai sydd wedi cael eu dewis yn y cyd."
795.7,799.3," Un, maen nhw wedi cymryd cymorth ar y cyfrif y byddwn ni'n ei ddweud wrthyn nhw,"
799.3,802.4," wrth y pwynt y byddant yn dewis yn ystyr, yn ddewis yn llwyr, yn ddewis yn fwrdd."
802.4,803.9, Nid oes ymgysylltiad â hynny yn y cyntaf.
803.9,804.6, Pwynt o dymuniad.
804.6,828.0," Felly diolch. Rwy'n credu, ac os ydych chi'n credu, rwy'n credu, ac os ydych chi'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n credu, rwy'n crei bregio'n ddiwedd i ddiwedd. Byddai'n cael ei roi i gyngor cyllid cyllid cyllid cyllid cyllid."
828.0,830.0," Rydym yn meddwl, ac os ydych chi'n credu gyda ni,"
830.0,833.0," os, ar y gwahaniaeth y gwir, mae'r dyn yn cael cyllid,"
833.0,836.0," mae'r dyn yn cael cyllid gan y cyllid cyllid,"
836.0,839.0, byddai hynny'n gwneud rhywbeth yn eich mewn chi.
839.0,841.0," Mae rhywbeth yn digwydd, ac os yw hynny'n eich gwneud chi'n teimlo hyd yn oed yn llai sych"
841.0,844.0," yn yr un ffordd mae pob un o'r aelodau o'r cydweithredol yn ei gynnal,"
844.0,849.4," rydych chi'n cytuno â ni. even slightly sick, in the same way it does every single member of the opposition bench, you agree with us. The justice system is not just about rehabilitation. It is about punishment."
849.76,853.22," Secondly, I want to say, no thank you, it's about closure for victims. We think these"
853.22,856.6," are the most important group in this debate for two reasons. One, they are more vulnerable."
856.9,860.18," They are emotionally distraught from being attacked, or they are physically distraught"
860.18,864.18, from being attacked in that same way. It's the same way as if you're raped all the way
864.18,866.72, through to if you have economic to do against you by theft.
867.04,869.78," Second of all, they did not consent to being harmed"
869.78,872.16, in the same way that someone who did commit an act
872.16,873.64, at the point of committing that act
873.64,875.2," explicitly consented to being harmed,"
875.48,877.58, whether or not there were slight worse oppressions
877.58,878.98, based on their background.
879.34,881.54, Only on side opposition do we think
881.54,884.78, that punishing individuals by the circumstances of that act
884.78,890.08, would lead to a positive effect on victims? A sense of compliance. We are the only side
890.08,894.06," of this debate that can stand for that, that can stand for providing victims of these abuses"
894.06,898.18," with closure. So if we restrict the rights of both groups, the rights of victims or the"
898.18,902.32," rights of criminals, I think it is intuitive of which that should rest. The second argument"
902.32,905.0, is about how more crimes are committed. Notice this is
905.0,909.0, a direct response from their staff about a state duty to be cared for and a direct response
909.0,913.0," from their staff about reoffence, because reoffence necessarily relies on the rate of"
913.0,917.0," initial crimes being committed. Before I unpick the logic of this argument, I'll take a few"
917.0,918.0, more.
918.0,922.0, So you seem to think that crime is an active choice. So will it just so happen that poor
922.0,926.0, African Americans are eight times more likely to make that active choice compared to white people.
926.0,930.0," There are coercive pressures that might make you more likely to make a particular choice,"
930.0,936.0, but we tell you still have the ability to make that choice at the point at which you choose to do it.
936.0,940.0, Let me talk to you in this debate about acquisitive crimes. We completely agree.
940.0,944.0, We think the overwhelming majority of the crimes in this debate are acquisitive in nature
944.0,946.48," and not strictly those that involve, for example, extensive physical or bodily trauma. Rwy'n credu bod y rhan fawr o'r ffyrdd o'r ffyrdd yn y ddewis yw'r ffyrdd sy'n gysylltiedig â'r naturiad a ddim yn ystrychol â'r rhai sy'n ymwneud â, er enghraifft,"
946.48,952.96," ymdrechau cymdeithasol neu ffyrdd cymdeithasol. Mae'r rhan fawr yn ymdrechol. Sut mae'r polisi, y cynllunio a'r broses yma,"
952.96,969.4," wedi newid y broses y tu ôl i'r cyllid i gyflawni'r ffyrdd hyn? Pan rydych chi'n gwybod bod mynd i'r ffyrdd yn anodd, That is the point at which your calculation about providing for yourself, providing for your family, being able to buy gifts for your kids, or toys for them, or even putting food"
969.4,972.7," on the table, fundamentally changes. Because you know you will be removed from your family"
972.7,976.8," for a process of years. How does this change? One, we think the overwhelming majority of"
976.8,980.6, people are more likely to commit crimes at the point at which there is effectively no
980.6,983.7," deterrent. They're getting handed a counsellor, they're getting handed a two week community"
983.7,986.66," service sentence, and they're going to walk away scot-free. But"
986.66,990.28," second of all, and most importantly, in states that only have a limited amount of funding,"
990.58,993.38," this is the side of the house, on the side of the opposition, where they spend their"
993.38,998.18, own councillors and not on provision for those that suffer from crimes of acquisition. That
998.18,999.36, is why you should vote opposition.
1004.26,1011.12, I think it's incredibly telling that they tell us from our first opposition speech that they do not want to defend the status quo.
1011.44,1016.42, One that's been trying out their nuanced methods for decades and decades and has not seen any success.
1016.76,1022.62," What they need to tell us in their next speech, and completely failed to do so in their first, was why their plan was at all reasonable."
1022.62,1027.06, Because they told us they're going to be nuanced. They told us they're going to consider different factors. Yet at the
1027.06,1030.96," same time, they never told us how they would get there. That's what we think is important"
1030.96,1035.3, in this debate. I want to make a few clarifications before I ask two questions in this speech.
1035.64,1039.72," Firstly, they say, ah, if prisons are so bad, why do you allow people into them at all?"
1040.0,1044.8," This underlies two fundamental mischaracterizations on that. Firstly, prisons are bad because"
1044.8,1045.14, of them.
1045.6,1049.5," Overcrowding, hatefulness, the fact that people actively hate prisoners on their side of the house,"
1049.76,1052.12," as evidenced by their first speech, means that prisons get worse."
1052.38,1055.24, People don't want to fund money towards humane treatment for these people.
1055.46,1057.86," But secondly, no, we are not dumping them in these prisons,"
1057.96,1059.9," we are dumping them toward where they need to go,"
1060.04,1061.86," which is sometimes maybe community sentence,"
1062.14,1064.92, sometimes maybe a better rehabilitation center.
1064.92,1065.22," We think that we've given examples such as the criminal system or green prisons, which is sometimes maybe community sentence, sometimes maybe a better rehabilitation center."
1067.7,1070.22," We think that we've given examples such as the Criminon system or green prisons, which already work much better."
1070.58,1073.12," Then they say, ah, you're treating them as inherently criminals"
1073.12,1074.38, and this takes down your whole case
1074.38,1075.82, because you're giving them rehabilitation.
1076.4,1078.9," No, we would tell you that rehabilitation tells people"
1078.9,1081.42, that people are fluid and their identities are not fixed
1081.42,1082.8, just because they are African American
1082.8,1086.0, and their community happens to have historically committed more crime.
1086.0,1089.0," They said there is a more nuanced justice system,"
1089.0,1091.0, we told you there were structural reasons that they ignore.
1091.0,1093.0, What were some of those structural reasons?
1093.0,1096.0, We told you that corporate and political interests such as the private prison lobby
1096.0,1101.0, in places like America and Venezuela meant that you cannot get that structural change on their side
1101.0,1107.66," if they allow any sense of retribution, then those lobbies take over and change policy, change the way the judge is saying it, change legislation."
1107.94,1112.68, We told you that deterrence and rehabilitation inherently counteract each other.
1112.86,1116.02," Because one has longer sentences, one tends to have shorter sentences."
1116.36,1119.34," One treats prisoners humanely, and one treats prisoners like dogs."
1119.6,1121.1, We told you that that's fundamentally different.
1121.2,1122.02, They don't deal with that.
1122.28,1126.68," Moreover, they don't deal with the stigma that comes along with this, something that I'll engage more later on."
1126.9,1129.16," Note, finally, that when they talked about money,"
1129.26,1131.44, they would tell you it's a much less expensive system.
1131.56,1131.76, Why?
1132.0,1133.16, Because the overburdening
1133.16,1135.1, of the political criminal system right now
1135.1,1137.08, is caused by the massive amount of people
1137.08,1138.74," flowing into these prisons, right?"
1138.9,1140.86, So the fact that we have tens of thousands of people
1140.86,1142.18, that do not need to be in prison
1142.18,1144.0, are massively overcrowding that system.
1144.1,1144.82, We have to feed them.
1146.0,1151.0," We have to shelter them. When they do not have to be in there for nearly as long, it's something that's incredibly expensive."
1151.0,1152.0, I want to ask two questions.
1152.0,1154.0," Firstly, is this principally just?"
1154.0,1156.0," And second, do we decrease crime?"
1156.0,1158.0," First, is this principally just?"
1158.0,1159.0, What did we hear from them?
1159.0,1162.0," They said, the state has failed many, and many didn't commit crimes."
1162.0,1168.36," So as a result, the state has no extra obligation to you, fundamentally ignoring what Lyndon told you, because those coercive pressures"
1168.36,1172.2, that they conceded themselves were incredibly important in this debate. It's like saying
1172.2,1176.18," some woman becomes CEO, so we shouldn't help women as the state. It's incredibly ridiculous."
1176.56,1180.24," I would say that the state still has a very great obligation to these people. If anything,"
1180.5,1184.3," it's mitigated to an extent. They may still have some choice, but to the extent that the"
1184.3,1186.04," state has an obligation, overtly"
1186.04,1188.12, punishing this group of individuals is incredibly
1188.12,1189.76," important. Next, they said"
1189.76,1192.34, some people fundamentally deserve to go
1192.34,1193.92, to jail because they consented to commit
1193.92,1196.2," crime. No, because in the circumstances"
1196.2,1197.88," where the state has failed, where you have"
1197.88,1199.98," poor education, where your family has been poor"
1199.98,1202.18," for generations and all the people around you are poor,"
1202.36,1204.12, it's not always a choice. And even
1204.12,1207.24," if it was a choice, we would say that this is a tautological argument, right?"
1207.38,1210.88," Just because saying, like, sometimes we want punishment because we feel like we want punishment"
1210.88,1214.94, doesn't mean that we actually should have that principle in the criminal justice system.
1215.22,1217.06, Sometimes people want vigilante justice.
1217.14,1218.56, That doesn't mean that we enact that.
1218.76,1223.54," So, if we can prove that we actually get better outcomes, we would propose that that's a better"
1223.54,1228.34," system of evaluating this debate. Why? Because they care a lot about the consent of the victims, and we agree."
1228.56,1232.5," The consent of the victims is important, but the consent of future victims which will be"
1232.5,1236.36," harmed is also important, and that's what we take out. But also, just dealing with their"
1236.36,1240.56," principle on victims, we would say that the majority of victims aren't as hateful as they"
1240.56,1244.84," would say. In fact, in the US, the majority of victims, something like 92% in the last"
1244.84,1247.68," time I read this study, actually don't want the draconian punishments"
1247.68,1250.56, that are being enforced right now because they're seen as hateful because
1250.56,1254.1, these people don't want to be punished. But to the extent that people actually
1254.1,1257.88," are so hateful on their side of the house, generally they are hateful toward the"
1257.88,1261.36," criminal because they committed an heinous crime that cannot be reconciled,"
1261.36,1266.92," such as a person who committed murder or rape. These people are the people that are most likely, on either side of the house,"
1266.96,1271.14, to be locked away for a long time because it's incredibly hard to rehabilitate these people.
1271.36,1273.62," But ultimately, in the most important way of the metric,"
1273.94,1279.7," we think that preventing crime as a whole is more important than mitigating the effects of some crime for some victims,"
1279.84,1281.88, although that may be as well important.
1282.06,1284.3," Next, let's talk about how we get better outcomes,"
1284.38,1286.5, because this was completely unaddressed on their side
1286.5,1288.4, except for like 30 seconds of their last speech.
1288.68,1290.84," I think given that they said that's the most important part,"
1291.0,1292.58, they should already be losing this debate.
1292.92,1295.36, What we told them is that rehabilitation is done better
1295.36,1297.98, in almost every single case on our side of the house.
1298.22,1299.98, There's a reason why the rule of four days exists.
1300.22,1302.34," That is to say, when you go to prison and you come out,"
1302.54,1304.64, your job prospects are now 40% lower.
1304.64,1310.2," You are likely to be paid 40% less if you find one, and your family is 40% more likely to fall into poverty."
1310.44,1313.36, The simple reason is because these people are ruined in prison.
1313.62,1316.5," There's a social stigma surrounding them by their own metric,"
1316.58,1320.36," which says that criminals are evil people fundamentally, and they deserve to go to prison."
1320.74,1323.26," Moreover, they are being de-skilled during that time."
1323.32,1328.0," When they come out, they do not have the same skills. they have that black mark on their record that they cannot remove."
1328.0,1338.0," Note the things that we talked about as well, like the criminogenic effect. Like the fact that you are surrounded by people who most likely would recruit you into gangs or toughen you up in prison just in order to survive."
1338.0,1343.0," These are the most likely people to be taken out on their side of the nomination, far more crime."
1343.0,1347.42," Their only response was, ah, we get more deterrence on our side of the house somehow."
1347.8,1350.24, This is fundamentally misunderstanding the human condition.
1350.52,1353.94, Because I don't think that the average human is evil enough to just randomly commit crime
1353.94,1355.06," just because they feel like it, right?"
1355.32,1358.46, We would say that the moral obligation you feel to other humans
1358.46,1361.56, is generally a good enough reason not to commit crime.
1361.9,1365.68," Note, also, we have other forms of soft deterrence on our side of the house."
1365.92,1370.2," It's not just like a two-week sentence in these places. It's like, for example, staying for a longer"
1370.2,1375.26," period, having your freedom stripped from you. Note, this is not as big an obligation, but it is still"
1375.26,1379.98," an deterrence, because people generally don't want their freedom and opportunities taken away. Finally, we"
1379.98,1383.68," would note that these crimes that they talk about are often crimes of passion, things that aren't"
1383.68,1388.56," premeditated, and therefore deterrence factors in. The premeditated attacks they talk about"
1388.56,1392.8," in the very, very, very minute cases, as they can see, are probably going to happen under"
1392.8,1396.74," either side, because these are just actively people and crazy people. Yes?"
1398.02,1402.64," In the case of crimes of economic acquisition, the way to rehabilitate people is to make"
1402.64,1408.02," their economic life better. Would you criminalize those people? And if not, what happens to crime rates for crimes of"
1408.02,1408.34, acquisition?
1408.9,1411.86," Yeah, generally if they commit a criminal act, what we're going to do is send them to"
1411.86,1415.6," rehab, give them job training, give them anger management classes, whatever they need. That's"
1415.6,1418.56, exactly the premise of rehabilitation. They don't get that on their side of the house
1418.56,1422.4, for the systemic reason that we talked about. But let's talk about how we stop the worst
1422.4,1426.0, crimes. Because we think the worst crimes come from organized crime syndicates.
1426.0,1429.0, How do we get that better on our side of the house? This is my new piece of substantive.
1429.0,1434.0, We tell you that organized crime syndicates are empowered when members of the community that is most affected
1434.0,1437.0, feel ostracized in the criminal justice system.
1437.0,1442.0," That is, when African Americans in Chicago cannot speak up when they see drug crimes being committed"
1442.0,1444.0, because they are fundamentally afraid of the criminal justice system.
1444.0,1446.38," They fear if they walk into that police station,"
1446.6,1448.82," they will be ostracized, they will be hated upon."
1449.02,1452.16," It's much, much harder then to get witnesses and inside information"
1452.16,1455.54, which is necessary to take down these gangs and organize crime syndicates.
1455.84,1458.08," So, therefore, in that winning mechanism,"
1458.36,1461.98, if we get better by it by not actively ostracizing these group of people
1461.98,1466.06," and making an adversarial narrative between the prison system and them,"
1466.34,1467.96, we get far better at the dealing
1467.96,1470.22, of criminal syndicates which cause the worst
1470.22,1471.98, crimes. We would note that the self-help
1471.98,1474.14, mechanisms that we talked about earlier are important too.
1474.38,1476.14, Because the reason that people slick into drug
1476.14,1478.06, addictions is because they're afraid to go to the state.
1478.36,1480.24, That's why when Jamaica implemented an amnesty
1480.24,1481.96," program, drug addiction rates"
1481.96,1484.2, fell dramatically. We get far better
1484.2,1485.0, outcomes because we stop
1485.0,1489.0, the root cause of crime. Because people don't mean to hate the state. Because people don't
1489.0,1493.0, mean to commit crimes of acquisition. They perpetuate that on our side. Their side is
1493.0,1495.0, much worse. Very proud to propose.
1499.0,1506.78," Ed told you about some of the most morally repugnant, the most evil individuals on our planet, the"
1506.78,1512.4," Joseph Fritzls, the Moors murderers, who abused systemically some of the most vulnerable people"
1512.4,1519.22, in society. Ed told you that these individuals did not deserve one penny more than it takes
1519.22,1524.08, to knock them up and keep society safe. One penny more than it takes to punish them for
1524.08,1525.96, the horrific crimes that they've committed.
1526.34,1533.62," To Ed's material, we heard not one second of response about how some people are so evil that they deserve punishment,"
1533.94,1536.98, and that is something you fundamentally believe on side of opposition.
1537.48,1538.92, I'm going to do three things.
1539.0,1542.42," One, I'm going to look at the responses to Ed's material, explain why they didn't stack up."
1542.54,1547.84," Two, I'm going to look at their own material, and then I'm going to talk to you about the perceptions of the justice system and a lot"
1547.84,1551.64, of that is going to directly respond to about the perceptions of criminals and people who
1551.64,1555.98, have gone through that justice system. Let's look first at their responses to Ed's material.
1556.32,1560.68," Ed tells you that even though, as they say, there are coercive pressures, for example"
1560.68,1566.24, people from poorer communities are coerced perhaps into committing crime. They tell you it's not always a choice.
1566.56,1571.04," In their words, Ed says, even in the poorest communities, there are individuals who manage"
1571.04,1576.4," to exist in those circumstances without turning to crime, without turning to committing acts"
1576.4,1577.34, that go against the law.
1577.6,1581.68," And that demonstrates that it is possible to make the choice that is a difficult one,"
1581.9,1584.54," but is nonetheless, from a viewpoint, morally correct."
1584.84,1585.9," If I get my brother,"
1586.02,1590.38, the fact that he's being really annoying doesn't make it any better that I get my brother.
1590.48,1595.02," So yes, we think it is a sad reality that some people are going to have to make harder"
1595.02,1598.58," moral choices if they come from backgrounds where they might be the worst, but that doesn't"
1598.58,1602.08, mean that we should just let them off for making those wrong choices because they've
1602.08,1607.26," still come out on the wrong side. Their response here was to say, point, that the state must fail to."
1607.36,1610.04, We would note that the crimes that most of the time we're talking about
1610.04,1612.54, aren't crimes that individuals have committed against the state.
1612.82,1616.78," They're crimes individuals have committed against other materials, other individuals."
1617.02,1620.0, And I would then point again to the lack of response to Ed's material
1620.0,1625.18," about the most aggressive, the most horrific individuals who we think only deserve punishment."
1625.68,1630.72, The second thing they said in response to Ed's material was that we never told you how we get to this system
1630.72,1636.78," that we proposed of weighing deterrence, weighing punishment, weighing rehabilitation against each other."
1637.0,1641.64," They said that as soon as you have some kind of lobbies, we'll be able to pressure people to make it worse."
1641.92,1644.92," We'd say, look, if they can caveat that people are going to accept this motion,"
1647.88,1651.68," presumably we can say that given that the thing we propose is actually the status quo in most states, it's likely for this to be accepted. Let's"
1651.68,1655.28, look at their material. They tell me that prison is bad and leads to more crime for
1655.28,1659.54, a whole bunch of reasons. But we would note that they still support prison for lots and
1659.54,1668.0," lots of people. So the distinction they drew here was that quote, the sentence length is not one which is suboptimal, whatever that means."
1668.0,1673.0, We would note that they gave you some reason that all sentence lengths are suboptimal by their side of the house.
1673.0,1679.0," Because you're forced to join gangs, because you're like sleeping next door to a bad person and they might make you even worse."
1679.0,1690.0," We can point that out in the POI. They suggested that prisons will somehow magically get better when their motion is implemented. yn y PY, maen nhw'n argymell bod prifysgolion yn rhywbeth yn fagus yn gwella pan fydd eu gwaith yn gweithredu. Ond yr unrhyw mecanisme i hyn oedd y syniad yw bod prifysgolion yn dda"
1690.0,1693.68," oherwydd eu bod yn ddiogel. Rydyn ni'n nodi nad yw hynny'n delio â'r problemau y maen nhw wedi'u sôn am,"
1693.68,1698.76," yn benodol o ran y bobl gorau yn y prifysgolion, felly pobl sy'n cymryd, fel, fad o gline, pobl sy'n cymryd"
1698.76,1707.28," glineu cyflawni ac y angen i gyd-dynnu. Felly, i lawer o bobl, maen nhw'n dal i fod yn rhaid i'w ddod o hyd i'r problemau gyda'r prifysgolion yr ydynt wedi siarad amdano. Rydym yn iawn â hynny oherwydd rydym yn meddwl, os ydych yn cymryd"
1707.28,1711.2," crim, rydych yn hapus i'w ddiogelu. Roedd ganddyn nhw'n cyfnod o'u bod yn eu cymryd ac wedyn"
1711.2,1714.16," wedi dweud, na, na, na, rydyn ni ddim yn parhau i fynd i'r prifysgolion. Rydym yn dweud, mynd i"
1714.16,1728.88," ganolfannau gweithredu, sy'n s what happens to the deterrence for most of the crimes that are committed,"
1728.98,1731.18, which they can see as crimes of economic acquisition.
1731.44,1734.72, At the point where the worst thing that happens when you commit a crime of economic acquisition
1734.72,1738.08," is like a few days of community service, we think, at best,"
1738.32,1742.12, we think that the numbers of people who commit those crimes are going to go up massively.
1742.26,1746.72," And by the way, that's a direct response to their point about crime rates going down. They say that people aren't"
1746.72,1750.7," evil enough to commit crime, and that most people have a moral obligation. Now, one,"
1750.94,1755.42," note that that is a huge concession on choice, because we tell you, two, that most people"
1755.42,1759.1," aren't evil enough to commit crimes, even crimes of economic necessity. And at the point"
1759.1,1762.66," where they say that as well, they can see that the people who do commit those crimes"
1762.66,1768.76," are morally wrong in some sense. And secondly, it misses the point of the fact that most people who commit crimes of economic necessity"
1768.76,1772.48, aren't committing them because they're evil. They're committing them because they're economically necessary.
1772.82,1776.06," So the point when you change the calculus for those individuals,"
1776.3,1779.22," at the point when the punishment for committing that crime is less,"
1779.42,1783.42, they're more likely to commit those crimes in the first place. We think crime rates go up massively.
1783.74,1786.14," Before I talk to you about the perceptions of justice, I'll take a moment."
1786.52,1790.18," The issue is that people are committing crimes because they are poor, because they are surrounded"
1790.18,1793.64," by communities that force them into doing those things, not because they just generally"
1793.64,1794.36, feel like crime.
1794.66,1796.96," If we address that root problem, we take down the entire case."
1796.96,1801.08," So first, Ed points out how we have much more money to spend on addressing problems of economic"
1801.08,1809.0, poverty at the point where we're not wasting it on failed notions that rehabilitating people who we say just aren't ever going to be rehabilitated and don't deserve it.
1809.0,1815.0," But second, we point to you that even women in the most horrific circumstances, when they commit these kinds of crimes,"
1815.0,1819.0," do deserve to go to prison, not least because it's a deterrent for other people committing those crimes."
1819.0,1821.0, Let's talk to you about the perceptions of the justice system.
1821.0,1827.26, The first thing to note is that most people don't have the enlightened view of Team China. Most people don't recognise that these individuals
1827.26,1831.3," have been failed by the state. Most people believe in ideas of justice, of balancing"
1831.3,1835.4," the scales. Why? One, because it's intrinsic. We say it's something fundamental to human"
1835.4,1840.32," nature that bad things should go unpunished. We see that in the cry of a child, but that's"
1840.32,1844.48, not fair. We see it in the fact that every religion has some concept of justice in the
1844.48,1848.04," afterlife, conveniently reusing the analysis from the Octo. We see that in all legal systems, ond nid yw hynny'n dda. Rydyn ni'n gweld hynny yn y ffaith bod pob ddyniaeth yn cael rhywbeth o ddydd yn y diwedd, yn gyffredinol, yn defnyddio'r gwaith o'r octoed. Rydyn ni'n gweld hynny mewn"
1848.04,1852.36," holl systemau leol, yn eu cydnabod y dydd o ddydd, yn ymddangos i'r dymuniaeth cymdeithasol"
1852.36,1857.44," am dydd. Ddwy, oherwydd dyna dymuniaeth cymdeithasol, oherwydd mae'n gyflawniol, oherwydd mae"
1857.44,1867.98," gynnwys o dydd wedi'i adeiladu i'n cymdeithas o ran y cyfryngau, o ran ffilm, o ran y sgyrsiau in terms of film, in terms of the conversations that people have on a day-to-day basis. So what happens when you see people not getting what you see as fair sentences,"
1868.24,1869.74, but instead being let off easy?
1869.86,1874.46, What happens when the person who commits a violent crime is given two weeks of counselling
1874.46,1876.12, and then let's go back onto the street?
1876.2,1879.8, What happens when the person who steals from you is given a slap on the wrist
1879.8,1883.08, and maybe has to go and see a parole officer once every couple of weeks?
1883.08,1886.76," We think that when people see a miscarriage of justice, that leads to anger."
1886.92,1889.78," One, because it violates their notions of right or wrong."
1889.84,1891.56, That ranges from petty theft to rape.
1891.8,1895.36," Two, because people feel less safe themselves at the point when they're in a society"
1895.36,1898.06, which they perceive as having people who are dangerous criminals in.
1898.34,1901.68," Three, because people lose faith and lose trust in the justice system."
1901.68,1905.78," And four, because the media is likely to play on the very worst cases of individuals"
1905.78,1909.86, and point out the kinds of miscarriages of justice that we say are happening.
1910.5,1911.24, What happens then?
1911.52,1913.16," One, you get vigilante justice."
1913.46,1917.38, Because the perception that the state is incapable or unwilling to do what is right
1917.38,1919.1, leads to people taking it into their own hands.
1919.34,1923.22," Because if you're a shopkeeper, if you die for, who regularly gets stolen from,"
1923.5,1925.24, whose wealth is taking a
1925.24,1929.94," hit, even though their crimes are economic necessity. When you see them not getting punished,"
1930.12,1933.54," when you see them getting off easy, we think you're much more likely to seek out and attack,"
1933.8,1937.7," take justice into your own hands. That's bad, because you often don't attack the individuals"
1937.7,1941.0," who are actually committing crimes, but individuals from the kinds of groups that are committing"
1941.0,1949.08," crimes. So African-Americans who don't necessarily commit crimes themselves actually do get attacked, actually do get people trying to carry out justice on their"
1949.08,1954.04," own because of the perception they are criminal groups. At the very softest scale, it looks"
1954.04,1958.06," like people excluding individuals from society. For example, if you're doing community service,"
1958.22,1961.16, it looks like you're being abused by other members of that society. It looks like you're
1961.16,1966.0," being spat on. Secondly, you get discrimination in hiring because we think people are much less likely to want to hire individuals who have come out of prison at the point when Mae'n edrych fel y byddwch yn cael eich troi arnyn nhw. Yn ail, mae'r gwahaniaeth yn cael ei gael yn gweithio. Oherwydd rydyn ni'n meddwl bod pobl yn llawer na ddigwydd"
1966.0,1968.0, i gael unigolion sydd wedi dod o'r brisyn
1968.0,1970.0, ar y pwynt lle maen nhw'n gweld y unigolion hynny fel
1970.0,1972.0, na fydd yn cael eu gweithredu'n iawn
1972.0,1974.0, neu na fydd wedi gweld y ddiogelwch y maen nhw'n ei dderbyn.
1974.0,1976.0, Beth sy'n digwydd yna?
1976.0,1978.0," Un, mae bywyd y unigolion hyn yn anodd."
1978.0,1980.0," Ddwy, maen nhw'n cael eu troi i'r crwm eto"
1980.0,1985.0, oherwydd nad ydyn nhw'n cael eu gweithio. because they're not being hired. That's a direct response to their material about how low recidivism rates
1985.0,1990.0," and about how perceptions of criminals improve. We think at the point when criminals have not seen proper justice,"
1990.0,1995.0," people will see that as well and hate those criminals even more. For all these reasons, I beg you to oppose."
2000.0,2002.0," The second opposition speaker says, and I quote,"
2002.0,2006.46," Sometimes equal and far-flore have to make hard moral decisions, and that's okay."
2006.98,2008.78," You know, I think what the subtext of their argument is,"
2009.04,2014.54," the subtext is the state is making the poor people have intentionally difficult lives,"
2014.76,2017.42," and when they slip up, as they expect them to slip up,"
2017.62,2019.7, they will punish them harshly for it.
2019.92,2022.94," We told you outside of proposition that if life was so difficult,"
2022.94,2024.52," and if moral decisions were so difficult,"
2024.82,2027.7," then on our side, we would make it easier for these people."
2027.92,2032.84," More importantly, they conceded to us that there are economically necessitated crimes."
2033.1,2037.56," And we told you that on our side, we would solve that by providing the root of the problem."
2037.84,2039.78, Because listen to their language.
2040.06,2044.06," Because in second, they literally dropped all pretenses of being nuanced."
2044.06,2046.8," Their language is, these people deserve it."
2046.94,2052.2," These people are people who we should hate, and these are people who deserve to be in the worst parts of society."
2052.2,2056.68, We think that rhetoric is rhetoric that condemns these people and doesn't provide them a way out.
2056.92,2058.28, That's what we're proud to propose.
2058.54,2059.76, Three questions in my speech.
2060.06,2061.16," Firstly, is it just?"
2061.5,2062.66," Secondly, on crime."
2062.96,2066.18," And finally, on society and people in vigilante cases."
2066.42,2069.48," So first, let's talk about the idea of whether or not it was just."
2069.72,2072.16, Because I know they tried in the first standing to want it to be nuanced.
2072.54,2077.44," But out of their second speaker, we still heard no mechanism as to how they want it to be nuanced."
2077.74,2081.38," Because we told you on our side that even with the pretense of being nuanced,"
2081.38,2089.3," in every real implementation of the system, that system would always defer to their type of rhetoric. It would defer to rhetoric that condemns prisoners"
2089.3,2093.54, as people who are inhumane. And I know that they try to rest their case on the idea that
2093.54,2098.28, it's an active choice. And we question them in our POI. Why is it that poor African Americans
2098.28,2102.7, seem to make that active choice far more than white people who are rich? We don't think
2102.7,2106.02," they're predisposed to crime, and they concede it. There is coercion involved."
2106.24,2106.92," And we told you,"
2107.1,2108.62," the moment in which there was coercion involved,"
2108.88,2111.92, the state had a responsibility to solve that coercion.
2112.18,2112.4, Why?
2112.64,2115.08, Because the state was the underlying institution
2115.08,2116.48, responsible for crime.
2116.68,2119.0," By letting individuals languish in impoverishment,"
2119.28,2121.16," by providing them no alternative,"
2121.32,2122.74, because they are provided education
2122.74,2124.32," on their side, on the house."
2124.62,2126.34, Only response to this principle we've heard is
2126.34,2128.4," well, evil people sometimes deserve"
2128.4,2130.42, punishment. We think that if they're talking
2130.42,2132.44," about evil people, this is a minute"
2132.44,2134.42, number that they're talking about.
2134.58,2136.14," And we told you, even if there were like"
2136.14,2138.32, 10 or 12 evil people that
2138.32,2140.2," should be punished, that we're vastly"
2140.2,2142.44," outweighing their benefits, because we told you"
2142.44,2144.32, that 88% of the crimes committed
2144.32,2145.0, in America
2145.0,2150.0," are committed by evil people, they're committed by people who are making out an economic dissension"
2150.0,2155.0, and they want to punish all those millions of people simply for the vast minority of evil people
2155.0,2160.0," who think that that principle is vacuous. But more importantly, we told you it was mutually exclusive"
2160.0,2167.62, that the sentence length for treatment for optimal rehab is inherently diminished the moment at which you try to consider other factors.
2167.94,2173.0," Why? Because oftentimes, other factors and other circumstances were principally oppositional."
2173.3,2178.48, Note the fact that retribution and deterrence literally make harsh excessive punishments
2178.48,2180.5, to try to get people to not commit crime.
2180.68,2182.52, So they are having a huge trade-off there.
2182.82,2186.0," Finally, their principles shrunk to the idea of how it's a waste of tax money."
2186.0,2188.0," Let's just think about this for a moment, right?"
2188.0,2192.0," Because what if that is the purpose of tax, which is to enhance state utility?"
2192.0,2196.0, And we think the average taxpayer would rather spend money rehabilitating someone
2196.0,2200.0, and creating them into a productive citizen that can contribute back into society
2200.0,2204.0, than spending it on a prisoner who will never get out of jail and who will always be a drag on society.
2204.0,2207.0," So if they want to talk about tax money, we think we've won that point."
2207.0,2211.0," Then they said, well, on our side we have more money to rehabilitate non-convicts."
2211.0,2218.0," Here's the problem. One, people in poor communities are often convicts, and this means you don't give those people rehabilitation."
2218.0,2224.0," But secondly, in response to what the second speaker told you, about how on our side we literally have more money,"
2224.0,2225.0," because people aren't being sent to jail for such long periods of time, And in response to what the second speaker told you about how on our side we literally have more money"
2225.0,2228.0, because people aren't being sent to jail for such long periods of time.
2228.0,2233.0," And it's less time you can spend on food for these people, more money you can spend on infrastructure that exists on their side of the house."
2233.0,2236.0," So if there comes money, we think we want that anyways."
2236.0,2239.0, Second question. Let's talk about the idea of crime.
2239.0,2242.0, Because they said they'd like to report rehabilitation as well.
2242.0,2247.26, The problem with this argument was that the CJS includes a healthy mix of characteristics.
2247.7,2251.84, The ability to garner political capital for rehabilitation is greatly diminished.
2252.16,2254.94, Why? Because of the very rhetoric that opposition has been saying.
2255.12,2258.28, Because these people are animals. These people are people who deserve to be in health.
2258.28,2263.56, We think that that rhetoric is literally what stops getting rehabilitation to the people who need it most.
2263.82,2268.0," But then they said, you still send people to prison, isn't prison so bad?"
2268.0,2272.0," And we told you, no, because the conditions are clearly different."
2272.0,2276.0," And it's not enough for them to scoff at us and say, well changing prison lanes doesn't actually change anything."
2276.0,2280.0," Because we gave you two key distinctions. Number one, the way people are treated."
2280.0,2284.0, And this is down to the micro nuances of how guards treat prisoners.
2284.0,2288.0," Because on their side, they're more likely to be dehumanized, to be treated as animals."
2288.0,2290.0, We solved it far better.
2290.0,2299.0," But secondly, because we make the conditions better, because we think stuffing ten people into a cell where there's likely to be rape and gang murder is not a conducive condition for people."
2299.0,2302.0," We solved the conditions, so we make prisons a lot better, right?"
2302.0,2305.5," More importantly, we told you existing prisons that they're"
2305.5,2308.5, running to defend exacerbate criminal behavior because
2308.5,2312.0, ultimately they engender crime when the life within prison
2312.0,2314.5, leads you to have connections with other criminals.
2314.5,2317.5, We told you about the stigma that occurs and ultimately
2317.5,2320.5, that stigma leads to recidivism and leads to the fact that
2320.5,2323.0, people are far less likely to get jobs and they're far less
2323.0,2324.0, likely to recommit.
2324.0,2327.68," And her response to this was, well doesn't stigma kind of increase on your side too?"
2327.68,2328.48, No it doesn't.
2328.48,2334.32, Because the main reason why the stigma exists on your side of the house is because the way criminals are perceived
2334.32,2340.08," means they're unfit for treatment, they're unfit for employment, and they're unfit people for society in general."
2340.08,2344.08, We told you we solved that far better on our side of the house for three reasons.
2344.08,2347.0," Reason number one, because we solved the root cause of crime."
2347.0,2350.0, We solved the crime that has occurred because of economic necessity.
2350.0,2354.0," Reason number two, we humanized individuals and reduced the stigma."
2354.0,2357.0," Why? Because when we provide people with job training,"
2357.0,2363.0," when we provide them with the things they need in the rehabilitation centers we need on our side of the house,"
2363.0,2368.0," these people are far more able to integrate into society, and society is far more likely to accept these people."
2368.0,2372.0," But thirdly, in our extension, which had absolutely no response, we told you how we stopped the"
2372.0,2376.0, very worst crimes. Crimes that are caused by the coercion of crime syndicates that are
2376.0,2381.0, ultimately able to flourish in areas on their side of the house. Absolutely no response.
2381.0,2383.0, Try now.
2383.0,2389.0, The number one thing which leads to higher recidivism rates is when former criminals cannot find a job.
2389.0,2395.0," Do you think that the way the widespread perception is that these criminals got off easy, people are more or less likely to hire ex-con?"
2395.0,2401.0," Okay, well I'll talk to you about the idea of how badly people perceive criminals, but you're not really dealing with mad analysis."
2401.0,2406.0," That people aren't so vindictive as you claim. That in the vast majority of developed nations, people have abolished the death penalty."
2406.0,2414.0," Because people, as you say, are people who just want mob justice. They're people who believe in the criminal justice system and can believe criminals are humans too."
2414.0,2421.0," Their response was, well, don't you kind of deter people, right? We told you, this is the very same rhetoric used to fuel the war on drugs."
2421.0,2428.16, Because deterrence and partial punishments clearly don't work when the trade-off is feeding your family or getting you into prison. People are always going to choose
2428.16,2431.72," the latter, and they've never analyzed the structural incentives of criminals."
2431.98,2436.42," Finally, let's talk about the idea of people and victims, because they say we provide closure"
2436.42,2440.48," to victims. We told you that if victims were their most important stake out here, we prevent"
2440.48,2444.4, future victims. So rather than having someone go through the trauma of getting a crime committed
2444.4,2445.04," on them,"
2447.16,2447.46, we stop that in the very first instance we think that's better.
2452.84,2455.54," But secondly, we told you on our side of the house that a lot of the expectations and hatred that they're talking about is hatred that is garnered by state rhetoric."
2455.8,2458.74," That is to say, the hate that's likely to occur on their side of the house"
2458.74,2461.24, and the vigilantes that are likely to occur on their side of the house
2461.24,2469.06," is oftentimes based on the fact that the state wows up people, that the hate that they have is manufactured because expectations are dynamic."
2469.32,2473.2," That is to say, there's not really a difference between a 20-year sentence and a 25-year sentence,"
2473.34,2473.5, right?
2473.64,2477.7, So it's unclear to us whether those extra 5 or 10 years on your side of the house make
2477.7,2479.76, any marginal difference in how people feel.
2480.06,2483.54," We told Jews, the moment that you're saying these people are animals, you're saying these"
2483.54,2487.8," people deserve no better, that is when you get hate for the very first time, that's when you get vigilante justice."
2487.8,2490.7," When they're treated as humans, we allowed them to be like that."
2490.7,2492.3," For these reasons, we were proud to propose."
2498.0,2506.0," Ladies and gentlemen, in Sweden, the country that perhaps comes closest to a justice system that prioritises rehabilitation"
2506.0,2512.0," when Angela's Brevin killed 86 children, they broke their own justice system,"
2512.0,2518.0, discarded the maximum sentence of 21 years and passed down a sentence of 86 life sentences.
2518.0,2524.0, That is because people around the world understand what site proposition fundamentally do not.
2524.0,2527.56," That justice is about what is roughed, not what is convenient. y byd yng nghymru sy'n deall beth mae cymryd y cymryd yn ei hanfodol. Mae dyniaeth yn ymwneud â'r hyn sy'n gyfranogol, nid yr hyn sy'n gyffredinol."
2527.56,2530.2, Dyna'r hyn rydyn ni'n ei ddynnu ar gyfer cymryd y cymryd y cymryd.
2530.2,2532.24," Yn ystod hynny, tri gwestiwn."
2532.24,2534.88," Yn gyntaf, pam mae pobl yn cymryd gwych?"
2534.88,2538.4," Yn ail, a yw yna ddyluniad o ddyluniad i gyflawni?"
2538.4,2541.36," A'n olaf, beth yw effaith ar boblion prisiau"
2541.36,2548.0," a beth yw effaith ar gynyddion cymryd y cymryd rhan o'r cyflogau'r ffyrdd a'r effeithlonrwydd y mae'r cynydd yn ei wneud. Iawn, gadewch i ni ddweud yn gyntaf pam mae pobl yn cymryd ffrindiau."
2548.0,2551.0, Yr hyn rydyn ni'n cael ei ddysgu gan y tîm yma yw ei fod yn ymddangos fel
2551.0,2555.0, bod ffynciau stwrtual yn gwahanol yn rhesymau pam fod pobl yn cymryd rhan
2555.0,2558.0, mewn ffynciau ffynol ac nad yw pobl yn cael eu cymryd.
2558.0,2562.0, Roedden ni'n dweud yn gyntaf y bydd llawer o bobl yn dal i ddim cymryd ffrindiau
2562.0,2569.1," er bod yn profi'r ffyn fod wedi profi'r un fath o ddysgu. Roeddent yn dweud wrthym, nid yw'r rheswm i ddysgu cymryd bryd yn gweithredu ar unrhyw un o'r unigolion."
2569.1,2574.4, Gadewch i ni fod yn fwy gwreiddiol yn y dydd hwn a meddwl am sut mae dewis dewis yn gweithredu.
2574.4,2577.6," Oherwydd mae pob dewis rydych chi wedi'i wneud, mae'n rhaid iddynt ymddygi,"
2577.6,2581.9," i ryw fath, yn gweithredu ar y pwysau cymryd bryd un ffordd neu'r un ffordd."
2581.9,2586.0, Dyna i ddweud nad ydym yn dweud nad oes pobl unrhyw ffordd neu'r gallu i ddewis eu hunain
2586.0,2591.0," yn unig, oherwydd nad ydyn nhw'n byw mewn byd o ffwrdd lle nad yw unrhyw dewis wedi cael ei effeithio"
2591.0,2593.0, mewn unrhyw ffordd neu'r llwyth o unrhyw unigol.
2593.0,2597.0, Nid ydym yn credu bod hynny'n ddiogel o ddiogelu am ddewis yn fictimion o'r system ddegasus
2597.0,2601.0, a'r llwyth o ddewis sydd mor angen i'w ddewis yn y system ddegasus.
2601.0,2605.6," Yna, mae'n dweud wrthym fod poblogaeth ynifoedd cymorth, cyflawni a chyflawni yn"
2605.6,2610.8," ffordd o gynhyrchu. Yn un cyd, mae'n bwysig bod yn gallu cefnogi pethau fel"
2610.8,2614.4," mesurau prewentifol a chyfrifoedd yn y cymunedau hyn, ac hefyd, i ryw fath,"
2614.4,2619.2," chyflawni hefyd, yn y cyd â phartnau eraill yn y system diogelu, fel y cyfrifoedd,"
2619.2,2623.2, fel y terapeuta. Ac rydyn ni'n meddwl bod cyfrifoedd yn y cymunedau hyn yn llawer
2623.2,2630.0," yn fwy tebyg i'w gynhyrchu, ond mae' yw'n ddiddorol i mi roi'r cyfrif yn eu rhoi'r cyfrif yn eu rheoli."
2630.0,2636.0," Ond hefyd, rydym yn nodi bod y rhai sy'n gallu gwneud y peth yn y debat hwn yn unigol."
2636.0,2639.0, Yr unigol yw'r rhai sy'n gallu gwneud y peth yn y debat hwn yn ystod y cyfrif economaidd.
2639.0,2642.0," Mae hyn yn ddim yn unigol i bawb, ond yn bwysig iawn,"
2642.0,2648.74," rydym yn meddwl bod yn debyg bod yn iawn bod yn y pwynt i chi gael i chi reoli pawb, not all fine, but more importantly, we think that it's probably true that at the point at which you have to rehabilitate everyone, you have less resources for the individuals"
2648.74,2652.78," who actually require things like education, who actually require things like proper health"
2652.78,2656.98," and everybody, and who probably need their help the most. So even in a case where they"
2656.98,2661.62," can prove these people do need assistance, they actually fail to provide it. Let's enter"
2661.62,2665.0, the second clash of whether there is a principle of justification for
2665.0,2668.0, reconciliation. Because they never really got to grips with Ed's principles in this
2668.0,2673.0," debate. He gave you three reasons why he's justified to punish you. One, the inherent"
2673.0,2678.0, reciprocity of punishment as something that isn't morally justified and morally demanded.
2678.0,2683.0," We got no response there, so we presume it to be true. Secondly, he told us about consent,"
2683.0,2685.0," and thirdly, he told us about vengeance. Let's look firstly at the response to the issue yn ymddangos ei fod yn wir. Yn ail, roedd yn dweud wrthym am y cymhwysedd, ac yn olaf, roedd yn dweud wrthym am y cymhwysedd."
2685.0,2690.0," Gadewch i ni ddod yn gyntaf at y cyfnod o gyfnod. Yr hyn a ddweud wrthym yw,"
2690.0,2695.0," yw bod unrhyw un yn gallu dewis i gymryd rhan mewn cymryd cyfrif, ond nid yw unrhyw ddifrif yn gallu"
2695.0,2698.0," wneud y penderfyniad i beidio â bod yn ddifrif o'r penderfyniad, ac mae eu cyngor yn ei ddweud,"
2698.0,2706.0, dyna rhywbeth y mae angen i ni ei adael. Yr hyn rydyn ni'n cael yn y cyf yma yw'r ddewis nad yw'n rhaid i ni. Mae hynny'n gyflawniad mawr o'r dynion China.
2706.0,2709.0," Os ydynt yn gallu dweud eu bod yn gofalu am ddewis cyhoeddus,"
2709.0,2713.0, yn debyg y bydd y bobl y maen nhw'n ei gofalu am yw'r dyn sy'n mynd i lawr y stryd
2713.0,2716.0, a byddai'n gweld nad ydy hi'n gallu bod yn cael ei wneud i fod yn cael ei wneud i fod yn cael ei wneud i fod yn seciol.
2716.0,2730.6," Yn debyg y bydd y bobl y maen nhw'n ei gofalu am yw'r person sydd ddim wedi meddwl y byddai'r plant eu bod yn cael eu cymryd mewn gwylfa. Rydyn ni'n meddwl bod yna'r bobl sy'n gweithio ar ddewis, yna'r bobl sy'n gwerthu neu'n gwrthwynebu cydnabod y cymorth sy'n rhaid i ni fod yn ôl ar gyfer cymorth sylfaenol."
2730.6,2734.8," Yna fe wnaethon nhw ddweud wrthym am y mater o ddifrif, ac am y angen i ddifrifion, a bod nhw'n"
2734.8,2740.0, cefnogi ddifrifion dyfodol o fod yn arwain. Rydyn ni'n meddwl bod ychydig o fanylion yn y
2740.0,2748.0," cyffrediniaeth o ddifrifion dyfodol a ddifrifion dyfodol yn ym dyfodol yn y debat hwn. Y bobl rydyn ni'n eu cymryd i'r afael â yw'r rhai sydd wedi cael eu cymryd ar y gwmpas,"
2748.0,2753.0, y rhai sydd ei dderbyn fel cyflawniad i'r ffrindiau sydd wedi cael eu cymryd.
2753.0,2759.0," Rydym yn meddwl bod y rhai hynny'n bwysig, ond rydyn ni hefyd yn meddwl bod ychydig o ddifrifwyr y dyfodol"
2759.0,2765.0," ar bwynt y bydd gennym mewn gwirionedd mewn gwirionedd, rhywbeth y mae Ed wedi'i ddweud amdano ac oedd wedi cael ei ddweud amdano. which we have property tariffs, something Ed told you about, and which they never brought to fruition."
2765.0,2769.0, Then they told us victims are not in the majority of cases capable of doing what they want.
2769.0,2774.0," Now they brought out a nice statistic from the US here, but we actually want to walk you through the rationale"
2774.0,2779.0, for victim in this situation. Because we think that it is frankly appalling that they would call someone
2779.0,2786.0," hateful who wants to see someone who hurts their child suffer, hateful who wants to see someone who stabbed sydd eisiau gweld rhywun sy'n llwyddo'u teuluoedd yn llwyddo, a phobl sy'n hoffi gweld rhywun sy'n llwyddo'u ffrindiau yn llwyddo."
2786.0,2789.0, Rydym yn meddwl nad yw hynny'n dda i'w wneud.
2789.0,2791.0," Ond hefyd, rydym yn nodi bod, os y gallwn ni'i gyflawni i chi,"
2791.0,2793.0, bod ymddygiadwyr yn hollol hollol hollol hollol hollol
2793.0,2795.0, yn y ffordd y gwnaethant eu cymryd.
2795.0,2797.0," Ac yna, mae unrhyw system diogelwch sy'n ddewis"
2797.0,2799.0, yn ddemograffol iawn yw'r hollol hollol hollol
2799.0,2802.0, a'r hawdd o ddiogelwch.
2802.0,2806.4," Yna, mae'n dwed. Yna, yn ail, yn ystod y gwirionedd, bydd y bobl gwael yn cael eu llwyddo ar gyfer cyfnodau hir"
2806.4,2811.0," o ran cyfnodau hir. Mae hyn yn fy marn i fel rhywbeth o gyflawniad,"
2811.0,2815.0, bod pobl sy'n gallu gwneud y pethau gwael yn debyg eu bod yn gwerthu rhywbeth ohono.
2815.0,2820.0," Ond hefyd, os yw'r ffyniad yma oherwydd y bydd unrhyw un yn dod yn fwy anodd ac yn gwneud gweithwyr gwael,"
2820.0,2824.0," yn debyg y byddant yn gwneud unrhyw un yn y sefyllfa hwnnw. Yna, mae'n dweud wrthym,"
2824.0,2826.0, bod cyfrifoedd morol yn cefnogi pobl i ddim ymwneud â'r ffrindiau.
2826.0,2828.0, Dyma'r person sy'n gwybod
2828.0,2830.0, bod y ffrindiau hynny'n dewisau ac ymwneud â ffyrdd morol.
2830.0,2832.0, Ac rydym yn meddwl bod yna
2832.0,2834.0," cydnabod, gan bob un o'r bobl yn y brwm,"
2834.0,2836.0," bod wrth wneud rhywbeth oedd morol,"
2836.0,2838.0, yn cael ei ddiogel.
2838.0,2840.0, Mae'n ddiddorol ac nid oedd ganddyn nhw'n cael ei ddweud.
2840.0,2842.0," Yn olaf, roedd yn dweud"
2842.0,2844.0, bod cymaint o bobl yn ymwneud
2844.0,2846.0," â ffrindiau sy'n gynnal gwrthdaro. Finally, new and third, they told us that a small number of people are involved in crimes that deserve real-life tribunals."
2846.0,2852.0," They also told us that prisons are full of rapists and murderers, so I'm unclear which of those characterisations is true."
2852.0,2858.0," But recognise that even if it is the case that a small number of individuals commit these most heinous crimes,"
2858.0,2865.0," on our side of the house, we can support absolute punishment for just those few individuals that cast a spectrum of responses across the justice system. ac mae'n gallu cefnogi gwmniadau arbennig ar gyfer ychydig o unrhyw unigolion a chyflawni sbeth o ymatebau ar draws y cyfrifoldeb."
2865.0,2871.0, Maen nhw ddim yn gallu cefnogi gwmniadau ar gyfer y mordwyr Moors. Maen nhw ddim yn gallu cefnogi gwmniadau ar gyfer unrhyw un.
2871.0,2875.0, Gadewch i ni edrych ar y ddyn o'r cyfnod o'r effaith y mae'r cyflenwi'n ei gyflwyno.
2875.0,2879.0," Yn gyntaf, mae'r cyflenwi'n ddifrifol."
2879.0,2886.0," Roedden ni'n dweud, pam y gallwch chi gael unrhyw un i ddod i'r cyfnod o'r cyflenwi? and easy to enter prisons anyway. They told us they were to make them better because fewer people are in there."
2886.0,2888.0, Let's look at the actual problems of prisons that they identified.
2888.0,2890.0," One, they told us about gangs."
2890.0,2892.0, Given they only want to put the most hardened
2892.0,2894.0," criminals in prisons,"
2894.0,2896.0, that's a problem that probably gets worse.
2896.0,2898.0, Then they told us about confined spaces.
2898.0,2900.0," Like, I'm unclear what they're going to do."
2900.0,2902.0," Like, you know, make the rooms larger?"
2902.0,2904.0," Like, we just don't think that this is a plausible character"
2904.0,2907.82, as it would happen today. Then they told have us guard the room to be less angry.
2908.1,2912.42," Yes, so there's no one there to protect you from the heart of the criminals. Like, good job, guys."
2912.54,2916.1," Okay, I'll take a quote from that. So, if people are the victims"
2916.1,2920.28," of a murder, why exactly does 30 years of a sentence make so much of a difference"
2920.28,2923.38," compared to, like, 10 years, given a likeness that would be measured in sentence lengths?"
2923.64,2928.0," Okay, this is about the same character between a 30 mlynedd a 10 mlynedd yn ymwneud â'r ffaith."
2928.0,2930.6," Mae'r ffaith yma o ran y dylid gwneud cyfnod o'r cyfrifol,"
2930.6,2935.4," o ran y cymaint y byddai'n rhaid i'w ddarllen, a'r cymaint y byddai'n rhaid i'w ddysgu."
2935.4,2937.2, Dyma'r hyn rydym yn credu y mae'n gwneud i'r ddysg ddigwydd.
2937.2,2940.8, Rydym yn credu nad ydych chi'n deall bod y dylid gwneud hynny yn ymwneud â'r cyfnod.
2940.8,2948.72," Rydych chi'n ei wneud. in this way, you do. Then they talk about making people safer, and especially victims, when they lower reoffending rates. Firstly, this probably isn't true when deterrence is"
2948.72,2952.5," something that they can't like, a problem that they've never been tricked in. But also"
2952.5,2956.68," reactively, people don't feel safer when they don't feel people in their society feel"
2956.68,2961.18," punished. Finally, on this issue of stigma against ex-convicts, because they've wanted"
2961.18,2966.0, to mischaracterise other arguments by default here. Because what they never really understood is that people are willing to re-accept people in their society when they feel they've participated oherwydd maen nhw eisiau llyfru'r farn o'r farnau oherwydd beth nad ydyn nhw wedi deall yw bod pobl yn ddylai
2966.0,2970.0, ddeall pobl yn eu cymdeithas pan maen nhw'n teimlo eu bod wedi cymryd rhan yn y cyflawniad
2970.0,2975.4, o ddifrif yn hytrach na'r ffrind. Rydw i'n credu mai dyna'r pwynt ar gyfer y bydd pobl yn fwy
2975.4,2980.0," arfer i gyd-ddeall. Yn olaf, yn ystod y munud o'u sgwrs ddwy, maen nhw'n dweud y bydd"
2980.0,2985.0," yna ddwy farn o'r cyflawniad cyntaf gan ddynion. Os yion. Os ydynt am mwy o bobl yn dod ymlaen,"
2985.0,2988.0, maen nhw wedi cymryd cymorth i ddewis pethau sy'n gwaethaf ar eu ochr y tŷ.
2988.0,2991.0, Maen nhw wedi cymryd cymorth i ddewis bod yn llai allu i ddynnu pobl.
2991.0,2993.0, Maen nhw wedi cael eu llwyddo.
2999.0,3001.0," Roeddwn i'n seilio mewn y sgwrs, yn y tu allan."
3002.0,3006.1, Mae myfyrwyr rheolaidd yn arfer yn eu prifysgol. Roeddwn i'n gweld rhywbeth. downstairs regularly teaches law students practice their profession. I saw something.
3006.1,3010.6," A woman, a female figure of justice, sitting not just with the scales in her hand, one"
3010.6,3016.0," in the other, but with a blindfold on. And that is because the central tenet of every"
3016.0,3021.0, justice system around the world is that it is blind. It does not account for circumstance.
3021.0,3030.46," It doesn't matter if you have slightly worse oppress pressures one way or the other. It is that some things are just wrong. That if you rape someone, you should"
3030.46,3034.96, not be sent to a community service programme. You should be locked away. If you break into
3034.96,3039.32," someone's house at night and stand open with a knife, you should not say, oh, you are pressured"
3039.32,3044.28," because of your economic circumstance. No, that is wrong. Two questions in this debate."
3044.58,3046.0," Is this policy right? What is its effect on crime rates? On whether it's No, that is wrong. Two questions in this debate. Is this policy right? What"
3046.0,3050.04," is its effect on crime rates? On whether it's right, this is the most important area of"
3050.04,3053.66," this debate. Because as we've told you, and it's not only non-contingent, but justice"
3053.66,3057.5," fundamentally relies on doing that which is right, not contingent or practical outcomes."
3057.7,3061.62, That was best explained to you in Rachel's. We've brought you two things here. The first
3061.62,3069.0," is the idea of dessert. These people make an intentional choice to commit a crime, and for that they consent to all punishment that might be coming their way. They stand up and Rydym yn cyflwyno ddwy bethau yma. Yn gyntaf, mae'r syniad o ddysg. Mae'r bobl yn gwneud dewis o ddylunio i wneud rhywbeth a, i hynny, mae'n gallu cymryd cymorth i bob o ddiffyg a fyddai'n dod eu hwynebu."
3069.0,3073.78," Maen nhw'n dechrau a dweud, oh, maen nhw'n anabod i wneud y dewis oherwydd maen nhw'n dod o'r ffactor anodd."
3073.78,3086.0," Dwy bethau. Un, rydym yn dweud wrthych fod y ffaith bod chi'n cael eich cymryd neu'n ysgwyl un o'ch rhain, yn eich rhain heb unrhyw dewis yn y mater, mae'n ddifrifol. I ddweud y pwynt arall rydych chi wedi mynd i lawr a'ch rafu rhywun,"
3086.0,3088.0, mae'r ffaith bod chi'n dod o ddwylyd cyffredinol
3088.0,3090.0, ddim yn gwerthu a ydych chi wedi gwneud y dewis.
3090.0,3093.0," Ac yn benodol, pan ddywedwn i chi bod milion, os nid miliwn o bobl,"
3093.0,3097.0," yn anabod neu yn penderfynu i ddewis nad ydych chi'n gwneud y dewis,"
3097.0,3100.0, mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud i mi yn benodol pam bod rhai o'r rhan o'r ddewis
3100.0,3105.0," yn cael eu llwyddo ar un ffordd neu'r arall yn ddigon. Y peth ail y byddwn ni'n cyfrifo i'r debat hwn, a'r syniad y byddwn yn ei ddweud,"
3105.0,3106.2, yw'r fictim.
3106.2,3108.6," Ac maen nhw'n ceisio gwneud hyn yn y sôn yn y sgwrs ddwylydd,"
3108.6,3109.2," pan ddywedon nhw,"
3109.2,3111.6," o, ond 98% o'r Amerigain yn meddwl y dylenion ddyleu'n cael eu trafod,"
3111.6,3113.2, bod pobl yn cael eu trafod mewn un ffordd.
3113.2,3114.2," O, yn y sgwrs llwyr nhw,"
3114.2,3116.4, maen nhw wedi dweud bod y dyniaeth yn debyg i'w ddweud.
3116.4,3127.62," Beth mae'n cael ei ddweud yw'r anawster i ddeall, fear that victims have every day. So the reason they care about the crimes they've committed is not because of the tangential effects on future arrest rates. It's because we trauma"
3127.62,3131.46, and live with them every day of the day that they were assaulted. The terror that they
3131.46,3135.14, still fear waking up in the middle of the night and remembering the time when a man
3135.14,3139.36, was standing over them with a knife. That is why we care about victims so much. But
3139.36,3142.44," crucially, the lie about victims who have got no response to the proposition speech"
3142.44,3149.3," that came in our first proposition speech was this, that if restricting the choice of Yr hyn a ddweud amddiffynwyr nad oedd yn ymwneud â'r sgwrs cynrychiol a ddod yn ein sgwrs cynrychiol cyntaf oedd hyn Os yw rhwystrau penderfyniadau i ddifrifion yn anadeilol i rhwystrau penderfyniadau o ddifrifion"
3149.3,3157.6, Dylem bob amser ysgrifennu rhwystrau penderfyniadau o ddifrifion oherwydd maen nhw'n cymryd cymorth mewn ffordd y gall ddifrifion ddim wneud o ran amgylcheddau
3157.6,3161.5," Yn ystod y cyfnod, beth mae'n bwysig i ddifrifion os yw'n 10 neu 30 mlynedd?"
3161.5,3166.0," Yn gyntaf, nid ydynt yn deall y problem yma. Mae 20 mlynedd o unrhyw un wedi'i aswlt arnoch chi yn y strydau,"
3166.0,3168.8, mae 20 mlynedd o unrhyw un wedi'i ddysgu o chi yn y strydau.
3168.8,3171.2, Dyna pam dylem ni ddysgu cyfrifolion yn ystod hyn.
3171.2,3175.0," Yn ail, ar ffyrdd fwriadu, maen nhw'n seilio ac yn dweud wrthym fod prifysgolion yn orfod."
3175.0,3177.6, Rydym yn dweud wrthych fod hyn yn ystod y tensiwn cyfan o'u cas.
3177.6,3185.0," Roeddwn i'n dweud bod y prifysgolion yn y pen draw yn cael eu hysbysebu i'r prifysgolion. Y gwahaniaeth yw nad yw'n bwysig bod yna'n ymysg am 10 neu 30 mlynedd,"
3185.0,3190.0," fel y dywedom chi ar y cyfnod cyntaf, oherwydd gallwch ddysgu sut i gyrru cariad mewn amser o ddwy awr."
3190.0,3195.0," Nid oes ynghyd â hynny. Ond yn ail, dywedom i chi, ac mae hyn yn well ymddangos i'r hyn a ddweud wrth Rachel,"
3195.0,3200.0," bod y rhai sy'n cael eu hysbysebu i'r prifysgolion mewn amgylchedd mwy ymddygiadwy, yn fwy tebyg i'w"

3207.84,3211.0," this policy. They say that deterrence exists already, but they can't have their cake and"
3211.0,3214.34, eat it. They can't claim to have a system that benefits minority groups by basically
3214.34,3218.84, not punishing them and claim that there exists a substantial deterrence. The reasons we told
3218.84,3222.72, you that crime rates actually increase is as a result of opportunity. And the point
3222.72,3228.12," at which they spend millions of dollars paying for psychologists, paying for counsellors for some of the most evil human"
3228.12,3232.22," beings on planet Earth, is the point at which they cannot afford to educate African Americans."
3232.48,3235.98, The point at which the overwhelming majority of states and states that aren't America cannot
3235.98,3239.72, afford to provide people with the things that mean that they do not have to turn to a creative
3239.72,3244.14," crime. If you believe some crimes are simply wrong, then we shouldn't be sending people"
3244.14,3246.0," to community service, vote for proposition."
3246.0,3251.0," But if you also believe the best way to stop crimes is to tell people that they shouldn't do it, that they will be posed for doing it,"
3251.0,3254.0, that is also the point which this debate has to go to opposition.
3260.0,3265.06, I think the correct question to ask yourself at the end of this debate is what happens on their side.
3265.52,3271.9," What happens in their legal system, which they claim to be nuanced into a flippant response from third that actually didn't explain anything?"
3272.2,3279.3," What happens to the African Americans locked up in prisons, not given opportunities, de-skilled, and given a black mark for the rest of their lives?"
3279.54,3286.02," What happens to the women and children living in dangerous areas that they make more dangerous on their side of the house, what happens?"
3286.32,3288.84, And I think it looks a lot like the US and UK.
3289.28,3294.22," Examples that we gave you from first, where crime rates and view offense rates are skyrocketing"
3294.22,3298.2," still, even though they've been trying to nuance policies that opposition has talked"
3298.2,3299.58, about throughout the entire debate.
3299.58,3305.38," Their third says, let's just punish the worst offenders partially by giving them a life sentence,"
3305.52,3309.68," which, unfortunately, is not only glib and late, but also crosses the house, because"
3309.68,3315.74," presumably, that's probably what we'd be giving them as well, because it's very hard to rehabilitate"
3315.74,3319.72," these people. So, if you agree that we should give the worst offenders life sentences, and"
3319.72,3323.88," we should treat everyone else with rehabilitation, you are probably conceding overnight consent"
3323.88,3328.18," to our case. No, their reply also contradicted this when he said they don't care about circumstances"
3328.18,3330.06," because justice is blind, right?"
3330.3,3332.0, I want to ask you three questions.
3332.18,3333.9," Firstly, is this more a just system?"
3334.2,3335.88," Secondly, do we better solve petty crime?"
3335.96,3338.1," And thirdly, do we better solve violent crime?"
3338.36,3341.62," Firstly, on the just system, there are two observations to make here."
3342.08,3348.96," Firstly, that there is a coercive force that they have conceded down the bench. Now we know this is not an absolute force, but it is still"
3348.96,3353.6, a coercive force to the extent that it is massively coercive based on communities that
3353.6,3357.58," you live in, the poverty that you were disenfranchised by, the people that you grew up with, and"
3357.58,3362.42, the prison system that you were shackled into. That was a very expressive coercive force.
3362.56,3368.2," And no, the solution to two people being coerced is not to punish everyone, it's to"
3368.2,3370.16, try to solve the problem at hand.
3370.16,3374.4," So even if there's slightly less coercion on the hand of the criminal, we still shouldn't"
3374.4,3377.04, be vindictive for absolutely no reason.
3377.04,3380.66," Second thing we told you is that future victims should be prioritized over current victims,"
3380.66,3384.44," because while we do care for current victims, future victims are far more important."
3384.44,3388.84, And the reason we told you is because preventing the crime is more important than ameliorating
3388.84,3390.12, the impacts of the crime.
3390.4,3391.4, We told you that was important.
3391.6,3393.1, We heard literally no response.
3393.42,3398.2," Then, on petty crime, and note this is 88% of the debate unresponded to, they try to"
3398.2,3401.3, storm at it by just exacerbating and mixing up the types of crime.
3401.58,3403.16, The first thing they said is that we don't have money.
3403.42,3404.68," This is just bad math, right?"
3404.72,3408.44, I come from China. I can tell you it's a lot cheaper. So the reason they said that is
3408.44,3414.32," spending $70,000 per year on criminals who stay in the system for much longer and are much more"
3414.32,3418.36, likely to come back is much more expensive than hiring some counselors. Much more expensive than
3418.36,3422.4, spacing them out. They get far more criminals. That's why it's far more expensive. No response.
3422.68,3427.2," Then they said, ah, deterrence. We told you that it doesn't work in the majority of cases that they're going to be talking"
3427.2,3432.78," about, because when it comes to a life prison sentence, when it comes to beating a family"
3432.78,3435.46," or a prison sentence, you're almost always going to beat your family."
3435.8,3440.36, But the analysis that we gave you that they didn't respond to was that in the circumstance
3440.36,3444.78," that we don't have economic deprivation as they do on their side of the house, you're"
3444.78,3449.0, much less likely and you don't need overwhelming deterrence. That was something that was unresponded
3449.0,3453.18," to. Thirdly, on backlash, firstly this is untrue given the stats we gave you, given"
3453.18,3456.8," that in places like Norway this doesn't exist, that is whipped up by their side of the house"
3456.8,3460.36, because the black mark and the message the government sends is that these people are
3460.36,3464.46," evil. Finally, we told you that the criminal justice effect happens uniquely on our side,"
3464.7,3468.42, they said it happens anyway. That's a fundamental misunderstanding. We're not sticking them
3468.42,3471.86, in overcrowded prisons anymore right next to the worst offenders. We are separating
3471.86,3475.72," these people. We are putting them in different sentences, often community sentencing. That"
3475.72,3479.06," means that they get lost opportunities, they get hatred, they get communities that are"
3479.06,3483.38, surrounding them that often incite more violence. Note that people will still hire them and
3483.38,3485.78," they're prepared to be more likely to hire them on our side,"
3485.9,3487.66, because that black mark does not exist.
3487.9,3490.1," Finally, the upshot of this argument is that in the short term,"
3490.2,3491.52," maybe we have largely less deterrence,"
3491.76,3494.58," but in the long term, we stop these systemic factors in the majority of cases."
3494.94,3497.06," Finally, on violent crime, they fail to respond,"
3497.36,3499.34," firstly, because this is the smallest minority of cases,"
3499.64,3502.88," and secondly, we thought we'd better solve it by having witnesses that can speak up."
3502.88,3504.62," People that aren't necessarily part of gays,"
3504.86,3508.52, but saw crimes happening and give insider information. For all of these
3508.52,3512.54," reasons, we stop the systemic groups of crime, we prevent gangs from forming, we prevent"
3512.54,3515.8, people from falling into the poverty trap. We are very proud of the vote.
