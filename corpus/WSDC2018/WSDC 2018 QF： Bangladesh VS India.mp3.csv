0.0,26.14, The world has had enough of the rich using developing countries as battery ramps for their own development. Rich corporations and individuals
26.14,27.96, that don't care about the economic
27.96,30.1," fabric of your own country, but rather"
30.1,32.06," care about their own selfish motivations,"
32.46,34.18, their own profit-driven incentives.
34.52,35.92, When these rich corporations
35.92,37.94, are allowed to go and buy entire
37.94,40.18, areas that not only give them economic
40.18,42.14," capital inside your own country,"
42.42,43.98, but also gives them political leverage
43.98,50.4, because they're the sole investors and sole owners of these areas. Meaning that municipalities
50.4,56.4," have to listen to what they say, have to bow down to their claims over that land. We think"
56.4,62.4," that that sort of ownership, that sort of reach of sub-branching is unjustified. Two"
62.4,68.44," burdens in this debate today. First of all, how foreign owners hinders"
68.44,72.64," the ability of these countries to develop and secondly, how it facilitates a form of"
72.64,76.48, gentrification in these countries. My second speaker is going to come up and talk about
76.48,81.48, why it's immoral for people coming from developed countries to benefit off of this land. What
81.48,89.74," is the model that we propose in our house today? First of all, we think that there is no ownership of land by entities that have a majority of foreign ownership,"
90.02,94.6," whether this be individuals or whether this be corporations. Second, we think that these"
94.6,100.66," governments, if they want foreign investment, will have to set up export processing zones"
100.66,107.0," or investment capsules, as seen in Bangladesh and India and multitude of other developing countries."
107.0,113.0, These are areas in which foreign corporations can lease or rent land where foreign corporations
113.0,120.0, are concentrated meaning that 20 or 30 different corporations share the same amount of area of land.
120.0,147.44," Finally, any other benefits that the government wants to give these corporations, like tax breaks and tax holidays, in order to make their countries more attractive for foreign direct investment, will all still apply under our world. What does this be comparative of the two worlds look like? own land, any corporation is able to come into your country and bid out that land if"
147.44,152.0," it is for sale, meaning that they can occupy and buy any land that is up for sale."
152.0,158.38," Under our work, the government has exclusive control as to where these corporations are"
158.38,164.08," located, what their level of involvement is in the local community, and they are able"
164.08,172.0, to cluster these companies in a specific area to limit their sphere of influence both politically and economically.
172.0,178.0," Before I move on, would you ban people above a certain income bracket from buying land from the poor?"
178.0,187.64," If that comes at the cost of displacement of the poor or it comes at the cost of gentrification of these poor people in their land, to the point that they can't live on their land, then sure,"
187.76,193.86," we're alright with limiting that as well. Why do foreigners want to own that? For corporations,"
194.08,198.32," the incentives are simple. They want to tap into different markets, or cheaper labor,"
198.32,203.44," or lower property taxes, that reduces their cost of production relative to if they were"
203.44,205.12, producing in their own country.
205.12,209.92," For individuals, it's a method by which they want to protect their wealth."
209.92,216.0," Meaning that it's safer to invest in a developing country because the property taxes are less,"
216.0,219.2," you'll be charged less by the government for keeping your money here,"
219.2,222.0, but it's also as investment in speculative markets.
222.0,225.84," If the price of land is on the rise in Bangladesh or India, then this is a"
225.84,227.92, lucrative market for individuals to tap
227.92,229.8, into. Note that
229.8,232.02, these incentive structures all
232.02,233.9, cater to the personal benefits
233.9,235.38, of these corporations.
235.76,237.92, Meaning that even if
237.92,239.84, they can show that some corporations
239.84,241.9," deserve some freedom, the fact that that"
241.9,243.92, freedom comes at the cost of the economic
243.92,248.06, fabric of these particular countries means that we have the ability to limit that freedom
248.06,248.86, in and of itself.
249.04,252.04, First argument about how it hinders the ability of these countries to develop.
252.36,253.84, What are developing countries looking?
254.1,258.86," These are countries with extremely high population densities, extremely high rates of poverty,"
259.16,266.0," a widening wealth gap, and the countries that are primarily dependent on primary and secondary tiers of production."
266.0,273.0," But also, these are emerging markets, meaning that in the next 20 or 25 years, these countries, if allowed to develop on their own,"
273.0,284.0, can create an environment in which their own economy proliferates and they become a Tier 2 country in and of itself.
284.0,288.0, What do these countries want then in order to facilitate that growth?
288.0,291.0," First of all, foreign direct investment."
291.0,297.0, We recognize that these countries often times want foreign direct investment in their own countries
297.0,301.0, in the form of investing in their own local companies to bolster their own local trade.
301.0,311.0, They at best want certain other MNCs to set up branches on their local land so that their economy also proliferates.
311.0,317.0," Secondly, these developing countries want to specialize because most developing countries have a niche that they can tap into."
317.0,326.0," For Bangladesh, it was the jute trade, the garlands trade. For countries in the Horn of Africa or in the western coast of Africa, it's a mineral trade."
326.0,330.0, It's a trade of gold and other precious metals.
330.0,335.0," Third, meaning that these countries need to have a roadmap on which they can rely."
335.0,340.0," Third, these countries are heavily incentivized for poverty alleviation."
340.0,346.0, They want to ensure that the average citizen has more purchasing power so that they can
346.0,348.0, live themselves out of poverty.
348.0,350.0," Finally, these countries want to maintain a roadmap."
350.0,352.0, What does this roadmap look like?
352.0,356.0," This roadmap looks like development, that is center outwards, meaning that they can"
356.0,358.0, start developing the center.
358.0,362.0," Once these urban centers are created, they can expand outwards."
362.0,376.0," Sporadic, random development of places that are of no strategic and economic value to them is extremely harmful for them because that limits their ability to allocate resources where it is necessary."
376.0,385.22," Why are all of these incentives better under a world where these companies are no longer able to own land. Because once you limit their ability to own land,"
385.44,389.62, you also limit their ability to distort the planning that the government has made.
389.82,390.68, What does this look like?
390.82,394.58," This means that the government, now that corporations on their own volition"
394.58,396.4," cannot create the industries that they want,"
396.74,399.74," governments have better control over what kind of jobs are created,"
399.74,410.0," what kind of industries in what tier of production are cropped up, where that industry is created as to how it can benefit the maximum number of people,"
410.0,415.0, or how it can create employment for people that can avail that employment.
415.0,423.0," But also, it allows governments to cluster these corporations together in a way that cancels out their political influence."
423.0,426.16, Meaning that one company can in no way
426.16,428.82, dictate the terms of their own state.
429.08,431.66, This means that employment is more consistent
431.66,433.94, because you are able to have stronger loss
433.94,435.8, due to the erosion of lobbying power
435.8,436.96, from these corporations.
437.32,439.88, This means better job security for people in these countries
439.88,441.74, and better industrial protection
441.74,444.12, because the terms of the state are dictated by the government.
444.38,448.1," Finally, a second argument as to how it facilitates gentrification."
448.1,454.3," Because when corporations go and buy these places, they outbid these places and increase the price of the land they stay."
454.3,462.6," In Kolkata, tobacco companies bought out slums and increased the price of land to the point that the regular average person could not avail."
462.6,465.76, The incentives are that these lands are cheap and the
465.76,467.98, economic zones that they create are
467.98,470.04, beneficial for them. But once they buy
470.04,472.32," them, this results in forced displacement"
472.32,474.06, or even if
474.06,475.64," it's not, it makes sure that the"
475.64,478.1, places are so expensive to stay in
478.1,480.16, that the local citizens
480.16,482.08, have to move out of that place if
482.08,484.16, they want to maintain their own standard of living.
484.42,487.0, This is particularly important for a number of reasons.
487.0,493.0," Firstly, because this happens often in remote locations that are home to many tribes, many minorities,"
493.0,498.0, because those are the places that have populations with the least political and non-political capital.
498.0,502.0," The protection of them is particularly important because they have the least ability to relocate,"
502.0,508.7," the least ability to preserve their own way of life. You know, we're not going to allow these corporations to dictate"
508.7,512.8, how they buy land and when they do so. We think that you will have their ability to
512.8,517.3, stay within their own countries. That is an important point that we must have. Proudly.
520.8,525.0, Zero thoughts on anything to do with land. That's what we heard from Zeit proposition.
525.0,533.0, They wanted a generic debate about whether government should be able to influence the kind of road map in which development happens in their country.
533.0,539.0, Not discussing the actual debate at hand. Whether foreign individuals should be able to own land within the country.
539.0,545.0," They just wanted a generic debate about what their national corporations. We are sorry, but that's not what this is about."
545.0,550.0, We cannot buy into the policy whose house lands on the poor.
550.0,551.0, What do we stand for?
551.0,555.0, We are happy to influence and institute basic regulations in these countries.
555.0,561.0," Anti-trust laws, insider trading regulations, things like restrictions on political campaign contributions."
561.0,564.0," If they want to talk about political influence, that is something we can regulate."
564.0,568.6, But what is the kind of land that actually gets bought up by foreign owners?
568.88,573.94," It's not natural resources, and because usually these are state-owned, it's not the most agriculturally"
573.94,577.74," productive land, because there's no reason to sell these land when people are benefiting"
577.74,583.0," from it. It's often barren, over-cultivated land that's developed in world is so round"
583.0,589.0," and round. But remember, as a state, we can still selectively choose to buy back land or have practices"
589.0,593.5," like eminent domain, but there is a high bar for that, a bar that they do not need and"
593.5,595.0, they never try to meet.
595.0,599.5, The comparative is whether we can filter out and regulate foreigners on whether they should
599.5,601.5, never be able to own land.
601.5,605.06," In developing countries, in some countries, incentivize foreign owners"
605.06,609.04, to come in and buy land through things like subsidies. Some others profit from foreign
609.04,613.26, owners by taxing them at a higher rate. They want a broad strokes span where they don't
613.26,618.48," care for the unique needs of every developing nation. They just pretend that Ghana, India"
618.48,623.76," and Zimbabwe are all at the same economic level. Obviously, we can also increase investments"
623.76,625.34, in things like public housing.
625.34,627.44, So they want to describe gentrification
627.44,629.0, as something we can still regulate.
629.0,630.6," Our three arguments are,"
630.6,631.92," there's a right to sell land,"
631.92,634.22," second, it is a win-win for the poor on the ground,"
634.22,636.94," second, we can argument on not reasonable speculation"
636.94,638.78, in developing nations is useful.
638.78,640.24, Three areas of response.
640.24,643.46," First, on their horrific stance that was so broad,"
643.46,645.4," second, on the idea of the white-wing gap, and third, on gentrification. First, let's horrific stance that was so broad. Second, on the idea of the white-ling gap."
645.7,647.18," And third, on gender discrimination."
647.36,648.9," First, let's describe this now."
649.34,652.22," Sorry to interrupt, but this debate is about foreign individuals,"
652.3,653.02, both on England.
653.36,656.4," It is not a gender-incorporated debate about all foreign investment, right?"
656.6,658.72, But what did they take on the board of defending?
658.94,661.58, Literally 80% of the world's capital is disappearing
661.58,668.0, because they want no multinational corporations to come into their areas. This is a world where multinational corporations only want with
668.0,673.0, the capital the ability to build infrastructure and bring in massive employment and skills
673.0,677.0, training to the developing world. How many multinational corporations don't have a profit
677.0,682.0, incentive to enter developing nations on their study house? They say then that they prefer
682.0,686.0, a world with crippling poverty and rampant unemployment
686.0,692.0, because that's what developing nations looked like previously entry of some employment and some industrialization.
692.0,698.0," They wanted over dependence on agriculture, the governments across the world have been fighting so hard to do or to erase."
698.0,702.0," That's why they were so scared, right? That they were so scared about the lack of industrialization."
702.0,708.0," They said, no, no, we will do all of these reasons and we will have all of these same issues, but we will give them special economic zones."
708.0,711.0, But we will incentivize them to come in and develop industrialization.
711.0,716.0, Not even explaining to us how those two go hand in hand and how special economic zones
716.0,720.0, are somehow uniquely beneficial without an independent of the other half.
720.0,723.0, But it was truly telling what the extent of their principle was.
723.0,730.0," When the investors looked at it, they were like, they were telling you fromvo selling it to a person from a higher economic class who could misplace it."
730.0,735.0, They are a side that didn't realise that poor individuals aren't just individuals who are stupid
735.0,737.0, but don't have information. They were so patronising.
737.0,741.0," They said, no, it harms you, we know what's best for you, we will do it for you."
741.0,744.0," We said, no, poor people should have the ability to sell."
744.0,747.0," Finally, we got the idea of gentrification."
747.0,753.0, The problem is that they fail to demonstrate how the majority of land investment is something that takes away.
753.0,757.0," But even if it is something that is gentrified, it is often done by domestic populations,"
757.0,761.0, which they were somehow having to support because people who live in higher class houses
761.0,768.54," for some reason were expats and were people from foreign nations, apparently these white people moving into Ghana. But second, if this is a debate indeed that's"
768.54,773.74," about housing, the vast majority of poor nations rely on renting and by pushing these very"
773.74,778.94," individual to take out renting, they hike the cost and displace individuals first from"
778.94,784.3," housing that is alleged. First, that is a right to serve. Why is this an unfair violation"
784.3,785.0, of property? I think the right to property is a natural to serve. Why is this an unfair violation of property?
785.0,789.0, I think the right to property is a natural right that derives from a few movements.
789.0,793.0, And an extension of the right to property is the right not to go to property.
793.0,797.0, You should be allowed to determine who you sell to and how you sell to them.
797.0,801.0, There is an autonomy over the terms of sale. Their bar doesn't meet the standard for this.
801.0,806.0, It's a fatalizing policy that doesn't realise that individuals are going to be desperately poor.
806.0,812.0," There might be a really bad time for the economy, they might not have a job, they might have to move or have medical costs."
812.0,819.0," Like they said, we know what you need. We think that's a legend. But uniquely you should have the ability and the freedom to sell to foreigners."
819.0,826.0," Why? Because they bring in liquidity to the market, they bring in competition against oligopolies of contractors who are so powerful that they"
826.0,829.0, set prices and collude with each other and exploit the poor.
829.0,832.0," Specifically, what is the alternative on their side?"
832.0,836.0, Local landowners being the only option for the poor to sell their land to them.
836.0,838.0, Why is that so egregious?
838.0,843.0," In India, we see with Zamindars and upper caste individuals, in Ghana, higher up tribes"
843.0,868.0," like the Asharim tribe in Ghana. The make profits is by saying,"
868.0,874.0," I will let you set your own terms, I will respect you as an individual if you have the ability to sit across the table from me."
874.0,881.0, They retain the most poor in the same kinds of poverty that we want to discard from our history of oppression.
881.0,886.0, It is fair to say that there is an unfair ban that does not meet the actual standard that they have to meet.
886.0,887.0," Sure, they have to meet."
887.0,894.0," If it is so true that the Jamindars dictate everything about the land, what if they say no to your foreign ex-commitment?"
894.0,901.0, You may agree. You have to realize that foreign investors have the power to go against the Jamindars.
901.0,910.0," They have the power because they are not subject to the same class hierarchy. They are independent of that, which means they have a profit incentive to tap an unsaturated"
910.0,913.5, market. And when they can go in and realise that these poor people want to sell land to
913.5,917.0," investors so they don't have the ability to sell their own farms, that's the profit incentive"
917.0,921.0," they need with that. Second, why is there a double win for the poor? Poor right now"
921.0,925.0, are stuck with unproductive land and can't escape its poverty. Two thoughts there.
925.0,927.0," First, this creates better agricultural production."
927.0,929.0, Three issues with land as its own now.
929.0,933.0, It is fragmented. Millions and millions of people exist in the developing world
933.0,937.0," and over inheritances splitting it among families with ten children,"
937.0,940.0, they have become so small that you cannot actually agriculturally produce.
940.0,942.0," Second, they are over cultivated."
942.0,946.0, Soil and its nutrition are depleted and they are barren in the state they exist right now.
946.0,952.0," Third, there are traditional unscientific agricultural practices. A lack of irrigation or technology."
952.0,958.0, The crucial incentive of these investors is to amass big estates of land and use modern technology.
958.0,965.0," High yielding varieties of food grains, tractors, irrigation, which means they create food security for the first time in these developing nations."
965.0,970.0, We saw this exactly in Zimbabwe when the policy to kick out white farmers meant a huge
970.0,975.0," dirt in the availability of food grains, which meant that the prices of basic necessities like food went"
975.0,980.0," up by a vast amount of just illegitimate. But second, it empowers the individual who"
980.0,988.0," says, I am right now a person who is stuck in disguised employment, in a piece of land that requires two people to cultivate, which my family of ten cultivates."
988.0,992.0, I'm seasonally unemployed in the winter and only employed in the summer. We give them
992.0,996.0, a capital when they can get the money from selling the land and retrain themselves and
996.0,1000.0," enter industries. When they can set up small businesses for themselves. When they can,"
1000.0,1005.0," for the first time, break this cycle of poverty that Team Bangladesh repaints you with."
1005.0,1011.0," We think that you are buying into a policy whose harms land on the poorest, we are proud of you."
1016.0,1019.0, The Luthers claim that MNCs are the best of all people.
1019.0,1026.0," They have no incentive to not decentralize the people that live in Sweden, where they have all the incentives to recruit them."
1026.0,1033.0, We've told you that many of the people whose land you cannot own are going to be people who are the most poorest of them.
1033.0,1036.0, Are going to be people like tribal people that live in suburbian areas.
1036.0,1040.0," In the Basmati case, these are the lands that you own, these are the lands that you buy up."
1040.0,1050.2, And it's not like they have incentivized to cater to them in the past week of cases where these people have so much political capital that they cannot propose these sorts of decent franchises.
1050.2,1054.7, They claim that we are up against MNCs and foreign investment.
1054.7,1059.7," If that was really true, we wouldn't have given the model where we claim that we are ready to give them EPZs."
1059.7,1065.0," We are ready to give them certain, you know, lease-out land that we think is going to be beneficial for the people."
1065.0,1067.0, That is not the burden on our side of the house.
1067.0,1070.0, We've told you why the exclusivity of land is extremely special.
1070.0,1075.0," The fact that, one, it causes gentrification of the most vulnerable minorities."
1075.0,1080.0," People who don't have, who need this land, not just because they want some level of economy capital,"
1080.0,1082.0, but because it's often of religious and cultural value to them.
1082.0,1088.0," But secondly, the fact that the massive increment in lobbying power that comes with the ownership of this land."
1088.0,1094.0, Where you can control the government simply because you can own this land and control it to such a massive degree.
1094.0,1097.0, The government is tied to what you want from them.
1097.0,1100.0, That is the excuse that they never break down.
1100.0,1103.0," First of all, you know the horrible characterizations that they come up with."
1103.0,1107.1, That these are not over cultivated lands thativated poor lands that get owned.
1107.34,1109.2, Notice that this is an extremely narrowed down case.
1109.54,1113.4," One, it's because most of the land is one that's owned by the poor."
1113.54,1117.04, Which is why it's so easy to buy them out and it's so cheap to be given.
1117.3,1121.72, That's the reason why you often go for those lands that are owned by the poor and not owned by the rich.
1121.96,1126.5," But secondly, these are often lands that are owned by people that come from certain tribal minorities."
1126.5,1129.04, That's the reason why you can often buy them
1129.04,1132.22, with less money and have more political opposition.
1132.22,1133.5," Often in the past military cases,"
1133.5,1136.6, their interests are extremely best case scenarios.
1136.6,1137.96," But in the past military cases,"
1137.96,1139.6, these are often people that don't get
1139.6,1141.44, any form of benefit at all.
1141.44,1143.04," But secondly, they want to talk about how"
1143.04,1148.02, over-consumption of land cannot be used by these people. We think we have alternative ways to deal with these people
1148.02,1153.94," as well, where we can hoard that money that these corporations get, because in your"
1153.94,1157.16," sector, the money gets transferred to all those other countries that they come from."
1157.16,1161.08," We think in our sector, the money which is saved in the hands of this government, we"
1161.08,1167.04," can use public housing and those sorts of things, job centers, etc., in order to cater to those people as well."
1167.66,1168.34, Then they changed it.
1168.44,1171.92," The MNCs will increase employment, and that's an exclusive benefit on the SLA."
1172.28,1176.92, They never said why the employment will be in the hands of the people in these regions.
1177.26,1177.94, We told you why.
1178.06,1182.8," First of all, in the vast majority of cases, these are the foreigners that are being employed"
1182.8,1183.66, to begin with.
1183.8,1188.16, Because these are the most skilled people who often have more training and education
1188.16,1193.6," to deal with their particular job, to deal with their particular kind of business better than these local people."
1193.6,1200.8," But secondly, often the local people have skillsets that doesn't coincide with the businesses that come in."
1200.8,1205.0," In the vast majority of cases, even training them up is a lot more costly"
1205.0,1210.0," than bringing in foreign contractors, foreign employees, etc."
1210.0,1215.0, I don't see why that incentive exists in the hands of these MNCs who often want to profiteer
1215.0,1217.0, from this land to begin with.
1217.0,1222.0," Lastly, MNCs will retain the most support because the Jandaras are just more powerful."
1222.0,1228.0," First of all, if that was the virtue, probably reason why these journalists would have ordered the land for themselves. You need to admit that to some degree these MNCs"
1228.0,1234.0," have more control, have more power than these artists. But the problem is this. They never"
1234.0,1239.0, tackle it. That lobbying power doesn't disappear on your side of the house. We need to control
1239.0,1243.0, land and the way in which it gets operated because there is no government regulation.
1243.0,1247.0, Where you can control who gets employed because there is no government regulation as well.
1247.0,1253.0, We think the amount of capital that you own and hoard from this land is enough to give you enough
1253.0,1258.0, looming power to ensure that the government listens to you and not ensure other terms of employment
1258.0,1262.0," get imposed upon you. On our side of the house, the exclusive benefit is this."
1262.0,1267.0, The impetus is where more companies are constrained in a particular region.
1267.0,1272.0, So that's the natural state of companies are not sparsely located in every single area of the country.
1272.0,1276.0," So it's easier to regulate how they operate, how they carry out their operations."
1276.0,1282.0," But secondly, in Goa, this region has a single monopoly. That is to say, in a particular village there is one corporation."
1282.0,1285.0, In another village there is another corporation that owns land.
1285.0,1288.0, The problem with that is that there is a monopoly that controls those regions.
1288.0,1293.0, It's hard to regulate those particular regions because all of those regions have just one monopoly.
1293.0,1298.0," In our world, these e-businesses are regions that have several companies existing together."
1298.0,1304.0," We just say if one corporation leaves, there is often another corporation that takes up that job to begin with."
1304.0,1309.0," We just say the extreme lobbying power for one particular corporation to dictate the terms of employment,"
1309.0,1313.0, to dictate how the operations happen is massively reduced.
1313.0,1317.0," If you are issuing consents for not purchasing a plant,"
1317.0,1321.0, why do you not support a completely controlled command economy over land?
1321.0,1347.0, We are not saying that we are supporting a command economy in the first place. economy over there.
1347.0,1356.0," In the process, you take away land from many minorities like tribal people. They are unlikely to get anything in return because one, they have less political capital."
1356.0,1361.0," So it's like, you know, they're incapable to get certain level of references from those governments, but not the technical."
1361.0,1367.0," But secondly, they are so economically unproductive to the extent that the government doesn't feel forced to listen to them."
1367.0,1377.0," The harms of that is twofold. First, they don't only get employed because they are often uneducated to the extent that the government's educational resources never went to them."
1377.0,1389.0," But secondly, they lose land that is of cultural and religious value to them. The one that is tangled up with identity and with no form of employment can benefit, can cover up for that."
1389.0,1398.0, First part of our limitation. We tell you why it's immoral to allow these developed countries to benefit off of the land they have prominently and previously had.
1398.0,1405.0, Developing countries' land have been threatened by other countries at various points in time in terms of ownership and the usage of the land.
1405.0,1412.0, This land has historically disenfranchised the people living in those areas. The impacts of it still carry on today.
1412.0,1420.0," Therefore, we have a moral obligation to ensure that the land remains in the hands of the people and not get owned and used even further by those very developed countries."
1420.0,1428.0," How have the land and its people been threatened? One, the intuitive reason, the fact that at various points in time, developing countries have confronted the fear of"
1428.0,1435.0, colonization by historically rich and powerful countries. Notice that the most number of people that have come and owned this land in order to
1435.0,1445.0," have the health are from those very developed countries that have been driven by them. The forceful annexation that countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India have faced. The fact that these people and inhabitants"
1445.0,1449.0, have been forced to confront forced migration. These people's agriculture and financial
1449.0,1455.0, resources were under and were given no reparations. Even in several countries they are still not
1455.0,1459.0, economically alleviated. We tell you that we have a moral obligation not to despair
1459.0,1464.0," of reparations but even if that is not possible, we think it is profoundly moral to allow these"
1464.0,1466.8, countries to benefit off of the land even further.
1466.8,1473.9," Given that those historical cloners have not only hurt those minorities, but the fact that you've got the cloner of those agricultural resources"
1473.9,1479.0, means these developing countries that still depend on these agricultural resources are still damaged.
1479.0,1485.5, It is like handing over a resource that a particular thief has stolen and allowing him to use it even further.
1485.5,1490.5, We think that's an important comparison that you need to admit. Even if some level of employment
1490.5,1494.5," is handed over to these people, it can never cover up for those levels of economic and"
1494.5,1499.0, political hijacking that you have done in the past. But at the time that most of these
1499.0,1503.5, local people will never be employed and these companies will never be forced to listen to
1503.5,1506.0," these governments, we are daring to listen to their settlements. We are daring to power food courts."
1510.0,1513.0, And they dropped our second argument on food security.
1513.0,1516.0, Here's why that devastates decades.
1516.0,1521.0," Structurally, these bunched countries right now have rituals without access to food at"
1521.0,1525.62," the table, have structurally massive rates of malnutrition, of disease caused by a lack of access to food on the table, has structurally massive rates of malnutrition, of disease"
1525.62,1532.04, caused by a lack of access to food. Food insecurity perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty where
1532.04,1537.72, children are literally unable to put food on the table. We save lives by expanding access
1537.72,1543.08, to food security for the most vulnerable in these countries. It was damning to that case
1543.08,1550.0, to not respond to this argument. We cannot buy into a policy whose harms lack on the product.
1550.0,1556.0," Two points were clutched. Firstly, whether this policy is just, and secondly, the effects it has on structurally disadvantaged nations."
1556.0,1566.0," Firstly, whether this policy is just. That sentence paper gave us a principled argument about how developing countries face colonization and fossilization historically"
1566.0,1570.0, and it's unjust death for foreign investors to benefit out of this land.
1570.0,1573.0," Two responses. One, there's an important distinction here."
1573.0,1578.0, And that important distinction is that foreign investors are now paying to get this land.
1578.0,1581.0, And are employing people to buy this land.
1581.0,1586.0, We think the best mechanism for them to pay reparations right now is to give these individuals
1586.0,1589.0," employment, to give these countries significant economic benefit."
1589.0,1591.0, That is something you don't get.
1591.0,1592.0, You want reparation?
1592.0,1597.0, The best way is to give jobs to those who have historically denied this beautiful organism.
1597.0,1601.0," And secondly, it's interesting the fact that the best mechanism of getting reparations"
1601.0,1605.0, for them was to restrict the rights of individuals in these nations
1605.0,1610.0, to sell their land. We told you in our speech that this policy is unjust as a market principle
1610.0,1615.0, because you have a right to sell your property. Because an extension of the right to have
1615.0,1619.0," property is the right to not have property, the right to get money or waste from that property."
1619.0,1632.0," And crucially, isn't the alternative to these foreign investors is local landowners, locals and mid-dust, people from ethnic majorities who come with a power asymmetry in terms of culture in these developing nations."
1632.0,1638.0," They told us, they conceded, that a lot of this land is owned by low-income people, by minorities, by indigenous communities."
1638.0,1647.0," Who is more likely to be exploited? A foreign investor or someone in these countries who is literally from the ethnic majority that oppressed these minorities historically,"
1647.0,1653.0, who is likely to coerce these individuals into contracts with far higher degrees of structural harm.
1653.0,1657.0, There is an asymmetry of power created by this gap in ethnicity.
1657.0,1659.0, Foreign investors offer another option.
1659.0,1663.0, They offer an option for you to sell your land without being exploited.
1663.0,1665.0, You have a right to sell your land.
1665.0,1667.0, That is something they fundamentally need to cover.
1667.0,1670.0, Second issue is the effects of structurally dysfunctional things.
1670.0,1672.0, Two big ideas that came from that.
1672.0,1673.0," First, your factory."
1673.0,1676.0, This hinders the ability of these factories to develop.
1676.0,1677.0, Three things here.
1677.0,1681.0," One, they conceded to us in their first speech that one of the crucial goals of developing"
1681.0,1684.0, countries is the ability to gain foreign investment.
1684.0,1685.0, It's interesting
1685.0,1690.0," then why they were okay with it, but to systematically restrict the amount of foreign investment"
1690.0,1695.0, which comes in. Why? Because rent isn't enough for foreign companies because constant
1695.0,1699.0, payment of rent adds up to much more amounts than the amount of money they need to invest
1699.0,1704.0, in land right now. These companies want to own land and they want to own land on their
1704.0,1705.0," own terms, right?"
1705.0,1708.0, Because often particular regions are better for efficient production.
1708.0,1715.0," What this means on their side of the house, North Bank, is that these companies are facing massive regulations on where they are allowed to set up."
1715.0,1720.0, Forced into tremendous competition where they literally can't survive in concentrated villages.
1720.0,1724.0," What this means is that on their side, these companies don't come in at all."
1724.0,1725.1, This is devastating.
1725.38,1727.62, Because it means people lose access to cheap goods.
1727.88,1728.4," No, thank you."
1728.52,1731.26," People lose access to infrastructure, access to employment."
1731.56,1732.34, There are two aspects.
1732.8,1736.28," One is that, why don't these companies employ people in these regions?"
1736.56,1737.2, Very simple.
1737.42,1739.7, Because it's much easier to employ people in these regions
1739.7,1742.54, than hope that people in the United States as an investor
1742.54,1746.7, might get along with you to be employed in a country with significantly lower wages.
1746.96,1748.12, They say this would create a monopoly.
1748.28,1751.14, That's why we have regulations like antitrust laws in our country.
1751.32,1755.42," Ultimately, a lot of these arguments are arguments against foreign investment in general."
1755.74,1757.96, Why were they okay with foreign investment in their first place?
1757.96,1762.52, Why did they say that developing countries should see foreign investment as a crucial role?
1762.76,1768.18," Second, they say sporadic, random debt limits hurt the ability of governments to allocate resources."
1768.6,1769.14, Here's the thing.
1769.4,1771.58, Different regions are productive in different areas.
1771.78,1775.66, We think companies should have the ability to choose which areas are the most productive
1775.66,1778.04, for them to develop their goods and sell their goods.
1778.3,1779.94," Lastly, talk about lobbying power."
1780.2,1783.62, We're happy to restrict the ability of foreign investors to lobby governments.
1783.62,1786.8, Those are regulations which already exist in this tax code.
1786.8,1790.8," But notice that all of these problems also exist with local investors, right?"
1790.8,1792.8, Wealthy individuals in these local areas.
1792.8,1796.4," Which is why we asked them, are you okay with communising the ownership of land?"
1796.4,1801.2," They said no, because they recognise the significant economic benefits that exist,"
1801.2,1803.2," so thank you, you know, world in this language."
1803.2,1806.0," Lastly, the second argument on facilitating gentrification."
1806.0,1811.0, Why? The alternative is that these investors are forced to rely on rented out land.
1811.0,1814.0, Notice that lower-income people also rely on rented out land.
1814.0,1818.0," Now you create a market of wealthy individuals who are asking for rent,"
1818.0,1821.0, meaning rent prices go significantly up.
1821.0,1826.0," On our side of the house, in contrast where these individuals are able to develop communities."
1826.0,1832.0," Because they don't rent out a family, which means communities can still afford to live in these areas, but now they also develop these communities."
1832.0,1837.0," They do things like build infrastructure, which is essential for them to actually survive in these regions."
1837.0,1845.0," No, frankly, in contrast to what we've got here, the benefits of individual ownership, the fact that food security can give you three structural problems."
1845.0,1850.0," Fragmented land, over-corrugated land, traditional unscientific practices."
1850.0,1858.0," On our side of the house, we don't want to go the path of Zimbabwe, where food security was systematically undermined by the policies of land reform."
1858.0,1866.0," We've found a world where the structural problem of food security is addressed, with the point where they dropped this argument, they dropped the largest impact in this debate."
1866.0,1868.0," Moving on then, my second question."
1868.0,1871.0, Why reasonable amounts of speculation are beneficial for development?
1871.0,1872.0," Before that, yes."
1872.0,1876.0," Given that selling land also means displacement and unemployment,"
1876.0,1883.0," understated things from our case, show us self-fulfilling incentive for these people to utilize their right to sell their land."
1883.0,1884.0, Two responses.
1884.0,1886.6," First, there is more displacement on your side."
1886.72,1890.68, There is rent prices increasing directly rather than property prices increasing.
1890.98,1894.3," Secondly, the perverse incentives of these people is to make profit."
1894.56,1898.62," The way to make profit is to set up businesses, lower prices of goods and give people access"
1898.62,1901.38," to food security, create jobs in these regions."
1901.8,1903.8, Why are reasonable amounts of speculation going to show?
1904.28,1905.76," The problem is, as a structurally disadvantaged nation, fluctuations in the regions. Why are reasonable amounts of speculation beneficial? The problem is, as a structurally"
1905.76,1912.56," disadvantaged nation, fluctuations in the cost of land are damaging. In times of recession, land prices drop."
1912.56,1917.68, This means lower middle class individuals who spend their savings on land investing and the rising middle class
1917.68,1922.72, who often starts off with an investment in land lose their investments. They systematically lose
1922.72,1925.48, their money because disproportionately it hurts them.
1925.48,1927.7," But in terms of inflation, in terms of growth,"
1927.7,1929.02, land prices increase.
1929.02,1932.08," What that also means is that the rate of prices skyrocket,"
1932.08,1934.06, displacing low-income individuals
1934.06,1936.42, and creating all the forms of gentrification
1936.42,1938.14, that they wanted to talk about.
1938.14,1941.38," But that, obviously, uniquely worsens this fluctuation"
1941.38,1943.9, when they virtually eliminate speculators
1943.9,1944.76," from these functions,"
1944.76,1949.92," as in people who buy that, expecting price changes, to hope to sell this land at a higher price."
1949.92,1954.32," Why? Because local investors don't have the kind of capital to engage in speculation,"
1954.32,1958.8," and have a culture of financial conservatism in which they don't make risky investments,"
1958.8,1962.24, which means speculation is far more valuable to come in through foreign investment.
1962.24,1964.88, Why does speculation smooth out these fluctuations?
1964.88,1970.0, Case 1. Let's say land prices are increased. They are more willing to buy land at lower
1970.0,1974.0, prices because they expect that the price will drop. They often don't speculate on this
1974.0,1978.0, land at all and when there is a culture of land owners relying on speculators buying
1978.0,1982.0," their land, they are likely to force the land prices to go down and stay the land."
1982.0,1985.0," But second, contrastively, they buy more land"
1985.0,1989.0, and speculate more if prices are unnaturally low because they expect these prices to increase.
1989.0,1994.0," This means prices of land are significantly smoothened down, meaning we are able to balance"
1994.0,1998.0, the benefits to the most vulnerable individuals. Those who invested in land and spent all their
1998.0,2003.0, life savings on land and those who want a house and want to get rent. On our side of
2003.0,2005.44," the house, we protect the individual from a systemic"
2005.44,2007.92, conflict of interest. We cannot buy into
2007.92,2009.86, a policy that harms that one.
2013.3,2014.82," Nebel, if regulations"
2014.82,2016.88," fixed everything, the problems"
2016.88,2018.2, that we're discussing right now
2018.2,2020.18, wouldn't have existed. Which means that
2020.18,2022.08, they have to understand that
2022.08,2024.32, regulations have a certain
2024.32,2025.3," amount of problems, right?"
2025.7,2029.34," One, the application of regulations in the Basque and Georgia cases is very subjective"
2029.34,2032.34, as to whether or not people want these sorts of regulations to begin with.
2032.4,2038.52," What we are doing is discussing a specific regulation in and of itself, claiming as to"
2038.52,2041.08, whether or not you should stop voting for that.
2041.28,2043.14, But two things I'll be discussing in my speech.
2043.24,2048.66," First, who gives rights to poor? Second, under which world do we give more autonomy to government"
2048.66,2054.34," and subsequently development? Before which, a few things to point out. The extent of rebuttal"
2054.34,2058.92, that they had to this entire month's principle of why you shouldn't give foreigners who
2058.92,2065.94," plundered with your, you know, countries like land, etc., rights, was give their employment guides"
2065.94,2067.48, that is the best form of reparation.
2067.74,2068.02," One,"
2069.2,2072.14, they essentially made you
2072.14,2074.02, the developing
2074.02,2075.5, country that you are in the sense that
2075.5,2077.96, they took away resources from your
2077.96,2079.98," workforce, creating these sorts of issues to begin"
2079.98,2081.9," with, right? So if you give employment guides"
2081.9,2083.78," now, it's not reparations because they're not giving"
2083.78,2086.72, something back. They're just trying to make amends to it at best.
2087.0,2089.1, We don't think there is a German that's a sufficient response.
2089.36,2093.7," But more importantly, this argument's importance was on the basis of morality, right?"
2093.9,2098.74, Which means that is it really all right to give people who have plundered with their identity before
2098.74,2105.44," the right to give them back the right to capitalize on that loophole that they created themselves, right?"
2105.58,2106.54, No response there.
2106.76,2109.22," So let's move on to the second speaker argument,"
2109.58,2113.16," this weird argument about speculation and why people, you know,"
2113.34,2116.02, under their world can speculate better than under our world.
2116.14,2118.42," One, speculation isn't an exclusive benefit,"
2118.42,2123.5, which means that analytical articles about whether or not land prices increase exist under our world as well.
2123.72,2127.52, So developing nations do have access to these sorts of things. So we think that speculation
2127.52,2133.12," can be an essential benefit under our own. But secondly, why is speculation linked to"
2133.12,2138.72," land ownership? People speculating is not exclusive to them owning land, but rather"
2138.72,2143.8," them analyzing the benefit of or like the price ranges of it to begin with. And again,"
2144.18,2145.44, they forget domestic
2145.44,2150.68," owners get owned land as well. So they can speculate on a large scale. But secondly,"
2150.86,2154.38," and much more importantly, rights to poor people. Three things that they said here."
2154.48,2161.24," One, the rights to property. Note three responses here. First, it's not absolute. Which means"
2161.24,2165.96, given that they themselves claim that regulations as to how you can use
2165.96,2171.2," land exist means that your ownership of land isn't an absolute, so government can make"
2171.2,2175.64," adjustments to it. Secondly, we think that if you say that you have a right to sell,"
2176.08,2180.7," we think you do have a right to sell under our world, the regulation or the limit being"
2180.7,2186.6," you can sell it to foreigners, right? Given that principle, their principle is contingent upon believing on regulations,"
2186.6,2190.84, we think this can be an additional regulation without harming the rights to property.
2191.24,2193.44," Lastly, and this is very, very weird,"
2193.86,2197.6, note that they say that the alternative is Jamindars
2197.6,2201.86," and why they're, you know, like, very oppressive to the poor people, right?"
2202.52,2206.8," Note that, first, they agree that corporations"
2206.8,2207.98, are much more powerful.
2208.4,2209.94, So if jambalas are less powerful
2209.94,2210.72," than corporations,"
2211.66,2212.9, why won't corporations
2212.9,2214.44, dictate the terms of the poor people?
2214.8,2216.02, Because clearly they have
2216.02,2216.72, the upper hand.
2216.98,2217.68, We have given you
2217.68,2218.72, incentive structures
2218.72,2220.28, as to why the rights
2220.28,2221.16, of these poor people
2221.16,2222.96," aren't in these corporations' minds,"
2223.06,2229.8," but rather their own needs and wants. So we don't look quite at worst. But secondly, there can be two instances"
2229.8,2236.22," in this case. One, that the corporation colludes with those Jamindars, which happens in a lot"
2236.22,2241.1," of cases to gain easier access to the population. Even under that law, poor people don't get"
2241.1,2245.1," rights. Or, if the Jamindar is against that foreign corporation"
2245.1,2250.7," existing, means that they won't essentially let them in. Either way, the problem regarding"
2250.7,2255.42," Jamindars, they aren't solving in and of themselves, right? So we don't think that's a benefit"
2255.42,2261.08," under their law. Secondly, they talk about food stamps. Guys, okay, number one. Note"
2261.08,2265.44," that I don't know how that's incredibly relevant in this debate. The reason being,"
2272.0,2272.72," if you want to make yields out of plants better, note that in agriculture-based countries,"
2278.12,2282.08," universities and students, etc., alike, do research as to why and how you can utilize smaller amounts of plants to begin with. So if you want to be a part of that progression"
2282.08,2285.14," as a foreigner, you can invest in these sorts of researchers,"
2289.62,2289.86," or invest on local companies who are doing this, become a minority shareholder,"
2291.9,2292.04, and you will gain access to the market regardless.
2295.48,2298.06," So I don't know why that is exclusively better under theirs. But secondly, and this is also quite crucial,"
2298.74,2303.62, they are the ones who take away agricultural land from poor farmers and give it to corporations.
2304.04,2305.44," Under our world, corporations"
2305.44,2311.52," can't beat out these farmers in the level of prices and in access, so we don't think"
2311.52,2316.88," they give rights to poor in that case. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, is the comparative."
2317.28,2322.72, And this is the most important part here. Because the extent to which they respond to
2322.72,2326.26, our gentrification argument is this. Domestic people
2326.26,2328.22, gentrify as well. Note
2328.22,2329.72, that you are increasingly
2329.72,2331.96, extent by tenfold that this
2331.96,2334.06, so the effect of gentrification is substantially
2334.06,2335.76," more under your world. But secondly,"
2336.1,2338.14, and the second speaker comes up and tells us
2338.14,2340.12, why rent apparently increases under
2340.12,2342.12, our world. Note that
2342.12,2344.12, when it is under government's hands
2344.12,2347.0," which EPZs they lease out,"
2347.0,2351.0," which means government has the set control of these prices, right? So it doesn't trickle"
2351.0,2356.0," down to the rest of the economy. It is under your rule, when it's a free bidding process"
2356.0,2360.0," to everyone, there is more rent rights, right? So we don't think that applies. But the reason"
2360.0,2368.66," why this gentrification argument is so crucial is even if the Gov accepts the fact that there's probably more marginally more employment,"
2368.94,2373.88," because they never told you why, that the market gaps are not filled up by local companies, right?"
2373.88,2389.18," Because I pretty sure think that in a world where foreign corporations don't exist as much, these gaps are filled up by local companies, why their ideas of gentrification, that their cost of gentrification is substantially"
2389.18,2395.1," more beneficial than any other forms of effects that we show in terms of minorities, right?"
2395.32,2400.22, Where we essentially told you that these are people who already have very little political
2400.22,2400.72, capital.
2401.24,2410.0," When you give them, when you give the government an incentive to gain access to these sorts of corporations, these people can't fight back."
2410.0,2420.0," Under our world, in the case of local companies, the ability for these poor people to fight back or at least voice out the fact that they don't want to give up the land is substantially more."
2420.0,2425.06," So we think on a comparative, we give poor people an easier level to find back."
2428.42,2428.66, We stop gentrification to the extent in which they increase it.
2430.0,2430.46, Before I move on to the last question. Sure.
2430.7,2434.14, What's the median size of the bank owned by the average farmer in Bangladesh?
2435.0,2437.66, I'm not a religious immigrant. I'm not a halmanak.
2437.92,2442.68," Second, let's talk about why government's ability to control development is important."
2443.04,2446.0," Because this is a part that they really never refuted, right?"
2446.0,2451.0, Because we told you that governments essentially have a roadmap as to what sort of development
2451.0,2452.0, that they essentially want.
2452.0,2457.0," In a free market, when foreigners can own land, what happens is they can come by and"
2457.0,2459.0, start moving out land.
2459.0,2462.0, We think that this is problematic for a number of reasons.
2462.0,2466.12, Because land ownership means that you have such an amount of power
2466.12,2468.04," over the government, which means that you control"
2468.04,2470.06, these sorts of areas. As a huge corporation
2470.06,2471.58," who owns 10 kilometers of land,"
2472.0,2473.34," all the other areas,"
2473.6,2475.82, small businesses around it depend upon you.
2476.08,2477.96, A lot of people are employed by you.
2478.34,2479.98, Which means that the ability
2479.98,2482.02, to dictate the terms of your
2482.02,2484.34, government relationship is substantially
2484.34,2486.1, more. So in a world where there's
2486.1,2488.22," a conflict of interest, only"
2488.22,2489.7, under their world
2489.7,2492.18, do corporations have a bigger
2492.18,2494.06, say over the government's
2494.06,2496.0, economic plan. Whereas in a world
2496.0,2498.08," where there are no hard owners, this"
2498.08,2500.08, imbalance of power substantially
2500.08,2502.08," decreases. Because note, they don't"
2502.08,2503.94," own land, they are under government"
2503.94,2507.0," leased land, which means government is dictating the terms."
2507.0,2517.0," In a world where all communities have plundered the liquid lands before, we don't think you should give them the right to do it again. We beg to propose."
2523.0,2528.0, It's clear to us at this point that side proposition just has a problem with private investors.
2528.0,2535.0," I mean nearly any of the reasons that they gave, gentrification, how having money and being able to lobby and having land exists,"
2535.0,2543.0," how you can displace people, literally every single one of those exists to people who are within the country who have private investment capabilities as well."
2543.0,2548.0," They realised this in their first speech and they said, yes that's true, but foreign investors are also private"
2548.0,2552.0," investors and that makes it worse. Here's the thing, panel, in no way is the entire"
2552.0,2557.0, case unique to this motion. All they've stood for in this entire debate is we don't like
2557.0,2561.0," people who have power, we don't like private property and we don't like you being able"
2561.0,2565.0, to buy land. That was the problem with the entirety of their case.
2565.0,2567.0, Three questions to ask in this debate.
2567.0,2570.0," Firstly, which side is effective in the decisions of the vulnerable?"
2570.0,2573.0," Secondly, which side was better for developing nations?"
2573.0,2577.0," And thirdly, which side better has the stability and growth of developing nations in this country?"
2577.0,2581.0, Because we cannot buy into a policy which harms land on the poor.
2581.0,2583.0, On the right of you to sell your land.
2583.0,2588.24," Me and Miriam, both sides finally in their first speaker they said, you do have a right to sell your land."
2588.24,2592.32," So let's ask a question, which side actually understood developing countries?"
2592.32,2598.08, Because they actually couldn't use general profit incentives of MNCs are more powerful than Jamindars.
2598.08,2600.48, That was literally the opposite of what we were saying.
2600.48,2612.0," We were saying, I'm sorry, you don't seem to understand the cultural context here. When for centuries and centuries, the Bipomian tribe in Nigeria has held power and managed control of all other tribes."
2612.0,2618.0," It's not about money, it's not about that, but rather the vast amount of coercive cultural influence that they have."
2618.0,2623.0," No response to this whatsoever. They come out and say that, oh, what if they collude with the private eminencies?"
2623.0,2628.56," Here's the thing, they're significantly less likely to collute with international MNCs and more likely to pollute"
2628.56,2632.7," with themselves. The fact is, on their side of the house, you have an oligopoly of a few"
2632.7,2636.78," people who have the power. However, on our side, you have competition coming in from"
2636.78,2641.52," private MNCs who can actually set the terms, who are not even claiming that MNCs are benevolent,"
2641.76,2649.32," but rather breaking up an oligopoly in itself, even if each individual is self-interested, means that prices go down for the poor on our side"
2649.32,2652.9, of the house. It means that you can sell your house at a higher price. These are things
2652.9,2656.74, that you enable the poor to do on our side of the house and they snuff that out.
2657.08,2661.24, Now on their argument for gentrification. We have an extremely strong and consistent
2661.24,2665.1," response. That is, the poor very often don't own houses,"
2669.26,2673.26, they rent houses. Why in the world's side proposition would you want to shift the wealth of the foreign investors into the renting market? Why would you want to cause even more
2673.26,2677.42, gentrification on your side when actually the way in which the poor stay in housing
2677.42,2681.78," is displaced on your side of the house? Not a lot of response, North panel, from their"
2681.78,2686.5, government. They did not contest with our characterization that the poor don't own it very often.
2686.5,2691.5, They didn't contest with our characterization that there's a side that jacks up lending prices.
2691.5,2695.5," If they wanted to talk about gentrification, they make it significantly worse."
2695.5,2699.5," On their side of the house, the poor are displaced in vast, vast amounts."
2699.5,2702.5," Lastly, on a principle that they want to stand by."
2702.5,2706.0, They said that countries were once colonized and so we shouldn't allow this to happen.
2706.0,2711.0," Here's the thing, panel. This debate is from the frame of reference of developing nations. What they should do."
2711.0,2717.0," What that means is, unless they're claiming India should never get into a trade deal with the UK because once they visited for a little too long,"
2717.0,2723.0, they're saying that developing nations and developed nations should never interact in mutually beneficial relationships.
2723.0,2725.0," We gave you a better principle in our first speech,"
2725.0,2727.0, that each country should decide for itself.
2727.0,2729.0," We told you, we're not going to labour down and say,"
2729.0,2732.0," no foreign investment is good, or all foreign investment is good."
2732.0,2735.0, But rather the limits to this should be set by individual countries.
2735.0,2740.0," We were the side that didn't pretend that Ghana, India, Nigeria and Sri Lanka were all the same."
2740.0,2743.0, They never refused to that characterisation on their side.
2743.0,2747.0, Which is why we best cared for the rights of the vulnerable and best respected their decisions.
2747.0,2751.0," Yes. If private entities are so bad, I'll ask you your own POA again."
2751.0,2754.0, Would you ban private entities from buying these important things?
2754.0,2759.0, Our entire case has been on how private entities actually really help the economy grow
2759.0,2761.0, and really help these individuals.
2761.0,2768.34," What we said in my introduction is you need to explain, please finally in your proposition reply, other than that one principle on net patients, what in"
2768.34,2773.18, your case was unique to multinational corporations and not just rich people within your country.
2773.34,2777.02," Please do that for me in your reply section. On the second question, which side helped"
2777.02,2781.78," the nations who needed it the most? On that front, they had a flippant response finally"
2781.78,2788.0," in their document with the biggest argument in this debate, that is university students do research or you can be a minority shareholder"
2788.0,2793.0," Firstly, university students aren't going around buying large pieces of land and putting them together"
2793.0,2799.0," And furthermore, we told you while we need one big person to conglomerate the land together, never responded to"
2799.0,2809.6, The largest problem is fragmentation of land battle when you have land pieces too small for you to build up an economy of scale and actually get food grains out. Being a minority shareholder in a piece of
2809.6,2814.08, far land the size of this room is not going to improve food security on their side of the house.
2814.08,2819.12," No response to this. This is battle. Make no mistake, the single most important argument in"
2819.12,2823.12, this debate because the people who starve the most are the indigenous communities they wanted
2823.12,2829.12," to talk about. The people who die in this world massively die because of poverty, disease, and starvation."
2829.44,2833.62," If we could bring the world closer to a world where we stop that harm, we would be happy."
2833.86,2838.22," They ignored the most important harm in this period. We also told you, panel, how capital"
2838.22,2842.16," comes in on our side of the house. How NNCs can train people, build jobs and infrastructure."
2842.52,2847.52," Not that they wanted to say they'll employ other white people on their side, but the moment my second speaker told you there is"
2847.52,2851.54," absolutely no reason to do that, they dropped the point of employment. What that meant is"
2851.54,2855.68," ours was uniquely the side that actually allowed economies to skin up, where they weren't stuck"
2855.68,2859.4," to an agrarian economy, where you can build a middle class and grow up and become a coder"
2859.4,2863.36, and become someone who's doing something more than just a farmland. That is how you make
2863.36,2867.0," economies grow up, and they remove that ability on their side."
2867.0,2871.0, Next on their argument is this message to the government saying we need a plan for hand-in-e-books.
2871.0,2875.0, Note let's point out that we didn't stand for a single strict model but we said for
2875.0,2878.0, different countries that have different types of regulations but rather we wouldn't like
2878.0,2883.0," them to cut out all foreign investment. But furthermore, no one will come into your SCCs"
2883.0,2885.0, when on their point they rely
2885.0,2890.0, on MNCs being perfectly happy with Nigeria having 100% control over where these companies
2890.0,2895.0," set up, who these companies set up and sell to and how these companies operate. They have"
2895.0,2900.0, total MNC flight when absolutely all control over the decisions of businesses on their
2900.0,2906.0," side are controlled by the government. Next, let's look at the SECs uniquely. Because, let's be clear about this panel,"
2906.0,2908.0, they set them up in horrible places.
2908.0,2910.0," They set them up in the cheapest of places,"
2910.0,2912.0, displacing most indigenous communities on their side.
2912.0,2914.0," Because unless they do that,"
2914.0,2916.0, the state is literally buying up the most expensive land
2916.0,2918.0, and renting it out to companies.
2918.0,2920.0, I would suggest that we put a dent in your healthcare budget.
2920.0,2922.0, What that means is their side
2922.0,2924.0, actually gentrifies the most.
2924.0,2928.0," The gentrifier now is the state, who, who surprise surprise isn't always that great to indigenous communities."
2928.0,2932.0, Their side is actually doing gentrification significantly worse.
2932.0,2936.0," The SDGs they stand for are in their best case weak, in their worst case horrible."
2936.0,2941.0," At the end of the day, let's just deal with the last part of owning land giving you political capital."
2941.0,2947.0, We actually think owning land within a country gives the government more control over you and helps regulations work more.
2947.0,2955.0," The reason for this is now you are tied to that area. You can't simply up and leave. What that means, Madhul, is that regulations are more effective on our side of the house rather than this."
2955.0,2959.0, Which means that we actually best control the investment and help these families.
2959.0,2962.0, But on to the third question. Which side of the net helps the long term growth?
2962.0,2966.0, We gave you a long argument on speculation and they don't understand what speculation is.
2966.0,2968.0, They said you can do research.
2968.0,2970.0," Here's the thing, this is the way speculation works."
2970.0,2975.0," If prices are too low, people physically buy the land and therefore stabilize the prices."
2975.0,2978.0, There is no response to this whatsoever throughout the entire case.
2978.0,2983.0, The impact of this panel is huge because it means in a recession I don't lose all the value in my house.
2983.0,2989.0, It means in an inflation my rent payments don't become more than my daily or yearly income.
2989.0,2991.0, That is a massive benefit on our side of the house.
2991.0,2995.0," When the poor people have to look at their housing prices and seeing fall into a rock bottom,"
2995.0,2997.0, they misunderstood what the word speculation meant.
2997.0,3001.0, What it actually means is financial investors keeping the price stable.
3001.0,3003.0," At the end of the day, three questions to ask."
3003.0,3008.0, Did they respect the choices of the vulnerable? Did they actually provide a good development for the countries?
3008.0,3012.0, And did they care about the most vulnerable who are starving on the streets? We say no.
3012.0,3016.0, We cannot buy into a policy whose harms never work.
3016.0,3022.0," My second speaker, Professor Satyajit, very clearly explains to you how food security"
3022.0,3025.0, is so crucial in development.
3025.0,3030.0," He describes the number of harms that come in the absence of food, not being able to afford it,"
3030.0,3037.0," the ceaseless cost by market issue. And to this, for the most part of the case, we heard deafening silence."
3037.0,3049.2," Third proposition also, which is one of the nuance of the argument, that you need to amass land and create a necessary scale of production which you can't do in the absence of foreign investors. In the lack of that,"
3049.32,3054.62, in the lack of responding to that nuance is what Bangladesh loses. We cannot buy into
3054.62,3061.32," a policy which harms land for the poor. Two things there is. First, on the idea of developing"
3061.32,3065.6," nations and what's best for them. And second, as to whether this is justified."
3065.6,3070.2," First, what's best for developing nations? What kind of investment is this debate about?"
3070.2,3075.0," Because, firstly, do they actually describe how any of their case is relevant to lack?"
3075.0,3077.9, Nor do they describe how it's relevant to individual audience.
3077.9,3082.7," By thought of position, it just became rich people are bad people."
3082.7,3085.36," As an individual, as a friend between my mother, I try to not"
3085.36,3089.7, be like that. But what they fail to realize is that there is a massive amount of benefit
3089.7,3095.16, that comes from multinational corporate capital. When we look back to the kinds of 19th centuries
3095.16,3099.22," and 20th centuries that existed in the developing world, we say that's a scary world. We don't"
3099.22,3104.0, want to go back to that. But what do they end up taking? They just said private capital
3104.0,3105.0," is bad, right?"
3105.0,3108.0, Because all of the harms were generalizable across private capital.
3108.0,3116.0," Because like my thought speaker points out, you want to point it out like they say they were pushing for a world where developed nations and developing nations shouldn't interact at all."
3116.0,3119.0," We told you, it might be true that they flunked at this, right?"
3119.0,3127.0," But it means that they have the capital which we so crucially need and we need the benefits of that capital, that's what they have."
3127.0,3130.0, But did they meet the burden that they took upon themselves?
3130.0,3135.0," They never show us what the alternative of this development is, how they actually megged off on this,"
3135.0,3141.0," because, notice, they were the proposition to this debate as opposed to just complaining about the questions."
3141.0,3145.98," But they just say, you know, we get benefits if brown people do this as well. But this was also"
3145.98,3148.12, a confusing response because for all
3148.12,3150.06," the harms of this debate, they said, if less"
3150.06,3152.02," people do it, it's better. For all the benefits,"
3152.1,3154.12," if less people do it, it was somehow still"
3154.12,3156.34," better, right? They realized how much"
3156.34,3157.82, the lack of capital existed
3157.82,3160.52, on their side of the bus. That's why they deprioritized
3160.52,3162.18, their own argument on foreign investment
3162.18,3164.06, across the bench and kept talking about
3164.06,3165.0, special economic source.
3165.0,3168.0, But we were so tired of wanting to respond to that as well.
3168.0,3171.0, We said you need the control over where you set up.
3171.0,3179.0," That kind of benefit comes from, for example, being able to buy a mass piece of uncultivated land and invest in building the nutrition for that land."
3179.0,3181.0, Deafening science students. They didn't need their own burden.
3181.0,3184.0," Especially a child, let's presume, they didn't actually take that burden."
3184.0,3188.0, What is the only argument there? An argument of gentrification.
3188.0,3191.0," An argument of gentrification has never moved past their first speech, right?"
3191.0,3198.0," Because when we told you that the reality of the developing world is that the vast majority of individuals are so reliant on rent,"
3198.0,3201.0, that you make it worse when people switch to renting on rent.
3201.0,3205.44," That we told you that gentrification in your best case continues to happen, but"
3205.44,3210.08," in your worst case happens in renting, which is far worse for these people. But ultimately"
3210.08,3213.44," they dropped a bunch of their car tax, they dropped the arguments on lobbying because"
3213.44,3217.36," they realized that regulation works. So then they ask, why does regulation work? But clearly"
3217.36,3221.12, we tell you across the bench that regulation works because private investors have monetary
3221.12,3225.0," interest in the nation, they've invested there so they need and can be done accordingly."
3225.0,3230.0," What was the RTS? Food security, cheap foods, people having the capital to retrain themselves,"
3230.0,3235.0, speculation making. They never really understood what speculation was because they said you can analyze trends.
3235.0,3240.0, That's not speculation. Speculation is having the risk profile to buy land at the time of recession
3240.0,3244.0, and save the middle class from losing their money. The finding of the idea of principle.
3244.0,3248.0, They say we benefit from the withholdopholes of the developing world.
3248.0,3253.0, This was ridiculously grown and so grown up. This is why the US and UK could never enter any data.
3253.0,3257.0, We shouldn't get aid from them because they are benefiting from our past oppression.
3257.0,3261.0, But they kept hitting us that corporations will dictate the terms and some class will still have power.
3261.0,3267.0, But we told you the unique incentive or the unique market for private investors is that they come as competition
3267.0,3274.0," is on the list. Is that they let you set your own terms. Ultimately we weren't patronizing to the poorest in the world. We said go ahead, make your choices."
3274.0,3278.0, We cannot buy into a policy whose harms lather the poorest.
3281.0,3291.0," There are clear strategies to win the power of finance by claiming. To literally dismiss most of our limitations, storm everything out of it and claim that they have defeated our case."
3291.0,3298.0," They gave you a few things. They never gave you a few things. First, they never gave you incentives behind the MNCs to cater to these people."
3298.0,3305.5, We told you why. They have incentives to exploit them and the fact that most of these people won't have any capacity to oppose them.
3305.5,3308.5, They never explain why private investors won't have
3308.5,3311.0, the incentive to buy this land and cater to those people.
3311.0,3314.54, What's the exclusive reason why farmers will come
3314.54,3316.56, and buy this land and cater to those people?
3316.56,3317.58, I don't really know.
3317.58,3319.76, They give you this really flimsy incentive
3319.76,3321.0, for a unique market.
3321.0,3323.68," If that really is so unique and so precious,"
3323.68,3326.0, I think those sort of FDIs will happen in our
3326.0,3331.0, state as well in the absence of an ownership of this land. I think those sorts of poisons which are catered to
3331.0,3336.0, those people will happen if that unique market doesn't exist. All the rebuttals have been constrained to why
3336.0,3342.0," these sorts of harms happen with private investors owning land as well. Sure, we have created some of these"
3342.0,3368.84," harms to overlap, which is the exact reason why when most of these harms overlap, such as gentrification, like, you know, little forced displacement of people, we also foreign owners, and the fact that foreign owners can lobby the government to an extent that they can, like the government"
3368.84,3370.9, and those people can do nothing about it.
3371.12,3373.4, That's the comparison that you needed to address.
3373.86,3378.32," The response to gentrification was that, one, renting prices will rise in our world as well,"
3378.54,3379.98, so these local people can't buy land.
3380.2,3382.24, They clearly don't understand how EPZs work.
3382.24,3383.22, The fact is this.
3383.44,3384.04, The fact is this.
3384.24,3386.96, Like EPZ regions don't necessarily work
3386.96,3388.1, in terms of bidding process.
3388.1,3390.08," The government finds and allocates the land,"
3390.08,3392.66," sets up a price for that, which often to a great degree"
3392.66,3395.16, is done in order to keep those people.
3395.16,3397.72," If government regulation is an incentive for your side,"
3397.72,3400.46, that incentive exists on our side of the house as well.
3400.46,3403.5," Secondly, they told you why speculation happens"
3403.5,3406.0, in some house that stabilizes the market.
3406.0,3411.0," If that is such an effective tool in order to stabilize the market, that happens on our side of the house as well."
3411.0,3415.0, When private investors go and buy land and try to get to those people.
3415.0,3421.0, I don't think it's something that seems like exclusive incentive for foreign investors to buy land and cater to those people.
3421.0,3427.0, They can think government is against FDI and we are apparently against interacting with developed countries.
3427.0,3430.0," If that was really true, we would have blocked trade, we would have blocked FDI to"
3430.0,3435.0, impregnate everything. That is clearly not the argument. We don't do any exclusivity of labor.
3435.0,3440.0, The exclusivity of land is such that we cannot allow these foreigners to own land and log it
3440.0,3446.9, and stay to the degree that they are doing right now. and the ability to exploit the people in those regions
3446.9,3449.28," get massively, massively increased on the other side"
3449.28,3450.12, of the house.
3450.12,3452.54, They merely claim that MNCs will cater to those people
3452.54,3453.54, with no incentive.
3453.54,3455.48, So the first one I wanted to show was that these people
3455.48,3457.16, can't buy food and they need money.
3457.16,3459.0," We told you why there is not enough,"
3459.0,3460.62," like this money is often not enough,"
3460.62,3462.66," because A, because this is cheap land,"
3462.66,3465.5," and B, this land is owned by minorities like child and etc."
3465.5,3467.5, So there is no incentive to give them enough money.
3467.5,3472.5," But the problem is there are narrow-gum cases where this is land that is over-cultivated,"
3472.5,3476.5, where the poor people need cash more than that land and everything.
3476.5,3481.5, If that was really true then probably your case is about how we should not find ourselves to own over-cultivated land
3481.5,3484.0, and not every land possible. That's a hard and narrow-gum case.
3484.0,3487.14, But then they tell you why their policy has an incentive
3487.14,3489.14, to give them food because it will give them food stamps.
3489.14,3491.12," One, I don't see why there's an incentive to do that"
3491.12,3493.7, after you've already bought the land and given them money.
3493.7,3495.52," But secondly, that incentive does exist"
3495.52,3498.04, within private investors who would also do that as well.
3498.04,3500.24, Because apparently that incentive is not dependent
3500.24,3501.5, on any context.
3501.5,3503.4, They told you why these poor people will get jobs.
3503.4,3507.0, They told you why employment is likely to be constrained to all those foreigners.
3507.0,3526.0," Because they are more likely to have skill sets that come inside with these corporations. They are more likely to train those foreigners because it's less costly and less expensive to train them rather than these minorities and these poor people who are often uneducated in the countries who didn't get the educational resources from the government. At the end of the day, they never tackled the important principle"
3526.0,3530.0, why ownership of land and usage of it is in and of itself immoral.
3530.0,3533.0," Even if you tell that oppression exists on both sides,"
3533.0,3540.0, we think this oppression that comes with the ownership of land and usage is in and of itself immoral.
