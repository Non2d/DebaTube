0.0,29.1," Rana Plaza yw ffatri sy'n cael ei gynnal ac yn cael ei gweithredu gan y gweithredwyr clodioio o'r Wester, Primark, yng Nghymru. Oherwydd nad oedd yn gallu gynnal cyfrifoedd o ran llywodraethau lleol,"
29.1,31.9, fe ddododd yn llwyddo'n llwyddo'n llwyddo'n llwyddo'n llwyddo'n llwyddo'n llwyddo.
31.9,34.1, Ond nid yw'r pwerau Primark wedi mynd i ffwrdd.
34.1,38.1, Oherwydd y llwybr ffyrdd economaidd sydd gennym ar gyfer llywodraethau gwladol gwledig
38.1,40.3," o ran gwledigion byd-eang,"
40.3,50.0," mae Primark yn dal i gweithio o'r cy, right now, huge swathes of the developing world are on the brink of being able to develop local infrastructure and industries"
50.0,54.0, in a way which is sustainable for the future and profitable for those countries.
54.0,60.0," But, local investors are being crowded out by giant foreign multinational corporations and individuals"
60.0,63.0," who don't care about the people or the future of those economies,"
63.0,68.66," but who rather only care about taking every last drop of oil out of that country, every last drop"
68.66,73.96," ounce of gold, leaving the countries destitute and unable to pull themselves out of poverty."
74.28,78.4," On Team England, we say you can't pull yourself out of poverty if you have nothing to grab"
78.4,83.34," onto, and foreign ownership of land yanks away the bottom rung of that ladder, preventing"
83.34,86.0," development. With that in mind, we'll bring you three points. One, why foreign investment ychwanegu'r rhan o'r ffordd sy'n golygu datblygu. Gyda hynny, byddwn yn dod â tri peth."
86.0,88.0, 1. Pwy sy'n golygu bod arian gwladol yn y cwmni.
88.0,91.0, 2. Sut y gallwn ni gael datblygu gwell mewn ffordd o gyfranogwyr lleol.
91.0,95.0, 3. Sut y gallwn ni gynyddu cymorth y busnesau yn y byd datblygu.
95.0,97.0, Beth yw ein cymryd yn y debat?
97.0,98.0, Dwy beth.
98.0,102.0, 1. Rydyn ni'n annog unigolion gwladol neu gweithredu sydd o leolion sydd ddim yn seiliedig ar leolion
102.0,106.0, o ddewis neu'n rhestru arian fel ffordd o ddyfodol 21st-oes.
106.0,113.0," Rydym yn dweud bod unigolion gwladol a phwysig yn achub ffynnau llawr o lland neu adnoddau cyhoeddus, fel ffermau o'r ffordd o ddŵr neu ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd,"
113.0,118.0," ac yna'n arwain busnesau lleol i'w defnyddio, neu'n gwneud yn rhaid i bobl lleol gweithio arnynt am pennau."
118.0,120.0, Ddwy. Beth yw ein model ar gyfer datblygu ar gyfer cyfrifion?
120.0,126.32," Rydym yn meddwl bod pobl lleol yn fwy na allu datblygu'r lland hwn, ac os nad ydynt, bydd yn well yn y llawr. We think the local people are more than capable of developing this land, and if they do, it's better in the long run."
126.5,130.56, My first point is about why foreign ownership is bad by comparison to locals.
130.86,134.36," First, because there is a race to the bottom among foreign owners."
134.48,144.28, Because the incentives of people who run these large corporations and foreign companies is to threaten the country itself to do things like lower regulations.
144.28,166.0, That's in terms of workers' rights and in terms of environmental rights. yn ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw ddweud wrth iddyn nhw d a chynllunio llai mewn gwledydd eraill os nad yw'r Llywodraethau yn cymryd eu gofynion.
166.0,171.0," Yn ail, oherwydd bod gweithwyr gwladol yn fwy tebyg ac yn gallu ddefnyddio'r gwledydd y maen nhw'n eu bodoli,"
171.0,175.0," mae'r cymdeithasau hyn, y cymeriadau hyn, ddim yn dweud yn ddiweddar y gwledydd y maen nhw'n eu buddsoddi."
175.0,180.0," Dydyn nhw ddim yn cael amddiffyn i, er enghraifft, cadw'r cynhyrch o adnoddau naturiol."
180.0,185.0," Rydym yn dweud wrthych chi, mae'r adnoddau naturiol yn rhai o'r asetau allweddol y mae'r wladau hyn."
185.0,193.0," Felly, ar gyfer cyfartal, byddwn yn gwybod ein bod yn gwella'r datblygiad yn ffordd sy'n gynhyrchol ac y bydd pobl sy'n lleol yn ei ffynnu."
193.0,199.0," Felly, pan oedd BHP Billiton yn adeiladu ei llinell yn Cadiamarca, yng Nghymru,"
199.0,202.0, fe wnaethon nhw ddefnyddio sylw i ddychryn y gwlion o'r roci.
202.0,206.0, Y rheswm iddyn nhw wneud hynny oedd oherwydd roedd yn fwy cyffredinol yn y cyfnod cyflawni.
206.0,208.36," Ond roedd y sain yn llyfru i ffyrdd llawr lleol,"
208.36,211.12," sy'n golygu bod y tŷ ar gyfer 300,000 o bobl"
211.12,214.64," ddim yn gallu mynd i gael arian yn ddwylo, yn ddwylo, yn ddwylo."
214.64,217.08, Dyna'r math o beth mae cwmni gwladol yn ei wneud
217.08,219.08, wrth eu bod yn gallu llwyddo llywodraethau
219.08,220.8," i gael iddyn nhw wneud hynny yn y cyntaf,"
220.8,223.92, a ddim yn golygu bod y lleolion yn y cymuned honno.
223.92,228.6," Yn ail, mae cwmni gwahanol yn datblygu llyfn mewn ffyrdd sy'n erbyn y cymdeithasau lleolwyr."
228.6,233.6," Un, oherwydd maen nhw'n tendu i gynnyrchu gweithgareddau, yn enwedig maen nhw'n cynnyrchu gweithgareddau"
233.6,236.6, o'u gwleidyddion rheolaidd o'u gwleidyddion lleol. Mae hynny'n golygu nad ydyn nhw'n cael
236.6,241.6, cymdeithas i fuddsoddi mewn sefydliad a chyfweliad ar gyfer unigolion lleol.
241.6,247.84," Yn ystod y gweithgareddau'r mwyaf, mae'n edrych fel cyfrifion Cymdeithasol yn gwasgu gweithwyr yn ystod y cyfnod i adeiladu rhai ar gyfer adeiladu"
247.84,251.52," rwydwaith, heb gweithio ar unigolion lleol hyd yn oed ychydig."
251.52,255.28," Yn olaf, maen nhw'n cymryd arian o'r economi, oherwydd y arian y mae'r cyfrifion hynny"
255.28,260.0," sy'n buddsoddi mewn arian yn cael ei adael gan yr economi, yn mynd yn ôl i'w"
260.0,262.64," cyfrifion eu hunain, yn mynd yn ôl i'w wladau eu hunain."
262.64,266.68," Yn olaf, oherwydd maen nhw'n datblygu adnoddau o ran eu hunain a phosib yn y"
266.68,270.64," ddiddordeb yn ymdrin, ynglyn â gallan gynnal rôd neu rôd, ond mae'r rôd neu rôd"
270.64,274.32, yn mynd yn unigol o'r min a'u gwn nhw i'r porc a'u gwn nhw ac
274.32,279.28, ddim yn helpu unigolion lleol. Felly gadewch i mi ofyn cwestiwn.
279.28,284.08," Os yw'n ddrwg iawn i'r wladau hyn gael ymdrinwyr fawr,"
284.08,286.5," ymdrinwyr fawr, pam maen nhw' gwnaethant eu gwneud hynny yn y cyntaf?"
286.5,287.4, Drwy rheswm.
287.4,292.0," Un, oherwydd mae cynnwys rhyngwladol o ran y angen i wneud cymdeithasau amdaniadol"
292.0,294.5, cael eu cyhoeddi gan yna agendad yn y dyfodol.
294.5,297.0, Mae hyn yn rhywbeth sy'n dweud ei bod yn llwyr.
297.0,302.0, Ac mae economïau gwladol yn byw i hyn oherwydd eu bod wedi gweld y gwaith mewn amlwg mewn cyfnodau isoleiddio
302.0,305.0," ond mewn gwirionedd, nid yw'n ddefnyddiol iddyn nhw yn y ddiwedd."
305.0,308.0," Rydyn ni'n gwerthu cymdeithasau fel China, sydd, drwy ddiogelu diwylliannau lleol,"
308.0,312.0," drwy ddiogelu adnoddau lleol, wedi gallu datblygu diwylliannau hir ymlaen, ac yn y gwirionedd,"
312.0,314.0, mae wedi gweithio yn fwy.
314.0,317.0," Ddwy, oherwydd mae'r cwmnïau hyn yn gweithio mewn cyfnod o ddysgu eu hunain."
317.0,325.92," Oherwydd nid yw'r rhai cymdeithasau gwahanol mawr sydd wedi cael eu gosod i mei i'ch economi, wedi dechrau prynu arian, maen nhw'n arwain prysau arian mewn ffordd sy'n prysu"
325.92,330.72," ymgyrchwyr lleol. Felly, nid oes dewis i'r cwmni, ond i ddyfynnu mwy o arian."
330.72,335.12," Yn olaf, oherwydd bod yna wladau'n cyd-dynnu â chymdeithasau datblygu eraill, oherwydd"
335.12,340.64," os yw gwlad arall yn defnyddio corff cymdeithasol i'w datblygu, gallai'n datblygu'n fwy"
340.64,347.1," ond yn llai ddiogel. Mae'r problem yw, mae'n llwyr y g gwaith y byddwch chi'n ei ddatblygu. Felly, wrth i un"
347.1,351.6," wlad yn y rhanbarth, er enghraifft, sy'n datblygu, ddefnyddio cyfraniadau amrywiol, ddefnyddio"
351.6,355.76," buddsoddiant gwahanol, mae hynny'n gwneud iddo fod yn hynod o haws i'w ddefnyddio mewn ystyr"
355.76,360.16," hir, sy'n gwneud i gyrru i gyrru arall i wneud hynny, na fyddant yn cael eu prifo, na fyddant yn cael eu"
360.16,368.24," llwyddo i'r marchnadaethau hynny, yn enwedig mewn pethau fel yr ol, for example, where other companies, by using multinational corporations, are able to lower prices in the short run,"
368.46,372.26, which means that the countries have no other choice but to turn to these kind of corporations.
372.7,376.98," Before I talk to you about how we encourage local industries and why that's so good, I'll take my own information."
376.98,382.12, Would your side of the house not allow an immigrant from South Sudan to own land in Sudan?
382.6,385.5," So, first, we think that there are lots of processes"
385.5,387.96," by which individuals who immigrate into a country,"
387.96,390.1," if they are genuinely invested in that country,"
390.1,391.32, can become citizens.
391.32,393.08, We're quite happy for those individuals
393.08,396.04, to exist in those countries and to function
396.04,397.56, as part of the economy of those countries.
397.56,399.46, But if they're genuinely invested in these countries
399.46,401.44," for the long run, those individuals"
401.44,402.94, are likely to become citizens.
402.94,404.64, That's a process we're happy with.
404.64,407.0, Let's talk about how we encourage local industries. y bydd y cyfeiriadau hynny'n ymddangos i fod yn systemau. Dyna'r broses rydyn ni'n hapus â. Gadewch i ni siarad am sut rydyn ni'n cymryd rhan o'r diwylliant lleol.
407.0,411.12," Un, rydyn ni'n dweud bod cost cyfleol yn rhaid i chi, ar y pwynt lle mae sefydliad"
411.12,414.8, gwahanol neu ffyrdd gwahanol yn gweithio mewn gwlad ac mae hynny'n
414.8,418.0," llwyddo cyfeiriadau. Mae hynny oherwydd eu bod yn gweithio i fynd i fynd â phrysiau llaw,"
418.0,421.0, oherwydd maen nhw'n cael mwy o arian na'r leolion yn gyfan.
421.0,428.86," Dyna pam nad yw'r lleolion yn gallu cwmio llaw neu gael adnoddau allweddol fel on the whole. That's why locals are no longer able to buy land, are no longer able to buy clean resources like oil fields, and at that point are unable to develop in a way that"
428.86,433.58," is good for locals. Two, because they literally remove resources which would allow for local"
433.58,439.28, industries. Because 80% of the Malaysian Borneo rainforest has been deforested at the point
439.28,443.56, when multinational companies have bought up that land and have deforested it. That means
443.56,446.52, there's literally no farming to be done in these areas
446.52,448.14, because the locals have been priced out.
448.36,451.88," Finally, because they're literally just able to out-compete locals by funding them better."
451.96,452.86, So why are locals better?
453.12,454.92," One, because locals are subject to law,"
455.0,458.46, because they can't bully countries by threatening to move to other countries
458.46,460.84, in a way that big multinational companies can.
461.1,463.44," Two, because they care about the country in the long term,"
463.5,467.3, because these are people who are actually invested in their country. It's not the shareholder of Exxon
467.3,471.22, Mobile sitting on their yacht in the Mediterranean texting orders about how many trees to leave
471.22,475.4," for us. No, it's locals who are invested in those communities, who genuinely care about"
475.4,478.5," the future of those countries, and who are much more likely to do things like corporate"
478.5,483.3," social responsibility, who are much more accountable to the locals. Finally, because they're on"
483.3,485.44," all levels employing local individuals, that means they have an incentive to do things yn fwy cyfrifol i'r cyrff lleol. Yn olaf, oherwydd maen nhw ar bob lefel yn gweithio ar unigolion lleol,"
485.44,490.48, mae hynny'n golygu bod ganddyn nhw amddiffyn i wneud pethau fel buddsoddiad ar unigolion lleol
490.48,495.36, fel y gallant fynd i fod yn rhan o'r sefydliadau materol yna. Oherwydd bod
495.36,506.0," cyrff lleol sy'n gweithio'n ddifrifol i'r datblygiad hir yma, ac oherwydd bod And because local industries must shut out and ultimately do it in a more sustainable and better way, I beg you to propose."
511.0,518.0," It was not enough for side proposition to come up here and pretend like this motion was exclusively about foreign companies,"
518.0,525.9, ignoring the fact that their side of the house would also ban an immigrant from Sudan from moving to South Sudan and being able
525.9,530.94," to own land there, and having to wait the decades that it takes to, quote-unquote, be"
530.94,536.0, dedicated enough to become a naturalized citizen of that country. It was not enough for them
536.0,540.86, to come up here and talk about Bangladeshi workers in factories in that country without
540.86,549.2, ignoring the fact that that worker chose to work in that factory because the alternative was subsistence agriculture that sometimes in the winter meant that their
549.2,554.32, families would starve. It was not enough for them to engage in a nuanced world that existed
554.32,559.06, in a vacuum. They lose this debate right from the first speech. Before I introduce some
559.06,562.82," rebuttal to side propositions material, in addition to our first couple of arguments,"
563.12,568.6," I'd just like to clarify a couple of things in this round. Yes, this debate does in fact include things"
568.6,573.24," like foreign commercial investment, which we will explain are in fact beneficial. But"
573.24,578.78," it also, the motion in this round is about allowing foreigners to own land in countries"
578.78,583.7, in which they are not citizens. That includes refugees and just regular migrants between
583.7,588.0, countries as well being able to do things like own houses and own small businesses.
588.0,590.0, They fail to engage on this ground as well.
590.0,598.0," But often, just as we can support things to limit harms of, say, ownership of domestic industries in these countries,"
598.0,609.44," we can also support things like safety standards and environmental regulations for foreign actors as well. And note that often these regulations come about when there is massive backlash to, yes, sometimes horrific"
609.44,614.84, incidents happening in factories owned by Primark and H&M. Such backlash has often actually
614.84,618.84, created movement to strengthen regulations and things like this. So we actually think
618.84,622.8," that regulations are in fact possible. We think that on our side of the house, we are"
622.8,629.2," actually better not only for migrants, but also for developing countries. We're incredibly proud to oppose. With that,"
629.4,633.36, let's introduce some responses to their first two substantive arguments in today's round.
633.62,638.22," First, that foreign investment harms individuals, and second, basically that local industries"
638.22,642.84," are better. These arguments are essentially two sides of the same coin, and we have a"
642.84,646.96," number of responses. First of all, we tell you that regulations, in fact, can solve."
647.06,651.14, That international backlash to massively problematic conditions can solve.
651.42,656.1," But second, this characterization that they tell you of small, boutique, local businesses"
656.1,659.34, owning massive mines in countries is just a little bit false.
659.34,664.36, It is likely that even if mines in industries like that are owned by the residents of that
664.36,669.36," country, it is probably going to be massively wealthy residents who can do things like buy a mine"
669.36,673.3, in a country. They're unlikely to be from the small village that is running that mine
673.3,677.6, and are likely to suffer from some of the same structural problems that they identify
677.6,681.86, with foreign investors on their side of the house. This was simply not unique and a very
681.86,688.26," misleading characterization. But third, even if there are some problems with foreign investment in terms of regulatory standards,"
688.56,691.06, we tell you that the comparative is worse.
691.44,694.36," There is actually quite a reason, and their assertion that, you know,"
694.5,698.04, the illiberal idea is that foreign investment is bad or a lie was a little bit assertive.
698.16,702.96," Because we tell you that the scale of foreign investment is just way, way, way larger"
702.96,705.44, than any possible scale of local investment
705.44,709.38, that can exist on our side of the house. The amount of industries that you can create and
709.38,714.04," jobs that you can create is just way, way larger on our side of the house. Why is this"
714.04,718.0," important? When the scale of investment is larger, the number of, say, factories and"
718.0,722.52," industries that you can create to lift people out of poverty and subsistence agriculture,"
722.64,725.0, which is the necessary comparative their side
725.0,730.0," has to defend, is much, much larger. And we absolutely think that this has to happen relatively"
730.0,735.0," soon, because the longer people are starving in, like, subsistence agriculture, the more"
735.0,739.0," they suffer. We're very proud towards those. With that, let's introduce our first argument"
739.0,744.0," that on principle, our borders were incredibly arbitrary. This is particularly true in developing"
744.0,748.52," countries, many of which have emerged from post-colonial societies. Their borders are particularly"
748.52,753.36, arbitrary because they're often drawn just randomly by external actors. Take the example
753.36,758.36," of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, where the former Prime Minister of our lovely opponents on"
758.36,763.2," the proposition, Winston Churchill, literally took a napkin and randomly drew the borders"
763.2,768.42," of the Middle East. It ignored ethnic lines and the true border to borders of what these countries should be,"
768.62,770.22, and were essentially effectively random.
770.62,774.02," Similar things happened with the partition of India, the partition of Africa,"
774.24,777.54," and this is true of much, if not most, of the developing world."
777.84,778.92, Why does this matter?
778.92,783.92, I don't think that individuals living in countries have an unlimited exclusive right to property
783.92,789.14," simply because you were born one mile east of the line that says this is where one country ends,"
789.3,793.82, this is where one country begins. This is particularly true with immigration between
793.82,798.72," nations in the global south, immigration between nations like Algeria and Libya, between nations"
798.72,803.46," like Sudan and South Sudan, where the distinctions, frankly, between these countries are entirely"
803.46,806.3, arbitrary. They have to defend this as well.
806.42,808.62, It is not enough for them just to talk about foreign investment.
809.08,811.86, But our second idea of this argument is about diasporas.
812.0,815.74," In an increasingly globalized world where there is much more immigration,"
815.92,821.38," either because of things like conflict or just because migrants from, say, India and South America and Japan"
821.38,824.2," want to move to other countries for more economic opportunities,"
824.54,828.0," they may become naturalized citizens of those other countries and technically be foreigners,"
828.0,834.0, but would not be able to move back to the country from which they are from and actually own land there.
834.0,836.0, We think this is an incredibly problematic.
836.0,842.0," With that, let's introduce our second argument about how we actually improve the economies of developing nations before that go."
842.0,846.76," Given that in controlling key national assets, foreign investors, by threatening to leave,"
846.76,849.48," can bully countries into giving no regulations,"
849.48,851.42, why are the working conditions for exactly
851.42,853.34, those migrant workers not worse on your side?
853.34,855.74, So we'll actually explain why working conditions
855.74,857.88, cannot get better without foreign investment
857.88,859.5," at the end of this next point,"
859.5,863.8," but we tell you even if lower labor standards exist,"
863.8,865.7, that is still better than the comparative.
865.92,870.52," It is not enough for you in your Western ivory tower to look at low labor standards and say,"
870.76,875.6," oh, that's so terrible, without acknowledging the fact that the alternative is worse."
875.92,879.12, We tell you that we incentivize investment on our side of the host.
879.38,882.38," Many developing nations, in the terms of the global economy,"
882.68,884.96, their comparative advantage in the economy is labor.
889.38,894.02," The cost of labor is necessarily lower. They maybe don't have, as Cypher Proposition points out, things like super high-skilled and educated workers or a massive technological"
894.02,898.88," advantage, which means that their main advantage is low labor cost. This means that foreign"
898.88,903.86, investors have an incentive to invest in these countries to essentially use that low-cost
903.86,909.12," labor and in turn also provide employment to workers in those countries. This happened in Vietnam,"
909.28,914.12," which prior to a lot of foreign investment by the West and by China, was largely agriculture-based"
914.12,919.4," and suffered from tons and tons of poverty. With the advent of this kind of investment,"
919.76,924.06," yes, maybe labor standards aren't up to Western snuff, but the fact of the matter is this"
924.06,926.0, lifted tons of people out of poverty.
926.0,934.0, Also take the example of India. The most impoverished regions in India are rural areas outside of cities without foreign bathrooms.
934.0,940.0," These are the poorest areas where in the winter, when your food doesn't grow, you literally have to watch your family starve."
940.0,955.06," One of the most successful aid programs and poverty alleviation programs in India is literally a program to transport people from rural areas to the city so that they can get jobs in foreign factories, which exist in much larger quantities on our side of the house."
955.4,964.16," Yes, workers do complain of crowded conditions and long hours, but return year after year after year because the alternative is watching their family starve."
964.16,968.66, Because the alternative is a father giving his dinner to his son knowing that it is not
968.66,973.66, enough. It is not enough for Team England to exclusively focus on low labor conditions
973.66,977.76, without and completely ignore the comparative. We give you a much more holistic
977.76,981.84, nuance story. But we also tell you at the point where people can do things like put
981.84,988.32," food on the table and not worry about fulfilling their basic needs, they can do things like invest in education and technology. There is room"
988.32,992.2," for them to gain a comparative advantage in these areas as well, which means they will"
992.2,996.7, probably need things like super low labor costs. We tell you that investment is a necessary
996.7,1001.32, prerequisite to improving labor standards and to improving the plight of developing
1001.32,1008.0, countries around the world so proud of the police.
1012.0,1018.0," The opposition case in this debate rests on the following plan. That without the investment of Western actors flooding in like angels and just dropping cash to local people,"
1018.0,1024.0," allowing them to use quote-unquote their low-cost labour skills, these people would be desperate."
1024.0,1026.0," We think this is a marginally offensive, massively overused characterisation eu sgiliau gwaith ar gyfer cymorth, byddai'r bobl hyn yn ddysgu. Rydyn ni'n meddwl bod hyn yn ddifrifol,"
1026.0,1028.0," yn charakteriseu'n llawer o amlwg,"
1028.0,1030.0," ac rydym yn gweld hyn yn ymweld yn ddibysgol,"
1030.0,1032.0, amser a amser eto.
1032.0,1034.0, Rydyn ni'n meddwl bod hi'n gorfod i ddiwedd.
1034.0,1036.0, Nid yw'n dda i'r gwyddon i ddweud
1036.0,1038.0," ei fod llawer o ffyrdd wedi datblygu,"
1038.0,1040.0," oherwydd ei fod wedi cael ei ddefnyddio gan ddiwylliant,"
1040.0,1042.0, mae'n rhaid i bobl yn y wlad hwn
1042.0,1044.0, ddim o ran gael cymorth.
1044.0,1052.24," Mae'n rhaid iddyn nhw ddim o randim o ddysg i ffynnu busnesau, yn angen i bobl ddim o sgiliau farchnadol i ddweud wrth y cyflwyniad cyfranogol, eu gwaith gwerth."
1052.24,1059.12," Twm pethau yn y sgwrs hwn. Yn gyntaf, cyfrifoldeb cymdeithasol y byddai cymdeithas yn cymryd cymorth ar y ddau ochr yma."
1059.12,1067.0," Ond cyn hynny, ddwy bethau. Un, ymatebau sy'n ddwy, dwy, d ddwy i'r argwitiaeth y mae Arthur yn ei gynnig i chi yn gyntaf ac yn mynd i'r cyfnod hwn."
1067.0,1070.0," A'r ail, ymatebion i'r ddwy adroddiadwyr y mae nhw'n ei ddweud."
1070.0,1071.0, Pwynt.
1071.0,1075.0," I'r gyntaf, dwi ddim yn diolch. Dwi'n meddwl y byddwn yn gallu mynd i'r cyfnod hwn o'r leol."
1075.0,1086.2, Dwi'n hoff i wybod bod nhw'n seilio'r ddweud y maen nhw'n cyynnyddau fel Rana Plaza yn digwydd oherwydd mae'n yn gwneud yn ddifrifio'r ddynion weddill.
1086.2,1087.2, Nid oes diolch.
1087.2,1091.28," Yn gyntaf, maen nhw'n cymryd yn agored yr holl ddarpariaethau ddiffygol y mae Arthur yn"
1091.28,1094.36," dod â nhw'n gyntaf am sut na fydd y swyddi hyn yn gwneud pobl allan o'r cyfoed,"
1094.36,1096.0, ond yn gwneud iddyn nhw'n gweithio'n dda.
1096.0,1099.44," Ond yn ail, ac yn bwysig, nid oeddent yn cyd-dweud unrhyw beth oedd yn ymwneud â'r"
1099.44,1106.0," cyflawn, ond y cyflawn 48 awr ar gyfer y cyfnod hwnnw o ddysgu ar gyfer y cymdeithas,"
1106.0,1111.0, ac mae hynny ddim yn gweithio. Y cwestiwn ail y byddwn ni'n ei gael i'r cyfarfod ar gyfer y cyfnod hwnnw
1111.0,1116.0," yw un sy'n dweud bod y cyfnod o ddysgu ar gyfer y cyfnod hwnnw yn mechnism. Rydyn ni wedi siarad amdano amdano,"
1116.0,1125.28," mae'n ychydig yn ddifrifol, ond rwy'n gofalu bod enghraifft o'r g ddau mwyaf o'u cymdeithasau, yn gweithio ar gyfer pobl gyda chyfrifoedd llai o fosg,"
1125.28,1132.8," wedi cyflawni 5% o gyfnodau i'r Apple. Mae'n ymdrin y mwyaf bwysigol o'r byd, mae'n cynnig miliynau a miliynau o"
1132.8,1137.36, cyfnodau i'r Apple. Nid ydym yn credu bod y mechnism hwn yn ddigon. Ac yn ymwneud â'r holl ddiffyg
1137.36,1146.0," o ymddiriedaeth i'r 6 munud o gynnalysiad, mae Arthur yn rhoi'r hyn sy'n ei ddweud wrthych chi am sut mae busnesau lleol yma yn eu cynnal ac am pam yw'r busnesau hynny'n mor bwysig."
1146.0,1150.4," Ymateb ail ydw, ond os oes gennym bobl lleol yn gael eu gael ar y busnesau hyn,"
1150.4,1154.4," maen nhw'n debygol o fod yn lleol byw, ac maen nhw'n debygol o fod yn cael yr un cyllid fel gweithwyr gwladol."
1154.4,1157.6," Yn gyntaf, gweldwch fod hyn yn argwylio'n hollol anoddol."
1157.6,1161.6," Ond yn ail, does dim cymysgedd am y cymhwyso'r arfer yr ydy Arthur yn ei ddod â chi."
1161.6,1167.0, Maen nhw'n dod i'w ddynnu o amser cyffredinol i'r debat. Mae'n ei ddweud yn benodol ac yn ysgrifennol oherwydd mae'r bobl hynny'n byw yno.
1167.0,1171.0, Felly maen nhw'n anfon eu plant i'r ysgolion. Oherwydd maen nhw'n cael mwy o bwysau fel swyddogion
1171.0,1177.0," sy'n gofalu am, er enghraifft, Uganda neu'r dde, maen nhw'n ddim yn hapus â'r ffwrdd o ddwylliant"
1177.0,1186.0," a'r ffwrdd o ddwylliant sy'n cael eu llwyddo, a'r ffordd y mae'r ffordd y maen nhw'n cael eu ddysgu, ac nid ydym yn credu bod hynny'n ddangosol. Felly, beth yw'r ddwy gyfraniadau sydd wedi'u cyflwyno?"
1186.0,1191.0," Yn gyntaf, mae'n dweud bod ymdriniaethau yn arbedrwydd ac yn ymwneud â'r ffordd y byddem ni'n galluogi pobl i ffwrdd â nhw."
1191.0,1196.0," Y cyfraniad mwyaf y byddai'n ei gynnwys yw rhywun sy'n symud gwladau, mae'n dechnegol yn dod yn ddynol o'r wlad hwn,"
1196.0,1206.68," yn llwyddo'u hawliau i fod yn ddynol o wlad arall, ac yn gallu symud yn ôl ac yn ôl, ac yn gallu gael eufosgau lle. Beth yw'r atebion i hyn? Un, ar lefel ffaith, gall pobl gael ffosgau lleol mewn gwahanol lleoedd. Mae'r ddweudddiad hwnnw'n wir."
1206.68,1211.2," Ddwy, yn y sgwrs, yn ein sgwrs, nad oeddent yn gwrando ar hynny. Mae Arthur yn dweud"
1211.2,1217.06," bod ymateb i ffosgau yn ystod y cyfnod, mae'n anodd i ni gael gwerthfawr o ddau a chael lles o ddau."
1217.06,1222.4," Ond, pan fyddwn yn siarad am unigolion sy'n gael ffosgau lle ar gyfer eu hunain a'u bywydau gwaith eu hunain,"
1222.4,1226.0, rydyn ni'n hollol yn iawn â hynny. Nid adnoddau hynny ddim yn dangos nad yw pobl yn gael
1226.0,1230.0, reit i fynd i ffwrdd arall. Mae'r adnoddau hynny yn dangos pam mae gan dynion a chyfrifon
1230.0,1235.0, reit i ffwrdd arall o ffwrdd arall rhywbeth nad ydyn nhw wedi'i wneud.
1235.0,1240.0," Y cyd-destun ar hyn o bryd yw cyfrifon gwahanol, yn y bôn am ddysgu am y cyflog,"
1240.0,1247.0, ac yn rhoi cyfle i bobl allan ar gyfer cyfle cyfle economaidd ar gyfer cyflogau llaw. Rwy'n credu bod hyn wedi'i ddysgu'n ddigon o ran y faterion ffasgol yma yn fy gyflwyniad.
1247.0,1251.0," Ond yn fwy i'r pwynt, nid ydym yn meddwl bod hyn yn fodel gynhyrchol."
1251.0,1254.0, Nid ydym yn meddwl bod gwasanaethu'ch ddwy ffasgol neu'ch tŷn yn ystod y gwaith
1254.0,1258.0, a chynhyrchu pethau allan o'r maskin gyda'r rhan fach yw ffordd ddeall
1258.0,1262.0, y cyfrifoedd y maent am ei drafod o ran addysg a chyflogi.
1262.0,1266.22, Y lle rydyn ni'n dweud ein bod yn fwy arfer i addysgu a chyflogi about in terms of education and upskilling. Where we tell you we're more likely to access that education and upskilling is where you have local businesses
1266.22,1268.08, that employ local people in the other
1268.08,1270.04, estuaries of management and that sends it to
1270.04,1272.14, a total of universities and schools
1272.14,1274.18, to be founded. Before I move on to my
1274.18,1276.08," substantive questions, I'll take a few."
1276.28,1278.28, What are the poorest parts of India?
1278.58,1280.2, The rural areas that look like
1280.2,1281.94, much of the country prior to
1281.94,1283.82, foreign investment and industrialization
1283.82,1287.32, or the cities that you deem as horrific bastions of oppression.
1288.66,1290.52," Also, you've got both quite accomplished areas,"
1290.62,1293.36," people that live in slums that are very poor, people that live in rural areas that are very poor."
1293.66,1294.88," We point out that overwhelmingly,"
1295.1,1297.52, you want to claim that the benefits of international business investing
1297.52,1300.44," contend not to invest in rural areas, contend to invest in urban areas,"
1300.62,1303.3, and that's where all the stuff about the rising of house prices
1303.3,1306.0, necessarily excluding local development is so problematic that it becomes much more problematic if they do provide that ultimate influence. ac mae'r hyn a ddweud wrth Arthur am y cynydd o fuddsoddiadau yn amlwg o'r datblygu lleol yn mor ffoddol.
1306.0,1309.0, Ond mae'n dod yn fwy ffoddol na'r hyn a wnaethon nhw ei ddatblygu yn gynt.
1309.0,1311.0," Felly, y cymorth cymorth."
1311.0,1315.0," Yr hyn rydyn ni'n ei ddweud yw, yn ymwneud yn benodol â'r ffodd arferol,"
1315.0,1320.0," ein bod yn galluogi rhai sefydliadau i ddod, ond i ddim yn cael eu clasifu fel ffyrwyr,"
1320.0,1323.0, mae'n rhaid iddynt ddod i'r cyfnod o unigolion a chynulleidfaoedd ffyrwyr.
1323.0,1328.0," Maen nhw'n rhaid eu cydnab unigolion a chynulleidfaoedd gwahanol gydag unrhyw un o'u cyrff, gydag unrhyw un o'u cyrff, a ydy'r rhain yn cyfrifol yn y cwmni, a ydy'r rhain yn mynd i lawr ysgolion,"
1328.0,1332.0," ac mae'n rhaid i'r rhain ddweud wrthych chi, mae'n rhaid i'r rhain ddweud wrthych chi,"
1332.0,1337.0, sut mae hynny'n newid y cyfrifoldeb a'r prosesau gan y rhai sy'n cael eu gael y gwaith
1337.0,1340.0, i'w gael a'r unrhyw unigolion a'r unrhyw un o'u cyrff.
1340.0,1346.0," Nid ydym yn dweud bod yn rhaid i fyddeuolwyr gwahanol yn angen i ddifrifo yn unrhyw amgylchedd, ond pan maen nhw'n cael pwer heb ystyried, mae hynny'n gweithio'n anodd."
1346.0,1347.0, Sut mae'r pwer yn cael ei wneud?
1347.0,1348.0, Dwy ffordd.
1348.0,1350.0," Yn gyntaf, gan fathymegu'r ffyniad."
1350.0,1356.0," Pan mae cyfrifo'n rhaid i gael ei reoli mewn gwlad neu pan mae'n rhaid i ddod trwy'r tref cyhoeddus i ddynnu llyfn ynghylch y wlad yma,"
1356.0,1358.0," ydy'r pethau rwy'n meddwl y byddai llawer o bobl wedi'i ddweud y gellir ei wneud,"
1358.0,1370.6," maen nhw'n gallu gwneud y ffynnu'r tax a chyflawni'r tax. Mae hwn yn broblem anormol mewn setau mawr o'r byd. Yn Uganda, er enghraifft, mae BP'n dod o hyd i 400 miliwn o ddoddau'r US y flwyddyn gyda'i tax,"
1370.6,1376.4, ac mae'r holl ddwy o'r system iechyd yng Nghymru yn cael cymaint o 380 miliwn o arian Llywodraethol.
1376.4,1380.6, Ac rydym yn gallu mynd i'r afael â hynny drwy annog y cwmnïau sy'n bod yn ystod y dynion hyn
1380.6,1385.04," i fod yn rhai arbennig i'w cyflogi, i gyflogi tax. dyna'r pwynt arall y bydd y gweithrediadau yn fwy tebyg i'w"
1385.04,1389.6," ddefnyddio. Yn ymwneud â hyn, mae'r fawrwyr yn ymateb yn dda i chi ac yn eich ymgysylltu â'u"
1389.6,1394.0," ddyluniad am y cyflog o ddysgu, a'r cyflog o gwasanaethau. Os ydym ni ar ein llawr"
1394.0,1399.44," i ddangos i chi sut mae cyflog yng Nghymru yn gwella'n ystodol mewn rhai cyd-destunau,"
1399.44,1408.0," byddwch yn fwy tebyg i chi, fel dyn datblygu, gallu gael y buddsoddiad hwnnw yn eich cyd-destun eich hun. Yn ail, byddwn i'n siarad â chyfraith. Rydyn ni'n meddwl bod yna'r realiti anoddol"
1408.0,1414.0," yw bod cwmnïau fel BHP Billiton, oherwydd nad ydyn nhw'n ymgysylltiedig yn Indonesia,"
1414.0,1419.0," ond yn hytrach yn y Lundain, yn gallu gwneud y cyfrifoedd llygaid yma mewn llawer o wahanol wahanol ffyrdd."
1419.0,1424.0, Mae'n edrych fel pan roedd Llywodraeth Indonesia yn ffynnu cyfraith tuag at BHP Billiton
1424.0,1426.0, am ysbyllfa o acydau i'r
1426.0,1431.2," fwytau ddwylo, am y llwythu a'r dystrychiad o'r ffordd ffwrdd, fe wnaeth y Cwmni BHP Billiton"
1431.2,1435.2," gyflawni'r Llywodraeth Indonesean, ond nid oeddent wedi'u cymryd i'r llyfrgell yn Indonezia,"
1435.2,1447.0," maent wedi'u cymryd i'r llyfrgell yn Londyn, maent wedi'u cymryd i'r llyfrgell yn New York, maent wedi'u cymryd i'r cwmniau hynny, os ydyn nhw am gael adnoddau, os ydyn nhw am ddarparu gwaith cymdeithasol i'w hunain a phobl lleol."
1447.0,1453.0," Allwn ni eu gwneud yn sefydliadau gwleidyddol, gweithredu, gweithio ar bobl lleol yn eu sefyllfaoedd manodig,"
1453.0,1459.0," arfer a'u taro. Dyna'r pwynt y gallwn ni'u cadw i'w canfod am yr abwysedd sydd, wrth gwrs,"
1459.0,1462.0, yn ymwneud â'r ddibwysedd y mae'r ddibwysedd yn y ddibwysedd.
1462.0,1466.0," Ar ddiwedd y cyflwr cyntaf, a phwy sydd yn gweithredu ar y cyflwr, rwy'n credu bod ddau ochr i'r debat hwn. Ar ddiwedd y cyflwyniad cyntaf a'r cyfrifon cyfrifol,"
1466.0,1468.0, mae ddau gwestiwn yma.
1468.0,1471.0," Un, mae pobl sy'n ddim yn byw ynddyn nhw, ac yn ddim yn fynedigion y nation,"
1471.0,1473.0, yn gael hawliau i bwydo cyfnod o'r nation?
1473.0,1475.0, Mae'n dweud nad ydynt yn rhoi ffyniad i chi i ddweud mai dyna'r achos.
1475.0,1478.0, Ond pan ddywedwn i fod y gallu i bwydo i fynedigion arall
1478.0,1480.0, yn amlwg yn cael canlyniadau mor anodd.
1480.0,1482.0," Mae'n gynrychioli adnoddau naturiol,"
1482.0,1485.0," yn gwneud i bobl lleol ddweud pa ffordd yw'r ddwyloedd ar gyfer llawr. hijacking natural resources, forcing local people into what borders on slave labour,"
1485.0,1488.0, that is the point which this debate must rest with proposition.
1488.0,1489.0, But it also rests with proposition.
1489.0,1494.0," With six minutes of material from our first prop, do not receive a response."
1494.0,1495.0, Vote drop.
1499.0,1505.32," In today's debate, the only actor that side proposition seems to be considered for is multinational"
1505.32,1510.16," corporations. Team England ignores what Ella makes clear. In many countries, it does take"
1510.16,1514.7," decades to become a citizen, and even if it's four years, we think that is too long for"
1514.7,1519.5, an immigrant to have to wait to get a house or own a draft of land. Only a handful of
1519.5,1523.2," countries allow people's citizenship, or have to screw in England, but not in the rest"
1523.2,1528.24, of the world. We think it's very fitting to completely ignore our first argument on the fact that
1528.24,1532.32," a lot of borders are arbitrary, and you may have sufficiently mocked our second argument,"
1532.54,1537.54, but they fail to engage. The lack of response is why we are so far ahead in today's debate.
1537.84,1541.22," In this speech, I'm going to be doing two things. First, I'm going to be engaging with"
1541.22,1544.8," everything we've heard so far coming out of the proposition, before then delivering our"
1544.8,1547.92, third substantive argument that land is essential for displaced
1547.92,1552.72, populations. But now let's get into what side propositionists will us in the debate. Side
1552.72,1557.2, proposition claims that multinational corporations are engaging a race to the bottom to pursue black
1557.2,1561.76, regulations. They're part of their argument is quite simple. They tell us that multinational
1561.76,1566.0, corporations have so much money they can bully developing countries into submissions.
1566.0,1571.0," We have a number of responses. First off, worker's relations were lax to begin with."
1571.0,1579.0," In fact, regulations are often implemented by developing governments in response to actual problems that arise with multinational corporations."
1579.0,1586.08," Why is this the case? Ella already brought to you the idea that backlash is led to companies like Forever 21, for example,"
1586.08,1589.62, increasing oversight in their supply chains by the company
1589.62,1591.32, and it encourages local governments
1591.32,1593.8, to implement regulations in response.
1593.8,1594.64, Why?
1594.64,1597.04, We reject the characterization that developing countries
1597.04,1599.14, are so helpless in protecting their workers.
1599.14,1601.94," For example, in response to their contradictory use"
1601.94,1604.78," of Chinese projects using foreign workers in Egypt,"
1604.78,1610.2," the Egyptian government implemented a law that for every one foreign worker, nine names must be employed."
1610.48,1615.08," We think the Chinese projects continued, and the Egyptian people who faced high levels of unemployment"
1615.08,1618.74, then were able to gain money to actually feed their own families.
1619.1,1623.64," Governments have an incentive to do this, and companies have an incentive to stay."
1623.64,1629.94," The second response we have is that foreign ownership is necessary to develop things like infrastructure. Remember,"
1630.32,1635.8," on scale, foreign actors will always have more resources than local communities. Element"
1635.8,1640.1," is very clear. They simply say, we are not engaging. That was not a response to what"
1640.1,1644.68," we tell you. That rather, having foreign actors is the only condition to which this is going"
1644.68,1645.36, to be possible.
1645.36,1652.36," First because they have things like higher levels of technological innovations, but secondly because they on scale have more resources."
1652.36,1656.6," But now, let's talk, but now we think why do foreign actors have an incentive to do this?"
1656.6,1669.3," Building schools so workers are literate or building hospitals so workers are able to work directly benefits the project of foreign companies. And politically, this is why China has created over 500 hospitals and schools on the continent"
1669.3,1669.8, of Africa.
1670.12,1674.66," Our clear response is that building schools, hospitals, and even simply employing workers"
1674.66,1677.32, is a great reference to gaining worker rights.
1677.56,1682.6," When workers are educated, fed, literate, and can afford health care, only then can"
1682.6,1684.3, they advocate for workers' rights.
1684.58,1685.22, Let's be clear.
1685.32,1691.66," On their highest ground, we think having any amount of money is better than the alternative that Ella gives you, which is none at all."
1691.66,1700.62," To give you an example, in rural India, every single year workers choose to return to foreign-built factories in winter because the alternative is starvation."
1700.82,1708.0," For example, building a bridge owned by a different country means that a farmer can get from point A to point B where they could not do so before."
1708.0,1718.0," But now, let's answer this third argument on the idea of skirting taxation. Large companies are systematically able to skirt taxation in every country, including developed ones."
1718.0,1729.0," This is simply an argument for why foreigners shouldn't be allowed to own land anywhere, not specific to developing countries. But what was the comparable analysis that they give you underneath this point that, like, uncontested?"
1729.0,1733.0," They did not contest with that, that in many cases, borders are arbitrary."
1733.0,1737.0," For example, would the Spence Pro-vote, the Free Co-op movement, or Winston Churchill"
1737.0,1740.0, literally drew the borders for the Middle East on a napkin?
1740.0,1749.0," The reason why this is so important is because we think there was a lack of engagement on another actor that completely ignored the debate, namely immigrants for example."
1749.0,1757.0," We think that in these cases, it is really important for them to be able to return to countries where they once lived but would not be considered a citizen."
1757.0,1763.0, The only real response we get is that they say they encourage people who are dedicated to that country gaining citizenship.
1763.0,1766.8, We think any amount of time that has to be actually backed or actually pursued
1766.8,1772.8," is one, going to be pretty long, and secondly, is still going to be pretty dangerous for the individuals themselves."
1772.8,1776.4," At the end of the day, we think they ignore the fact that in many cases,"
1776.4,1782.4," multinational corporations do in fact help workers, they do in fact help workers to feed their families,"
1782.4,1785.66, and we think regulations can still be employed even on their highest grounds.
1785.72,1786.94," Before I go on, I'll take a point."
1786.94,1792.24," One of the reasons developing countries need high amounts of resources in order to develop is the high land prices,"
1792.4,1795.14, which come about as a result of competition between foreign investors.
1795.54,1800.56," Why, when land is cheaper, do you not allow locals to develop industries in a way that is sustainable for the future?"
1800.58,1809.0," Okay, we think that first off, there's an issue of scale that happens where foreign actors can simply develop in more efficient ways. But secondly, we can still support"
1809.0,1813.0, locals still owning some land. The comparison is not in our world where only foreign individuals
1813.0,1817.0, own entire areas of country. We think it's a pretty false guarantee that we do that.
1817.0,1821.0," And lastly, on this point about resource colonialism, we still think that one, we can actually"
1821.0,1830.52," have more regulations, but secondly, beforehand, in a lot of these countries, they did not have the infrastructure to gain any level of economic benefit in the first place."
1830.76,1835.18, But now we're going to our third step to the argument that land is essential for displaced populations.
1835.18,1842.42, The reason why this argument is so important is because it brings in a new actor in this debate that side proposition has ignored entirely.
1842.92,1845.0, Let's examine the context in which we live.
1845.0,1849.0, We live in a world with over 60 million refugees.
1849.0,1853.0, These are families and individuals who have been forced out of their states.
1853.0,1856.0, These are the Syrians whose country is ravaged by civil war.
1856.0,1860.0, These are the Orquídea whose presidents face silence as the military in Myanmar
1860.0,1863.0," say, hurry our genocide and burn entire villages to the ground."
1863.0,1867.36, And these are Indian families who are forced to migrate because of monsoons and flooding
1867.36,1867.98, in their families.
1868.14,1868.76, Thanks for the information.
1868.9,1874.48," We would say, around the world, people have no other option but to leave their home and"
1874.48,1877.68, functionally have no state on which to own land.
1877.94,1883.78, The impact is compounded by the 20.5 million predicted climate change refugees in the upcoming
1883.78,1884.3, century.
1884.56,1888.5," This analytic makes sense, considering that we are already witnessing the mass access"
1888.5,1893.5," of people who are moving away from coastal and neighborhood regions due to flooding, droughts, and extreme weather."
1893.5,1898.5," At that rate, we are dealing with over 80 million people largely in developing centuries"
1898.5,1903.5, that characteristically are more vulnerable to extreme weather than to the economic ability
1903.5,1906.0," to develop adaptive infrastructure,"
1906.0,1910.0, who are currently facing and surrounding states with great political instability.
1910.0,1916.0, Due to the most significant and critical ways these refugees can survive in their new states is through land ownership.
1916.0,1921.0," Why this case? Many countries around the community locate rely on subsidies for agriculture,"
1921.0,1928.28, literally meaning that the way individuals survive is largely dependent on the ability to own land to farm or establish a business.
1928.54,1932.56," For example, working-class Muslim populations of Kota Land in Bangladesh, for instance,"
1933.02,1936.9, and countries such as Jordan along the Jordan River or Turkey next to the Mediterranean
1936.9,1941.14, Sea have high populations of Syrian refugees who similarly pursue land grants in order
1941.14,1942.7, to have substantive agriculture.
1943.08,1948.0," In the proposition world, this mechanism disappears because they would deny them the ability to"
1948.0,1953.0, own the land. The impact is further in states where they don't have the economic resources
1953.0,1955.0, to solely rely on native markets.
1955.0,1961.0," This is not a minority of cases. In Lebanon, for example, Syrah Nefruji has now"
1961.0,1971.0," composed one-third of the entire state's population. Make no mistake, side proposition would deny the world's most vulnerable the ability to survive and live sustainably."
1971.0,1975.0, We are willing to wait four years for these citizens to actually pursue citizenship.
1975.0,1978.0, The D.D.s and individuals are the most important in today's state route.
1978.0,1990.04," They have no alternatives for states to return or be native to, and they have been through the greatest harms and thus deserve the greatest compensation. At the end of the day, they remove not only mechanisms for individual"
1990.04,1994.62," native workers to actually subsist, but they remove the ability for the most vulnerable"
1994.62,1998.46," to continue to pay, and that point is a clear valid for the opposition."
2001.28,2010.0," In their attempt to explain why MNCs am wella'r datblygiad, roedd TGSA yn rhywbeth o'n fawr am beth roedden nhw'n ei olygu gan wella'r adnoddau,"
2010.0,2018.0," gan wella'r sgiliau tecnicol, gan wella'r cyfleoedd. Yr un peth y maen nhw'n ei ddangos yn sicr yw bod MNC'n cymryd 80% o'r trefion yn y"
2018.0,2028.0," fforddau maenol Cymru, yn llwyddo lleolion ac yn distroi'r amgylcheddau gynhyrchaliadwy a all gwella'r datblygiad. Yr hyn rydyn ni'n ei ddysgu yn sicr yw bod prynu'r ddau ar gyfer cyfrif hwy"
2028.0,2033.0," i unrhyw leol arall, ac allai hynny ddod o hyd i'r system ac ati'r holl busnesau eraill."
2033.0,2037.0, Rydym yn meddwl a ydynt yn barod i ddiffynu eu gwasanaethau gwell.
2037.0,2040.0, Rydym yn meddwl a yw hynny'n gweithio i ddatblygu'r datblygiad ar eu ochr.
2040.0,2042.0," Yn ystod hynny, tri gwestiwn."
2042.0,2048.0," Yn gyntaf, pa fath o ddynion ydyn nhw'n meddwl y bydd yn bosib i chi ddewis a chael arian ar y llyfr hwn? A mwy yn bwysic, pa faterau y dylech chi ei ofal am"
2048.0,2052.0," i gael arian ar y llyfr hwn? Yn ail, cwestiwn beth mae fuddsoddi gwahanol yn ei olygu"
2052.0,2056.0," i'r dynion datblygu, ac yn olaf, ffordd i fynd i'r afael â pha ffordd y byddai datblygu"
2056.0,2059.0," yn dda o'r ddau ochr o'r llyfr hwn, pam y byddwn yn gwthio at faterion lleol."
2059.0,2066.0," Gadewch i ni edrych ar y mater cyntaf yw, beth yw gwneud arian ar y llyfr hwn? who would buy another land under the state's authority? Because they think that, first of all, there are plenty of extraneous principles"
2066.0,2067.8, about the fact that the board is an arbitrary
2067.8,2069.6, and therefore we don't have a justification
2069.6,2071.6, for denying individual property rights.
2071.6,2073.5," Look, we're not going to stand up here"
2073.5,2075.8, and deal with their little cute anecdotal arguments
2075.8,2076.5, in church.
2076.5,2078.1," The board is made up of arbitrary,"
2078.1,2079.8, but we think that things that probably aren't
2079.8,2081.4, are things like tax structures
2081.4,2083.3," and things like how we engage with the state,"
2083.3,2088.88, precisely the kind of accountability mechanisms that edge borders. We think when these large MNCs are able to
2088.88,2092.48," avoid engaging with the state on those levels, when we think individuals don't do that,"
2092.72,2097.02, probably the question of whether borders are arbitrary becomes a pretty irrelevant one.
2097.4,2101.74," Then they tell us refugees and migrants need the capacity to buy a plan. Like, this was"
2101.74,2104.8," slightly strange, because they gave us two minutes to believe that these individuals"
2104.8,2107.0," are living on subsistence, that they are some of the most vulnerable"
2107.0,2112.0," people within nations, and then told us they were going to buy houses? Like, I'm genuinely"
2112.0,2115.0, a little bit confused as to how they think it's happening. Some of them use a more likely
2115.0,2119.0," mechanism, as the things that Ed tells you about. For instance, friends, for instance,"
2119.0,2124.0," being offered accommodations, or actually, it would be unrealistic, living in a refugee"
2124.0,2128.0," camp. But we also think that when refugees want to live in parties for the long term, oedd yn ymddangos yn realistig i fyw mewn canolfan arferol. Ond rydyn ni hefyd yn meddwl bod arferolion yn mynd i fyw mewn gwleidyddion am y hir"
2128.0,2132.0," ar gyfer ymweliadau, mae'n amlwg yn cynnal pethau fel cydweithrediadau,"
2132.0,2135.6, a fyddwn ni'n hapus i'w cefnogi i fynd i fyny a mynd i lawr o'u canolfan.
2135.6,2139.4," Yna, roeddent yn dweud wrthym, mae angen i unrhyw un o'u cyrff, os ydyn nhw am adael eu"
2139.4,2142.2," wladau, ddod â'r rhain yn y lleoedd yn unigol."
2142.2,2149.2," Os ydynt yn yr un fath o ddynion yn ystafellau yn ystafellau yn ymddygiadol, rydym ni ddim yn siŵr pam y maen nhw'n ymrwymi, ond er"
2149.2,2153.44," gwaethaf, rydym yn meddwl bod pethau fel cymdeithasolwch a thafoddau cymwys yn"
2153.44,2158.4," bodoli i'w ddysgu yn union. Ond, gwelwch, gadewch i ni fod yn onest ar ddiwedd y"
2158.4,2161.52," ffyniad hwn, oherwydd rydyn ni'n meddwl nad ydym yn siarad am ddynion yn y mwyafrwydd o'r"
2161.52,2169.36," achosion, oherwydd mae'r ddynion yn credu eu hunain yn ddarparu dynion sy'n datblygu, fel y gwnaethon nhw'n rhaid i'r rhai yn y dynion, heb ddim o ddiogelwch,"
2169.36,2174.16," drwy gwrthdaro eu hunain i fynd ymlaen, y syniad y maen nhw'n cael cyfle i fynd ar y trein,"
2174.16,2178.32," y syniad y maen nhw'n cael cyfle i ail-gwneud eu bywydau ar hyn o bryd, mae'n rhywbeth"
2178.32,2182.64, sy'n hollbwysig iawn. Mae popeth y maen nhw wedi'i ddweud am y dynion hyn.
2182.64,2186.98," Ac er bod yn gwneud hynny'n bwysig, gallwch hefyd fod yn ymdrin â'r ffordd y byddwn ni'n ei wneud that everything they have told us about these nations. And even if it weren't a point, you can ultimately never be in a fortunate way of looking at it"
2186.98,2189.72," between the crushed economies of nations that we talk about,"
2189.92,2191.64, between children losing their hands
2191.64,2193.9," because LNCs aren't obeying regulation,"
2194.16,2196.62, and the minor inconvenience of waiting four years
2196.62,2198.16, for citizenship confirmation.
2198.62,2200.96, Onto the second question of what is the impact
2200.96,2203.26, of foreign investment in developing what.
2203.7,2207.38," Look, we think of the first thing that Arthur talked to that never really got a response"
2207.38,2211.54," was how these nations are able to specifically, or how these corporations are able to specifically"
2211.54,2216.76, exploit nations by threatening to relocate because of their multinational or transnational
2216.76,2217.24, status.
2217.62,2221.1," The only response we got here, and the key to us really making a big deal about this,"
2221.28,2223.62, was how much they supported regulation bias.
2223.9,2227.0," Look, this completely ignored the thrust of Arthur's analysis, which is not that these ac roedd yn fawr iawn am hynny o ran sut maen nhw'n cefnogi'r rhaglenni. Wel, mae hyn yn ddewis cyfnod o amrywiaeth arferol,"
2227.0,2230.0," sy'n dweud nad yw'r cwmnïau hyn yn mynd i gael rheolau yn eu lle,"
2230.0,2232.0, ond nad yw'n gallu gwneud hynny.
2232.0,2235.0," Pan fydd y cwmnïau hyn yn gwneud cyfnod o amrywiaeth arferol,"
2235.0,2240.0, mae'r unig gyfle economaidd y byddant yn gallu parhau i ddefnyddio'r rhaglenni.
2240.0,2248.0, Ni oedd gennym unrhyw ymateb i'r amrywiaeth arferil am ddim yn ddiogel o ddefnyddio'r adnoddau neu unrhyw fater i'w credu y byddai cyd-dysgu datblygu yn y corfforau hyn yn ddewis
2248.0,2252.0," bod yn ddewis datblygu yn unigol, byddwn yn ystyried eu bod yn ystyried hyn,"
2252.0,2255.0, os oes gennynt ddim unrhyw bwynt i'w ddysgu.
2255.0,2257.0," Yna, byddant yn dweud wrthym am y mechgyn yw'r ffwrdd."
2257.0,2268.0," Yn ymwneud â'r mater yma, mae hyn yn ystyried llawer o'r ddefnyddion rydyn ni wedi'u ddweud amdano. you about, because seeing as they've tried to prove to us that conditions in these factories aren't bad as they say, probably backlash isn't the mechanism they want to throw at"
2268.0,2272.0, us. But people start calling for appeasement and receive no response to the fact that this
2272.0,2276.0, is probably no longer true in a world where a 24 or 48 hour news cycle requires that no
2276.0,2281.0, abuse ever receives sufficient attention to actually alter the calculus of individuals.
2281.0,2289.12," But actually, finally, more importantly, we think that it is absolutely unacceptable. So then there's a world where Western interests and the issues of people"
2289.12,2293.72, in these nations is the condition for whether their lives are even bearable. We think that's
2293.72,2297.56, something that we're incredibly abhorred. We can't stand it. Over and out. Then we
2297.56,2300.82," have this issue of what does development look like on our side of the house, which that's"
2300.82,2307.2, what we're trying to make. Our argument is not that individuals are so impoverished that they can't do things like
2307.2,2309.52," buy a house, which we think they have the right to do."
2309.72,2313.96," It's that they can't do things like build factories, which are necessary prerequisites"
2313.96,2315.82, for economic development in these countries.
2316.08,2317.4, Don't misconstrue our analysis.
2317.74,2318.54," No, no, no, no, no."
2318.64,2319.42, That is not the point.
2319.68,2323.48," Your argument is that people who are economic migrants, living or subsistence, people who"
2323.48,2328.0," are refugees, living with nothing but what's in their hand are going to be buying up land rather than renting it,"
2328.0,2330.0, or rather than seeking refugee care?
2330.0,2334.0," Like, a little bit late for a reframe, but that's a point you're on your own."
2334.0,2338.0," Okay, let's look at what development looks like on our side of the account."
2338.0,2341.0," Because the first thing that we told you, and this was something we never really thought to prove,"
2341.0,2346.0," was that under the state's quo, because of the increase in land prices precipitated by the bending wars between big MNCs, ac yna, oherwydd y cynydd o'r hwyrau, oherwydd y cynydd o'r hwyrau, oherwydd y cynydd o'r hwyrau,"
2346.0,2366.0," oherwydd y cynydd o'r hwyrau, oherwydd y cynydd o'r hwyrau, oherwydd y cynydd chi'r opsiwn i fod yn ffermwr agor, ar y llall arall, mae gennych chi'r opsiwn i weithio'n ddifrifol ar gyfer MNC."
2366.0,2371.0," Ond, er bod yr hyn rydyn ni'n ei ofyn i chi, yw un o'r faterion lleol o leiaf, mae'n iawn peidio â'r faterion sy'n llawer fawr"
2371.0,2376.0," ac yn rhywbeth sy'n ymwneud â'r holl faterion, ac yn gallu rhoi cymorth cyfrifol i bobl."
2376.0,2380.0, Rydym hefyd wedi dweud hynny oherwydd maen nhw wedi cael ymddiriedaeth yn unwaith yn y stafell.
2380.0,2386.1, Mae unigolion sy'n byw yno yn ymddiriedaeth i ddatbly got two responses. The first thing is this idea of scape.
2386.1,2388.4," Okay, let's actually break down what we mean by scape."
2388.4,2391.4," Because we think in the majority of instances, what they're probably talking about"
2391.4,2395.1, is corporations that have scapes in a variety of different nations.
2395.1,2400.1," These are likely to be corporations doing things like building railways to link up the ports and their ports,"
2400.1,2403.7," resources and scapes that are inaccessible to most local people,"
2403.7,2408.6, and that will probably pull out of their list of this debate if their burden is to prove that people's lives get better.
2408.6,2413.8," Let me tell us that these people have less resources. I've kind of already dealt with that enough in my introduction,"
2413.8,2420.2, but we've got to have a point. Cost-cutting and monopolies are precisely the things that actually make MNCs less efficient
2420.2,2426.96," than local people, who don't have those same incentives. Let me tell us that foreign investment uses low labour o ran pobl lleol sydd ddim yn cael yr un fath o ddysg. Yna, mae'n dweud wrthym fod fuddsoddiad gwahanol yn defnyddio llwyth o ddysg i gyflawni economi"
2426.96,2428.36, a chyflwyno ar gyfer fuddsoddiadau.
2428.36,2431.48," Yn gyntaf, mae'r Archwilio'n dweud wrthych bod hyn yn ddynion ddifrifol iawn,"
2431.48,2434.72, mae'n ddynion ddifrifol iawn o ran beth mae'r dynion hyn yn ei edrych ar.
2434.72,2437.64," Ond yn fwy cyffredinol, maen nhw'n gallu ddweud yn ymddygiadol"
2437.64,2448.0," bod yna ddylen i ddatblygu gwaith y cwmnïau yng nghymru workforces of these countries, and that their workforces having no skills is the only thing that draws them in easily. And this is why the important material in this paper comes."
2448.0,2452.0," Because we think ultimately, if there are lots of natural resources, you have no incentive"
2452.0,2456.0, to upskill or protect or provide infrastructure for a workforce when you're importing the
2456.0,2460.0," educated part of the child. And we also point out that when the price of land goes up, it's"
2460.0,2464.0, so much harder for anyone else in the society to build up the kind of infrastructure that
2464.0,2467.0, would improve people's quality of life.
2467.0,2474.0," Finally, their response to Ed's argument was a pretty misnomer, that you could skirt taxation anywhere in the world."
2474.0,2479.0," It completely neglects what we've already told you, that the race to the bottom means even in their best case scenario,"
2479.0,2485.76," where regulation is beautiful and no backlash happens every day, these concepts will never be able to enforce what is in their own interests."
2490.76,2496.36," From the very beginning of the first opposition speech, we gave you a very holistic interpretation"
2496.36,2498.6, of what we thought this motion encompassed.
2498.6,2503.0," Their response was, well, to continue talking about the rich white people who might have"
2503.0,2507.38," an Eton education, owning foreign companies, and then exporting people in developed countries."
2507.68,2512.34, We don't think that was sufficient enough engagement to talk or even respond to the
2512.34,2516.32, nuanced analysis that we've brought back to time and time again as to why our sign is
2516.32,2516.54, winning.
2516.78,2518.54, What am I going to be doing in this speech?
2518.58,2519.4, A couple of things.
2519.68,2525.12," First, I'm going to go over some major discharacterizations and important strategic errors made by the"
2525.12,2526.12, proposition.
2526.12,2530.12," Then, pose the two next questions you need to ask yourself when evaluating the round."
2530.12,2532.12," But first, which side best protects economies?"
2532.12,2537.12," And second, which side best protects the people who need protection the most?"
2537.12,2542.12," But first, let's go into some big mischaracterizations and strategic errors made by the proposition."
2542.12,2547.0, The biggest strategic error made by the proposition is that they still fail to engage in what
2547.0,2549.0, the actual imperative in this round looks like.
2549.0,2554.0," It wasn't enough for them to simply keep on saying that rich, profitable corporations"
2554.0,2557.0, are going to continue exploiting other developing countries.
2557.0,2560.0, Why do we think it was important for them to engage in their imperative?
2560.0,2565.0," Because as we told you right from the very beginning of the first opposition,"
2565.0,2570.0, that the alternative to having no ability for foreign and foreigners to own land in other countries
2570.0,2575.0," is no one is able to get investment, these people are left to starve, as Ella and Emily pointed out,"
2575.0,2579.0, we think that is a role where exploitation results in even worse consequences.
2579.0,2582.0, But let's talk about what the most important stakeholder is in this round.
2582.0,2587.98," We told you that right from the beginning of Emily's speech, the most important stakeholders are not really the rich white couple"
2587.98,2590.24, that they would characterize as most important in this round.
2590.46,2592.1," It's actually the migrants, the refugees,"
2592.36,2594.26," and the people who are displaced from their homes the most,"
2594.34,2595.68, as we've been offering since Santa Barbara.
2596.28,2597.46, Why do we think this is the case?
2597.5,2598.0, Two reasons.
2598.34,2600.68," First of all, we think they are the most economically vulnerable,"
2600.98,2603.9," and second of all, we think they are the ones who need land ownership the most"
2603.9,2607.0, because they are the ones who are displaced from their homes in the first place.
2607.0,2609.0," At the corner, we already are winning."
2609.0,2612.0," Who the most important stakeholders in this round are, it is enough for them to simply"
2612.0,2617.0, come up in their next speech and just say that these companies are exploiting.
2617.0,2620.0, Now let's go on to the first question you ask yourself in this round.
2620.0,2622.0, Which side best protects the economy?
2622.0,2625.0," Now they gave you two arguments, really, that really two sides of the same coin."
2625.0,2629.0," What were they? They said, well, exploitation increases when local industries are better."
2629.0,2633.0, Let's first respond to exploitation. We had a number of them that didn't get sufficient engagement with.
2633.0,2639.0," First of all, we told you that really foreign investment incentivizes greater investment from other countries,"
2639.0,2641.0, including developing countries who need it the most.
2641.0,2644.0, Maybe ownership of land therefore helps people in a few ways.
2644.0,2645.84," First of all, we already told you"
2645.84,2647.96, from the first opposition speech that developing countries
2647.96,2649.46, are a competitive advantage to labor.
2649.46,2652.3," Their response was, well, that opens them up to exportation."
2652.3,2653.8," But remember, we told you that there"
2653.8,2657.1, are regulations that can exist to stop exportation.
2657.1,2659.6," To which their response was, well, exportation doesn't"
2659.6,2661.3," work, or sorry, regulations don't work"
2661.3,2662.8, because these other countries just
2662.8,2664.0, don't have a ton of follow-up.
2664.0,2667.78, Remember the incentive analysis that Emily gave to you in her second speech that explained why regulations don't work because these other countries just don't have a ton of follow-up. Remember the incentive analysis that Emily gave to you in her second speech that explained
2667.78,2672.82, why regulations don't work. We did just list off one example and call it an argument about
2672.82,2676.72," how regulations work. We told you that these countries, mainly examples like China and"
2676.72,2680.1," India, do have incentives to try and improve work regulations. Why were these the case?"
2680.32,2684.14," Because when you improve regulations and improve labor standards, that's one, it increases"
2684.14,2688.0," the likelihood that people will still work for the companies that they say are so hard for,"
2688.0,2695.0," but two, it gives them the ability to access better labor conditions and ultimately make their company more productive and thus more profitable."
2695.0,2702.0, We think that regulations certainly still exist on our side of the house. It's in very lower degree to try and force us to defend exploitation.
2702.0,2705.0," But third of all, even if you buy, some exploitation does happen."
2705.0,2710.0," We think that it's reasonable ground for us to argue, from the very first opposition"
2710.0,2714.0," speech, that not only do regulations insist, but the imperative is infinitely worse."
2714.0,2718.0, We honestly want to clarify what our characterization of developing countries is.
2718.0,2723.0, We don't think that developing countries want to just stay developing and want to be exploited.
2723.0,2725.12, They ultimately want to become a developed nation.
2725.12,2727.36," And so in that sense, when foreign land ownership"
2727.36,2730.82," is one of the most viable avenues to get to that idea,"
2730.82,2734.04," we think that ultimately, the only option is to oppose."
2734.04,2736.32," But let's go on to the second idea that I told you about,"
2736.32,2738.4," how land prices will increase, and that basically"
2738.4,2740.24, increases the likelihood of economic downfall.
2740.24,2741.4, We had a few responses.
2741.4,2743.5," First of all, we told them that the places where foreigners"
2743.5,2745.62, or foreign companies which they want to focus on
2745.62,2748.54, are most likely to invest are places that are most likely
2748.54,2750.16, after the investment to urbanize.
2750.16,2752.06," And they tell you that in rural areas,"
2752.06,2753.74, prices for land will increase.
2753.74,2754.78, We actually contest that.
2754.78,2757.34," We think in rural areas, prices will still remain cheap"
2757.34,2759.06, because why is this the case?
2759.06,2762.34, We think that when cities within these developing countries
2762.34,2764.28," urbanize, that doesn't automatically mean"
2764.28,2766.26, that lesser developed rural cities will have to jack up
2766.26,2768.38, their prices to compete. We don't think that was the analysis
2768.38,2770.02, that actually brought their response.
2770.26,2772.14, What we told you is that rural areas that
2772.14,2773.94, oftentimes don't have as much resources
2773.94,2776.44, oftentimes have to keep prices low
2776.44,2778.26, to attract more investment to
2778.26,2780.26, their own rural cities. Why do we think that's
2780.26,2782.28, important? Because we have to analyze the scale
2782.28,2784.22, of the comparator. We told them that the
2784.22,2788.0," scale of investment that is received from foreign individuals,"
2788.0,2792.0," the companies that they talk about, is much greater than any local industry that they"
2792.0,2793.0, request from Taiwan.
2793.0,2799.0, Their second argument is completely on the idea that local companies are able to thrive
2799.0,2801.0, and help the country's economy overall.
2801.0,2805.0," We think the scale of investment, the scale of the money"
2805.0,2810.0, that these local companies are able to accrue is so minute in comparison to the scale of
2810.0,2814.0," investment that foreign multinationals are able to offer that on that analysis alone,"
2814.0,2818.0, they lose the debate. What are we telling you on our side of the pack? We told you that
2818.0,2823.0," when multinational corporations have an incentive to invest, that means that they have the ability"
2823.0,2827.52," to improve working conditions on our side of the house. If they want to talk about exploitation, if they want to talk"
2827.52,2832.18," about lax standards, then you default to the opposition. Why? Because we told you the prerequisite"
2832.18,2836.48," to get better standards, to get better economic development, is to have that initial stimulus"
2836.48,2841.12, from that foreign investment. What do we hear in response? Very little. Second question
2841.12,2844.74," in this debate. Which side best protects migrants and refugees, the stakeholders that really"
2844.74,2845.0, matter?
2845.0,2847.0," Before I get into it, I'll take a moment."
2847.0,2850.0," Given the structural reasons that foreign investment shuts out local businesses,"
2850.0,2857.0," why, when foreign investment isn't allowed, won't local economies be allowed to develop from your horrific, starving alternative?"
2857.0,2861.0, This is again where we beg you to engage with the comparative.
2861.0,2868.62," Because what we told you is that when foreign companies are not allowed to invest in these developing countries, that means that these developing countries' ability"
2868.62,2873.8, to try and get more money to build up their industries is very minimal. Why is this a
2873.8,2877.76, problem? Because since these local companies just don't have as much resources compared
2877.76,2881.34," to their foreign counterparts, that means the likelihood they'll be able to inject enough"
2881.34,2888.06, cash to build up their economies is very low. That's why on the comparative we're winning because we give the prerequisite meaning for greater
2888.06,2892.18, investment that board companies have in order to try and boost up these developing countries'
2892.3,2895.48," economies. On the second question, this is where the third substantive argument comes"
2895.48,2899.8," into play about what lacks tax regulations. But we have a few responses. First of all,"
2899.84,2903.7," we see that while a lot of countries, especially in the developing world, still have the incentive"
2903.7,2907.64," to impose regulations to prevent things like tax dollars, but second, even if you take"
2907.64,2912.22," their argument at its highest ground, it's an argument for better regulations, not an"
2912.22,2915.38," argument for why people shouldn't own land, or why foreigners shouldn't own land."
2915.58,2918.12," But even if standards are low, we took it that the imperative is worse."
2918.52,2919.86, What do we say about our side of the house?
2919.86,2924.5," We told you that in our first and third instance of arguments, that the arbitrary orders that"
2924.5,2930.36, are drawn by these foreigners into these developing countries are essentially preventing them from gaining greater opportunity.
2930.58,2933.08," Now, they say, well, we gave you a cute example."
2933.38,2937.38," I'm sorry, but we didn't think it was cute when borders were imposed on existing people."
2937.38,2945.0, We thought it was devastating for the families who were split apart that now cannot buy land in their home states or the states that they move to on their side of the house.
2945.0,2950.0," The comparative is the most disadvantaged people who we both agree need to be protected in this round,"
2950.0,2954.0," the most vulnerable to losing their homes, the most vulnerable to economic inequality,"
2954.0,2957.0, are the ones who will lose out on their side of the house.
2957.0,2960.0," At the point where they don't do anything to protect them, we take this to mean."
2960.0,2964.0," Their only response to this idea of arbitrary borders is that, well, dual citizenship can still exist."
2964.0,2968.0," First of all, that's a vast minority of cases, very few countries offer that. But second"
2968.0,2972.0," of all, they literally just told you in their second prop speech that these people can still"
2972.0,2977.0, wait for four years to get citizenship. Tell that to a Syrian refugee who is now living
2977.0,2982.0," in Lebanon, desperate to have a home. We think their response, their responses to our principle"
2982.0,2986.0, argument are flippant at best and not engaging with our actual analysis
2986.0,2990.18," at most. And of course, we told you we protect the people who need it most while protecting"
2990.18,2993.12, the economies of these developing countries. That's why we were focused.
2998.02,3003.4," Team England was remarkably uncomparative and un-nuanced in today's debate, and that's"
3003.4,3008.38," going to lose them the round. I don't want to get through, so I'll just jump right in toward two questions. First,"
3008.7,3014.4," why does corporate foreign investment help developing countries? And second, how does"
3014.4,3019.38," this help literally anyone who is not a multilateral corporation, a stakeholder that they apparently"
3019.38,3023.56," didn't really care about in today's round? But first, let's talk about how foreign investment"
3023.56,3025.0, does in fact help developing
3025.0,3030.0, countries. This question is literally where Team England put all of their offense. They functionally
3030.0,3035.0," had two arguments in today's round. One, foreign investment is bad and local investment is better."
3035.0,3040.0," And two, foreign investment allows people to do things like skirt tax laws. We have engaged with these"
3040.0,3049.36," substantially and it is not enough for them to just pretend that we didn't. They told us that the incentives of MNCs lead to necessarily things like exploitation, because MNCs want"
3049.36,3054.3," to increase their profits. We told them first, from our very first speech, that the rich"
3054.3,3061.02, individuals likely to do things like own forests and own mines suffer from the exact same structural
3061.02,3065.0," things as we know them. Second, we told you that in fact regulations"
3065.0,3069.64," do happen. Take the examples that we tell you about in Egypt, of OPEC regulations and"
3069.64,3073.44, all of these sorts of things. But this was not even the most important response to his
3073.44,3077.24, argument. The most important response they did not sufficiently engage with was the
3077.24,3081.98," comparative, where we acknowledged that in some cases, yes, foreign investment does"
3081.98,3089.62, lead to lower labor standards. We tell you that it is more important that this investment and these jobs exist in the first place.
3089.94,3091.26, Their argument was basically this.
3091.64,3097.72," Because locals suffer from high land prices, they're unable to invest in improving their economy."
3098.02,3102.4, That is why local individuals are pouring billions of dollars into building factories.
3102.94,3105.0, We just reject this characterization.
3105.0,3110.0," We tell you that in the vast majority of cases, actually all cases, it is more true that local"
3110.0,3114.0, individuals just do not have billions of dollars lying around.
3114.0,3117.0, That is why these countries are developing in the first place.
3117.0,3119.0, The scale of investment is just way low.
3119.0,3123.0," Nikhil told you that in rural areas, land prices are still low."
3123.0,3126.04, Why do you think that there is not massive investment happening?
3126.24,3128.08, It's clearly not because land prices are low.
3128.16,3131.8, It's because individuals do not have the resources to invest.
3132.18,3139.12, Note that these rural areas look like the vast majority of developed countries writ large before the age of investment.
3139.3,3141.4, This is the comparative they had to engage in.
3141.4,3145.8," And it is just factually true that rural areas are poor, suffer from"
3145.8,3149.9, more starvation and disease. It was not enough for them to come up here and simply assert
3149.9,3155.02, that that is not true. It is just true that when winters are cold and you can't grow food
3155.02,3159.34," and you don't have an industrial, reliable job to turn to, you and your family are going"
3159.34,3163.42, to starve. This was their imperative. They failed to engage in it. They lose the round
3163.42,3165.3, exactly on that point.
3165.3,3172.4," But even if we're willing to sacrifice some degree of local businesses to prevent literally millions of people from being in much worse poverty,"
3172.8,3179.6," I can just think that taxation, the impacts of taxation, are kind of a drop in the bucket compared to this and are happy to support more tax regulation."
3179.98,3183.76, They lose the debate on this question alone because it's where they waste all of their material.
3184.08,3187.5," But second, let's talk about anyone who is not a multilateral corporation."
3187.82,3189.72," Okay, what did we tell you on principle?"
3189.8,3192.2, We told you that arbitrary orders do matter.
3192.42,3193.48, They were very dismissive of this.
3193.56,3197.46," They were like, oh, that was just a cute anecdote about Winston Churchill you threw out in your first speech."
3197.76,3202.42, Never mind the fact that that cute anecdote has literally informed decades of Middle Eastern foreign policy.
3202.42,3206.0," But actually, we think that immigrants should not have to wait"
3206.0,3212.0," 4, 10, 15 years to buy a house or own a business because Winston Churchill thought the border of Afghanistan looked cute"
3212.0,3218.0, 10 miles east of where it was drawn. We don't think that that is right. They failed to engage on this principle.
3218.0,3224.0, They were only dismissed if it was turned around. But now let's talk about refugees. We tell you that those fleeing from conflict
3224.0,3227.3," or even environmental suffering, it's not like they're taking absolutely nothing with them."
3227.5,3237.22," They might have the resources to, say, buy a house or own a business, just as Syrian refugees in Turkey own businesses and support them, just as Rohingya minorities in Bangladesh own homes and businesses there."
3237.56,3249.0," We don't think they should have to wait 4, 10, 18 years to do this either. And we think that their mischaracterization and dismissiveness of this government is incredibly problematic. Note that these are 60 million"
3249.0,3253.62," people, the most vulnerable in the world, care about them, care about them, care about"
3253.62,3255.96," everyone in developing countries, vote for the opposition."
3259.34,3263.8," By and large, the opposition case in this debate was that you need start-up cash to"
3263.8,3267.0," develop economies, otherwise they're left as subsistence funding. We dealt with this Yn ogystal â hyn, roedd y casgad yn y debat yw bod angen i chi ddechrau arian i ddatblygu economïau, os na fydd ganddo, a chyllid cymorth."
3267.0,3269.48, A ni wedi cymryd hynny a gwnaeth y debat mewn ddwy ffordd.
3269.48,3272.64," Yn gyntaf, roeddem yn dweud bod hynny ddim yn wir, ac roedd yn debyg fod yna gyfraithiad leisiadwy,"
3272.64,3274.48, a chyfeirio'n rhyfeddol.
3274.48,3277.76," Ac, wrth gwrs, roedd y ddweud y gwell fawr y gallwn chi ei ddarparu gyda hynny yn y sbith"
3277.76,3287.5," o'r gofynion cyntaf a'r cyhoeddwyr y cyhoedd, pan oeddent yn ymddangos yn arbennig bod lleoliadau'n fawr sy'n ffynnu'r ffactorau hyn. Ond hyd yn oed os nad yw hynny'n gwirioneddol, rydyn ni'n siarad â chi o'r cychwyn."
3287.5,3292.0," Rydyn ni'n hoffi byd â datblygiad lleol yn llythyr, sy'n helpu pawb yn y wlad,"
3292.0,3295.5," yn hytrach na ffocws cyflym, sy'n llwyddo'r rhan fwyaf o'r cymdeithas."
3295.5,3301.0," Ac i ddweud eu tro cyntaf, mae llawer o ffyrdd cyfartalol o lawer o gwasanaethau."

3390.0,3392.0, Mae bod pobl fach yn gweithio ar gyfer cyflogwyr.
3392.0,3395.0," Y peth dau y maen nhw'n ei ddweud yw, ac efallai bod gennym rhai atebion,"

3436.0,3442.0," Second, how do we call these individuals to account? They ran away from this argument in the context of time and time again."
3442.0,3450.0," To some extent, I don't blame them. Because in the first plot, we're talking about the systematic abuse of power that killed 250 people in Rana Plaza. yn y cyfnod hwnnw, amser a amser eto. I rai ffordd, dwi ddim yn ei ddweud yn dda. Oherwydd yn gyntaf, roedden ni'n siarad am ddiffyg systematig sy'n llwyddo 250 o bobl yn Rhaid y Pasgad."
3450.0,3454.0," Mae hynny'n rhywbeth y maen nhw'n ei gael ei weld, ac yn wir, mae eisiau bod yn digwydd yn fwy cymaint,"
3454.0,3458.0," yn y gair eu cyfraith cyntaf, oherwydd mae'n mechnismaeth cymorth. Beth oedden ni'n ei ddweud?"

3468.3,3471.46, of the irrelevance of holding your local governments to account. Because they literally
3471.46,3475.84, own your lives. They own your islands. They employ an enormous amount of your population.
3476.14,3480.06," Because of that, we structurally can't hold them to account. No response there."
3480.3,3484.0," But we told you that when we encourage these businesses to play by the rules, we bring"
3484.0,3485.0," a load of benefits. We told you about taxation. They said, oh when we encourage these businesses to play by the rules, we reap a load of benefits."
3485.0,3488.0," We told you about taxation, they said, oh, well these businesses will avoid taxes anyway."
3488.0,3494.0," Not an argument in response to the fact that actually some of these businesses probably won't avoid tax, and we legally require them to pay them."
3494.0,3501.0," But, in our second speech, we told you about international legal systems rigged in the favour of multinational corporations, an argument they do not provide."
3501.0,3505.7," If you believe someone has the right as a rich, affluent individual or a multinational corporation"
3505.7,3509.5," to own a portion of another country, hold the local people to ransom,"
3509.5,3511.3, maybe they're going to sign opposition.
3511.3,3513.3," But somehow, I doubt it."
