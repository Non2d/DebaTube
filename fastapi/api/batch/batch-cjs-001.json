And it consists of criminal justice technocrats who have the most knowledge on the systemic biases and flaws of the system. This will be a transparent process in which the algorithm can continuously be improved to improve its level of efficacy. Thirdly, what will this algorithm look like? And we're just going to do a bit of characterization here. It will be programmed to evaluate both the type of punishment and the duration of sentencing, with the goal of prioritizing rehabilitation, the risk of reoffending, and the severity of the crime over other metrics such as retribution. We would use a host of punishments that aren't necessarily jail time. So rehabilitation, community service, fines, etc. We would take into account non-exhaustive metrics such as individuals past history of crime, remorse and ease of rehabilitation, severity of the crime, personal upbringing, etc. and compute this objectively. For illustration, if you're low income and you committed a crime of necessity in order to survive, your economic desperation can be used as a mitigating factor and we would recommend specific punishments like job training that would reduce the likelihood of recidivism."

For two main reasons. Firstly, the law provides an extremely wide scale of minimum and maximum sentencing for a single crime, granting judges the power to excessively over and under penalize criminals based on arbitrary considerations like their race and their own personal worldviews. As a direct result, two criminals who committed the identical crimes may be punished very differently under the side of opposition. But secondly, sentencing trials are far easier to compute via algorithms as opposed to conviction trials where there can be an infinite number of circumstances and complex evidence. Sentencing trials follow a set of metrics that can easily be calculated by an algorithm"

But then you also say that the data that's going to be provided for these algorithms will be based on the people who have enough knowledge. So basically, you're just going to take opinions from the rest of the people who have knowledge. How do you clarify this biasness? So my first argument is about why judges aren't having bias. But I but model gave two reasons why technocrats would be the one doing this but you assume that we will over penalize individuals that's not true because we're using a rehabilitative algorithm under your side the house is racist because they are specifically tailored to firstly rectify this racism but we look at individuals we told you those things like poverty as a mitigating factor, you compared it that you have to defend is racist punishments that are already status quo."

              "text": "Firstly, that every judge has a unique upbringing and a specific worldview on the application of law. This is to say that different judges view circumstances differently, and no amount of training or jurisprudence studies can change their inherent worldview. Some judges are excessively lean and too harsh as they prioritize different goals within the justice system, like retribution over rehabilitation, or the fact that they had zero tolerance towards some crimes due to their personal experiences with crime and the justice system. Additionally, your political and moral compass can affect the way you adjudicate criminal behavior because right-leaning judges tend to over penalize because they are tough on crime while left-leaning judges under penalize. Both of these are inequitable. Second level, judges are vulnerable to changing human emotions that determine the fairness of judgments. Judges are humans, note panel, but they are vulnerable to emotional stresses that affect their cognitive abilities and their rationality. So inside court proceedings, overly emotional victims have the ability to sway judges towards over penalizing the perpetrator. Whereas overly emotional perpetrators will compel the judge to under sentence. Outside of the courtroom, externalities in their lives may impact their emotional stability at any given moment. We're talking about turbulent relationships, life-changing circumstances that would sway even the most mentally resilient of individuals. The third reason as to why human judgment undermines fair sentencing is that judges are often swayed by the ability of their structurally disadvantaged. In sentencing trials, highly experienced and more expensive lawyers can persuade judges to prioritize metrics that advantage the client, while underpaid public defenders have no such incentive or experience to fight for the freedom of their clients. This results in an unequal application of sentencing laws depending on the wealth of criminals. Our algorithm computes defined metrics and evidence in an objective way as mapped out by technocrats, and the weighing of metrics is applied equally in all cases. What are the harms of this? So firstly, we would note that the most fundamental maxims of the justice system are equality before the law and impartiality, which they must undermine under their side of the house. But there are two more tangible and dangerous harms as well. Firstly, that over penalization results in the complete loss of trust in our justice system. The legitimacy of judgments, it's called into question and individuals believe that the criminal justice system is persecuting them instead. This undermines our ability to gain societal cooperation. So for example, how African-Americans are unwilling to offer information to law enforcement agencies that can help prosecute crimes because they believe that the court system is intrinsically against them. But furthermore, on the other hand, under penalalization emboldens crime culture as privileged members of society believe that their race and their wealth and other factors entitles them to the leniency of the law. Hence why wealthy white celebrities and politicians are the primary perpetrators of rape culture leaving behind a string of silenced victims. This asymmetry between perpetrator and victim further leads to underreporting and underprosecution under their side of the house."

              "text": "Into my second argument about why human judgement is skewed by personal biases that disadvantage the most vulnerable. Firstly, racism is ubiquitous in criminal sentencing. In the Northern Territory of Australia, 86% of the prison population is Indigenous, despite this group only making up 3% of the population. This points to the fact that the average judge is human and susceptible to prevalent stereotypes and bigotry that designate vulnerable minorities as aggressive, more immoral, and more dangerous, leading to the over-sentencing of these groups. These biases are extremely difficult to alter, and they are perpetuated by holes in the justice system for four main reasons. Firstly, judges can act with impunity because the independence of judiciary renders it a near impossible task to remove them from office. Secondly, they have the legal knowledge and expertise to rationalize any legal decision using any available metrics. Therefore, racism is hard to detect and easily explained away. Thirdly, appeal processes have high barriers of entry because you have to prove a gross miscarriage of justice. It is also extremely expensive and therefore highly inaccessible to low and middle income groups. At the very best, these appeals are reactive and uncertain when harms have already been incurred to the vulnerable. But finally, the fourth level, that training also does little to undo the kind of biases that have been ingrained in your mind for decades since childhood. It is almost impossible to be cognizant of your subconscious bias that you don't know even exists in the first place. This means that a judge may never realize that the racist tendencies decided that this black man was less remorseful and more dangerous than his white counterpart due to his implicit biases. The consequence of this is that un-first sentencing cripples a person for life, further disenfranchising vulnerable communities. Even if the average judge is blatantly racist, which is the best case scenario, our side gets systemic change whilst they rely upon the luck and goodwill of judges for minorities to escape the shackles of mass incarceration that they've been suffering under for far too long.

When we have more judges from different backgrounds, ladies and gentlemen, we're able to get more diverse decisions from various people and therefore we do not need to eradicate this human judgment.

Now, citizens have handed over their responsibility to the state and not to these algorithms that we're talking about. Then the question is, why do we give this responsibility or why do we hand this power down to these algorithms? Now, we also tell you, panel, about the issue of efficiency. We think that despite these algorithms being efficient, we on our side have more accountability. Now ask yourselves this question. Why does society have trust and confidence in human judgment? This is because we tend, as human judges, we tend to have more accountability than these algorithms that we're talking about. This is why states sacrifice efficiency for accountability. Therefore, we can trade off efficiency for accountability because that becomes unjustified."

              "text": "And this is why it brings me to my second issue, which is retribution. Now ladies and gentlemen, retributive justice responds to criminal behavior that focuses on the punishment of lawbreakers and their compensation of victims. In general, the severity of the punishment is proportionate to the seriousness of the crime. Now we have to ask ourselves this question, who is the best actor for this retribution? And we think outside of position that we have human judges who are the best actors and we're here to give you four reasons as to why we think that. Number one, a human judge is one who is able to understand and give and engage from a human view or from a human perspective. Now ladies and gentlemen, computer based algorithms may not be able to understand the emotional causes for these crimes that have been committed. As much as I know, these computers are not able to read the emotional status of a human being. It is something that only lies with these human judges. Therefore, we feel that empathy and feelings are some things that only lie with human beings. Number two, context. The circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood. Now, what do I mean by this? A judge might know the circumstance under which a certain crime was committed, and by that they're able to judge from that specific issue. Algorithms do not have context, ladies and gentlemen. They're not able to fully understand what might be going on. But with human judges, they have context and they're able to fully understand the issue that is being held on, ladies and gentlemen. And this brings me to my third issue, which is accountability. Now, by this, we talk about responsibility. We tell the panel that with human judgment, we are able to hold these judges accountable. I believe there is no way we can hold these machines accountable for this criminal sentence here. We need to realise that these machines are not perfect. We cannot completely hold them accountable, but human judges were able to hold them accountable. That is why we feel that we cannot eradicate these human judges. Number four, we talk about transparency. As opposition, we do not know what these algorithms relied on to make their decision. We don't think they are really transparent. Even if they were right, we don't know the factors or where it relied on. This is why we don't think they are really transparent even if they were right we don't know the factors or where it relied on this is why we think that human judgment is more transparent compared to these algorithms now ladies and gentlemen what are some of these"

              "text": "outcomes of algorithms number one we talk about cost effectiveness we think that these computers algorithms can be cost effective let's um talk about something like capital capital in terms of three things number one data, data collection, data analysis, the systems being made and maintained. Now, these three processes, all this money, they are cost-effective in terms of capital, ladies and gentlemen. Let us also think about cost in relation to these companies that are actually making this. One thing we know is that they're not really government-based. It is a lot to do with the private sector, ladies and gentlemen. Look at something like the Compass Risk Assessment Tool. It was not government-based, but rather it was made by a private company. Therefore, even with computer algorithms, cost-effectiveness is a factor not only just for humans but also for these systems. We also tell you about time. Now, panel, we think that for a case to be hard and for it to be given the best solution, time then is the factor at hand that needs to be catered for. Therefore, a judge needs time to come up with proper decisions for the judgment. We tell you that it's better for us to take time in investigating a case rather than rushing to free a computer with information that maybe is not even investigated, ladies and gentlemen. Let me give you an example of a lady who was arrested because of murder. She was arrested because she had killed a man. And when the case was investigated, they came to realize that this man had been sexually harassing this woman, raping her and abusing the woman. So at one point, this woman got pressurized and she decided to just kill him. Ladies and gentlemen, what is the analysis behind this judgment? That with human judgment, there is a lot of flexibility. Algorithms do not think like human beings they are set in a specific way that it will just react to the action that it has been given in that same case of the lady this computer you know just reacted to the case that it was murder but when the case was investigated and time was taken um there was a different judgment to this scenario now ladies and gentlemen time is very important in criminal sentencing. The fact that we think that we can save on time because of a machine, that's absolutely wrong. We also talked to you about biasness and corruption. Now, maybe one of the benefits of one of the benefits includes how algorithms will undercut biasness, discrimination and mental shortcuts inherent to human judgment. However, two arguments. We tell you that algorithms are not perfect in any regard. This is primarily because any algorithm needs to be coded by a human. This can introduce what we call unintended bias from the onset and biasness nonetheless. Now, what is the analysis towards this argument? I tell you that small irregularities and biases can produce a measurable risk in the final sentencing. For instance, there is evidence that despite similar rates of drug use, black Americans are arrested four times the rate of white Americans on drug-related charges. Therefore, even if an engineer were to come and faithfully collect data and create an algorithm, it would still pick up embedded biasness. Secondly, I tell you the idea of junk in, junk out. A major use of algorithm is to identify correlation within data set. However, ladies and gentlemen, a major use of algorithm is to identify correlation within the data set. However, depending on the type of data, this could lead to a false positive and is not useful for identifying the underlying causes. For example, let's talk about poverty. Poverty is not necessarily a direct cause of criminal behavior, but it can be an indirect cause where it will create conditions that make crime more likely if errors are made on correlations. The final decision will generate either a higher sentence or a lower one. So, ladies and gentlemen, we tell you today that we find that there's no need of eradicating these human judgments, but we tell you that, number one, we can create more accountability in the sense that we can include more judges to the judiciary system. Number two, we can have these judges seek guidance from other peers so that we can get diverse decisions from these judges. So therefore, we tell you that we do not feel like we should remove this human judgment because we feel like there's also biasness in this computer algorithm and there are also other factors that are even more such as human judgment. Therefore, we feel that, ladies and gentlemen, we should not remove this human judgment. I rest my case. Thank you. The speaker spoke for eight minutes and nine seconds Thank you. Judges, are you all ready to listen to the next speaker? We now have the second speaker from the proposition to begin the debate. Hi, can you hear me?"

How on earth do they rectify the systemic failures and inherent biases that agents sophisticatedly analyze for you in this case? So firstly, I'll look into their model and tell you why exactly it is insufficient to the system. The first is that said, we can use more judges and therefore have more check and balance. The second is that we can seek assistance from peers. I'll first like to point out that in the status quo, this already exists. That is to say that they already have a panel of individuals whereby they can consult, they already have peer review within their system of judges, and they have consultative measures. Here is the problem. The innate biases and the innate structural subconscious racism that exists is what prevents them from doing so. So they cannot just say that more individuals would thereby lead to more accountability because they in fact exacerbate the human flaw within the criminal justice system and exacerbate the amount of racism and inherent biases that exist. We don't think they even responded to what Tijan told you about the fallibility of human minds and how literally, even like them, you know, slipping down or going to a football match and seeing their team lose could be little things like that that could influence their mental calculus."

              "text": "Now, I want to clarify one thing because they said that we would be basing it off racist statistics that would mean we also over punish individuals. The reason why technocrats are categorically not swayed by racist tendencies is the following two reasons. Firstly, Ejen told you in our mechanism that the job of technocrats is to solve the structural flaws of the criminal justice system, which is high rates of recidivism. So what this means is that the algorithm will be recommending a rehabilitative model because a rehabilitative model has been proven in areas such as Norway to be the solution to lowering recidivist rates. What that means is that even though the statistics upon which we look at may be racist and discriminatory, we are using that statistics and the literal purpose of our algorithm is to solve and rectify for the racism which is why we get the counter model to that intrinsic bias system but i would just like to point out that in the status quo judges are the ones who overwhelmingly put punitive measures rather than rehabilitative measures recognize panel that a current recognized aggravating factor within the criminal justice system is anger from the public. That just because the public is more angry, that means that you get a disproportionate punishment upon your perpetrator, which then leads to higher rates of recidivism and more spillover harms and social ills to society. That's a world in which they have to defend. We told you that we have a sufficient mechanism to counteracting that. What did they then say? Look guys, it's not just for you to use time and efficiency as a reason to implement this algorithm. We never said time was a reason, efficiency never was our argument. We only told you that we wanted to rectify racism in this status quo. They then said, look, how is your algorithm going to take into consideration for emotions, empathy, how is it going to factor for context? We told you that the framework is to create an objective mechanism based on facts and data and imply it impartially. What this means is that we can utilize things like clinical psychologists who can determine the level of trauma. We can use psychiatry to then give us the data and therefore input this into our algorithm upon objective metrics to determine what the punishment and sentencing should be. But just notice that this debate still needs to operate on a comparative and it was insufficient of them to simply say, hey, your algorithm isn't good when they literally do not want to recognize that individuals and judges are fallible and inherently biased, and the leanings of the judges are one that literally leads to someone like Brock Turner being sentenced for literally six months for raping a woman. That's the world that they have to stand for. The last thing that they talked about is about accountability and this ability for us to check and balance. I would just firstly like to note that on a comparative, judges are literally not held accountable under their side of the world, where they literally have things like tenure, that means that they can justify all these sorts of racist meanings that we have. We think that we are held accountable because each technocrat has an incentive to do so in order to ensure that they meet the objectives that we set for them. That is to say that parliament can also look into things like how effective is it and thereby have a rectifying and accountability mechanism to ensuring that they do their job properly. The conclusion to all of this is that even if they say that an algorithm may not be able to determine or be objective 100% in every instance, we need to recognize that this debate still operates on a comparative"

But before I continue, are there any POIs? No. All right. Now, why is this the case? Three reasons. Firstly, human sentencing results in extremely high rates of recidivism. Look, in the United States, recidivist rates is at 60% because judges are often extremely punitive and do not prioritize rehabilitation. The reason why this is the case is that society's perception of deterrence is punitive sentencing and jail time. That's why judges often reflect this and do not maximize the tools at their disposal. Community training, job training. Therefore, on opposition, their best case scenario would be some mediocre rehabilitative measures in jail, whereas on proposition, our algorithm would prioritize having no jail time at all if serving jail time is proven to be counterproductive to rates of recidivism and rates of reoffending. As this computer will continuously use the rate of reoffending as its barometer of effectiveness, technocrats will recalibrate its algorithm until the flaws of the CJS have been corrected. But the second thing to note is that over-penalization of crimes for criminals who do not deserve it become counterproductive to rehabilitative codes, putting non-violent offenders in prison for prolonged periods, giving poor people fines. This situation that has literally forced them to resort to prolonged periods of committing recidivist crimes, trying black juveniles as adults. Prisons are essentially criminal factories with inhumane living conditions that cripple the ability of offenders to function in society upon release and force prisoners into lives of violence and gang membership in order to survive. This, on a net, then creates more prisoners and more individuals who commit crime, and it then means that we have a more dangerous society that would not have existed if appropriate punishments were given as opposed to the status quo."

Retribution fails as more and more victims are created in society through repeat offenses, social safety is manifestly compromised, and these individuals are unable to reintegrate back into society. By prioritizing the effectiveness of rehabilitation, we are safeguarding the rights of future victims and fulfilling the fundamental goal of the justice system, which is keeping society safe. Note importantly that opposition cannot co-opt effective rehabilitation because judges are humans that play into the same hand with retribution and also do not have the oversight to predict when jail time is the best punishment to be at the end of the day panel, do not rely on the goodwill and luck of team opposition when an algorithm can structurally reform and curb and root out the structural racism that exists on the outside of the house we do not stand for mass incarceration, go side opposition The speaker spoke for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.

Because on our side of the house, we believe that our equitable justice by human judgment will entail both the reflection on the values set in place by the legal system and the recent application of those values in the context, right? It is biased to apply the consistent principle and is prepared to set aside general patterns in favour of the unique circumstances. We believe that equitable justice is going to be more beneficial on outside of the house because its obligation is to really provide a particular case specific explanation that connects to the legal principle. So in essence what we're saying is that human judgement would practice equitable justice better because there is more flexibility through human judgment and there is a wider parameter of understanding. However, on their side of the house, they've got the codified justice, the justice via algorithmic sentencing. Now this refers to that routinized application of a very standardized procedure, right, to a set of facts. Codified justice would tend to eliminate both three things explanation restraint or even the legitimation apart from the adherence to a standardized procedure. In essence what we're saying is what happens is when we're trying to compare equitable justice and the codified justice we find that codified justice provides more hands and the most inherent help is the disillusionment. Now, disillusionment will alter the judiciary's internal composition, culture, and even its attitudes by eroding the confidence in the legal system's legitimacy. We find that the use of the codified justice in algorithms would prompt many to start looking at human judgments that were made in the past more strategically, right, which will cast doubts on other legal activities. Take, for example, people who start looking back at contentious social issues where judges may have passed sentences that they quite want of life, liberty, or even poverty. And the majorly affected or the adverse parties would begin to question the judgments and they would feel that they were the victims of human judgment errors. So by promoting or even advocating for this algorithmic justice, we're just going to cast a shadow of doubt for the human judgment and decisions that were made in the past."

We believe that this argument serves as a response to first the effectiveness of human judgment in terms of moral accountability and effectiveness and secondly on the clash of how human judgment may get wrong and the question of villainous brought about in the first and second speech. The notable reasoning behind our reputation of the algorithmic sentencing as a replacement for human judgment is the fact that the appellate courts are going to always be a means to provide the transparency and accountability of a human judgment. Now let us use the even-ish analysis, right? Even if we can see that the human judgment side is wrong because obviously it's going to be defending the status quo, right? It's wrong either due to the biasness, either due to the emotions and the port of our proposition. We believe that we have a measure of recourse. Why are we saying this? That's because the judicial system has the appellate structure. Appellate structure ensures that there is more accountability because we believe that on outside of the house, it's basically impractical. Just a minute. It's basically impractical because even if you get a sentence that you're not satisfied at the magistrate level you can always reappear and through this appellate structure get um more um closure or even the accountability of the human judgment we find that this is not the same case on government side why are we saying that on government side of the house there is no measure of recourse and even less accountability due to the algorithmic sentencing that is going to be is why are we saying this this is because of the rigidity of these algorithms that decrease the ability to reverse decisions our analysis on this is a simple fact that it's going to be using a similar binary code. I've heard about in their model, what exact consistency, uniformity. So whatever binary code is going to be used at the magistrate level, that is the same thing that will apply on all the whole spectrum. So what do we find from this? Our end seven is that we find that whatever sentence you're going to get at the magistrate level, even if you reappear and get to the Supreme Court, the highest probability that you're going to get at the magistrate level, even if you reappear and get to the Supreme Court, there's a higher probability that you're going to end up having the same sentence.

But what was unique in our mechanism was that we told you we are holistic in terms of the kinds of statistics we use and the kinds of data we use to compute our efficient and effective kinds of sentencing. This means, yes, we agree the majority of crimes right now are committed by people of color and minorities in general. But what we go above and beyond for is to analyze why specifically. Therefore, we are able to objectively identify that this isn't a racial issue. This is the fact that these individuals were inherently disadvantaged because of economic stability, because they weren't given sufficient welfare. And that is an objective metric that our computer algorithms able to compute this objective data that is colorblind in nature. Because of that, we get proper sentences for these specific individuals. We think that's why we win that clash. But moreover, even if you think that some states are inherently biased, we offset that. Because on our side of the house, our computer algorithms can compute a vast array of efficient methods to solve the problem. So yes, we have chimerax right now, but what we also get is that we get to the realisation that Nordic models do tend to have a low recidivism rate because they don't prioritise retributive punishment, which I would like to note was the fundamental principle that opposition highlighted in its debate."

We weren't giving it off to a private corporation panel. We were giving it to an independent technocratic body based upon academicians that know the CJS in and out.

Because on the outside of the house, technocrats live and die by their academic integrity, insofar as they try to use racist statistics and do not fulfill their principle of solving recidivism and upholding the legal principle of impartiality before the law, they are going to be criticized with peer reviews. Compared to this, judges have a vast array of accountability mechanisms that don't actually work. The first reason is that they are able to easily justify their decisions by manipulating the legal metrics. The flexibility they talked about, the subjectiveness that they wanted, is the precise reason why a lot of just get away with those specific problems within the status quo. They gave us no solvency to that specific issue. Final point of clarity is that I want to note a lot of opposition's argumentations doesn't flow into it because the uncontingent and un-nuanced on sentencing trials they are nuanced on conviction trials so when they talk about the individuals who are like judges being able to understand the circumstances of those crimes we think those are more uniquely pernicious towards conviction trials because you need to understand whether there was guilt in the first place that isn't applied we're talking about crimes and the vast majority of crimes like crimes of of necessity being committed by African American individuals and people of color, crimes like rape being committed by white people against African American individuals. We think in the vast majority of instances, the kinds of circumstances that apply in this thesis don't really exist versus a sentencing trial. Opposition doesn't understand the emotion. Finally, they try to misstrap us and tell us that our model is insufficient because of data collection. We told you this is structurally untrue because data collection is separate in this case. Our data is what is holistic in nature. We don't get the problems they wanted to push on. Second part, I want to look at opposition's model and analyze why accountability and bias at the House is crippled. The first thing they said is they wanted more judges from different backgrounds. I think the first issue here is that it's a concession that there are problematic sentences due to innate biases that they wanted to fix because they wanted people of different backgrounds to check and balance each other. So they inherently still have a risk of individuals from, for example, white backgrounds that would perniciously punish minorities and people of color, which is a problem they needed to deal with. But second, I want to note, this mechanism isn't as simple as saying you will have it. It literally doesn't apply to any legal metric system in the status quo. More specifically, you still don't change the structural barriers that blockade people of color and minorities"

But second, they talk about judges seeking assistance from peers to pass a decision. I think it's a logical tension in their case when they argue each and every judge will be extremely qualified and perfectly able to use flexibility and subjectiveness to provide judge punishment within their situation. But second, this is also ineffective. Insofar as you're unable to coordinate biases of judges within their side of the house, it is pointless to get peer-to-peer reviews of judges because the peer-to-peer reviews you get are ones in which it's symmetrical, are ones that are still grounded with the kinds of racist tendencies and racial biases that exist. But at the final level, even if consultation is good, it's insufficient compared to our side of the house because the authoritativeness of good consultation isn't as clear or as maximized as an algorithm that's impartial in each and every circumstance.

They see they can have a human view and the algorithm is unable to read emotions like empathy. I think they conveniently left out the vast majority of cases where these kinds of emotions and subjectiveness actually create tangible harm towards people of color and minorities in general. Your human view as a judge of a majority population seeing the kinds of crime that's been committed by people of color inherently shapes's ability to view the world in an impartial way. Which means the moment in which you see an African American individual walking into your courtroom in the very first place, you assume that he's already guilty, you assume this individual already committed a crime. That impacts the ability to give a fair sentence, reading that's unjust. On ours at the House, we think our completed argument is impartial and is equal when it comes to our sentences to individuals.

Now, we also talked about the affluent structure and all kinds of solutions, where we found there was no engagement at all. And we also didn't see any responses or engagement on the social contract principle. That is why we begged the panels to vote opposition. Thank you."

Firstly, that most of their harms flowed from a misunderstanding of our model and not wanting to engage with the critical nuances Ejen told you with regards to how this algorithm would function. But secondly, that most of their argumentation was mitigatory in nature. That is to say that we have appeals, that is to say we have checks and balances that did not want to recognize the severity of racism in this status quo. We think it's abhorrent that they would choose to ignore the stories of human suffering because they chose not to engage with our model. I'll make it very clear in this debate"

That it would be consisting of criminal justice technocrats who are tasked with an objective metric of wanting to reduce recidivism. The reason why this is important is because it is categorically different from judges who are subject to their inherent biases and their inherent metrics and personalized interpretations of the law. Because now, when we have an objective metric that says you need to get the rates of recidivism down by 10%, that means objectively that they have to use rehabilitation as the model to overcome that, because it is the proven model to ensuring that recidivism goes down. That is what is effective. We said, moreover, that this would be one in which could be continually improved and we could have the sorts of reforms. I do not mind it is so hard to change an algorithm. We constantly do it already in the status quo. What did they say?"

Even if we take them on the very best case scenario and they root out racism, they still do not take into consideration all the multitude of the pool. But here's the thing, even if we take them on the very best case scenario and they root out racism, they still do not take into consideration all the multitude of subjective interpretations of the law we told you about. So they still have to deal with undermining equality before the law because some judges choose to overpunish, some choose to underpunish, and all the harms before you about aggravating factors. They just had a simple response. Look guys, the statistics is still racist. If that's the case, I think the harm is symmetrical. But we told you it's not. Because our algorithm is specifically tailored to occur for this racism. They said that, look, the use of technology leads to disillusionment."

              "text": "We told you since second, that trust for algorithms is far greater than humans. In the same way that the state has failed them, now they will think human judges who are fallible will fail them. It's a far harder challenge and algorithm that has been objectively programmed to lower recidivist rates. That's why the outrage and this lack of trust only happens in a world with instances such as the uproar caused by Brock Turner, the uproar caused by George Zimmerman. They told us, look guys, we have checks and balances such as appeals. We already told you, appeals are insufficient, they look guys, we have checks and balances such as appeals. We already told you appeals are insufficient, they're expensive, and the poor and minorities often cannot access these structures. We say that's bad. We furthermore told you why rehabilitation is exclusive to proposition because human judges in the status quo are overly punitive because of society's view on criminals. That's why we have a 60% recidivism rate in the United States. But secondly, on justice, racism, and heron biases, the main claim coming from them is that customized justice can only be delivered by human judges. This did not at all engage with what, firstly, we told you, that we don't have a finite set of metrics for the computer to compute. So the computer can compute those differences. So even though two black men committed the same crime, we told you their financial record would be a mitigating factor and we can still take this into consideration. We told you we can still have clinical psychologists compute this information in and thereby have an equal weighing of all these metrics, where on their side of the house, a racist judge might use racism and the race as the sole metric to determining their sentence. We told you about why the vast subjectivity of decisions human judges guarantee that circumstantial justice isn't accurately administered. Because what is just in the eyes of the judge may not be what's just in the eyes of the victim. We told you systematically that human fallibility was one that currently poisoned the justice system. For all those reasons, we think it's principally abhorrent of opposition to recognize that racism exists and not do anything to curb its flaws and its damages in the status quo we're so proud to propose"

Let's take an example of drug possession. A human judge is more likely to be pressured by the societal norms and the environment of drug dealers, the political environment surrounding drugs, harsher retribution than people who commit far more violent crimes.

              "text": "Three, why just the criminal sentencing decisions part of the justice system and not the entire justice system, right? We tell you the justice system is mainly made up of major parts conviction and sentencing you're okay with human judgment being a part of the conviction process but not the sentencing process say this because when a criminal is yet to be convicted there are a lot of things that go into this that process things such as police investigations and trials these processes have their own policies and regulations that make them as fair and just and effective as possible the whole trial process has a lot of people involved. It's a jury, lawyers and judges. It is a much more inefficient process because it is much harder to influence or sway so many people at once compared to if it is just one or two people, right? But when a criminal is being sentenced, the system starts to become inefficient. Because there's usually two judges involved, or sometimes just one. But when it comes to primary court, it's just one human being that's why it's criminal. So they can be super inefficient in the process. So the point is, couldn't in any way be taken away from the trial process, right? Human retrial and reopening cases become irrelevant because we're only talking about sentences today. How will our mechanism work, right? What info will we put into these algorithms? One, the rule of law. We tell you that statutes and ordinances of that country's legal system will be put in as information we tell you that we're better able to mitigate the circumstances right but we're able to cater to things such as whether a criminal should get a minimum or maximum sentence no matter how different the circumstances of a crime are the rule of law on those circumstances will always be the same to evidence enhance and criminal history of the conduct how. How will this work? It will work by combining large amounts of data with fast processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from practical features in the data. It will work through commands and by finding a pattern of correlation in the data it's been fit. But what is even more unique about it is that it is also good at picking up causation patterns in the data, something a human judge cannot do without falling victim to perceptions and biases. So it is good at identifying the two main principles of a crime, what caused the crime, and are there any correlating patterns in the circumstances of this crime with the law or the evidence, and then use all the data to give out a sentence. Another thing we tell you about computer algorithms is that we're able to score and process so much more information than a human because a human's brain can only score so much information. But additionally, we learn through machine learning machine learning over time they're able to better understand and adapt to the political climate or changing societal trends and norms they're even better able to adapt or make changes to things society bias and discrimination being human is our best attribute but it is also our worst attribute we're susceptible to perception supposed to be their. It all affects us as explained in the problem statement. Humans have emotions which play a role when it comes to making certain decisions. These emotions are exactly what we don't need when making criminal sentencing decisions. We can't pretend that black men are not facing harsher punishments in America than white men. We can't pretend drug dealers are spending longer time in jail than third-degree murderers. We can't pretend that men who work in the law have not been able to get off the hook for crimes simply because they work within the system. These elements are not as a computer algorithm for a far more effective justice system. But before I go any further, I'll take your POI. Are you going to use such algorithms pre-criminal sentencing, i.e., are you going to use algorithms to determine whether the... No, I just explained that not pre-criminal sentencing, not during the conviction process, only during the criminal sentencing decision. Part of the justice system. Two, time. We tell you that because of how widespread crime is in societies and communities, we find that usually... ...why sentencing decisions in terms of dates are not swift. This stops the effective working justices. Cases are dragged on and on. We tell you that this is detrimental to the administration of justice, makes it not effective because workers are overwhelmed with the number of cases that need to be tried and then sentenced. It also means that sometimes criminals who are flight risk or criminals who are waiting to be tested after being tried without bail have to spend an unnecessary amount of time in jail waiting for the sentencing to be scheduled, which at times takes even around three to four months. So in these instances, a judge who would take a longer amount of time would be eliminated from this situation, while a computer algorithm would be much faster and fairness. We tell you that when computer algorithms are used, even when a criminal opts to appeal to a higher court or to a different court hopes that his sentence will be reduced because another judge may fall victim to his emotions, the algorithm will give the same sentence because there'll be an equal and fair metric for sentencing. We tell you dispassion is the very essence of justice and justice without dispassion is always at risk of not being. Thank you."

Only then will the lawsuits be filed. B improving the selection process of judges and enforcing strict clause regarding grace judgment i.e. suspending judges in cases of bias detected by the supervising committee. We would like also to note that judges have as well an incentive to protect their reputation and keep their jobs. So it's more likely that they are going to be adhering to what these strict laws tell them and what these supervising committees tell them. C, selecting diverse panels, i.e. judges who come from different backgrounds. So different contextualization and perspectives can be proposed during solving complex cases.

Secondly, the unique role of human judges, which will be addressed in Alma's speech. Now, before I move on to delivering my stanza, I'll be responding to what the team on the other side of the house has mentioned so far in this debate, which was extremely wishy-washy. We asked them in a POI, are they going to use such algorithms pre-criminal sentencing? No, thank you. I.e. if algorithms are also going to be used in determining whether this person is guilty or innocent. They said no only in sentencing. Well, they tell us that the human judgment is biased. This means that the pre-sentencing will also be faulty and will also be biased. They never saw this on their side of the house. On our side of the house, we fixed this problem from its roots, meaning we do not send innocent people to jail. They do that, and that's quite problematic. I mean, if their model that the whole case was, they based their whole case on this model is very implausible and has a lot of loopholes. I don't think that they're in a place to solve the problem in the first place. On their model further, I never get what their model is really about because it was quite implausible. What exactly are these guidelines? Why is this model exclusive to their side of the house? And why not setting guidelines to human judges as well? They never explained to us the exclusiveness of their solution. They come up and tell us, oh, the human judgment is so bad and suddenly tell us that the algorithm would be the solution. They never gave us one example of a successful algorithm. And actually, this is quite problematic because I don't think that works in real life at all. And there is a gap of links between what this team on the other side of the house tells us. Now I have one more refutation, but it will be integrated in my argument. Moving on to our first argument, I'm going to prove two things in this argument. Firstly, how using computer algorithms is very harmful. Secondly, how human judgment can be replaced and our approach is justified. First point, using computer algorithm is very harmful. But before I move on to explain it, I'll take a P.O.I. Can you please make it clear how your system is going to work? Who will be responsible for this system? How will the system look like? What principles are you trying to fulfill? And like lawsuits already exist. Tell us how your lawsuits are going to Thank you. Thank you. I literally spent one minute explaining our model. If you listen to it, I bet you would be able to. Basically, it is about filing lawsuits, it's about enforcing strict laws to the judges, and it is about actually forming panels they care about their jobs. Now, our argument, using computer algorithms is very harmful for three main reasons. One, algorithms can be biased, and this is directly clashing with what the team on the other side of the house has mentioned. Even if a variable such as race is taken out of the sentencing algorithm, the system could still cluster a seemingly random group of people on the basis of other signs, such as place of residence or IP address, which would point to the same minority groups. Also, take the example of Compass, an American algorithm that was used to only help judges. An investigation was published, and it unraveled that the algorithm was biased towards Africans and Americans. Now, imagine how the harms will be multiplied if it completely replaced human judgment."

              "text": "Notice that on our side of the house, there are biased judges and non-biased judges, which means that some bias can happen. And we told you that because it's hard to get rid of this bias by our mechanisms, whereas on the other side of the house, one biased algorithm will always remain biased. So basically taking them on their best case, even if bias exists on our side of the house, it is much lesser than the bias that occurs on their side of the house. Reducing bias is exclusive to our case because, for instance, you can't file a lawsuit against a judge who is biased, which means that bias can be minimized on our side of the house. But it's never possible to file a lawsuit against an algorithm. I'd like to further elaborate on a thing that they never mentioned in their model. They never tell us who designed this algorithm. They never tell us from where this algorithm comes from. If the designers of this algorithm themselves were biased, the bias remains on their side of the house. We are the ones who actually make contributions to removing bias and reducing it significantly. But secondly, though, even if this is not the case, an algorithm can accurately calculate possibilities because it can take into consideration the unique variables of each situation. This is quite problematic because we are generalizing a single algorithm to solve every given case, which will eventually lead to bias as well. But thirdly, though, the way algorithms work is very vague. This is because algorithms are hackable. No matter how strong they get, studies prove that machines are now hackable. This will incentivize murderers or gangs to hire top hackers that can infiltrate the machines and change its behaviors, which will result in a highly unfair approach that will again increase the risks deemed to society. What is the impact of the previous reasons? The solution that this other side of the house proposes is more harm than good because more biased and faulty decisions will be made. Many vulnerable people will be sentenced much longer than they deserve and many innocent people will be sentenced much lesser than they deserve and this will lead to an unfair criminal justice system. Their approach won't solve the flaws that already exist in the criminal justice system but it will also worsen things up. Which brings me to my second question which is about system. Their approach won't solve the flaws that already exist in the criminal justice system, but it will also worsen things up. Which brings me to my second question, which is about why is our solution justified and exclusive? Two reasons. One, human judges can't consider more factors than algorithms like mental stability of the convict when sentencing. This means they do know when rehabilitation should be considered as a go-to choice. Secondly, human judges can understand the offender's intent. Take the example of a person lying about their home address to get their children into a better school district. We think that these cases need a human mind to understand them, to understand the person's position. Did this person genuinely want to"

What system will this work, right? Because we understand now there is accountability towards judges, but these problems still do exist. What kind of mutual accountability are they going to bring in this system to prove that judges are going to be effective in sentencing, right? Who will choose these judges? How will the system of convicting these judges or suspending them look like? And what principles are they trying to achieve, right?

Because at most instances, even the minor judges are usually few in a society to prove or to necessarily provide justice to those minorities who are constantly oppressed, who tell you that their model does not work because most of their model is just what happens in certain schools, but using different words, you think, tell us why it's really exclusive, right, to our model."

We tell you that. These systems will be inputted by something that is impartial, which necessarily make them impartial in the first place.

The first point of analysis is computer AIs are oftentimes reliable than human judgment. This comes under two points of analysis then, right? You need to understand in the status quo, where human judgment besides sentencing of different individuals, there are certain flaws and inevitable circumstances and variables which supposedly make it unreliable, right? Understand that the current system has those justice value like integrity and social equity, which loses the whole point of why we have a justice system. In our first speech, we have told you how effective justice is going to be served when the system is going to be implemented. Here, I'm going to show you how the system is going to be unreliable in the first analysis of corruption. Understand that. On the basis of how the system works, corruption is highly going to be mitigated. Understand that computerized systems, which are oftentimes transparent, have the least of ability to be manipulated in comparison to relying on a human being, which is most time greedy and unfulfilling, and even such an instance as nepotism on some interests. I think humane factors, which tend to exist in an impartial system like justice makes it such that proper liability is not going to be attained. We'll tell you that we're more likely to depend on a system which is transparent and has an impartial system which is inputted to it to bring final justice and integrity. I do think trust is likely going to happen in our society more. I think this has been proven when the machine of risk assessments was tested in Munch's concierge, which proves that, you see, integrity is likely going to be highly influenced by the system, especially if it's transparent, and that is something that we likely, likely stand. Second point of analysis. Reliability in terms of perception and bias will be at the panel. Understand, in most instances, the justice system is oftentimes filled with perceptive judgments, which sometimes are not necessarily effective to bring good and precise sentences, right? Understand that even in conviction, some individuals can be given harsher sentences with regard of their color, or sometimes you find a Black individual who committed a non-violent crime given a harsher sentence than an individual who committed a violent crime, which is white in society. And a very good example of this is what happened in Compton when a black individual even if he had like certain identical circumstances were given a harsher sentence than a white person all this happens because of the biased perception which exists in human beings which can only be solved when an impartial body is coming to replace you think law is impartial but implementation is unjust and we tell you that implementation can only be just when you have law inputted in systems that can be just. Justice comes with an impartiality that can only be achieved when effectiveness of non-bias is improved in this machine. And that is why we tell you that law, that is really law. Crime and evidences are likely going to be things that are going to be inputted in this machine to be effective. Yes, POI."

In most instances, the central justice system is often filled with perceptive judgments, which sometimes are not necessarily effective to bring good and precise sentencing, right? Understand that even if conviction of some individuals can be given harsher sentences, even if it has identical circumstances. Understand in Copleton, a person, a white person who had the same similar circumstances in terms of police brutality was given less black person which had less police brutality. You think this is something which already proves how biasness and perception already exist in a society, right? All that happens in terms of bias and perception which exists within human beings can only be solved when you have an impartial body implemented. Law is impartial, but its implementation is unjust. We tell you that implementation can be unjust only if we have something that is likely going to be impartial or more of like partiality existing. We tell you justice comes with impartiality, which can only be achieved when effective and non-biased information is inputted within machine.

We tell you that we are more likely to eradicate trade secrecy, which is likely going to exist when they argue this machine will have trade secrecy.

Do you think that a black box algorithm is better than a transparent judge while serving his judgment? Okay, I understand that. How these machines work isn't necessarily rocket science, right? How this machine makes decisions comes with justifications on why these decisions are made on a particular way. You think these sorts of AI even give more clear and more effective justifications to why certain cases have been sentenced in a certain way. We think this type of transparency, which is likely going to not exist in terms of bias and its impartiality information and input in it, we think it's more effective than a human being is likely going to not exist in terms of bias and its impartiality information and input.

An African-American judge is less likely to be biased towards an African-American person.

They had no idea how their model happens. First of all, they say it will be based on rules. We have two circumstances. Either they are based on rules, and we tell you you have no rules, you have no general guidelines that are capable of determining every single case. That is why we have human judges in the first place, because there are no general rules that are capable to encompass every single case. You can't have rules. And second of all, if it was based on former patterns, former bias, you are continuing the biases I've already explained. Second of all even if it was based on former patterns former bias you are continuing the biases i've already explained second of all they said that security systems can't be hacked that is completely false i tell you the u.s army military itself was hacked at the beginning of this year and you tell me that a simple uh sentencing algorithm can't be hacked and then they started by talking about speed they said that uh in their first speech they said that their side is faster however we tell you that our side is more accurate. We think that the accuracy in our case has a greater depth of impact than their speed. Judge, tell me, which do you prefer? Do you prefer to be sentenced quickly or do you prefer to be sentenced correctly and accurately? The first point was the fourth of trust and transparency. They said that people won't be, they trust more of more trusting towards an algorithm because algorithms give clear justifications so you're telling me the computer that sentenced me is supposed to come up to me and tell me I sentenced you because that that that how is this going to happen? They give no analysis and second of all I tell you how are they supposed to trust the algorithm if they don't trust the people who made it and the third of all even if they did, people don't trust things that they don't understand, if they don't trust the people who made it and the third of all and and the third of all even if they did people don't trust things that they don't understand if they don't understand how this algorithm is made they're not going to trust it um before i move on to my substantive i'll take your points quickly please i can't hear you in an instance where we would allow for the prosecution to be included in the system, would you allow for the proposition to pass?

              "text": "My second argument is about the role of humans in courts. In my argument, I'll be showing you all the negative effects of increased dependence on automation in courts. Using an algorithm to decide the final ruling on criminal sentencing raises questions about the validity of those rulings that were after all decided by a program and a series of mathematical analysis. My first speaker showed you why algorithms can't always make valid sentences because of the many concepts that can't be included in their formula and can't be calculated, things like incentive need, etc. In my argument, I'll be taking them on their very best scenario that algorithms were found successful, which we proved wasn't true. But even if it was, I'll be showing you how the motion would be allowing technology to take over with unintended consequences and how all of this leads to removing accountability in court. Law is based on ethics and morality, which humans have but aren't by machines. So you would be implying that algorithms are better than humans in ethics and morality, which is the one thing that sets humans apart from machines. Not only that, if you think they are more efficient in sentencing first, then what? Then they're more efficient in convicting. And finally, every other task that humans are required in, you would be increasing your dependence on machines. So why is this bad? Because machines in the end have the capacity to malfunction or behave in unpredictable ways. As with all forms of technology, this can lead to unintended consequences that may go far beyond anything the designers ever envisioned. Take the 2010 flash crash of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. The action of algorithms helped create the index's single biggest decline in its history, wiping nearly 9% of its value in minutes. But the algorithm that amplified the problem didn't make a mistake. They followed their own logic in a way that created a downward spiral for the market. Now, imagine such a situation in court, this time with an increased dependence on automation and literally deciding the fate of a human life. It isn't the stock market that is at stake here, panel. It is the possible mistaken sentencing of a human. I tell you, even if they are partially able of solving issues of bias, they come with unintended risks that can't be accounted for. While on our side, we begin solving the issue by reducing bias and allowing judges to be held accountable for their actions because you can actually sue this judge. We give you an exclusive solution that does not come with future implications. Second of all, before I move on, I'll take your point quickly, please. Ma'am, in an instance, we're allowing... Can somebody else ask a point, please? Ma'am, in an instance where we allow the sentencing- Can somebody else ask the point please? I can't hear you. I'm really sorry, I really can't hear you."

In our world, judges maintain autonomy in sentencing, thus any mistakes would be held onto them. They can be held accountable for any mistake in the sentence. Why is accountability important? Because it prevents having a program as a scapegoat for bias and systemic discrimination. On your side of the house, a programmer can be biased in their own program. And then people would tell the defendant that, oh, you were sentenced by an algorithm. Since an algorithm can't be biased, your sentence must be true. That way, the system on which an algorithm is sentencing is biased in itself. But since you were sentenced by an algorithm, it definitely must be fair. What does this do? It does not allow the case to be revisited. On our side, a case can be revisited because a program would give you the same output again and again. So you can't actually revisit the case. In our world, you can change judges. You can be trialed by another set. You can file an appeal. So what is the impact? In their world, systemic injustices remain. Those poorly judged by a mistake of calculating have no other way to get the justice they deserve. Human judges should retain their place as the final arbiters at the apex of any legal system. In practical terms, humans should ultimately choose what they consider a morally superior interpretation, proud to oppose."

Their debate is very small. Their debate is not very wide, and it's not very, like, what's it called? It's not like they're being brave with what they're saying. Also, they don't solve anything significant on their side of the house. Really, they just try to say that we would make it stricter and we'd hope that people follow and fall in line. Not only that, but their case isn't particularly compelling either. It's not like they have any clear justification. Furthermore, it's just status quo with extra steps. So if we were to try putting this on a widespread belief, we don't see this working in many other countries. If you were to tell a judge to be stricter, that just means people pay more money to the judge. Do you understand how your side of the house does not work? And they would still have to follow, and they would still have issues such as corruption on their side of the house, right? They also come over here and they ask us very silly questions. So the first thing that we have to tell you is you can update an algorithm. At least that's a plausible, what's it called? They tell us things like a programmer could be biased. What if the programmer is supposed to be biased? We tell you, no, that isn't actually a real issue because the programming is based off the laws. So if it is biased, then the laws are biased. Like we said, we would follow a set of rules. The rules that we were talking about in that instance were obviously the laws and the constitution of the country, but yet they come over here with a curb to say, no, it's not a brave idea. What is the possibility of it being hacked which my second speaker actually talked about in to some decree because this is not this database right this is an algorithm it's like a math question how do you hack a math question that is something that we have to pose to side to side opposition because they don't really think about what they're saying when they're saying this stuff they see some other very crazy things like, you know, algorithms can't calculate incentives. But this, this singular statement that came up from the second speaker is the debate itself, an incentive. That is the issue. On our side of the house, the one thing that we want to have is free, fair judgment, judgment that is universal, judgment that cannot be bent. We would be the key administrators of all this judging of people. On their side of the house, they come and make the concession in their second speak and say, you know, algorithms can't calculate incentives. Do you understand the audacity of saying that? What they're essentially saying when they say an algorithm can't calculate incentives is they're saying that an algorithm doesn't understand when it should let a case slide. That is the issue on our side of the house. The potential ability for people to literally bend the laws, the constitution of the government to make it favor them. That is the issue on our side of the house. But yet, we still have to talk about this debate."

See, an issue and a side clash of this point is the idea that side opposition bring in this debate. Side opposition take a very long amount of time saying there are other external factors that a judge could look at. But at the end of the day, the one thing that matters most in sentencing is evidence. On our side of the house, the only thing that we care about is the evidence that was shown when a murder was committed. When we look at the evidence, we don't care about all the oppression that was faced by this 15-year-old child. We look at the evidence. Because at the end of the day, the difference between the last 24 hours and the last 15 years of that child was that in our system, he becomes a cold-blooded murderer after 24 hours. That is an issue that we do not stand for. We do not let people slide based off the certain differences that they had in their upbringing or maybe their financial background because that is unfair to everyone else. That is unfair to the same person that probably drove someone over and had a lesser time because he was drunk. That is unfair under all circumstances. And it's something that we can't advocate. But yet we also have to understand that the current status quo is more trial and error more than everything.

Now, with less than a minute left of my speech, I want to talk about the differences of the two worlds. Let's look at our worst-case scenario and their best-case scenario. On our worst-case scenario, you could potentially be hacked. On our worst case scenario, you could potentially be hacked. On our worst case scenario, only judges know about simple psychology. Thus, the judges can make the best call because the judges know what it's like to show remorse. On their best case scenario, there is still nepotism, there is still bribery, there's still political influence, and there's no guarantee of no bias. At least we can guarantee on our side of the house that we're being free and fair towards all parties, something that side prop opposition not once proved to us how they can do well. That being driven, that being drawn, we should look at this comparison. On our side of the house, the only things that they can complain about is the potential ability to hack and how judges can show remorse, to which we say, not only is it completely inaccurate that you can hack an algorithm, but furthermore, we don't care about the background information because the only thing that should matter when you are sentencing somebody, a criminal, is the evidence that has been pitted against them. That is something that we've made very clear across our past two speeches. And that is why we have to put a pressure on third opposition speaker to come and clear these questions and make us understand.

But the main problem with this is that they are doing this too late. What we heard today from Team Tanzania was a lot of claims without any real-life example, without any mechanism, without explaining how the world looked like. They wanted us to have a clear analysis on who our panel will be when they had zero analysis on who provides the algorithm, who puts the inputs, and how it works. So proud to oppose. In my speech, I'll be circulating around two main questions, in which I will be including all the clashes that happened in today's debate. So, onto the first question, can algorithms solve the existing problem? So, we think this is wildly important, since the only main argument, side proposition had today was that algorithms are needed because firstly, human judges are racist and human judges are corrupt. As long as we prove algorithms cannot solve this and we can solve judges' problems, we win today. Now, what we heard from them under the efficiency of algorithms. Firstly heard we heard that algorithms will only be used in sentencing i.e the last uh the last step in convicting someone so uh firstly we have a clear response for this that we gave you which is this has zero impact in today's debate why is this firstly because if judges were really biased to the extent they are saying it which means the conflict itself might be biased so that black man they are trying the extent they are saying it which means the conflict itself might be biased so that black man they are trying to defend they are trying to give him five years instead of 15 years will be will also still be sentencedly wrong because maybe for maybe for example he doesn't deserve to go to jail in the first place this is the problem with their situation they can't solve the roots of the problem but firstly sorry secondly we we think that the people who are giving the algorithms the input might still be uh might still be giving it uh wrong uh wrong or biased information although uh so although not here that we heard no clear analysis from them on how their algorithm will work so how do we solve this we solve this problem from a truth with having a mechanism that helps us have qualified judges under strict laws in which we will be prosecuting them if they did anything wrong. So we solve the problem from its truth."

In their first speech, they literally told us that algorithms are machine learning AI technology. But their first speech, they literally told us that algorithms are machine learning AI technology. But on their third, they gave up this total thing and they said that algorithms follow only rules and laws. They abandoned their case when they did so. They cannot decide how algorithms work. They cannot decide if they are machine learning or they only abide specific laws. They lost this point. So this is exclusively problematic because it means that they will mainly rely on previous information when deciding the sentence, which means that bias will still exist because when an algorithm takes into consideration factors like someone's neighborhood, someone's socioeconomic situation, when deciding the recidivism rate of this particular person, this means that bias will still be linked in the algorithm, even if factors like race weren't inside the algorithm itself. That's why we think they cannot solve the bias problem. Now, finally, they said that algorithms are transparent, thus they are better. Firstly, we never get any single reason why do they care so much about transparency. But furthermore, we do care about it because we think that without transparency, people will have a clear backlash towards the justice system, which will only happen in their world because they will be given a black box algorithm, which even its engineers don't know how to solve it. And we ask them that in a POI, which with no clear response or explanation on how they will solve this problem. So they will be giving a black box algorithm that, like that's not logically how it works, the chance to be sentencing all people. We think that this doesn't lead to transparency, but on the other side of the house, it will go to backlash. But further, we think that even if they had a transparency, it's not inclusive to their side of the house, it will go to backlash. But further we think that even if they had a transparency, it's not inclusive to their side of the house because we have more transparency with judges that can have a clear reason, that can understand the human incentive and so. Now, so clearly algorithms wouldn't have any additional benefits on their world. Before I move on to proving on how we can solve the bias problem, I'll take a point. So in your provision of justice, are you likely to depend on a system which has impartial variables or biased views? Thank you. I will just be elaborating now on how we wouldn't be having biased views. Why is this? So our world doesn't have biased views as you are trying to say. I refuse to answer this question because it's not the world. It's not our world. So how do we have less bias?"

Firstly, because now in the current situation, we can see that social movements are on the rise and have a very huge impact on all spectrums. What this has to do with today's case, this means that judges are under direct evaluations from all people around them. So they will not, and since they care about their reputation, they're less likely to take biased decisions that will harm their reputation. So judges care about their reputation, they're less likely to take biased decisions that will harm their reputation. So judges care about their reputation, thus they will be less likely to take biased decisions. But secondly, we told you that we will be forcing severe punishments on them. This means that we will have, this means that federal prosecutors will actually exist to follow judges and file lawsuits against them uh to like or like uh like see how they work we think that this works uh we think that uh we can minimize the bias they have in our side of the house because we can have persecution uh against them but finally because uh because even if this was true in our side of the house people can revisit the case people can reopen the case uh they can remove the judge they can do a lot of stuff that can't be done on their side of the house because algorithms will be only taken to be true all the time so they can't reopen the case and they can't have an appeal while we can so we give people the voice to fight back if they were even faced with uh if they were faced with uh like bias in the first place.

Now, secondly, why is a human factor, why is a human factor needed and who has a more stable impact? So we all are, so we already elaborated on our mechanism in each speech. Still, they, they, they, like they had all Still, they only had hypothetical questions about this rather than directly clashing with it. So we told you that you will be imposing severe punishments on these judges who break the law. Thus, we think that this is very important in reducing problems like corruption or so because they care about being a judge. They care about having high-profile cases. They care about their reputation. So when they have the choice to be biased, corrupt, or they are to be respected, we think that they're going with that because they will be prosecuted. But further, we don't think why this is exclusive on our side of the house. So, for example, if someone can bribe a judge why can't they uh why can't they bribe the programmer in the first place we don't see how they first solve that on their side of the house so their impacts can only be seen in the short term and in the near future they can't have any stable uh long-term impact while we do because it will only take people some time to to decide some time to see how algorithms don't work clearly. And as the chair said today, technology is not always helpful. Never been so proud to oppose it. Time. Thank you very much. Take a moment. Okay, reminder that reply speeches are four minutes and they are all protected. So I would like to invite the opposition reply speaker to present and conclude the case for the opposition. I just need a second. Okay. Thank you. Okay, am I audible? You are. Great."

              "text": "My speech starts in three, two, one. Team proposition is expected to provide a clear model in today's debate. They provided us with zero mechanism on how these algorithms are going to work. What variables do these algorithms include when sentencing the convict? Why is their solution exclusive and that we can't improve the criminal justice system on our side of the house? Who designed these algorithms? Was this approach implemented before anywhere in the world? So many questions that were unanswered by the team on the other side of the house. The only thing they actually tell us, oh, that's unnecessary. How is it unnecessary when your entire case is based on this model? We tell you that from the very beginning of today's debate, Team Tanzania lost it. Panel, we had a clear burden, which is paving the way into creating a fairer criminal justice system. We believe that we proved that throughout our speeches. On our side of the house, on the other side of the house, we don't really know where they are going with their case because they do not clearly address the problem that they want to solve, nor set a burden that they have to achieve. Team Proposition provided us with a very wishy-washy case in today's debate, whereas on our side of the house, we told you that we guarantee judges are going to stick to our model, stick to these stricter laws because they also care about their reputation. They care about keeping their jobs as well. Zero engaging with this idea. With that in mind, I have one question to ask in this speech. Who creates a fair criminal justice system and reduce bias? We ask them clearly in a POI. If you care so much about getting rid of bias in the criminal justice system, especially in sentencing, why is it that you keep judges decide whether the person is guilty or innocent, knowing that the current system is biased. We received no actual engagement with this idea. Comparing both sides of the house, ours solved the problem from its roots, whereas on their side of the house, more innocent people are going to be sent falsely to jail. But secondly, they gave us this ridiculous example on how they serve justice by sentencing a juvenile and 15 years old according to their crimes. And that is the only important thing in a sentence should be the evidence. Whereas we tell you that firstly, they do not realize how this is harmful for these people. Because we tell you we actually sentence these people in a proportionate way to their crime and we look at their incentive because secondly an algorithm can't really differentiate between whether this person stole out of need and whether this person killed someone because they wanted to defend themselves they never engage with this they tell us that oh both should be sentenced the same, which is extremely harmful to their side of the house. We tell you we actually sentence people according to what they did, and we look to the circumstances that are related to the crime. We never punish someone knowing that their incentive was we never punish someone harshly knowing that their incentive was only to defend themselves, for example. On our side of the house, with our mechanism, we get everyone to be punished in a proportionate way to what they did. We also allow the vulnerable people and the ones who are mentally unstable to seek rehabilitation and other forms of support. Whereas on their side of the house, this is non-existent because they clearly said that in their third speech, that the only thing they care about is evidence, which is completely immoral by all means. I tell you, for all these reasons, I beg you to oppose. Thank you very much."

We tell you that this is the case because one, sentences are given out largely by one or two judges, one or two people who are so much more likely to be ineffective in all of the four problems that we mentioned to you in my first speech. Compared to the conviction process, we're a jury of two individuals who are much harder to sway, thus all the other processes that go into the conviction process, right? Things such as police investigations, forensic reports, and trials, which are all governed by their own regulations to make them as effective as they can be. So I think at this point, I was raised in the debate"

They bring to the table a counter system that is basically just a failing representation of the current status quo, right? They tell us that, one, we will allow people to file lawsuits. We tell you, these already exist. How will their suits be uniquely different? Two, they tell us, oh, we'll improve the selection process of judges and apprehend these judges for wrongful convictions. They give us no analysis on how to make sure that this happens, how judges who work within the system, judges who never, ever, ever get punished for wrongful convictions will actually be jailed on their side they simply measure their mechanism by no analysis on how their mechanism actually works and then claim that i we didn't explain our mechanism when i think i spent around five minutes and 30 seconds just explaining to you how our mechanism will work right but rather tell us number three we will select diverse judges and panels give us no analysis on how they will get enough black lawyers in a country like America, where black police are being shot for being asleep in their homes. We tell you that all of the policies that they bring to the table already exist in the status quo.

Now let's look at what we brought to the table. We bring to you a system that addresses all of the problems I gave out in my first speech. Problems that the opposition doesn't account to. Problems such as discrepancies of sentencing for criminals under identical criminal evidence and circumstances, harsher and longer punishments for nonviolent crimes, elitist sentencing, racial bias. The only rebuttal they bring to the table to the system is one, if you use previous decisions and patterns, then you perpetuate bias. When in my speech did I say we would use previous data? Three things we said we would input into these algorithms would be one, the rule of law, two, evidence at hand, and three, criminal history of the person. And yet they seem to be really zeroing in on this piece of information that we will use previous data, which makes our system biased, right? They accuse us of not telling them how our system will work, but rather, I think I sent about two minutes explaining to you how these systems would work. I told you about how machine learning works, causation and correlation. We tell you that this is the only effective way of administering justice because it eliminates things such as gender and racial bias. It eliminates things such as being influenced by money and popularity, by being influenced by things such as societal and political pressures, things that are exclusively present in human beings but not in computer algorithms, right? We tell you that people have to spend time in jail without bail. People have to spend weeks and weeks waiting for the sentencing to be scheduled simply because of the fact that human judges cannot process so much information and it takes too long to schedule a sentence. They tell us, oh, we don't care if it takes so long as long as it is fair and correct but no analysis on how these systems that they have implemented will make sure that these sentencing is fair and correct here we tell you that when people appear different words sentences aren't standardized so two judges may give out two different sentences something that does not happen on our side because of the fact that we have standardized standardized punishments for crimes that have been committed under identical circumstances. We lose this debate because they don't give us exclusive analysis on how all four problems we give you are solved on their side. Thank you."

We can see that today, 33% more respondents in the poll describe white people as intelligent than they did black people. As a result of this preset set of beliefs, people have biases, and their jury judges are people. You can see here an example of the USCC report where black male offenders received sentences on an average 19.1% longer than similarly situated white offenders. This unfair sentencing is made possible by having a non-identified unified criteria for sentencing, and secondly, giving the judges the freedom to adjust sentences at their own intuition."

And secondly, it takes two factors in consideration, which is firstly, the information about the crime the defender is trying to convict it of. And secondly, the previous criminal record of the defender. Now, I would now note the severity of the criminal record will be crucial because this means that if you steal something worth 50 euros three times, you will be charged the same sentence every time. But if you start, for example, with pedicabs and progress to armed robbery or violence, your sentence will certainly increase. Based on this information, the algorithm will calculate the risk of recidivism. Secondly, whether you need rehabilitation and for how long you will be getting it. And thirdly, what kind of harm and how much harm have you done to the society? And based on this information, the sentence will be made to be appropriate for the crime. Now, I know that the side of opposition will most likely tell you that the accuracy of our algorithm will not be good, but we can see that today there is a trend for improving the accuracy of our algorithm will not be good, but we can see that today there is a trend for improving the accuracy of the data. For example, in April 2020, the best-case identification algorithm had an error rate of 0.08% compared to 4.1% for the leading algorithm in 2014. I'll be able to believe that simply this cannot happen with people because as I live, I gain information, and based on those information, I make my own opinions and make my own biases. And I tell you that certainly no one can come to me and erase a part of my memory in order to change my opinions, to change my biases. So the side of opposition needs to clearly say and prove to you why human judgment will always be better than algorithm. Well, we believe that this switch from human-based sentencing to algorithm sentencing is a natural transition in aim to make our justice system fair and fair, just like we've done in the past, just like we've changed justice system in the past to make it more fair."

Thirdly, for victims to be sure that the system is recognizing their suffering and actually giving them closure and a fourthly for people to simply have a trust in the system and provide them a feeling of safety. So let's take a look at why none of this is actually happening on the side of opposition. Why is the current system so imparsha?"

              "text": "This is happening because we are giving the judges so much power. Because judges are giving certain freedom in sentencing to further reduce the sentence if they decide to do so. This is called the downward departure invariance. This is the so-called holy human act, empathy, understanding, and so on. But the problem is that here is exactly where the racism and discrimination is happening. This is why we can see that black males receive a 21% less of this downward departure, and when they do, it's 17% shorter. Now, why do we believe the judges will never be able to be impartial? Firstly, because they have different sentencing criteria based on racism. And people who are wealthier, have a job, and even play golf in their free time are deemed more reliable and less likely to repeat a crime. But because of of structural racism, we can see that black people simply cannot get a stable job. They cannot get good education, and therefore, they're perceived as less reliable. This is the present ethnic and racial bias among judges. We have already explained this to you in the stand. Secondly, judges are biased. They're humans after all. They have their own problems, their own mood swings, ups and downs, and so on. We can see that the likelihood of a favorable judge spikes up to about 65% after the judges had lunch before, had a break for a meal or snack. So what I'm actually doing is I'm asking you, jury, would you like to stay in prison 20 years instead of 20 months because your judge didn't have an afternoon snack before your trial? So the third point about judges having more and more imprinted pictures of Black people as criminals, this is because every day they have trials. Every day they sentence Black people to longer sentences. And the more they perceive them as criminals, the bigger the sentences they give to them. They put them in a box. They put them in a box. They put them in a box of black people who have to be criminals because they're black. They're no longer looking at other factors such as employment, criminal record, and so on. And this is because they have their memory, and we can simply not just remove it like we can do as an AI. So to conclude, there are people and ethnicities that have an unfair advantage in criminal sentencing that cannot be changed differently. So what is the result of this? As the people are aware of discrimination, they are taking place in court, and they want a change of the system. For example, a poll in the US revealed that an overwhelming 92% want some sort of change in the civil justice system. Now, the impact of this is that innocent defendants are pleading guilty. They don't believe that they can prove their innocence. In the status quo, people simply don't go to trial because if they go to trial, they will get a bigger sentence, which is true."

The second thing that is happening is that victims don't get the closure they need. Unfairly reduced sentences to privilege groups don't only hurt our sense of justice.

All the important information that I have mentioned in my stance are put into the algorithm, and they show as a sentence. This means that there is no bias within the algorithm, and it can be checked and made sure multiple times by many people that it's fair. While we can never program humans to not be biased, we certainly can do this with algorithms, and this is exactly why we propose. Secondly, as already mentioned, algorithms have a trend of improvement in accuracy. For example, Compass, the leading algorithm in 2019, had 90% accuracy, while people had only 60% inaccuracy. And the third point, when deciding how much a person will spend in isolation, away from their family, away from the society, the government should make sure it is taking as much objective variables and factors as possible in order to make the sentence fair. And the AI as it is, is an objective factor. So if you do believe that justice is blind, and no matter what race you are, you should not be privileged or discriminated both for side purposes. Okay, I thank the speaker for their remarks. A reminder that to note the timer just so that everyone can be aware of when you're moving in and out of protected time, especially if we're not comping to signal that.

We just don't believe this is the way to do it. Now, we also have to say that it's getting better. So it's not the same as it was 70 years ago, 60 years ago, because homophobia, racism and other biases are less and less socially acceptable. And we as an opposition have a duty to prove, have a burden to prove, that number one, the justice system is already getting better organically. Second of all, this makes, this opposition makes the state of the problem even worse. And thirdly, that this goes against the idea of justice itself. Now, the first speaker has told us that details of the crime and the criminal record will be taken into the account. And we ask that this will inherently include race, economy, etc. because endangered people are systemically forced to commit crime more. Their neighborhoods are more policed, and they're more likely to get caught committing crimes. You're not solving the real problem. You're not solving the racism this way. So you can't ignore all those issues and factors really, and these people really are more likely to commit crimes again, but do they deserve greater punishments because they're a circumcised force to do so?"

And we think this is a bit of simplification because we have to see that some judges are biased. There is a bias in the justice system, but the judges are still trained professionals for their jobs. They're educated to have less biases. They're educated to support their own biases. And there's always a right to appeal. So in higher courts, there's three judges. In Supreme Court, there's nine judges. So bias decreases the more people you have in the system now the second way is that it's just not very more bias is that it's getting less and less prominent because social movements like LGBT movement Black Lives Matter and so on have been some some way the minorities are getting more aware of the situation they're in social media more media more internet transfer more transparency, more people educated and aware, more people in majority groups. Yes, I am fake BI. What do you say about the judges who simply said that they decided to give someone a longer sentence because they saw it in their eyes, which is a legit example that happened? Okay, yeah, thank you. We'll address that later, but... Okay, thank you. We'll address that later, but... Okay, yeah. We say there are some biased judges, but you can appeal, you can always have some higher authority over all that decision. So it can't stand.

So the first way you do it is a problematic history, and this directly clashes with their idea that AI is going to be more objective. Because input on the AI is based on previous cases. You can't make new cases and you have to train your AI some way. If there's a bias, in previous cases, AI will replicate it. Further back you go in history, there's more bias because people were more racist, more homophobic and so on. Further back you go, the more cases you have and the more accurate your system is. So there's always going to be that kind of trade-off. And blacks and men have historically been given harsher sentences for the same crimes and it will just be become replicated in the ai system and the second way is that ai is a black box and it's hard to challenge the ai's decisions because people don't understand this technology very well because even experts who make ais and computer scientists don't know what is it's a"

So, yeah yeah the third way is uh everything that happens before sentencing can there is a lot of flaws in there so before the sentencing you have the police investigator you have the grand jury indictment you have persecutors you have a jury making verdicts so all that can go wrong by solving this you don't by just changing the sentence in where you don't solve the problems. No, thank you. But you exacerbate that problem because now people will believe that AIs are more just and they will have no incentive to solve these previous problems. And the fourth way, this is in French as it is in Spanish, is that you can't have new penalty policies because you have already been to judges for example, 20 years after the foundation. You can't have new penalty policies because you have already been to judges, for example, 20 years after the coronation. You can't train with no new input cases and we're left with prison or fine or community service and that's it. So you can't implement the new policies because AI doesn't have anywhere to train from. And if we want to drastically increase or decrease punishments for some crime, prescribed punishments for some crime, AI will get confused because it's trained to give sentences based on previous cases in which, I don't know, for 150 years, there was a single range of sentences for murder, and if you want to change it, AI will know how to deal with that. Now, how this destroys the vision of justice, which is our second argument."

It's a social construct and everyone has their own vision of justice, so we take the average of all people. That's why we have representative democracy. That's why we have courts. That's why we have all that. So it's changeable through the generations, through the centuries, and through the cultures. And for example, death penalty, torture, and whipping were perfectly acceptable 200 years ago, but they're in no way acceptable now so how does this destroy the vision of justice the first way is that ai has no stake in society as opposed to judges because the judges are people they're they judge and they get judged by the people their actions so their vision is a reflection of communities vision of justice and the region can change alongside communities of justice and they have a stake in community and country and they have to think about how will they their decision if it them themselves any doesn't have that it doesn't have to live in society it creates it just spits out decisions and spits out output and that's all it does the second way is accountability you You have higher courts. You have higher court judges. Those decisions can be appealed. They can be challenged. You know, more agents deciding if you have more courts and more judges is more representation from the whole system. If the society doesn't agree as a whole, they can protest motions. They can protest sentences. They can do all that because laws and justice are societal consensus and we as a society have a duty and have a right to choose which laws are being applied to us. And if nobody in society thinks this law should be applied that way, it's justifiable to protest and rebel against that. So AI decision cannot be challenged in any way because it doesn't give, it doesn't care about what's going on inside the courtroom, it just spits out data and it can't be a field of a hard court. And third way, whom to trust. Because sometimes witnesses have contradictory statements. They have different angles, perception, memory, and so on. It just has to decide if there's some mistake in police work before that and whom to trust really. The witness's true story is the most real. And every human can change human errors according to that because AI doesn't really know how to trust or how much weight to give to each person's testimony and the fourth way that's usually justice is pleading and people are taking the innocent people too because people spend less time in prison than if convicted usually and this goes against the principle of justice that everyone can have a right to fair trial. Now, they're taking it because people are afraid of the outcome of the trial. So it will be even more clear because the AI, you can't know how it does things, or it can't advise you. So it's really, really going to exacerbate this problem with plea deals. Thank you. I thank the speaker for their remarks."

The fact is, you can't change this. And comparatively, AI will never have this. They have no incentive to have this sort of bias. Secondly, we can see that there is a pattern with these sort of judges, because if they have convicted in the past, unfortunately, more black people than white ones, people only confirm their bias further, and they will think that this is something that happens in the future. And thirdly, no matter how hard some industries try to convince us that there are robots who are in fact not human, it is a fact that no robot, no AI will ever sit in front of the TV and watch Law & Order where 50% of the criminals are black and minority gangs.

So plea deals, in your case, are still available, and they will still not come before the AIs. So they will still take a plea deal for a lesser crime so they can escape a prison sentence.

The details in the crime have to, in order for it to make an equal sentence, it has to take into account different crimes from the past in order to see what the sentences fit. Secondly, it has bias from the makers. Even if a diverse group of people makes this AI, it only gives it much more legitimacy. But in the end, there are still biases. You're talking only about race. Bias can mean anything. Bias can mean based on age, based on sex. You can have ageism as a bias, which can be a big, big problem. And those biases don't even have to be about race. They can be about the color of your shirt. And as the fact is that the IBM Watson who picked people with tattoos as the most likely to commit crimes is those who have committed crimes. And that has nothing to do with if they have actually committed crimes. Third thing, correlation versus casualty. As I have said that some things that can be accidents in two different cases can be, the AI will correlate it and it is nowhere near the same cause. It doesn't have to have any similarities and affect a different case. And the fourth point, you cannot pinpoint biases in the system before. So in the future, you will not be able to improve it since you have no way of pinpointing exact biases in exact cases. If we could do that, then a lot of crimes would be made clearly from the past.

We stand for seminars and we stand for education and we stand for more progress in a social environment. And you can still call them out, sue them and go to different courts, even if you don't agree with the sentence, you have a right to do that. You talked about plea deals. That is the fourth point. The plea deals that they won't go to trial because they'll get a bigger sentence in our case. But in your case, because you don't know how the AI is going to give you a sentence, you're scared that it will take into account some insane details that you don't even understand. And therefore, you're more likely to take accountability for a crime you didn't commit just so you wouldn't go to jail for a long time because you don't know how the AI works and what the sentence will be. When you have a judge, you can talk to him. You can try to make him understand you're not guilty or there were reasonable circumstances that he should take into account. You don't believe that the AI does those things, and you will take a plea deal even if you're not guilty or even if you shouldn't get that big sentence."

We think that it is extremely important that you have faith in the government, the police, the courts because they are the ones who make the rules and trust in them and when you trust them, you think you are equal. You believe that you want to pay taxes, you want to go to work, you want to have a family, you want to engage with the government because you have trust in them. But the public perception of this is different. Why are people scared of machines you don't understand it you're scared you're scared because you think they will take your job in the future that they will replace you a human can never process so much information so you cannot comprehend how they can process so much information and give a fair call you can physically see i can physically see a judge and I can see what their reaction is, but I cannot physically touch a robot. And the people who understand the machine's beliefs are more uneducated, which are the people who are most affected by these sentences. So now I'll take a question before I continue. What is your reply to our statistic from the first speech that there is a 2019 study that shows that human judges were right in 60% of cases, whereas the most famous algorithm today was right in 90% of cases? We are saying to you, we have proved to you how they are biased inherently. I will continue with my argument. Now, we have a situation where you don't understand the process because of the reasons I have explained to you. And they can lose trust in the government now because you can go into protests and boycott the judges when you think they have made the wrong decisions because you think that they can go to higher courts and then they can make a decision they can fire a judge now when an ai cannot uh when you can uh when you know that no matter what you do the decision will stay the same because an ai is the same system for all it's not a different judge you can go to if you think you have been a victim of bias you uh you there is no point in boycotting it because you have no insight in the process. And the impact of this is that people will never be able to make a social change when they think a wrong has been done. They will never see how the government is doing them a favor because they don't understand the machine. So what Maxim has said, we are entrenching the status quo, and this destroys the vision of justice, as well as people's perception is completely altered in this world, and let the motion fail."

So we have given judges greater freedom after this case. If we look how much longer sentences of blacks than whites were before this case, they were 5.5% longer. But if we look at it after the case, we see that this same number has risen to 19% longer sentences. This means that the more freedom we give to judges, the more racist"

It is not enough for you to say that other parts of technology are not developed when we see that this specific one is more than good. So they tell you the second problem on algorithms is that you cannot pinpoint what is happening. You cannot pinpoint what the algorithm is talking about. So they must claim here that then their system has greater transparency. But what we tell you here is that, okay, we have an algorithm that is based on some information, but what transparency you have on your side. When we have judges saying, I felt like it. When we have judges saying, God told me the defendant was innocent, which actually happened in Texas, we cannot really say that they can pinpoint what exactly in judges' head is going on at any given time. So we would rather replace it with an algorithm that can improve, and there is an incentive for it to improve from the side of private companies to make better algorithms while we see that no incentive whatsoever is happening on the side of judges.

Firstly, the proposition claims that this will be a fair and an impartial system. And this is the first place where they are wrong. The system will not change because you change the person or the system of sentencing. The system has much deeper flaws than just sentencing. And there are many examples for that. And we can even use the opposition's examples in these cases. Like, as you've said, we have rich people like Jeffrey Epstein, who have, I will allow points a little later. We have rich people as Jeffrey Epstein, who can get away with crimes. And you have people who just steal something and end up on almost life sentences. And that is not the issue of sentencing. That is the issue of the laws in the state. The state mandates that you can't give it.

You completely prevent the option for change. You can't change a system that has been programmed to think something like this, which leads to long-term consequences being much worse than in our world. In our world, we say, okay, maybe the judges are awful right now, but with societal change, with societal pressure, with much more accountability, we can change the way the judges see the world. If we do this, the judges are going to even have an excuse to be like, yes, but the system is going to give the sentence every time. So you stop any progression and also you incentivize people from fighting it. Because if you tell them, like the proposition said, if you tell people it was developed by an impartisan private company, it was developed perfectly so it can work every time, the people are not going to think it's going to make a mistake. And then you have a big, big problem with people going and getting wrongly sentenced later, getting wrongly sentenced, and then not fighting it and not using their rights to fight. The second thing that the proposition said is that AIs are better than humans and that we are advancing with rapidly developing it. Now, as my colleague said, and I will not repeat myself too much, but we are not really advancing too much with AI. We are advancing in simple stuff like captures and things. But with such complicated issues, we can't put our faith in private companies or government companies or independent bodies or anyone in the world to make this the perfect system or to even make this a usable system. It's not going to be usable in any way if you can't distinguish, if a car can't distinguish to drive on a line that has been dotted out. And the AIs fail on the first obstacles and variables they are not learned to not fail on. And if you fail with sentencing, you are doing a much worse job than if a judge fails with sentencing. The third thing is making a model that is really vague, like having only criminal records and previous biases. And the opposition said nothing about both of our cases, and later with the POI, we have much time. The opposition did not respond once with the proposition, I'm sorry, they can't respond once to us saying, okay, yes, criminal records, right, we concede to that. But criminal records are inherently racist. People are going to be more likely to commit crimes because of necessity, because as both the proposition and the opposition agree, we have systematic racism in this country, in most countries, actually. And with that systematic issue, just giving lower sentences, if you look at criminal data, you will still discriminate people. You will just discriminate them on a different basis. Instead of discriminating them for being a person of color, you discriminated them for being poor. And we don't see any benefit in that. The last part that I'm going to compare is how the proposition says that the judges are sometimes openly biased and we have no accountability."

If you remove the responsibility of conviction from the judges, the judges will never, ever be prosecuted because of their wrong convictions, because they can blame it on the computer. And the second thing about that is that if they are openly biased, they can make up a reason to give a bigger sentence, just like they make up reasons to give smaller sentences to the more rich people. Now, before I continue with just showing the two biggest questions, I will take a few more. 152 years ago, white people and black people were made equal by the law. For the last 10 years, we have seen the Black Lives Matter movement acting aggressively. And still, there is no change in the system. I mean, I don't know what the POI is. We both agree that there are systematic differences. The biggest thing is that we, as the opposition, claim that the proposition is handling this awfully. And I will talk about that a little later.

And I honestly don't understand how the opposition didn't do enough research for this debate to realize that the judges aren't the ones making these algorithms. Okay, this is private computing companies. People can literally have no incentive on whether they're going to be biased or racist or whatever. They only have incentive to make as much money as possible. And the second incentive being backlash. What would happen was that in the small cases when they actually did make a mistake, there was so much backlash to the company that they immediately raised this error. And that is exactly what can only happen on our side with computers. Why? Because you can't program computers. You cannot program people. We have told you so many times, and unfortunately, humans are biased in every way, not just throughout their entire life, but the society, the media, everyone is making them this way. And we can see that it literally takes 10 years for a movement to accomplish almost nothing. Well, let me tell you, we are done with waiting. We want a radical change that can actually help these people. And now let me tell you about the changes. While the best statistic that the side of opposition has given us throughout the entire bench was cats versus bricks, that AI might not be able to see this, we have told you literally that this year there was a Stanford-Berkeley research made that showed that in 30% of cases that algorithms will make a better and more accurate decision than people. Okay, further evidence that we have given to you that the side of opposition completely decided to ignore. 40% less people would be in prisons today if the sentencing decisions were made differently because of those that were made of racism. From this, we would generate over $80 billion of profit which would be invested into these communities that they keep talking about where minorities come from and where they're actually worse off. Their sentences would be reduced by 20%. Why? Because all of this can be done by an algorithm. And when you tell us, again, in your 70th minute of your op three, that what's wrong is currently the entire system. We're telling you, unfortunately, the entire system before the sentencing is wrong on both sides. But it is not what we're debating at all. We're debating the sentencing in the end, which we have shown to you has a huge importance because in the end, the judges are actually you, has a huge importance because in the end, the judges are actually the ones who give 20% longer sentences, no matter if before that people were convicted of being guilty or not. We're telling you that on our side of the house, there's so many harms that you never touch. For people who would not be sent to visit in the first place, who could actually just serve community service and never have their lives taken away. But for people also who have reduced sentences, who would instead of 15 years go to prison three years, and after that be able to actually have a normal life once again. All of this never touched by the side of opposition. Unfortunately, I could go on and on about everything that didn't touch on our side of the house. But the fact is that if there's any justice, if you didn't touch on our side of the house, but the fact is that if there's any justice, if you want there to be any justice in the world, we will give this debate to side proposition. I thank the speaker for their remarks. I congratulate all speakers for their speeches and invite you all to relax."

The setup of this argument is pretty intuitive. This argument is about what happens after you actually leave prison. Right, you actually, what happens after these two years that you actually get when you actually just beat up somebody or ten years if you actually commit sexual assault, for example. This is factually true. If they want to argue that this life sentence, good luck, this is just not the truth. Okay, then, why prisons doesn't stop you from future crimes and even makes you a worse person and actually more violent criminal? Firstly, you lose connections with family, friends, job, etc. Therefore, once I go out, I have nothing to go back to. First, because I have criminal record, therefore no one is going to employ me, but also I have bad reputation because stigma exists towards people who have been to prison. Therefore, who actually I... I basically forced back to stealing because I simply have no other income. But also... Point of information. No, sit down. Means that basically we have... Yeah, we desentice to violence too. This is the second mechanism. Because prisons are violent. There are skirmishes there. There is basically extremely, you know, battles for influence. Or gangs even. This means that you actually need to survive. Therefore, you actually do anything anything, therefore be into... No, that means actually we have your survival instincts kicking in, therefore you actually get into jungle mode where you actually have to fight for your life, therefore you get extremely violent simply to survive, even if you're not that kind of person. But thirdly, you still remain in a gank after you get out, because you have have got out but now you have nothing to go to therefore You're either going to be threatened or only your only friends are going to be from this game that you have been in prison Therefore you actually still remain there still recommit because at the end of the day you have to make something out after that But finally and maybe most important now she's actually going to get why should you get more violent afterwards? Therefore once you get out the chances are even greater because now I'm even more likely to commit crime Then be like violent crime than before"

I cannot beat up anyone and rob someone because I feel pain and nausea. When, for example, I break my hand, I cannot write. This is the same logic here. Meaning that we have far less crime on our side. What are the impacts then? He basically, on their side, he can recommit again. How does this look like? This impacts new lives who haven't been touched by crime before. Therefore, they go through the same exact trauma. But also, their families also suffer. For example, if, for example, a daughter is, I don't know, beat up, therefore all her family is going to struggle. But also, people's businesses where they have been robbed are going to be suffering too. Because now, if, for example, they're poor and couldn't have afforded to reassure it, then their reaction is cruel. But also, it will be even more severe. Why? Because I am a violent person, obviously. Therefore, I want to basically seek my revenge. I have been radicalized in my prison cell because I have nothing else to do. But also I am so used to violence because I have seen nothing else for the past two years. Therefore, it is basically, even if I'm a violent person to some extent, now I'm a more violent person in extreme ways. Then, why is this extremely important? Because future victims are more than the current ones. Right. Because more and more people get born, therefore more and more people can actually be attacked. Therefore, if we prove that there are lives of victims at stake, where actually in the future there are more, then we win on violence by far."

But here is the thing. People are extremely emotional when they actually feel such circumstances in violence. They're therefore irrational. And I would never believe the sentence is enough. How does this look like? If I get like five to ten years for this case, if my daughter gets assaulted, it won't matter because if the criminal is taking this five years, I'll want something harsher, like prison or death sentence in this way, because this person assaulted my daughter, dear panel, I want him dead. It is kind of intuitive. Therefore, this isn't as important as a clash because no matter the sentence it will never be enough. I have no closure. I have no retribution. Therefore, at least we want to get something by getting someone to not commit anymore. Or I don't know, such people to actually not be on the streets, to actually have one less person to actually recommit such things, and less people to feel this horror. You know that this one, basically, let's go on to mechanization. You know that no one in the future will actually make you feel the same way. Why? Because I know this person wouldn't recommit. Why? Because the state actually wants me to feel okay, so they actually explain how this process works and I will never, ever worry about it. But even if that's not called the case, after some time we'll have statistics that these people actually don't recommit and I'll know that this isn't the case. But also, this doesn't happen on their side of the house because I know that this person is still out there and believe me, I'll know that these are so paranoid. But also, I actually believe that maybe he wants to revenge in this way. Therefore, I'll be even more paranoid. But what actually leads to closure? Because I feel empathy on our side of the house. Because at the end of the day, I have empathy towards myself and the potential new people who actually are going to get to the new victims. Because at the end of the day, one less beat a person means I have done my duty to actually protect one more person who has committed this. But also, I fear the revenge of the actor. Therefore, I actually know that this monster is going to search for me afterward. I'll be in extreme paranoia. Because at the end of the day, I have no control, but also I have fear. And when this combination actually acts, I am extremely, extremely, extremely going to be extremely excited and paranoid and suffering. Please, vote against that proposal. Thank you. May I begin?"

              "text": "Let's be clear about what this is actually about. Firstly, this is about committing violence and feeling nausea then, but it's also about thinking about violence. Not made clear by proposition, I will make very clear why that's very important. Secondly, this is severe nausea. For you to have the incapacitation that proposition requires, that you physically can't do the crime, you know, alcoholics very often commit crime while under the influence of alcohol. They assault other people. So presumably this is a lot of incapacitation that they're doing. Very, very severe nausea. That will become important later. But thirdly, prop doesn't get the magic wand their way out of this. Maybe this is why they're afraid of the POI. Because let me tell you how Pavlovian conditioning happens. It happens in a very specific way. You expose the patient to stimulus, in this case, presumably images of violence, and then you punish them with things like an electric shock, so that in their heads they connect the images of violence and pain. That is what creates the image of nausea that they so desire. I hope you begin to see how inhumane this is. What will our side do? Firstly, we will explain why proposition is inhumane and why that justice element here should be the priority of the debate. Secondly, we will talk to you, no thank you, about restitution, and Alexia will talk to you about harm. What does proposition's first speaker do? I want to, at the top, notice that nothing that he does actually tells you why they support an opt-in system. In fact, all of it is about incapacitation and about retribution. To that extent, I think they would be absolutely fine with just imposing this on patients. They have to tell us why that isn't the case, why they only support it in the cases of an opt-in. I think the reason why is because they value autonomy. I'll explain to you why there is a society that basically cripples autonomy. The second thing I want to note here is in terms of their argument, in terms of why prison is very bad and why this is something that you don't want to go into. Like a criminal record, you can't have a job, you can't provide for your family, skirmishes in the prison, you might be shipped. Firstly, instead of fixing this, Proposition is forcing people to lobotomize themselves to get out of this. This is literally coercive. They did the argument for us about telling us why the alternative is something that coerces you into lobotomizing yourself. That sounds horrible. But secondly, these are issues you can fix. No thank you. This is like a US slash El Salvador thing almost exclusively. Singapore has fixed this with a very retribution-heavy thing. Netherlands have fixed this with a very retribution-heavy thing. Netherlands have fixed this with a very rehabilitation-focused system. Different methods can give very good results, right? And obviously those are very good examples, but we think across many countries you don't have the type of horrible things that proposition describes. It is on their side that the state doesn't solve these horrible things and rather delegates this thing to the person lobotomizing themselves. But I will now show you in the first argument why violence and thinking of violence are a core part of the human experience. Therefore, it is unjust to allow people to lobotomize themselves in the way proposition allows. Why is violence, violent thought rather, and violence a core part of the human experience? Firstly, because it's hardwired into you. It is the natural extent of the emotion of anger. When you found out your spouse cheated on you or that your friend was assaulted, you get massive nausea on their side because you perceive yourself, because you think of that violence. The immediate reaction when you see or hear of your friend being assaulted, as they describe, by the way, when they tell you about the father wanting to put the person who assaulted his daughter in jail, the immediate reaction of that father is to think about violence against that other person. It is core to our identity. But secondly, no thank you, it is core to our imagination to conceptualizing ourselves, the world around us, and our other identities. On proposition, you can think of violence. So, like, if you go under the treatment, right, if you lobotomize yourself. So you can think of Jesus on the cross, if you religious. You can't think of the revolution that birthed your country. You can't even think about how a father you would fight to defend your kids. You can't think and conceptualize all of your other identities. Imagination is what allows us to be human, to think of the future, to think of who we are and our place in it. Thirdly, though, I think you don't have, to a large degree, a choice in thinking about violence. Action movies, ads, all of these things always tell you about violence. Songs very often talk to you about violence. That's nausea, debilitating nausea on proposition. Versus, look, we get freedom of movement is"

The difference then that we draw with proposition and conceptualizing anger is that they are taking away your ability to conceptualize the things you want to do. Not only are they taking away your ability to do certain things with, you know, prison time, they're taking away your ability to think of goals with, you know, prison time, they're taking away your ability to think of goals, to think of who you want to be, not just your ability to tackle those, right? And so we think that freedom, that this is just unjust fundamentally for the following reasons. Firstly, because it is often coercive. Why? A, because people can't conceptualize what it would be like to not even be able to think of violence. We think that this is something that we don't realize how often we do it, so we can't even opt in, sort of, to some degree, because we can't think of what it would be like. But B, because of, to a large degree, all of the pressures they tell you, right? Economic pressures. For many people, they have to get out of prison now in order to provide for their families, in order to make sure that their kids keep going to school and don't go to some broken orphanage. These are the things that you need to do very often."

This is unusually cruel. But secondly, even if it is not actively coercive, even if this is a free choice, we think we don't allow people to choose to divorce themselves over a core part of their humanity. This is why we don't allow, for instance, people to choose to... Sorry, the reason why is because what you become is no longer able to make choices, no longer able to be a functioning member of society when you're lobotomized, and so you are essentially killing your future self. This is why we don't allow you to sell yourself into slavery, for instance. What are the impacts of this? Firstly, this is a horribly wrong practice. The state loses it, and society loses their moral authority to impose punishments on people. But secondly, and crucially, you're crippling the ability of these people to rehabilitate themselves. On proposition, if you want to reflect on what led you to commit the crime you did, you're thinking about violence. You're thinking about what were the on what led you to commit the crime you did, you're thinking about violence. You're thinking about what were the thoughts that led you to commit violence, that therefore you're getting significant nausea. That is something that prevents people from accessing the ability to become better people, to not want to be violent in the future. I'll take the P.I. now. I believe it is good to stop violence. That's why, for example, we forbid Nazi parties from existing even though this is limiting people's ability to express themselves on whatever level they want. Okay, I get the point. Yeah, cool. First of all, I'm not even sure we limit Nazi parties, as he says in many places. Secondly, I don't think being a Nazi person is core to your humanity, as I just explained conceptualizing violence is. Thirdly, I'm now going to explain why we think the priority of this debate should be justice, and that is quite simply that on proposition, presumably they agree that there are certain restrictions and certain punishments that we can impose. We don't support probably cutting your hand off for stealing. We don't support doing horrible things to you or torturing you. Why? Because we recognize that these punishments are unjust, even if they would probably lead to greater deterrence. Therefore, we think the priority of this debate should be justice. I will finally tell you why proposition harms the restitutive function of the criminal justice system. We think the punishment of eight years was chosen for a purpose by the judge or the jury. The reason was that this was the harm that was caused to society by your actions. We think allowing or even forcing a criminal into a different punishment is wrong, because it denies recognition of the pain to the victims. The person who murdered their boyfriend gets the same punishment as someone who assaulted someone else. That is fundamentally not recognizing the differences that exist in every crime. That is wrong. That is not something the criminal justice system should stand by. Don't allow people to lobotomize themselves."

This is extremely likely because, as they say, this is a mechanization that creates this sort of particular thing. This means that if I think of something, most probably the impact on my brain will not be as severe as if I do something violent. Most probably if I see it on an action movie and not even think about it without any sort of a real person, the effect won't be as big because it's something imaginary when I see it on the movie. Well, if I don't see it on the movie, then it will be severer. It's on a spectrum of how much you feel nausea, directly mitigating all of their practical claims this way. Right. Then they say...

They send them to prison. Right? So we don't own these people choice. Let's begin with this. Why is this the case? Because you don't give them that as well. These people have broken the social contract, the contract with the state, so the state can choose to not protect them from this sort of particular thing, to give them a certain punishment that fits this sort of particular thing. Right. So having in mind they have broken the contract, then we can take away the choice. But we are more charitable than them. We actually give them choice. We say, okay, they can choose between prison and this sort of specific thing. We believe that later. We believe everybody will choose this specific conditioning, but at the end of the day we give choice, we give more autonomy. So if this is the metric they want, then I think that something coercive is better than no choice at all for autonomy. I think this is kind of intuitive, right? And then, what else can I say about this? Notice they say, ah, you will continue thinking about it because it's in the human nature and all these things. Notice, you get used to not thinking about it. My first speaker explains this. My first speaker says that avoiding pain and suffering is the most fundamental biological instinct. This is why we change things about our lives. So if you think we can take them at their best and say that you're going to feel incredibly bad, but this is only for a short period of time, not conceding anything, even if. Right. This you it will only be for a short period of time which basically means that this is severely mitigated because you adapt as my first speaker already has explained right and then there are big impacts you can't watch an action movie guys come on let's be serious we are talking about life we are talking about assault we are talking about life. We are talking about assault. We are talking about victims of crimes that they did not consent to, which is also pretty immoral if you ask me in this sort of particular way. Right."

So prisons require money and are miserable because these violent offenders often start riots in prisons because they want to, because they have to let their emotions out. These violent offenders often beat up other people in prison because they were on their nerves, for instance, or didn't want to give them their lunch in this sort of particular case, didn't respect them enough, didn't look at them enough, and all these sort of things. Like, at the point at which these people, and guess what also, this kind of seems immoral, you know, to get beaten up in prison, kind of also very immoral, like if you want to speak about morals. No, I'm not. Great, no. Great. So why we think this is better? Firstly, notice how these violent offenders are outside of prison. This means that now these violent offenders cannot start riots. These violent offenders cannot beat up other inmates, and it's much less likely for somebody that has never beaten people up to start beating people up than somebody who has the tendency to beat people up to beat people up. You know. Then, what happens then? Secondly, you need, there are less prisoners overall. So you need to pay food for less prisoners. You need to, the prisons are less overcrowded because there is a problem with overcrowding in prisons because simply there aren't enough buildings because generally speaking, it's not very populistic to say I'll give more money to the prisons because people believe these people deserve suffering so you mostly, politicians don't give a lot of money to the prison system, right? Then, notice, what are the impacts of this? There are less miserable conditions for the non-violent offenders. They don't get beaten up in prison, they don't install riots that they can get stabbed in, in this sort of particular way, and we believe this is fundamental and moral. Why? Guess what? The judge has given them this sentence, the judge didn't give them the sentence to get stabbed with a knife. So taking by their logic it's kind of immoral for me to get stabbed by a knife in prison, right? Because the judge didn't give me this. Then, what happens? Secondly, notice how there is less violence in prison, which means that now these people will not radicalize further. Because as my first speaker explained, when you see violence everywhere, when you are part of a guard, you are pushed to your limit. Now these financial scammers, for instance, and every other kind of non-violence are not pushed to their limit. So they don't begin doing violent crime.

They tell you you lose connection with family, prisons are violent, and apparently you have gangster friends, and this is the only person you can hang out with after you come out of prison. But I want to bring some reality to this debate and tell you that there's a spectrum which exists for violent crimes. That is to say, that 40% of violent crimes that exist in the US vary from, for example, one-to-one assault at a bar, all the way to, for example, more consistent abuse such as domestic abuse. The more extreme cases would be like, you know, Jeffrey Dahmer, really, really bad. But we think this is very minor, the minority of cases which exists, the majority exists within that side of the spectrum. Now, why is this important? Because prison is really important for both sides of the spectrum. Why? Firstly, because there is a government incentive to do rehabilitation under our side of the house. In the terms of the capital and the money that we would be using, they're using this to lobotomize people, get doctors, no thank you, and get electric chairs. We're using that money to invest in that rehabilitation. We have the fiat to do this. But secondly, because under our side of the house, prison is better because the individual in the vast majority of cases from this side of the spectrum can understand and override the feeling of anger that drove them to disrespect the law in the first place. We allow them to reflect, we allow them to talk about this with psychologists, we allow them the time to think about this, because by the way, we don't make them fall on the floor at the first thought which they have. The third reason is because prison, no thank you, we think is enough of a deterrent in the status quo, at the point where in the most extreme cases that they talk to you about, it's very, very long. We think this deters people enough to the point where they can make the decision to not actually enact the crime. But even if they override that deterrence, we think it is so much better when in prison they are actually able to override that. Their side is the one which, by the way, even if we don't deter people, eventually after they come out of prison, they're unable to self-defend. The individual that, by the way, did a one-time crime in which they hit a guy at the bar, under their side and from their model, the next time that they will need to self-defend for whatever reason, they can't do this. Because they're going to drop on the floor and turn purple and their eyes are gonna go crazy because you're literally lobotomizing them this is inhumane and this is causing so much more crime in the sense that if people can't self-defend from future crimes you also have lower the ability for them to be able to escape that crime in the first place secondly then on victims feeling better which by the is very, very patronizing for you to assume that victims want to inflict this horrible pain that is eternal on people."

So whether I did the bar thing or whether I'm Jeffrey Dahmer, same thing for proposition. And by the way, it is forever. I have this nauseous reaction for eternity. Very patronizing for you to assume this is what victims want, even though they felt the pain of what it means to actually be violated. This is horrible. But secondly, right, if it is the case that courts decided that the right decision is for this person to go to prison at the point where the individual has the choice to opt out of it, this is really bad because victims don't find comfort in the fact that someone gets to play around with what punishment they will fix. Even if they think it's worse because they're guilty or even if they are not quite sure how badly this lobotomy is and they choose it because they think it's easier, giving these people choice is really bad, and victims are much less likely to want this. Lastly, very quickly, on prisons, they tell you it's expensive. By that same logic, would you also kill them? Would you also torture them because they take space, send them to an island? No, because as a society, we understand that that is absurd and there are limits to what you do to the people that commit crimes, even if it is the most extreme.

We're saving new people from being harmed. We're saving these people from experiencing things that literally limit their body autonomy, that limit their dignity. Things like being, for example, beaten up are things that you didn't have control over, and things that harm you both physically and mentally. We believe that as the criminal justice system, it is our main goal to limit these sort of things. Secondly, we speak on retribution. We explain to you why the victims feel better when they feel like they have done a good deed, when they feel like they aren't going to live in paranoia for the rest of their lives, that there is monsters going to come and harm them again. We explain to you why this is probable and truth simply through the prism of the perception of these victims and how exactly they feel. Never engage with it. Thirdly, on prisons, we explain to you why the prisons will become less violent, which then results into discriminations being as radicalized when it comes to their actions after being let out of prison. Because let's face it, guys, they will exit prison at some point. The majority of life sentences are not the case. The majority of time, if you do something, even if you are asexual, you get 10 years max. So, when these people exit, we should care about what they're doing. Okay."

              "text": "Not to rebut all of their principled arguments. First, let's bring some nuance into what they're talking about. They say, it's in your nature to think about violence later. Sure, but what people are they talking about? I don't understand. They're talking about offenders that are already convicted. This person already harmed someone. This person already, for example, committed an armed robbery, so we know who to give this sort of medication to. These are people that are already criminals, and when you have cleared that up, rebuttal us to why the principle doesn't work. First of all, by the extension of their logic, these people don't control what they're thinking about, so they should not suffer for it. Okay, so why should we send them to prison where they're intuitively going to suffer when these thoughts transition into actions? And this is something that we have proven in our argument as to why this sort of medication is effective and why it prevents. Even they can see that this medication literally prevents you from thinking straight and you having life abilities. Therefore, you probably can see to the fact that you cannot reoffend simply because you don't have the physical ability to do so. When this is true, we don't believe that it is moral by their logic to send these people to prison where they're limited of their freedom, when they're limited not only from freedom of what they think, because their social group is bad, because the environment is depressing and all of these things, but you're also restricting their ability. You can't go out, you can't choose what activities you do in prison. So these people are much more limited on their side of the house, even if you choose to care about these people. Again, by the extension of their logic, they must explain as to why this sort of treatment is much worse than prison, which they comparatively never do. They just impact why it's bad, which, by the way, leads me to the next call-out, which is that this contradicts their second claims when they're trying to claim that, oh, but it's too little, but then it's too much for example, it's too little of a punishment to give this person the pill and give them sort of medication but then it's too much for them to be principled, you have to either buy their first argument or the second go ahead if it were true that they would decrease crime by 10%, that's a big number Point of information? You have to either buy their first argument or the second. Go ahead. If it were true that they would decrease crime by 10%, that's a big number, would you cut off the legs of people who commit serious assault? Of course. Very happy to do that. Why? On to Wayne. I don't care about these people. I could not care less. Why? Simply Wayne, as to why the actors on our side of the house, which are the basic civilians, which is you, which is me, are more important than this person who is an already criminal. First point of weighing, these are immoral actors. This is what comes even in our second speech. These actors, for example, limited the body autonomy of another individual, limited their rights. Therefore, it is justified for us to limit their rights, which is why prison exists and the concept of the criminal judicial system exists. It's okay for us to limit them when they have limited the rights of someone else. So they never explain as to what's the problem there. But comparatively, we must care more about the members of the public because they obey their full freedom, for example, to obey the law and to live by certain rules in their life just to have that freedom, and they deserve to have that. But secondly, these citizens are functional citizens and part of society. These people are working, these people are obeying the law. On the comparative, prisoners either stay in prison forever where they do nothing but just sit there and don't contribute to society in any way, or secondly, they just exit prison and join gangs which are actively harming the state that society is in. So what is the bottom line here, Giorg Pano? The bottom line is that when we don't care about the actor, we shouldn't care about the severity that this actor is suffering, when we prove a more important actor that is suffering much more. Which leads me on to my next point of weighing."

Firstly, future victims are far more in number than the current victims because when this person exits prison for beating up one person, he is going to exit and beat up another person and then another person. Second point of weighing, we believe that our case proves why the severity of these crimes will actually increase after this person has gone to prison, due to radicalization, due to him having no other choice. So we have this acceleration of impact. If you buy that they're equally important, when ours gets worse over time, you should protect the people when more violent crimes are to happen. But thirdly, on solvency, what is moral and what is not is up to every single person in this room's judgment. Everyone has their different life story versus practice is something that we agree upon.

The basic dignities that civilizations have fought very hard to get from their state. The state which did use to execute people out in the streets for stealing apples to feed themselves. We fought hard to get to the point where the criminal justice system has these constraints. Why? Because it's not just about the criminals, Pamela. Society is represented by the system it chooses to enforce. And that is a system no citizen consented into. Did they offend or did they not offend means that that society still represents you. That the policing, that the punishment is one which is done in the name of the people, and you can't paint the name of the people by stripping others of their humanity in their name. That is the first reason as to why we have constraints on the criminal justice system. And the second reason we have constraints on the criminal justice system is because very often it gets it wrong. It gets it wrong when it over-prosecutes and convicts African-Americans on three times the likelihood of a white American. It gets it wrong when it over-prosecutes and convicts African Americans on three times the likelihood of a white American. It gets it wrong when 15% of convictions with a death penalty are later overturned after the fact, even though the person was executed. And because it disproportionately affects the poor who can't access legal defense and the minorities who are victims of discrimination, it is why we should earn on the side of caution, make sure punishment isn't irreversible. That is why we do not take away people's legs proposition. That is insane. And third of all, because it enters a slippery slope. Now, slippery slopes are generally bad faith arguments, but we don't need to do that because they accepted the slippery slope, that by their logic they would cut off people's legs because they were convicted, even though that conviction might later be overturned. They would also, by the way, realistically be okay with preventative policing, punishing people before the crime happens, imposing a curfew so people don't go outside, because guess what proposition? Night is when most crime happens, so you wouldn't want people risking all of that to prevent all of these victims from happening. You are probably the people who would also arrest someone before they convict a crime because some sort of algorithm or statistic has proven they are more likely to re-offend. Even though we think this might prevent victims, we think that the oppression of the state needs to be limited by these constraints because the state has a much greater capacity to coerce you than any other citizen because of how asymmetric that relationship is."

It strips a basic element of life, an element of life which is religion, which is in media, in advertisement, in your national identity, culture, etc. And we think this is not something you can scale, because the InfoShack very clearly says severe nausea if think about violence. They don't get to have this sort of scale of severity. And they tell you that, like, look, and this isn't, by the way, just about violence, because the brain would go into self-defense mode. It can't compartmentalize. Therefore, every thought which is tangential to violence would be eventually washed out. You would eventually cleanse your mind off of all of that, and you are losing so much of your capacity to think, so much of your capacity to engage with reality. They try to make a parallelism between this and the movement, and the freedom of movement, which we limit, but the freedom of movement is logically secondary to your freedom to set priorities by having thought. You move because you want to do things. You can only want to do things if you can think. And we think, look, you don't always have control over your thoughts. You do over your actions. That is another distinction. And we can only punish you for those actions because those have caused harm. We think that our thoughts themselves are harmless. They are innately human, and that is what you're stripping away. I'll take the point. Understand that if you cannot do the punishment, then don't do the crime. You have a choice., therefore your principal argument is not important, because you actually intupted into this, you actually did this crime, therefore you actually are a bad person and you should be punished to the severest extent if you actually committed sexual assault. Their logic would use the death penalty on everything. If you know the punishment means it is okay to inflict upon you, so long as there is a paper notice somewhere saying death penalty applies for all, they would apply that. That is the level of oppression and coercion Team Proposition stands up to defend.

Come on panel, we are debating a hypothetical motion in an info slide. The average informed voter doesn't know this story. But I gave you logical reasoning how this process is likely to look like. I explained to you, milder cases will most probably not have such an effect on your neurons. This is something I did in second speech.

They say, he says, the system makes mistakes. Guys, this comes too late. You should not buy it. This comes in third speech on the mistakes. This is something that should not be brought in the debate. This is constructive. Nobody mentions mistakes in the past two constructive speeches. Then they say, ah, but like slippery slope. This is like me saying, would you take away prisons or any sort of punishment because it violates the basic human rights of freedom of walking. Like I can also create a slippery slope, guys.

Some people, the intuition here is, some people believe the death penalty is moral. Others believe it is not. Some people believe that self-defense in every situation is moral, some believe it is not in every sense. So principles are ultimately a human construct. Right. I don't believe that this is less essential, especially taking, I don't believe that they pull over principle, especially taking into account the whole consent point. Like at that point it becomes very complicated to determine whether something is principally correct or not. The practice is much more intuitive. Second comparative. Notice we impact more people. The principle of a few people are infringed on their side. The people who have convicted violent crimes. We infringe the principles of every other type of criminal getting stopped in prison, every victim who doesn't feel any sort of closure, and thirdly, every future victim that gets convicted. I believe these are more people's rights because we impact the future generation in this particular case. So we believe that they infringe the rights of more people. Secondly, why are victims' dignity more important than offenders' dignity? We ask this question from second speech, they never deliver an answer. Offenders choose to do the crime knowing the punishment, knowing they will be given this choice. The victims did not know that they will get sexually assaulted on the street when they walked in the night. This is the comparative. Four-three, principles are binary. Either you buy them or not. Ours is on a spectrum. You can buy them to reduce some time. but if they have not proven their principle and not responded to every single rebuttal we give, you cannot buy their only argument in this debate. Vote for us.

We think they need to engage with the reality of how betting manifests in the status quo. That's to say, regulations, even if they have the feel to do so, are likely insufficient to address the harms that we will illustrate in our case because one, sports itself is too unpredictable, so you never know for sure if a sports team actually fixed a game in response to betting incentives.

We will prove then, and this is principally justified, for three reasons. On why one, it leads to third party harm that the state ought to address. On two, why it leads to individual coercion.

              "text": "First of all, why does this harm and force people who bet? Even if most people do sports betting responsibly, which we do not think is the case, we cannot ignore the significant set of people who are addicted by sports betting. This significant minority matters in this debate because it is also this group which spends the highest proportion of their income, who loses the most, who has the least control over what they bet, and the least control of their own financial autonomy. Why are these people, and a significant number of people, likely to act irrationally when betting is legal? One, we think sports is closely tied to individual identities, which they unconditionally prioritize. For example, whether it's the Manchester fan or the Dallas Mavericks fan, they have a tainted and biased lens without an objective valuation of which team they're actually going to win, so therefore they always think that they have the highest chances and they always have a perceived bias of always winning the game. Secondly though, the very structure of how sports manifest is with gamified websites, where the specific colors on the website make it very attractive. It only just clicks away from adding more money into the website. It's very insular communities online like Vedant, people are psychologically predisposed to gambling onwards and onwards. Where they have this bias that they will make the money back somehow. That all the money lost in the past will be no thank you, we made back in a later time. The team will bounce back even if they've been losing matches. They have this fallacy because of their own biases. The bottom line is that addiction begets addiction and we think the government ought to prevent this."

But the poor are more likely to go on their personal biases like the town or the team from their own hometown or to vote based on the perception that they're always going to make it big as the underdogs. Secondly though, we think gamblers are especially bad not just for themselves but for their family. It's the husband who spends all of their family's savings to come home at night where gambling is always intertwined with alcoholism because you cannot couple with how you just spent all of your family's savings. It hurts families, it hurts wives, it hurts children, it hurts all these individuals. The comparative is, we removed the exposure and influence of gambling in the first place. We nipped the bud of addiction at the very first place and we stopped it from cycling out of control."

It's not this house who banned gambling, it's this house who banned sports gambling. All of your mechanisms apply to gambling as a whole. Mine is banned at all. We are perfectly happy to ban gambling as well, but we said sports is especially pernicious because you feel your own identity is tied to that team from your hometown, whereas cards like aces on a table are not tied to your own identity, and you are not psychologically predisposed to please engage with the first four minutes of my speech. But secondly, on why betting destroys the integrity of sports with perverse incentives. The premise of this argument is that sports betting has massive potential for profit. The fact that the return on investment is literally more than 100% because you get all the money you betted and as well as other people who betted as well. More bets means that you get more rewards for the individuals who bet. But also, we think that people who play these games also have an incentive to make money because we think, contrary to popular belief, athletes actually lack a lot of money. They want to make it more in a jackpot because they know how risky it is for every extra game they play. They don't know when it's going to be a life-ending or, for example, a career-ending injury. That means they cannot play anymore, which means they want all the money they can get in those five golden years of their time in that peak in the league. The same thing applies for sports organizations who don't know where their plays will be traded into, who don't know the longevity of their organization."

The result of this is one people who bet will try everything in their way to change the outcome of games. So it looks like how very recently the USA somehow beat Pakistan in cricket which was a huge upset because there were things under the table that were involved and money that was going around Which were only possible because of the huge betting market that came from money from every single person that betted Where people sabotage people and protest before for example a fight We're more likely to hurt the opponent to increase their own chances of winning But secondly it means players and teams no longer make the best decisions They don't make the best plays and they follow the money trail. This is extremely harmful because one, for athletes, think of how much time and effort they've dedicated. Their entire careers, they've come here for this one shot at the championship and now their coach is telling them to purposely miss the goal so they can make more money in the long run. Think of their morale. Think of their teammates who have to put up with this. But secondly, for fans who seek their monthly allowance to afford a seat in the arena, to see their best and perfect sports games and sports teams play, they will see the money, they will see the change actions, and we think that is a deep injustice. The additional layer here is that betting fans the adrenaline of fans, pun intended, which means that there's much more likely outbreaks of conflict, of cultural brawls, where losing is far more bitter and winning isn't the same as it was before. We will not, by the virtue of sports, be tainted by dollar bills. I beg you to propose. Thank you. . In that sense, you can go to the other side."

You can only gamble on teams you know and follow and like. You maybe play once a week, and you can comparatively play poker every single day. Additionally, this means you cannot fall for the payback policy. And secondly, there exist huge caps on how much you bet.

Every single form of betting is unpredictable. That's why it's called betting. And secondly, they say, oh, but we'll have under-the-table gambling. Notice that insofar as these people have an incentive to gamble, black market is likely even worse on the side of proposition because they want to still gamble. The implication of this that the regulations are good enough on our social house, then we see this in status quo. Then the rebuttal on the first two arguments. Firstly, they say, oh, this is bad for people. Two points here. They say that, oh, you're addicted. Notice we have framing. Yes, some people are addicted, but they will likely still want to gamble in some people are addicted but they will likely still want to like gamble in some like some sort of way they will just shift to another form of gambling then we flip this with our analysis that we say that this is the best gambling to be in and on like on people who like are casual gamblers yes maybe they are we concede maybe they like they stop gambling in the national house but it's not a high impact as you say you waste a few euros a week you're likely to spend this on a beer while you while you watch a game or you're likely to gamble with your friends locally like okay i think around matthews is gonna win if they don't you buy you buy me a beer and secondly they say like everything is subjective like notice this applies to every every form or like every form of gambling secondly on their like point about about athletes and like they games. Firstly, what is the game? Athletes are likely rich. We don't go for their characterization. They have brand deals, they're paid a lot and they have huge sums of money. Secondly, it's extremely risky to do so, so it's not in their incentive. Why? Because these things get found out a lot because there's infinite incentive to find out if corruption is going on in your league because you lose popularity, you lose credibility. They have severe consequences, not only for the players, but for the team managers, so they are likely to discourage it. Thirdly, they don't have much control over the games. In football, there are 11 players, you're just one of them. Even if you want to match teams, you likely aren't able to do so. I want to add on to this analysis if you buy in That they are like these people are like poor this means that they're not good players So they're even harder for them to fix these to fix these games and lastly I would explain They like to have like underground underground betting so it's so it's even worse then our first argument about losing funding of sports. Pervar framing. No, before that, sure, go. But, especially what you do, that's the worst gambling, that's the worst gambling. That's why it's a stepping stone to all the other bad forms of gambling. No, no, it's not a stepping stone. I'll explain later. You like to do this with your friends. They encourage you to go, like, even more and gamble even more. Because this thing is just a social activity. They discourage you from doing other things. First argument."

This looks like Germany being on every shirt in the Euros. And they give them a huge amount of money. This looks like millions of dollars that go to training and buying players. This is really profitable for Germany because their literal ad is seen on the players the whole game with billions of people watching, for example, the World Cup final which 4 billion people watched. Notice they are likely to sponsor lower level teams. Why? Because top tier clubs like Manchester City have rich private Saudi investors which bring in much more money than Germania so they are likely to sponsor mid-level clubs. Then, notice instead of score these clubs lack a lot of money. They don't win that much, this means they have to sell young players and they don't have rich sponsor and notice the league in You know itself pays them less because your ship is down because the leads are in that competitive status Oh, we see this like Manchester City winning a lot and dominating the links So the viewership is done the application of this is that every sponsor and every single cent these clubs are these clubs These clubs get is crucial. And these companies can pay them a good amount, not more than Saudi investors. Why? Because they're extremely profitable. Their only expense is literally like the majority of time they win, so they don't have huge costs for paying out people. And even furthermore, their only costs outside of that are literally just setting up a casino or like a machine. This is not that much money. What happens in the proposition then is clear. Once these casinos go bankrupt, they cannot sponsor leagues as a whole and these smaller clubs. Thus, these smaller clubs have less money. What is the impact of this? Why is this so bad? These clubs don't have enough capital to function. This means two things. First of all, services fans pay for as a full are more expensive. This looks like merch, tickets to games or streaming services to watch them at home. They cost a lot more because now clubs, I took a POI, because now clubs have to compensate for the money they lost. Shirts, instead of being 100 euros, which are in stated scope, go up to like 200 euros or even more. Notice this flips proposition. Because casual gamblers and fans that don't gamble, that proposition doesn't even impact, now have to spend much more money than do on a proposition. This means their best case, these people stopped gambling, but now they still have to pay much more money. This reflits this point on National Houses. And secondly, clubs that have less money to function this money that's useful facilities new players and pages big clubs aren't affected by this though because they have different sponsors only small clubs are harmed and big ones have money in stills this means that leads aren't even are even less competitive why because the teams just dominate why this means that people watch less games because the quality of the always worse this is very bad because the week has less cash now because they don't have as many as many viewers and less sponsors This means that same impacts of this argument apply But on a much larger scale and second and like second layer here is that people are much less happy Because the average person has a hard life you watch a 9 to 5 you're stressed all the time You look forward to these games every single week to watch your club play and this makes you happy. This is really important to them because they tie this to their community, to their friends, to their family. They watch them their whole life, this is their upbringing. And now instead of watching a game once a week, they can watch it only once a month. And this freaks their second argument because now every single game is like it's corrupted because one club has so much money that it doesn't matter what the other one does this is clear opposition"

I think it's incredibly demeaning and unstrategic for opposition in this debate to stand up and just say to the people who get addicted to gambling, to the people who are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in their life savings because a coercive game and the unflinching decision-making that they are making has made them lose money on bets that they never wanted to make in the first place. These people matter. Even if they chose themselves to bet, these are decisions that they oftentimes regret. They are the decisions that they don't make under full informed consent. They are decisions that these people are victims.

And thirdly, on the quality of sports themselves. Before that, I want to make two strategic observations and two rebuttals to their case. Firstly, opposition can't push an overly high burden on our side of the house, because it is true that we can defend sports betting and the sports ban on our side of the house, but we can also support banning things in general that are committed to gambling, so this isn't problematic for our case. But secondly, all their impacts are incredibly unclear and unlinked to sports betting."

Why is it that the sports fund is unable to be funded if you don't have an alternative revenue source of gambling? Because most of these casinos and online places where you bet on sports games aren't run by the sports teams. So the profits don't go to the teams themselves. The second argument never made sense to begin with. But two things I want to talk about. Firstly, on the black market that they say are going to occur on our side of the house, why does this not happen? Three reasons. Firstly, this becomes far harder to do. There's more illegal barriers and steps. There's a more greater risk of getting caught because it's no longer legal to do so, and the police exist on our side of the house to enforce the policy that the government makes. But secondly, the risk becomes too high, because you need the state to facilitate gambling for it to work, because they can guarantee that when you win something, you actually get your earnings. But on their side, when you bet into a random black market house, how are you certain that when you win a bet, they don't just pocket your gambling and run away to somewhere else? What are you going to do? Report to the police that you were gambling illegally. But thirdly, even though this is not perfect, it still massively reduces the harms. These will only be the rich people on their side of the house who go to the underground casinos in Monaco, or the average person that we told you"

But notice that there was no response to the idea that Bo told you about, that many of these things can't be enforced. How do you prove that Messi didn't just mess up versus being intentionally missing the goal and the penalty? So you're only using the example to try to prove this argument of one thing, and I don't understand why it applies in the general case. How exactly would they stop this? What are the regulations that they support on their side of the house? What do they want umpires and the legal authorities to do to actually prevent this? They never explained. But secondly, there's an infinite number of sports to bet in, right even if they increase scrutiny on one specific sport like horse racing the bettors will just move to a less regulated sports like racing dogs or chickens right they move from baseball to ice hockey so it's impossible and there's limited resources for you to actually regulate every single thing but thirdly they say that attacks gambling right that's another incentive why the government doesn't want to enforce this policy, because the more people that gamble, the more people that lose money,"

              "text": "the more money that the government makes. On the clash of game-fixing and how this wins the round independently from proposition, the point was that it was insufficient response to Bo's argument on bribery, because what they say is that this is, one, incredibly risky, and secondly, there's limited control. But on the risky point, oftentimes the benefits outweigh the risks. Where it's incredibly difficult for you to get proven, if you compare it on your side of the house, it's millions upon millions of dollars of earnings. It's that you can retire early. You can actually have the ability to pay your bills. But secondly, it isn't true that you have limited control. Because while you may not be able to win the game independently, you can drastically stack the odds in favor of the person who you're betting for you. If you perform badly in a game, and there's only 11 people on your team, that's particularly important. If an umpire gives a wrong call and gives a penalty, that drastically increases the chance of a team winning at a particular moment. But here are some additional reasons for why bribering and fixing games is actively possible. Firstly, players do need the money, contrary to what they say, because most sports players are not rich. The players in the WNB, for instance, get paid like $ money, contrary to what they say, because most sports players are not rich. The players in the WNB for instance get paid like $60,000 a year. This is money that they do need and they cannot retire on. But secondly, there's massive uncertainty about the future, where even if you're paid relatively decently, you're not sure you're not going to get injured in the next season and your entire career is over. So players have an incentive to make as much money as possible. But thirdly, there's other ways to fix games that counteract their response on players because you can bribe umpires, you can bribe fans who are sitting in the front rows, you can bribe and understand the stadium to go into the locker rooms and drug the drinks that the players are playing so that your team wins over the other one. The delta here is the extreme level of financial incentive to actually do this bribery and corruption. That is a pernicious form of investment that in one night could earn 10 or 20 times what the S&P 500 makes in a single year. This is a massive amount of money, and when such massive amounts of money are at stake, the incentive to do bad things drastically increases. Why was this argument so important, and what were the harms? But firstly, we told you that there was a principal harm here, right? And the differentiation between sports and other forms of entertainment is that while sports is very entertaining, we care about the fairness value. It is a competition that people have spent years and years working towards, and it should be a fair game for people to decide. This is the same reason why you wouldn't support, like, us bribing you in this round to pay for you to let China win, right? But secondly, there's a massive harm and damaging on athletes, where oftentimes, not only do these athletes work so much to do so, they don't have any transferable skills. They can't go into another industry. They can't do something else. But it's also about the massive amount of time that they put into this. The athletes have a very short period of time where they're at the prime and peak performance. So if you ruin one game for them, that oftentimes is the only chance that they have to win the championship that they spent 20 years working towards. So it is massive damage to these athletes and we do think this is a stakeholder in sports debates. But lastly it matters to fans, it matters to the millions of people who stay up to 3 a.m. each night in Asia to watch Manchester United play in the Euros. These are important things that happen to fans and it's entirely damaging to them that they don't watch a fair game, that the decisions of who wins have already been decided by Saudi billionaires in Saudi Arabia who made their money off oil."

              "text": "On the second argument, on betters and who benefits them, but before that, I'll take a point of information. Do you think it's fair that Manchester City have more money than the bottom 10 of the event clubs in the Premier League? Every game is like it's rigged. You don't prove why they're likely to make this money on their side of the house. And secondly, it is far harder for Man United to rig games than it is for a rich oil billionaire who has even more resources disproportionately. On bettors then, the premise of their case is that on bettors is that you have to meaninglessly consent into this. And that is why their case can't work. Because Bo proved to you for three structural reasons why people cannot have informed consent and oftentimes this is very addicting. But notice how addiction and their own framing makes things far worse where they tell you that this start that's casual betting that this isn't seemed like something very very bad so you're going into a casino has a high barrier of entry you don't understand the games in the casino like blackjack but you understand like games like basketball and baseball that there's a social stigma against betting in the casino but like they, betting on sports games is just betting $20 with your friends. This is Bo's response to how this is a stepping stone into gambling even more on the other side of the house. So we flip their argument in so far as gambling once on a sports game leads to an addiction to gambling and leads to worse forms of gambling even if you don't bet this. So we do have a concrete harm on the bettors and it's a significant minority of people that you ought to care about in this debate, because these are people who are losing out on money, and it matters more than them having slight amounts of enjoyment and occasionally winning 10 euros. But lastly, on the sports themselves. They imply that betting makes sports more fun and people more engaged, but Bo's preemption in his speech already counteracts this. Because we told you, too much attention and the stakes being too high is oftentimes very harmful. It is bad for fans to be incredibly heated, because this is what you get instances in which Brazil fans beat up Germany fans after the World Cup finals because they were incredibly bitter about losing. It is when you increase the stakes drastically, that is when soccer players throw broken bottles from the pitch to stop the other team from winning."

What happens to the casual gamblers on the side of opposition? Two things. Firstly, they don't gamble officially, but they might move to gambling with their friends, which we see in, like, constantly, for example, gambling with their friends, which we see constantly. For example, gambling in a beer or putting a few bugs on the table or something like that. Proposition doesn't actually get rid of their habits because this habit stays with you trying to be connected to your community, with you trying to watch sports, with you trying to get a little bit of a rush, with you trying to have fun. Secondly, even if they completely stop gambling on the side of proposition, they're not a problem in this type of call because they gamble once in three weeks to buy themselves cevapi.

Firstly, you're not addicted to the sport but the rush you feel after winning a bet. So this is a dopamine addiction, meaning that they're still addicted and they're still gamblers in their seventh house. Secondly, they're probably in a circle of friends who gamble, which are familiar to, etc. and things like that. Thirdly, at the point at which sports gambling is banned, marketing agencies for other forms of gambling try to capitalize by advertising even more because they're trying to recruit the gamblers who want some certain other outlet. And we tell you it's much better to have a way more regulated, way more seasonal outlet of gambling than going to a casino, than having something available at your fingertips, than having something that is completely based on chance. Proposition wants to impact the most extreme people and cases by their opening of the case so, oh, you will bet your house, you will bet your wife, you will bet your dog.

These are things behind the scenes. Secondly, popularity is way more profitable than money to these sports players. Why? Because you gain traction. You gain followers. You get transferred to a better club. You get better things. You have trained for this from being so small, from being two years old. You know how to play football better than you know how to walk. This is something that you have invested so much time in. You want to have the best career options for yourself. You saw the biggest players and you want to be just like them. You want to play for Real Madrid. It's much more profitable in your head to try to have somebody scout you rather than you getting like a thousand dollars more, which is like a complete better incentive analysis than on their side of the house. Not only that, like the third point, there isn't a lot of incentive on their side, because they tell you, oh, the people want money, but they have wages, they have sponsorships, they have enough money in the status quo. Not only that, as I told you, popularity outweighs this. Secondly, they want security, because it is a lot of risk, like, it is a lot of risk, for example, with injury, with, like, being disqualified, things like that. They don't want to put another risk on themselves with gambling. Not only that, we proved to you a manager incentive, how they discourage it because they can lose every single thing they know. And also, they lack capacity because they haven't proved to us how they can bribe 20 players. This is some certain Saudi Arabia person who hasn't been characterized and who we don't know why he wants to rig this game so bad can bribe 20 people to do something with the game. Not only that, we tell you that whatever they prove with this argument, we outweigh it vastly because we tell you that we actually help the gamblers, we help sports teams, which is something that matters to the most of people. They say, okay, sports loses meaning. Okay, maybe. Okay, worst case, if the game is rigged, the players might be sad, but people are happy because they can actually see this game and we impact way more people with investing in sports."

We told you that money goes to clubs because casinos sponsor them, they never like deal with this mechanism, they just say, oh no mechanism,, we have one. They go to clubs and we have more money. In return, their logos are shown on players' shirts. And this is good because players get more trainings. They get better physicians. They get better wages. They get better certain things. Not only that, like, merch becomes more accessible and things like that. And we saw and we see through history that people care about sports a lot. This impacts a lot of people vastly and people will want this and create this on their side of the house, but then sports will become only for the elite because you cannot afford to see your favorite player play in some certain stadiums. So, like also on two levels also, people spend more money on their side, so that is even worse. And also, secondly, the games lose quality, which is why we outweigh this constantly. Now, like, fourth point of rebuttal shortly on this certain violence, I want to say that people are angry because of a game, not because of vent betting, it's the same. And before I move on to my argument, go. Why is sponsorship for a casino, again, out of player's spirit? Is there any different sponsorship for any other company that also wants to... Okay, where is their capital? What is this company? Do they sponsor them already in the status quo? Why don't we see them replacing it?

Why has sports betting popped up? Because people have always tried to predict the outcome of an event with friends, always tried to analyze. There was always a demand for it and it always existed. We saw this in ancient Greece with carriage rickses being bet where you bet with your chicken. It's a part of human nature. Since governments know that people will always bet on sports, they decided to provide a regulated safe outlet for these people. Proposition doesn't make people forget about gambling, they just ban this certain outlet. And that means that the black market pops out because incentive exists for this black market to actually be open. And these are not enormous webs under the city, this is about like a hundred shady people that vaguely know each other that pool money for games they like. The impact of this is four things. Firstly, this is not regulated for age or amount of money. Secondly, black markets put extremely unfavorable odds because they're doing something risky. They want a high profit. That means you have a low payout. Thirdly, you might have ripped off. There's no guarantee of money. Fourthly, they know that you can't contact the police. They might put you in bigger problems, for example go to your house directly. Why do people still opt in on their side? Three reasons. Firstly, you likely received an invite from your friend which you trust, this is why you don't think about the police and you're kind of peer pressured into it. Secondly, a gambler's fallacy which they mention to you, you only gamble if you think you will win, you don't think about the downsides, this is why you don't care about the guarantee for payout."

The first is, from the player end, this is impossible to regulate. This often looks like micro nuances in the way you play, especially with the rise of ultra specific stats. It's impossible to assess this from the outside unless you are that player that has been playing for your whole life. Sports is often really uncertain in and of itself. There are performance variations every single day, minor injuries that might mask your behavior changes. At the top level, the differences between different teams are massively small, and a minor difference in the way you behave is likely to change the outcome. They say that you have no control over this game as an individual player. This is false for two reasons. The first is, given the info slide, this looks like more and more specific betting on micro stats that you can control as an individual, especially if you are powerful. But two, it's just not true that an individual player has no control over the outcome of the game, because otherwise you would not have team players. These are team events in whom every single player has a massive outcome on what happens, such as if I tell Bo to change his behavior right now, we probably would not be winning as much as we are in this round. Two, many of these actors are ludicrously wealthy and powerful. It's what they characterize, Russian oligarchs and Saudi Arabian people who own clubs and uses to expand their wealth. They often can literally influence financial institutions. Regulation is insufficient. Three, sports is always evolving. There's the growth of new metrics like micro stats, like game changes like the NBA three-point revolution, the introduction of AI umpires in baseball, for example. It's often initially unclear what the influence of these changes are. What this means is that regulation that has to be agreed upon by vast international federations often has an operational and administrative lag insofar as contexts are changing, which means people can exploit this. Their response to this is that there is no incentive to do this because this is really risky and players are unlikely to do this. I have three responses. First, this misses our preemption from first. Your career is vastly uncertain as a player. Your career is finite. You have the incentive to safeguard your future with a large inflow of cash. The vast majority of players will never be famous. They will never, you know, be in fear of, for example, backlash. This is a better financial decision for most of them. But two, you often can't say no as a player. There's a strict hierarchy in sports in which you're beholden to team managers and people who fund your team. These people often do make the financial calculus that accepting a bribe and covering up is better. But three, you can bribe other people who are involved in the game, things like umpires, things like referees who don't have fame to lose are already paid a massively small amount and are likely to take these bribes. The upshot of this is that fixing of games on which people, is likely to occur, even if it occurs in a small slice of instances, it is really terrible because these are the games on which people derive their pride, their elation, their dignity and their identity. It is the most important thing that we are enshrining the fairness of these games for these people and for the very reason that we believe sports matters"

              "text": "in the first place. Second, how do bettors react and change their behavior? They give us two big pushes under this. The first is people will do worse forms of gambling. I have two responses. The first is this is clearly not how people's psychology works. Like, gut check this. People who bet on sports usually do so because of our analysis, that this is something uniquely foundational to their identity, that sports is uniquely personal to people. The average person has a normative aversion to gambling because it is perceived as something that is a moral ill. It is not so for sports gambling, which is perceived as an extension of this community that you like a lot. These occupy different niches in the average person's conception of what gambling is. It is unlikely that on our side they do worse forms. But two, both flip habits, which is that this is a stepping stone. You miss the high of winning, you seek out other things at the point at which you realize that this is something you like. Per their own characterization, this is how psychology works. The implication of this is so. Perhaps existing gamblers may still attempt to seek out black markets on our side of the house, but at least we stop new people from entering into this habit and entering into this niche. On their side, the harm is infinite because infinitely more people can enter this. Okay, second, on the black market, I have two responses to, I have three things to say in response to their argument on the black market. The first is, it is obviously much harder to do gambling at the point at which it is in a black market. People often have aversions to illegal activities in the absence of a centralized platform for betting that exists in the South. So, for example, Predicted, which is not for sports, but you know, I don't sports bet, so I don't know any of these platforms. There's a much higher threshold of proactiveness in seeking out this activity that you have to do. So you have to seek out this black market. You have to infiltrate these vastly insular circles, which per their analysis is only like 100 people, which is a massive contradiction, by the way, which means that people are more likely to make the calculus not to do it, insofar as the short-termism that adheres in the decision to gamble is likely to only apply when this is an activity that is readily available versus when you have to go through all of these hoops in order to access a black market. Two, the risk is really, really high. That is to say what Clement tells you, that there's likely to be house exploitation. It's hugely unlikely that people bank exorbitant sums of money if you know that there's no accountability mechanism for the house. You can't report it to the government if they just don't give you your millions of dollars. This is fundamentally why massive forms of gambling that lead to incentives such as fixing games is likely to fade away on our side. But lastly, here's the way. Even if there is a black market and rich people who have access to this black market are able to fix games, on our side, we insulate average people with the most to lose from the worst harms of this abuse. Even average people who care a lot have an asymmetry of power at the state. That's to say the state has the relative ability to stop them from accessing these black markets in the way that, like, in the, even if they can't for, like, people who are exorbitantly rich. Which means that, insofar as they miss our case on insider trading, which is there's an asymmetry of information that means that poor people are often at an innate disadvantage, are financially dis-exploited in these circumstances, we protect these people the most. Try and move on, sure. Yeah, sure. You have a contradiction in your case. How can you people the most. Try and move on, sure. Yeah, sure. You have a contradiction in the case. How can you both analyze that people gamble on identity-based because of culture, but this is also a stepping stone into other forms of gambling? They'll actually stop if it's because of identity. You start because this is foundational to your identity. On your side of the house, as you gamble more, you realize you like the physical sensations and the dopamine it releases in your brain. As a result, this is a stepping stone. When we remove this on our side of the house, it is better. It's very, very simple. Okay, on big and"

I'm charitably offering them that mechanism. I think I have broadly four responses. The first is, I do not think this makes sense. Why do casinos need the net quality of the game to be higher to make money, insofar as they can already capitalize on the existing attention of sports? The maximum they are likely to do on their side is advertising, but they're not likely to fund to make these teams better, right? They just have no incentive to do this. It costs quite a bit of money. If anything, you want to maximize the attention on the teams that are already powerful and rich. Two, this is bad, though, because it means that the house now has greater leverage over teams as well as insider information insofar as they are the ones funding them. Now companies have disproportionate power and leverage to financially influence people under this setting. Three, the comparative of what people do with their money is better, which is, at the point at which you do not gamble, what you are likely to do with this money is fund these clubs, is fund these small clubs that you care about, instead of betting you channel this into support, such as buying this merch. Notably, this is likely to include smaller clubs, since people's support is not based on how rich the club is, but, for example, your national origin, or whether this is culturally important to you. Three, finally, this is obviously a smaller harm than gambling since these costs are finite and distributed over many people."

I want to just note the extremely unstrategic stance Team China took in this debate. Their answer to our POI and P1 was that they would gladly ban every form of gambling. Notice the amount of both political and monetary capital mistakes on their side, a.k.a. the same fiat we have access to. We're very glad to use this fiat to, for example, fund anti-addiction initiatives, workshops in schools, rehab centers for people who might fear getting addicted, more just public conversations about this addiction.

              "text": "With this done, let's move on to the clashes. First clash then on the sport itself. Our claim here was very simple, though our claim here was very simple, right? So sports betting is a uniquely profitable industry with a huge amount of capital. This means they likely sponsor individual teams and leagues, right? Why is this true? First of all, you can see it being true from the status quo, like every football player wearing Germania all over like shirts because it's a famous sports betting company. And obviously, these companies have the incentive to do it because players watching that might get into sports gambling from them. That's just how marketing works. This leads to a huge amount of revenue for those leagues and for those teams. Without this revenue, everything from those teams becomes 10 times more expensive. First of all, merch, just the things people buy, like, because they want to support their local team. The football jerseys, the shoes, whatever. Secondly, streaming to watch the game at home has to become much more expensive at the point that leagues lose more money in advertising. Thirdly, tickets, getting into the event itself in real life. And fourthly, even bars. You can't just go to a game and, like, watch the game for free at a bar because at the point where the bar has to pay much more money to stream it, their services also become much more expensive. So you lose money even if you try to go out to watch it. No. Secondly, then, what's the response? They have two things that loosely came out in P3, nothing before. Firstly, they claim, aha, what's the incentive of these companies? Obviously, the incentive of everyone that has ever marketed to get people to buy your services, that's why you put out marketing. And secondly, they claim that these industries can be substituted by other industries that can market themselves instead of gambling agencies. Why isn't this true? Because gambling, like sports betting, pays specifically a high amount to leagues because they have a uniquely high profit margin as an industry. Their costs are extremely low because they only have to maintain online sites or vending machines for gambling tickets, and the bets are obviously placed so that the house always wins. For this reason, they have amount, they have access to a uniquely high amount of capital that they can use for this sponsor like these things. Sure. Guys, show them what we have. We have two people here who vending and gambling. We don't have to run a motion. We simply find a couple who have You dug your grave in P1 Sure you don't have to But you have to prove to us if you don't Why it's a uniquely dangerous form of gambling Sports betting And why you shouldn't ban all other forms of gambling Insofar as you answered that you should, I'm going to take that as your model. Sorry. Okay. What's their positive content here? They only have this point about like games likely to be fixed. Okay. We have a lot of responses to this, right? Firstly, we have the same capacity to take edge these games as propositions, right? Because if you cannot find out in the status quo that Messi missed on purpose like one of his goals, you can't find out if like a Russian rich guy paid him to lose a game."

Secondly, on the incentive of the players. They have no incentive to do this because they are rich. On proposition, you claim they are risk-averse when they don't want to risk injury, right? Because they want to keep their time in the game. So obviously, to keep all the time they have in the game, they don't want to ruin their reputation by being known as a bad player who loses games seemingly on purpose, right? It's the same type of incentive. Also, you just asserted that these people probably have five years in the league. That's ridiculous."

They won't be invited to judge Worlds or to judge, like, the Euro Cup if you're, like, a super bad judge that consistently makes bad calls. Also, we flip their analysis, right? Because when gambling is legal, there is a focus on preventing rigging. Once gambling is made illegal, this is a smokescreen that they will use on your side, not to catch these super rich guys likely rigging these games. And also, another key piece of rebuttal we've told you, this is just a huge risk for the fixer, right? For two reasons. First of all, you can get scammed by the team you're supposedly bribing, because both of you are doing something illegal, you can't report them to the police for not purposely losing the game. And secondly, you're just unsure of the outcome. You can't perfectly fix a game because the other team might just also play very poorly or very well. You just can't be sure of this. Okay, with this done, let's get on to the key way of this clash. So if clubs lose more money, this means players are paid less. So there's a higher incentive to rig games on their side, like if they lose the revenue from this capital that they have. That means on their side, effectively, every game is rigged and by logical priority, the sport just becomes worse on your side. Let's weigh our point on accessibility, why it's so key in this debate. A very, very key think panel. Sports are a huge part of the identities of people, right? That's what connects you to your nation, watching your nation on the World Cup. That's what connects you to the hometown, having your personal league in the country, having your personal team in the country league. Your dad probably took you to football games when you were younger. You feel a connection to your family and to your community through this. This means so much to you, which means you'll likely do two things once it becomes more inaccessible to you to watch these games. You can devote a lot of money to it which we prove which like we flip up uh propositions analysis this is their best case win even if people stop gambling on their side they lose a lot of money because they keep watching these sports which are more expensive on their side and secondly since most people don't have this amount of money they just lose this huge value from their life they lose this cultural value they lose this thing that connects them to their communities This is a horrible thing that happens on their side Okay"

They characterize gamblers extremely like they're willing to Gamble hundreds of thousands of dollars, gamble their houses away, gamble everything their life away But we're willing to go along with this analysis. What are we seeing within this clash? Three things. Firstly, that sports betting is the best type of betting. We've never received much response on this. Firstly, because it's a lower frequency. You likely, I took a point, stop doing that. Firstly, you likely bet only on teams you know personally or care about personally, so you bet at a lower frequency. And secondly, we've told that there are higher caps, or lower caps in sports betting because the high amount of people betting on the same game. And secondly, we've told that people are not likely to go further in gambling for four reasons. Firstly, the casuals obviously don't go further because they're casuals. Both sides can see this. Secondly, because you're regulated by your friends. Sports are a social thing, so you go out to do them with your friends. You can't really do that at a casino or you're not likely at the point of date with your prior tradition. Thirdly, you yourself say there is a huge stigma regarding casinos in the status quo, so I'm not sure how on your side this flip happens, how you can claim this on our side. And fourthly, we flip this point, because notice what happens on site proposition. Once these gambling sites can't advertise anymore, other forms of gambling, other forms like casinos, poker, whatever, they now market way more to capture this demand that's left hanging in the air. So likely on their side, people are more coerced to go into gambling just from this higher amount of advertising. And the only response will be straight to our third black market point, just ignoring our mechanism. It doesn't matter if people are averse to illegal activities if you're likely invited to this black market from your friends who you trust. And it doesn't matter if there's a high risk of you not getting your payout because as you've said, the gambler's fallacy states that you only gamble when you think that you can win. So black markets are obviously still a point that stands on our side and harms people who persistently gamble on theirs."

So we push to you clear things, and to our first argument, first, at least draw a minute, and say that we don't have any mechanisms, but the mechanism is clear. Casinos give money to clubs for advertisements, not only that, like gambling agencies and things. And this is not like some certain model. This is literally the status quo, what is happening currently and a huge source of funds for many clubs and games. Secondly also, their only sort of competitive reply to this argument comes to us in the third speech, where they say, oh, but cost is spread out. But we're talking about billions of dollars. People compensate for this. And even if it is spread out, it is a lot of money that is still missing from the clubs that people and watchers and viewers have to compensate for, which is detrimental.

Firstly, there's a counter-model, where there's forbidden advertisement near schools, certain, like, worries of governments. Secondly, when the ban happens, gambling agencies capitalize and advertise to fill the role, meaning that casinos of,inos of other gambling will advertise, which is much more detrimental and will prove to you much less regulated, and you have to invest way more money, way more accessible to you, and it's not seasonable. Fourthly, even if we do push people a little, it is the least detrimental form of gambling which we prove to you, and another thing they haven't fulfilled is their burden of proof.

Four ways and four reasons why this cannot be their path to victory and let them win this round. Firstly, they never proved incentive. Where it's unclear why the NBA getting more money makes more money for the casino, since oftentimes it's already very profitable. So there's no cost-benefit analysis of investing more money into this because it's uncertain whether or not you actually get more money back into your gambling industry. Secondly, they never proved uniqueness, where it's unclear why sports are so underfunded massively to a degree that this is a problem. And secondly, that it doesn't clear why other companies don't have an incentive to do this. Companies like Nike, companies that make like game jerseys, who have the same incentive to make money off sports teams and the fans that watch. But thirdly, intuition check this, right? Which sports team's whole budget comes from casino companies? There's only a sliver of their budget. So even if you lose out of this, you don't get the massive effects on their side of the house because it will increase cost a little bit, right? But it's not going to be an unforbiddable degree. Like paying five euros extra to watch a sports game is going to be the dealability thing to its fans but fourthly Alicia told you how this money goes to useless things advertising for gambling not actually helping these corporations and helping these sports teams so we think that's harmful but even if you fully credit this argument the impacts here are incredibly marginal what are a few more million dollars to a billion dollar sports industry that already exists they never illustrated the degree to this actually benefiting them.

              "text": "case step. First on bettors and second on game fixing. On bettors, we had a pretty clear case on how sports gambling is uniquely harmful to the subset of people who are vulnerable to this. Off then asked two questions. First, why is sports unique? We told you that sports is unique because sports gamblers, different from other gamblers, gamble for different reasons. They gamble where they have strong ties to the teams. They gamble because it's about nationality, it's about the passion that they have, and it's about their particular set of interests, because they like sports more than games like blackjack. So it isn't true that all gamblers just gamble for the sake of gambling. There's also their analysis feeds into ours, where they say there's massive advertising on our side of the house that coerce and pressure these sports fans at their own games to gamble on these games in a large degree. But secondly, they say, why wouldn't you just gamble on something else? But we told you how oftentimes there's a social stigma against other types of gambling, so you're actually going to automatically go into the casino. Their case is also extremely bizarre. I don't think it's so easy to gamble on other things. There's heavy regulations on casinos in most countries. Actually, most countries don't have casinos, don't allow them to exist. There isn't an easy alternative in most cases. But on weighing, what matters in this debate is simple. What is worse? All of us paying 10 euros more to watch games because sports leagues are slightly poor, or Bo personally losing a thousand dollars or a thousand euros on gambling because he himself is vulnerable. We say the disproportionate harm to one individual is more than slight benefits to everybody else."

              "text": "Secondly then, on game fixing. They haven't sufficiently responded to the idea that bribery is going to exist because the potential for massive profit incentivizes people to do illegal things. Their responses were severalfold. Firstly, they said there's too much risk. But we've shown you how the risk is very low because you're not going to get caught. And secondly, the benefits outweigh risk, right? And and you'll be rich so who cares if you can't play these sports anymore right again if they paid me a million dollars to throw this match for team croatia i would do it and gladly not ever do a wsdc round again because who cares about reputation when you can already retire but secondly regulations exist was their response but what regulations are they talking about right like it's a reasonable concern for us to ask what exactly are they gonna do to stop umpires from taking drives like are you gonna have somebody watching each umpire each player it is unreasonable and unrealistic model on their side of the house that they can't just be off works but thirdly they say that the black market exists but we already proved against this because while gamblers want to win and the gambler fallacies that you want to win so you bet you also also want to ensure that when you win, you get the benefits out of it, which is why our analysis of risk of not getting your winnings is particularly important. This outweighs all of the impacts, because if games are fixed, it harms every stakeholder in this debate. It harms the principle of fairness that they also talk about. It harms fans, because games aren't interesting if teams aren't playing in a fair competitive sphere and they throw games away. It is harmful to athletes, which is a stakeholder they completely don't engage with in this debate. We think this is a very, very clear of opposition ballots because they haven't proved sufficiently why there's a benefit to sports betting that exists in society against all the harms that we told you about. I'm very proud to propose."

In the status quo, we think sport betting is a massive industry that has zero or very little regulation. Because the sport industry itself is glorified by media plus the normalization of this culture. I will explain this later. We'll prove why the government needs to take a stand and take action to protect individuals. The true comparative on their side of this debate is that no individuals is harmed if they don't sport bet. They have to tell us the tangible harm of individuals not being able to bet on their favorite players."

              "end": 481,
              "text": "Onto my first argument on why this is a form of self-harming. First, how does sport betting look like? We think before a match, you can go onto websites, you can bet on like the local bar, you can bet on local like places that you watch sport with. Because know that sport itself is a competitive and it's like a game sport. So you never watch it alone in your house, on your couch. We think you watch in like bars, you watch in areas that have a lot of people. Know that the method in which you can sport bet is extremely easy. You can just go to websites. They don't even bother to check your identification. You can just give money to some, to like, I don't know, like the bartender at the bar to bet on your favorite team. This takes really casual form because, and then therefore, government cannot take action because people undermine the harms that they have. But also note that this form of casual is very different because in order for you to go to a casino or go to Las vegas for example this takes even more this takes more resources and i'll explain later on why uh why why why sport betting is uniquely bad but two why do people bet then we think because we think it is the culture of the culture of sport itself because because when you watch sport your your mentality and the mental state of yourself has already been, you've been like thrilled and you're just so passionate. You're just so enthusiastic for this player. At first, you might bet for fun, but because this culture is so normalized that you will eventually join because note that you never watch sports alone. So eventually people will, your friends or the people you meet at the bar will eventually say, oh, like, why don't you bet on this player? this player just twenty dollars for example because you're so caught up in the fun you thought oh why shouldn't i bet it's just twenty dollars right but also you think that this is a good opportunity for you to gain some money because you because you yourself think that consider yourself to be a huge fan because you consider that oh i know a lot about this player i've been their fans for like 10 years so you think that this is a I know a lot about this player. I've been their fan for like 10 years. So you think that this is a very low risk and high return way to get money. Thirdly, a third thing under this argument is why are these usually uninformed decisions? Because first of all, sports betting companies are extremely big. They're profit maximizing. And note that they sponsor and they have investment to certain football club. So therefore, they have the incentive to hide or not display all information and know that they usually have like assessment about a team. Like, oh, there's a 70% chance that this certain football team will win. Or we think that because they have a streak of very good performance, they're still gonna, they're gonna win this match. But know that when you lose lose they're the one who gets the money this is their incentive to hide information and to lure you into this trap of gambling so therefore we think companies control how you think it's never your independent decisions of i like this team store but it's their scheme and in their scheme in controlling what team sport that you bet for. But secondly, it's just the nature of sport. Because sports is a human-based performance field. We think with stocks, it's much more stable because you have a lot of index, you have a lot of government regulation, you have a lot of information and data. So you have better information because it's less arbitrary. But thirdly, not that little regulation is also very harmful because when you watch sports, you focus on the fun. Therefore, government don't really regulate it, but it's also very hard to regulate it. But know that we think that there's no official body that controls the financial transactions surrounding sport betting. With stock market, you have the SEC. With Las Vegas, casinos, you have rules, you have regulations of government. But in sport bet, it is impossible to impose these things. But why is regulation an important impact of this debate? With regulation, this is a government action in asserting the stance. And also note that these are protective measures."

This is the adrenaline rush that you enjoy so much that you conceptualize that betting is part of watching sports itself. It is not the process of watching the game, but it's more like you thinking that, oh, I need to bet for this team in order for the sport to be fun. Even if you don't consciously think so, we think there's an unconscious bias, there's an unconscious habit of you doing so every time you watch a sport. But also note that because the sport industry is so permanent, the channels of addiction is also massive. You can take loans very easily from pawn shops, from high-interest rate organizations or whatever. Because note that these are regulations. These are the places where you take loans from are extremely shady. Because you cannot go to a bank and take loans from them because no bank would give you loans for sport betting. But before I go on, sure. Would you ban all forms of speculation or opinion polls on your side of the house? Can you say that again? Would you ban all forms of speculation or opinion polls on your side of the house? Can you say that again? Would you ban more speculation or opinion polls on your side? No, the difference is that that's not your opinion, but it's just company scheme. But we also think that it's just a much more riskier field. I'll continue and this will engage with their POI. But no, this is a snowball effect because at first you start with $20 and then it accumulates over time. Therefore, people make uninformed decisions because of the externalities, which is also their want to redeem. After you lose, you don't think, oh, I'm going to stop there, but you just want to continue. But why is government interference so important? Because we think when government cannot inform you every information,"

Therefore, people harass, force them to commit hooligan, because when they lose, the amount of frustration they have is so much more higher. And all of these will be elaborated by my second speaker.

Apps like Fantasy Football or Dream11, where you're often doing things like making rosters, betting on the performance of these teams. But second, it's also institutions. So for example, in F1 races, you give money to your authorities there to give you money if your team ends up winning the race, for example. What are the characteristics of this? Firstly, it's one formal network. But two, there's a large pool of users, so they often have a very big amount of money to actually use for betting. And thirdly, and this is important, they are often large companies tied up with leaks and they often show large corporation ads. This looks like how Dream11 ads come in every single IPL screening 500 times. And the meaning of that is that often, you as a corporation who is doing sports betting have very high visibility. And I want to note the implication of this on their case. Not exclusively, there is a strong push to actually regulate these companies because they are often tied up with huge reputable corporations, literally the entire week, which means that you don't want to be spreading blatant lies because it's going to hurt other corporations that are tied up with these betting companies. Our compadre then is we're not going to ban these institutions. We're going to continue existing regulation. And notice crucially, you can't hide things like information because of the level of scrutiny that is on these companies. So firstly, we're going to provide clear information on the paths that are available. So exactly, how much money are you giving? Exactly, if you win, how much money are you getting back? These are clear paths of information that are given. Secondly, clear statistics on performance are available. You can go on ESPN if you don't want to look at this app, but even on the app, you can see the history of these players. Thirdly, terms and conditions. This means you have to give this money back and you can raise complaints if you're not. Fourthly, we can also do things that regulate coercive ads. So you can't say that you'll become a millionaire if you use Dream11, for example, because if you do lie about these things, it is a state scandal. The entire league is going to have its reputation at stake. But the second type of ways in which you do sports betting is one they actually can't ban on their side. The types of betting that you do with your friends. When you go to the boxing match, the backroom betting that you're doing is not done by a corporation. You can't ban on their side. The types of betting that you do with your friends. When you go to the boxing match, the backroom betting that you're doing is not done by a corporation. You can't actually ban that. Or shady sets that are like the startup on their side that are private URLs that you're sending on the internet."

              "text": "Two arguments then from Team India. Firstly, on the principle of choice. Secondly, on the black market betting being far more harmful. But before that, I want to do two pieces of rebuttal. Firstly, on their overall case. Panel, listen to the examples they keep giving. The thing they want to talk about is giving money to the guy at the bar, or money that you're using with your friends. How exactly are they banning this? Because I don't think the government can station an officer in every single bar, or in every single home when you're watching a TV match on your TV. Really, all they can ban is the apps. And all of this informal stuff is going to continue happening on their side of the house. So we needed a line in that speech about how they're actually banning these things. And I want to note why this is important. If you buy all of their characterization that these sports betting are incredibly coercive, that there's peer pressure, you're still doing it on their side. But you're doing it on a more shady website. It's a random website that doesn't actually have to guarantee that it's giving your money back. We think it is far worse. But on their principle, I'll do the nitty-gritty rebuttal in my argument. But really extend their principle battle. Should you ban anything that makes you feel excited, anything that does influence your fear pressure, anything that you don't have enough information on? Because their little thing about the stock market doesn't really work. We don't think governments are giving you information on every single company. Often, you're choosing which stocks to invest on, based on what people are seeing on Twitter. It's a new stock that you don't actually have that information on. If you really extend their principle, they would want to ban the stock market, but they don't because they recognize governments do not have the ability to restrict how you spend your money, and that is the principle we're going to run in this debate. Our first argument then on the principle of choice. And the first thing I want to do in this principle is tell you that often these are informed choices that people are able to make. That despite the rush, often you channel that rush in a good way and make good decisions. Firstly, because often, you just do have a lot of information. We think the types of people who are betting the most are more experienced fans. And not exclusively. The unique thing about sports is that you have so much information on it. ESPN gives you the entire history of every single player on the team. There's literally statistics calculated by really, really strong algorithms by the league itself. There's detailed analysis by commentators of the trajectory of the team, of the choices and strategies that they have to make in the match. So, not exclusively, it's not just a choice you're making. You're making it alongside experienced commentators. They make it seem like a bad thing, but these are often people who have more experience in the field to begin with. But secondly, even then, not exclusively, sports is an investment you're making, knowing that it's unpredictable. You know that there's a 50% chance that you're not going to win. You know that if there's a random goal at the end of the match, you may lose. People who are watching sports for a long time know that it's unpredictable. You go and take that risk with you to begin with. And thirdly, the unique thing about sports is that it's endless. Which is why you can't compare this to things like banning drugs. Because once the competition is over, or your team is knocked out, you're not going to do sports betting anymore and that means that it's not addictive in the way that, for example, drugs are to begin with. Formal networks of sports betting like apps and institutions strengthen this. They increase the information you have. They actually increase the data that you can make more informed choices of to begin with. But at our worst, let us say this is not an informed choice which is their best case. We still think that it's important that you have the choice to do sports betting and this deals with their claim which is their best case, we still think that it's important that you have the choice to do sports betting. And this deals with their claim, which is that people gain nothing from doing sports betting. We just think this is absolutely false. One, often it's the way you can engage with the game. Talent is not spread equally. Not everyone can be playing on the ground in a stadium. But you do feel like you have a stake in the game when you are betting. The fear you feel on the ground when the goal is hit by the other team. The sense of victory you feel when you throw a basket. You can't feel that race of emotion if you're not on the ground and you allow people to actually feel that as a result of sports betting. You feel a unique sense of victory to begin with. Often this is a way that you can trust a player, show them that you're investing in them in a way that you can't by just watching these games to begin with. It is on our side that often you're able to get this form of benefits from sports betting. I want to really note why this is important. The state doesn't ban gambling, even though we think it is far worse than sports because you don't have proper information. The state doesn't ban the stock market, even though often we are making decisions off of just small-term instincts that we have. This is because the state recognizes that you should have the ability to make choices that you want to make, that make you happy, and we think this is just an extension of that, which is why we shouldn't ban this. Second argument, then, on the black market betting being far more harmful, I think you'd be right. When Apple has introduced their position, it is objecting to your investment, but what if a player is safe, or a judge is biased, and you give that information up front? We just don't think that's true, right? Who is this judge that is biased in sports? We think you can see all the past matches they've played, all the strategies that they've used. Second argument, then, on the black market betting being more harmful. And the impact of this argument is everything that they say is far worse on their side if a black market forms. We think a black market is going to be formed. Often it's an ingrained culture to do betting. Often there's a huge amount of money US corporations can make off of this. So we think two things happen on their side. Firstly, you create smaller informal networks on their side in the form of websites, for example, or IRL networks where often you go to boxing matches and you do bathroom betting, because people are still doing that on the ground, the government can't really find out about that. And you often can't close these things. Informal networks, the government just has no idea it's happening. But even in the case of like shady websites online, often you don't know that these are, there's so many of them popping up, especially in large competitions, you can't shut all of them down. Why do we think people are going to opt into the black market? First, let's talk about hardcore fans who are affected by the peer pressure and coercion that they want to talk about so much. These are individuals actively seeking to do betting because they want to engage in the game to begin with. This is not a minority of people. But secondly, even in the case of moderate fans, when you go to a pub and all of your friends are betting, that peer pressure still applies to you. You think you're still doing it on their side. Why is it harmful then that these are worse? Firstly, they are not regulated. So that is the situation when you don't have to give proper information on statistics. You can do bad advertisements. You can say you're going to become a millionaire if you actually invest in our thing. And we also think in terms of informal networks that are in person, these are also far, far worse. It increases the risk that people on the ground are able to lie to you about the teams. They're able to tell you that they have some special information about the hard speed that one team is getting and that means you're likely to make worse bets on theirs in the house because you don't have accurate information to begin with. But also, we think it increases the risk that you don't get your money back. On the competitive, we go to formal networks which actually ensure that you're getting your money back, which actually give you far more data to begin with to make better bets for all these reasons we're incredibly proud to propose. Is this volume okay for everyone? Panel, when gamblers and sports bettors have to"

              "text": "Two extensions, actually no, three extensions in my speech. First is on the nature of sports betting and why that is actively harmful. Panel, we think that sports itself is incredibly volatile because of the fact maybe the weather is making your horse being trippy, or because of the fact that the new car model makes Charles Lecter suddenly flop in his new race, for example. Many of those things are beyond the individual's self-owned control. This isn't just a player between the strengths of the opposition team but rather we think there are crucially so many aspects that's changing the tide or changing the results of a game itself that's why it's so incredibly unpredictable because maybe the health of the health or the mentality of that player in a certain round is going to massively change the way that it's going to turn out but But beyond just uncontrollable factors, we think currently sports is an incredibly unfair game where many governments themselves also heavily endorse various players. This looks like, for example, the Russian government having like sneaking steroids into their own Olympics athletes. Although there are many regulations on the government currently, we think that the fact that sports itself is heavily politicalized already means that this is an unfair battle for people to actually put money on. But secondly, is that we know to you on how this hump is going to be exponentially larger as people become more addicted to it. The reason being, initially, I may spend $20 into the sports betting. Then I'm able to predict some form of the players winning or losing. I feel normalized to the fact that I am winning, sports betting then i'm like able to predict some form of the players like winning or losing i feel normalized to the fact that i am winning and i feel like i have some sense of control over the outcome or i'm able to predict it but the problem with that then is you are more likely to make riskier decisions as you view these games as you become more addicted to this hobby that's why the impact of people losing money is going to snowball over time that they may say that well you can't have information that these people um about the rates that these people have in the past, but the problem is that the harms, you only know that you're betting into the wrong team only when you have already lost the amount of cash that you have deposited in there. And we think this is an incredibly harmful panel. Our PM already flagged to you various impacts of why this is detrimental to individuals' lives. We have not heard an explicit response from opposition team yet, but I'll just reinforce it then."

              "text": "Firstly, you've just fundamentally lost money. All this money that you've acquired through your own hard work is now being poured into an incredibly arbitrary game. But to the point where individuals are not aware of the circumstances of many factors that are influencing that result, people are harming themselves and their own well-being. Secondly, because of the fact that you cannot loan from any banks in order to promote such a risky hobby, you're likely going to seek out shady alternatives where they're more likely to exploit you. This is like loan sharks that charge incredibly high rates, for example. That's why the impact here is there's going to be a perpetual cycle where you're unable to opt out of this sports betting hobby that you already included yourself into. Secondly then, is our idea about why this is going to harm the majority of the young people who are going to be involved in the sports betting. Before I go on, I'll take that point. Would you ban gambling? Oh sure, we would ban gambling to the point where it is going to make many people having to live on the streets where they are unable to escape from the debt cycle that they are in. We think that's where the government needs to step in and needs to protect those people. The reason why the stock market is a banned panel is because literally you spend four to five years in college studying about this thing that you're going to put your money into, and many of them are already young and informed adults. We think that due to the fact that they're able to calculate and see many of the rates on the market at the moment is a fundamental difference between sports betting and many of these stock market itself. Our PM already flagged to you that many of these companies are also able to have a chokehold on the information that they're spreading out. They're going to have malicious incentives and they're also likely to hide those information whatsoever. Secondly, it's on young people and why this is incredibly harmful to them. Two layers of characterization. Firstly, they just have far more time to engage into watching sports. That's the main audience of sports currently because they grew up being exposed to many things like the NBA, the NFL, or esports in general. Secondly, they are far more impressionable, meaning that they're likely to be influenced by many things like sports influencer, and that's why they're likely to make riskier decisions as they go on. We think that many betting companies are likely to have incentives to cater to them because it's far easier to manipulate them. They're far more vulnerable. And they also want to tap into new markets and expand their consumer base as a whole. What is going to end up happening is that you're going to make it become even more accessible to young people. Like, for example, when I pirate and I watch Frozen, I also see a lot of advertisements on sports betting on those websites as a whole. This is incredibly important because to the point where our PM proved to you that many of these companies have a chokehold and a power asymmetry over the information and the ability for them to infiltrate into people's mentality, this means that more young people are likely going to be participating into these sports. Why is this bad then? Due to our previous mechanisms on why sports itself is so volatile, now that you're going to, like, this unfair game is being rigged, when you lose money, it's far worse for them. Because firstly, these people are not financially stable yet, panel. Even one of our team members is an avid sports veteran, and he's like 16. We think that because you're catering to such young audiences in the status quo, this is incredibly dangerous. Because these people are not people who are, like, able to have cash to spare, who are able to bear the cost of losing a bet afterwards. We think this is all so likely to be in a perpetual cycle because now I lost money. I'm constantly scared and I want to get that money back, which means that I'm likely to invest into future sports events as well. So that is why this is going to be like a self-reinforcing cycle. But secondly, is that this is a to be like a self-reinforcing cycle. But secondly, is that this is a cycle of addiction that hinders the ability to balance with their daily lives as well. Maybe I started sports betting as a hobby when I was in university, but now I'm going to make this and jeopardize my own academic outcomes. Before I go on, I'll take that point. Will your stock market be good for investing in the stock market? Wait, sorry. Okay. We think that poor people are unlikely to be the ones who are going to cater to the stock market in the first place, but we think crucially, these people are likely going to be incredibly desperate people who are going to cater to things like sports betting due to how accessible that sport is in the first place. That's why we think many poor people are already also one of the people who are going to be heavily influenced and harmed under the status quo. Why is this so important then, panel? We think that the people who are going to be heavily influenced and harmed under the status quo. Why is this so important then, panel? We think that as young people are unable to have a balance between their own daily lives and the hobby that has gotten them into this massive toxic cycle in the first place, we think the state needs to protect them. Because the sheer quantity of people who are going to be harmed here is massive. This looks like thousands of students who are going to join into sports betting simply because they perceive it to be a casual activity, but many of their peers are coercing them into. But secondly, is that we think that this is going to be, but secondly, is that these people are incredibly vulnerable because they don't have a lot of financial room to spare, and that's why they're going to especially haunt in the first place. Why does this weigh over the argument about the black market then? We think that as you have the black market although there's going to be hardcore sports player who are going to be pouring their money into which we think that you can't really be helped on either side at least we're able to significantly reduce the amount of like coverage and the amount of control that they have over the exposure of information that they have on young"

              "text": "Two clashes in this speech. First, is this principally just? Second, which side is better for sports fans? First, let's talk about the principle. Our case was clear. This is a legitimate choice for people to make and the state can't take that away from you. What is the pushback we receive from them? The first thing they say is, this is a really addictive choice. But there really is no mechanism here. They don't prove to you why it's addictive. The average person works really hard for their money. They save away 9 to 5 in their corporate office. They recognize the value of that money. They know that they need to provide for their family as well. So we don't think just because you happen to be in a bar or just because your friend is telling you that betting is really fun, they recognize the value of that money. They know that they need to provide for their family as well. So we don't think just because you happen to be in a bar or just because your friend is telling you that betting is really fun, you're going to actually risk all of your life saving suddenly. This cannot be their only mechanism. But the second and more important thing they hinge their case on, and these are sites that hide information from you and you're making these decisions to the last, so you're making uninformed choices. The first thing I want to point out is all of the issues with websites are issues with websites we can correct. You can regulate it to mandate that sites provide you that information, show you past performance, show you track records. Obviously in this debate, if the Political Capital Institute ban on these corporations that have so much power within the government, we at least have the ability to say these regulations work. But the second thing is, even if you don't buy the regulations point panel, I just think there is competition in StarScore. The fact that there are so many betting websites that are able to exist formally, because they know this is a big industry, means that you have a competitive incentive to be the one that offers the most information, to be the most reliable one, so you have more people opting into you as opposed to another site. If there is a site that is exploitative and taking more commissions, I don't think there are a large number of people that want to go to that site. But finally, often when you are sports betting, even if there is a site that is exploitative and taking more commissions, I don't think there are a large number of people that want to go to that site. But finally, often when you are sports betting, even if it is an informal setting, you are part of a larger sporting culture and are following the game. So you probably know information. Even if that information isn't perfect, we think that's still fine because you consent to knowing that sports is unpredictable. You consent to knowing that there are things you can't control, there are factors that you just don't know about. And in status quo, we already allow individuals to speculate and make decisions that are unpredictable. That is why we have the stock market. And honestly, panel, their response is, yeah, you studied this in college. The average person who puts money in the stock market isn't a person who studies economics in college. My father bets in the stock market, panel. I can tell you he doesn't know what he's doing. Leaving on their side, there are so many factors outside their control in other choices as well. You don't know if a company shorting a stock, if that means the stock is going to go down in the next two months. This means that on a status quo, we already allow these kinds of choices to exist. Importantly, because the state can't pass value judgments on how you spend your money. It is your money at the end of the day. If you gain enjoyment from sports betting, which we think you do in a lot of instances because you're able to win fan cultures around it, because you feel like you're part of the game, there is a legitimate choice for you to make. They're not showing you why that's not the case. And it's ways over there practical as well because we already allow choices that might be harmful for individuals."

I want to be nuanced in this debate panel, because I think there are a variety of types of fans that exist, not just the characterization they want to talk about. So firstly, there are often a lot of moderate fans. And here, their case collapses. Because these are not fans that are risking their life savings. These are not fans that are getting trapped in cycles of gambling, because they recognize the harms of this. They recognise that there is money at stake. But second, let's talk about the fans that they wanted to talk about, the addicted fans, the fans who want to engage in sports betting because that's the only way you can enjoy a sports panel. If that's the case, I suspect they still want to bet and that's when they turn to shady sites. They can't track on their site panel. It's really hard for governments to individually trigger.. You don't know when another site pops up. That's when they turn to informal bar networks. And it's not enough to say, well, you can't really pay poker in public. That still happens in status quo panel illegally. A lot of police officers will have no idea this is happening because this is not something the bar is advertising. The bar isn't approaching police officers to participate in their gambling ring. It is obviously doing this in ways that are covert. But at the same time, I also think this is generally really accessible. One, for these fans that really care, they will go out of their way to find these sites that exist. But second, often bars know to target them. Often because they tell you that you're watching sports in communal settings, it is really easy for gambling to pop up. So it's not this black market that's shady that no one knows about. It is a black market that most people know about, but governments cannot ban it. And I want to note the implication of this in their case, because I think it flips the entirety of it. One, you put more money into gambling when it happens in decentralized networks. This is because on our side, when you have the option to opt into like a formal setting, that's when you do that because that's just something that feels more safe. It is also just a lot more popular because there's a lot of advertisement around these platforms. On their side, you have decentralized, limited pools, which means that each individual person has to put more money into the pool. So they cared about people losing their savings. Their side encourages that. But secondly, we think there's just so many more risks that happen when you are in the black market. You don't know if you will get your money back. You don't know any form of information, which we think means they've turned their case on their head. They needed to respond to this argument. The one-line response, and we can still regulate it, doesn't work. My argument then in this debate on why we're also able to improve sports culture as a whole. I think there are three ways in which this occurs. Firstly, fan networks are simply more likely to exist as a result of formal sports betting. You can have forums on these websites to often discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different players. You also now deeply engage with the sport because you have the incentive to make an informed choice so you don't lose your money, which means that you go from being a passive fan who's just maybe watching the game in the background to a fan who actually knows what's going on, to a fan who's trying to seek out more information, and that's when you're able to meaningfully become part of the sports community. That can't happen on their side. But secondly, a lot of people are now engaging with sports based on statistics because that's what they're seeing every time they're making a bet. That's the regulation on our side. That means your favourite players are not just based on popularity cults or who gets the most coverage anymore but are based on actual performance. And this is performance that also takes into account their team contribution. So the number of assists they are making, the number of passes or defences they do. This means that not just the most popular players in a team but even underdogs are able to get a lot more attention from teams on our side when they see their contribution quantified. And I think this is really good because teams are forced to give platforms in a more equalised way. That means more players are able to move up the ranks. But finally and most importantly, Pamo, corporations have now an incentive to invest in local sports as well. This is because sports betting is also something that gets them a lot of money. You can earn in the form of commissions and often you can gain a lot of interest around a particular tournament that's happening and gain a lot of money as a corporation. And winning this means you want to increase the interest that is in local sports tournaments as well. This is why in India, we see Dream11 investing in the Subroto Cup. That means that they get their games televised. That means they want to platform individual players so they get more coverage. That means local sports is able to improve as a whole. And I want to note the importance of this. One, that means you're able to have a lot more accessible sports culture. Often the sports culture around larger tournaments, yes, while it's massive, it's not as accessible because not everyone is going to watch the FIFA games, right? We don't have the money to do so. It is when you develop local sports that people can engage with sports in a way that is more meaningful. You can actually go to watch the games because those are games that are accessible to them. But secondly, we think you improve the individual lives of the athletes. And I want to be clear, these are not the most privileged athletes. They're local players who would not be known on the count of actual. It is when you give corporations to prop them up as well, that you're able to make sure that they earn a living for themselves. That sports, what is generally a really unpredictable field, is a field they can make a career out of. At the end of the day, we're the side that protects individual choice and protects sports culture as a whole for all those reasons we're incredibly proud to oppose. Yeah. Okay, before I start, pronouns, they, them, and I just want to have a quick trigger warning because my opening line is a bit sensitive because it's a dark joke related to sports. So I'm just putting it out there. Yeah. Okay, my speech starts in 3, 2, 1. There's a really dark joke in Vietnam that goes,"

              "text": "I just want to take a step back, panel. We really need to ask ourselves, but why is sports betting so popular in the first place? Because just like think, like isn't the concept of gambling just simply insane? Like you know you probably won't win and yet you gaslight yourself into continuously wasting money into something that's going to just make you waste even more money right it's a self-perpetuating cycle that to a rational human being makes no sense but secondly right why did sports betting become so popular so quickly in the first place right because sports has always been popular because the nature of sports is exhilarating, it's engaging, it's competitive, that makes people want to watch it, that made people, like made business people see the potential of a gambling industry involved with sports in the first place. What is the conclusion of this panel? It's that sports betting has snuck its way into sports culture and has framed itself as the norm. It's framed itself as an expression of loyalty towards its club. Before sports betting was ever a phenomenon, people already liked sports. People never needed sports betting, right? It is only because of these massive institutions that team opposition themselves talked about that people feel the need to engage in sports betting in the first place because they've gaslit themselves and the industry has gaslit them into thinking like this is the right way to have fun in sports rather than just simply enjoying a beer with your friends over a losing match. So why is this so important? Because this just completely demolishes the entirety of team opposition's case because their analysis is completely reliant on this premise is that in a vacuum people already want to bet. We are doing literally just proved to you about why it is people only want to bet because the betting industry is so prominent because it tells them that betting is the right way to go in the first place in the first place but now I'll be more charitable engage with the analysis one month one so firstly right let's just talk about"

The final conclusion of their logic is, presumably, we should completely legalize meth, cocaine, all of the drugs out there, because the Mexican cartel would, like, take advantage of the black market, right? But thirdly, right, like, opposition is pretending that the betting industry isn't already shady, right? Like, it looks like, sure, there might be institutions, like, there might be massive institutions, whatever. But it's, like, in fact, this popularity that allows for smaller grassroots. I can't think of another word, so I'll just use grassroots. Grassroots, like, smaller websites to pop up. And they talk about these massive examples. But in Vietnam, it's not about those things. It's about, like, Bet88 that you've probably never heard of because it's not about those things it's not like bet 88 bet 88 that you probably never heard of because it's only popular within vietnam and it is these smaller companies that engages with the most vulnerable stakeholders i.e young adults because the barriers of entry are so low and because there's so little regulation because how on earth can the government regulate these smaller companies right and this leads to them taking out loans from loan sharks"

But like, I'm just gonna really ask, how are you gonna regulate people spending money? Because presumably, if your analysis on the principle to spend money in the first place, well like I'm just gonna really ask how are you gonna regulate people spending money because presumably if your analysis on the principle to spend money in the first place however you want then presumably you should allow them to commit fully to their addiction but certainly you should allow them to snowball into just spending more and more money into a crystal palace that's honestly never gonna win the Premier League right but now it's actually the next they tell us about that ah it leads to be like people moving up the ranks like leads to be like people moving up the ranks like let's wait like let's really look at analysis here line by line right because like no panel a club actually doesn't make money out of a popular player and in fact the public like oftentimes managers and coaches hate this popular player because they have a massive ego because whenever they make money they make money for themselves rather than the entire club. What they do make money out of, you know, is wins and success as a team. And that's what gives them incentive to maximize talent investment, which leads to them, like, looking at smaller clubs to find potential rising talents there or just investing into the entire club because sports, like, you need everybody involved to be at the best of their capacity in order to get the Premier League championship, right? And this is the analysis, like, this just completely washes out the case. So let's engage with the most important point from your speech. Before I move on, P.O.I., please. In the original call, the guy who spent money on the league was the guy who said, you know, we're generally thinking about financial aid. Why should we take debt to the chicken when it's the national decision to take it? Gotcha, gotcha. I'm going to grab that now. The principle on, like. Why should we say that you're a chicken? What is the irrational decision you're making? Gotcha, gotcha. I'm going to grab that now. The principle on choice or happiness, whatever they're calling it, right? Note, panel, that their principle is incredibly hung on the idea of info and whatnot. But no, most people aren't professional bettors. In fact, casual fans that have fallen into addiction follow into the coercion of this industry in the first place. And they tell us that, ah, you have a lot of info. Ah, you invest knowing that it's unpredictable. Sure, we're going to concede with that. But the flip is this, panel, is that ultimately none of these things matter because sports is so unpredictable. Like Hamilton, my goat, recently won out of nowhere."

We think the government on our side of the house always had the power to make sure you got the information, always had the power that the most manipulative advertisements were ones that were already taken down from the public sphere. We did not have to support what they pushed on us. The second thing I want to move is that they have not actually proven the burden of their impact in this debate either.

              "text": "First question, on which side is sports betting that addictive and coercive? At the top of the speech, I just want to note in this clash, on us in the house, we would rather the government engage in a balance of rights. So we think there are some people who engage in sports betting because they truly do want to, because it does make sports a lot more fun for them. And some might be slightly coerced into it but sure I want to know the government can do our responsibility and our side of the house by making sure that the information is actually provided that we are actually able to stop explicit manipulation on our side of the house. If it was about government obligation we're decided to balance both the obligations the government has but let's then take out the unique responses they gave to you regarding why it is that sports betting is actually so bad. First, sports is volatile. It's out of your control. Guess what? So is the smart stock market. You cannot predict which company is going to go down. You cannot predict which recession is going to happen. And uniquely, the difference is people know that the sports is volatile when you're going into it. You know for a fact that your team might win, your team might lose. You know exactly how much money you might make, how much money you might lose. So any contract might have risks, might have harms. We think sports being volatile is not a metric for whether or not we allow people to make the decision. Second, on sports being exhilarating. Panel, that just sounds like them having an issue with sports being fun in the first place. I get a dopamine rush from taking chocolate. That does not mean that it becomes addictive on us at the house. If people just want to have fun, they should have the ability to put money into something they find fun or exhilarating. We don't really know why exhilaration means that it becomes incredibly addictive. The third thing they told you was that it becomes so normalized that advertisements are going to be so manipulative on us at the house. And apart from the response and regulation, two reasons why we don't think advertisements are that manipulated. One, the fact that those advertisements exist within the visible public sphere means that you're able to call them out. So when you, for instance, lie about statistics, guess what? There are expert fans who exist who often follow these sports companies and often can tell you that guess what? You are lying. These are advertisements that are manipulated. And guess what? That means we're actually able to call out those advertisements in the first place. But second, just generally, the fact that even they're able to point out the fact that maybe sports betting might have some harms means that uniquely there is discourse existing in the current factual. We don't think there's explicit peer pressure. Sometimes families explicitly ask you not to do things like sports betting. We think that balances out. There is not the explicit coercive pressure to always go into this. And I want to note the importance of this. If it is true that sports betting is not as coercive or addictive as they want to claim it to be, their only impact in this debate can't be just going into debt. You might buy a car. You might buy luxury goods. If you choose to do so, if you had some choice over that, that's not a harm in the debate. Before I move on to my second question, I'll take a beer. You're not only engaging with the whole spectrum here. We told you that many companies not only distort information, they also glorify and display advertisements to vulnerable young people. Please engage. I don't see why glorified advertisements will mean I will give up my house the next day. At the end of the day, it is a glorified advertisement. But first, we can still call out the glorification. I don't even know what that glorification really looks like on their side of the house. They haven't yet told you how manipulative a glorification of this advertisement actually works. But second, probably that is, this post is fun, maybe this is something you can do, and uniquely, you know at the end of the day, this is going to be a loss of money. We think we can actually just regulate advertisements to make sure they give you that information. Second, flashback on why fans are worse off. By this point, the only impact they have in this debate is that fans might lose money. First, I want to minimize this impact and second, flip it to you that why fans actually lose more money on their side of the house. Two things. First, we think fans aren't really as stupid as they claim them to be on their side of the house. Peer pressure is not strong enough for you to give up your motorbikes or give up your houses and uniquely that is because in a lot of cases, the kinds of fans they tell you in the beginning are national consumers. They themselves tell you these are people who are casual fans. We don't understand why you strictly go into something else. We think a vast majority of people have a bunch of different interests, a bunch of different priorities, a bunch of different kinds of peer pressures to even care about in the first place. We don't think this is the first thing. The second thing is, I don't think they tell you the full scope of sports betting because sure, you might lose money in some cases,"

              "text": "a tangible harm of loss of money. Some people might actually make more money in this debate. You need to prove why that was always not going to be the case. But then, I want to note uniquely, we flipped their impact. We told you that fans are going to work within the black market and more than likely to get addicted. And if they want to note uniquely, we flipped their impact. We told you that fans are going to work within the black market and more than likely to get addicted. And if they want to tell you these are fans who are so addicted, who will do this at any point in their life, who will give up everything they want to bet, these were not fans that were going to stop on their side of the house. What then happens and what are the responses we got? First, apparently advertisements is what allows this to be addictive. You won't have that in this account faction. Two reasons. First, apparently the ban is something that is happening in the present. If people are already so addicted, if young people are already down this rabbit hole, we think they're going to get addicted on death at the house anyway. You can't solve for addiction. This already exists in the first place. There are always going to be people, huge amounts of people that enter the black market. But second, I want to note, a vast majority of people don't enter, for instance instance, sports betting just because of the advertisements. It is the small level of peer pressure you want to talk about. If there is a dopamine rush you want to talk about, even when advertisements don't exist, you're still probably going to bet because of the fact that sports is so exhilarating. So guess what? On their side of the house, you will actually still bet. The second thing I want to note, they can't also say that smaller companies actually exist much more likely on our side of the house when it is that larger companies exist. Because we told you, you actually crowd out unregulated peers on us at the house when black markets don't exist. And there's a reason for one. One, when you want to go to the largest companies, the one with the most truth, because they also have the aggregator effect. The more people on them, the more money you're able to pull. But secondly, they're the only ones that often have the ability to advertise. What does this mean for this case? We were very simple. Black markets are worse for every single of the impacts they wanted to talk about. One, they are so much more coercive. They have no scrutiny on them. The information can be explicitly lying. You can't call them out because they're not in the public sphere in the first place. Second, I want to know, any of the impacts on monies are much, much worse. Because you know what? That might actually mean losing your house. That might actually mean losing your motorbikes. If they wanted to care about that, that was something. But also, they can often be explicitly exploitative. Even when you win, they can tell you, maybe you lost and actually take over your money, even when that was money you should have had. So for all of their impacts, they were much worse off. And lastly, we told you that even if in their absolute best case that doesn't happen, if these are people who are so addicted to sports betting, they would go to gambling, lose all of their money anyway in the counterfactual. What this means is that fans are always going to be worse off because they lose more money within the black market on their side. So proud to propose."

The stock market, gambling, literally just buying luxury goods that could bankrupt you to begin with. We can go into the nitty-gritty of where there is actually information, but how can the government come and see each individual's sports betting scenario and see whether they're actually making an informed choice? You as an individual government don't have as much information on each person and the level of coercion that they're under. And notice, especially, this is the same as the stock market. An 18-year-old has less information than a 30-year-old who's working in finance. Some people are making a fully informed choice. Some people are slightly coerced. The reason why we ban drugs is because it's not a choice anymore. You're literally not psychologically safe. Your brain is altered when you do take drugs. They needed to tell us why betting is the same as taking meth. We don't think they actually proved that in their case. So at the end of the day, betting is actually quite different because you stop betting when the competition is over. You stop betting when your team ends. It is not the same as drugs to begin with. Which is why on our side, we have to regulate so that more people can make an informed choice rather than straight out banning a choice that actually helps people.

This is not a shady black market that's underground in Andes. It is what you do with the bud, what you do with your friends at home. It is a website that you go to on the internet. They said that people don't opt into the black market on their side because the betting industry is what is setting the norm. But the more and more they talk about the millions of youth who are losing their lives to betting because they're addicted to gambling, they're going to shift to the black market. It doesn't matter if the betting industry is what sets norms. According to them, millions of people are already addicted. They will switch to the black market. That cuts across their case too. So they really needed to tell us how people so addicted to the rush are going to stop going just if the app doesn't exist for gambling to forgive them. If these people are really so addicted, it is better that we give them a formal channel to actually do it. They never responded to our counterfactual of regulations. If they can ban these apps, we can obviously regulate them. But we also gave you structural reasons for why it's likely that we can regulate them. You're tied up to leagues. You have ads from corporations. You are accountable to begin with. But also, you're literally affected by laws that don't allow you to do coercive advertisement to begin with. We were actually far more nuanced here. We told you most people aren't going back up, but a lot of people are going to shift to the black market because those are norms that already exist. And I want to weigh this. At their best case, they don't get a black market, which they didn't actually prove. But they needed to respond to our counterfactual regulations. They needed to tell us why it's such horrible coercion, which is why our second speaker argument matters. We increase engagement in sports. We increase the amount of enjoyment that people are able to get. That is important. They never responded. That's their best case. Incredibly proud. Give me a pause."

The reason why this is so important is we told you that these people, these exact consumers, are being exploited not only by betting but also by loaning companies when they are doing it whatsoever. Their second response then was, well, you're not going to really be addicted or anything. It's only like a casual hobby where sports players are going to do so. We told you, it's not like you're going to sell your house the moment you discover like FB88, but it looks like you start with a small sum of not money then you are normalized to the feeling of winning then when you lose you're scared because now you want to make that money again which makes it become a perpetual cycle where the home is going to be exponentially larger as you progress opposition also conceded to this when they say well some people even make it their entire careers panel this sounds like a pretty bad addition to me and we think this is perpetuating um in cycle, in the lives of people. Then they gave us a comparison, like, oh, this is similar to, like, this is not the same as using drugs, but our PM literally has her whole case on how people are going to have this huge sense of adrenaline when they are betting into sports, which is why they're likely to engage in it even when they continue to win.

That's why we're less likely to have young people who are going to start their own journey into this cycle of betting in sports in the first place.

But secondly, we flip this by saying that there's far less enjoyment to the point where the money is on the line. We have to constantly worry about whether or not they're going to win or whether or not I can make my money back.

One, we say the breakup of Yugoslavia, which saw vast immigrations of former Yugoslavs into their republic of origins, into post-Yugoslav republics with which they felt safe. But secondly, the refugee crisis for the people stuck in countries they did not identify with. We'd say those scattered across Europe, many of them have not been able to return back to their homeland from which they came from.

Purely, we say it was a vengeful tribunal that was mildly concerned with redressing the harm to victims and put punishment of war criminals at its center. Note these defining characteristics. One, we say that the tribunal's jurisdiction narrowly covered crimes that happened in the former Yugoslavian territory after 1991. The problem was far beyond that scope. Note the violent crackdowns on nationalist movements in Kosovo, Croatia and Slovenia in the 1980s. If OP is sincere to bringing criminals to justice they have to account for the 100s of criminals who evaded the law due to lack of territorial presence. But secondly, we say it was laden with bureaucratic structures that developed the remedy and rendered it inaccessible. But lastly, we say it was an illegal, biased court that set itself to push for the UN interests. We knew it for disproportionately persecuting Serb defendants whilst being more lenient towards Croat and Bosniak suspects. We say that's something that is important. Why then won't people likely use this, particularly as a platform to defend their innocence? We think that's something that is important on its own.

One, we say that we achieve and spread a more reliable truth through one, establishing conclusive reports involving gathering testimonies from both perpetrators and victims and ensuring inclusive process for the victims. But secondly, we say we provide amnesty for full confessions that promotes transparency and accountability. We say that there's going to be dialogue facilitation, creating spaces for former adversaries to engage and to foster mutual understanding and respect for each other. But thirdly, we say that there are going to be victim-centered remedies and solutions. This looks like suggesting legal, institutional and policy reforms. This could include changes in laws, restructuring the security forces or the reforms in the judiciary in itself. What does this look like? It looks like institution building. It looks like advising on the establishment or strengthening the institutions that promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law. We say it looks like support services. We say it looks like providing psychological and legal support to victims during the process. But then why on the counter do we then not think they're going to use this as a platform for them to defend their innocence? We say in the best case, we say people will likely use this as a platform to air out their concerns. We think they're going to air out their truthful concerns because they've got no harm of being incarcerated. But secondly, we say even in the instance that this is likely, we say we get a marginal benefit in the instance that we get more testimonies compared to none that are truthful at all. We think the willingness to accept, we're also willing to give amnesty to specific participants. We don't think that this is going to be blanket amnesty, but we think we're going to provide for those that haven't committed very large war crimes, right? But we say there's going to be a provision for reparation for the people who've been proven to be harmed. We think in the past, this has looked like psychosocial support, group therapy, economic and educational empowerment. Now, we're going to move firstly on how tribunals' lack of involvement meant an ineffective remedy. We think in the past this has looked like psychosocial support, group therapy, economic and educational empowerment. Now we're going to move firstly on how tribunals' lack of involvement meant an ineffective remedy. But before I do that, I'll take your view on it. When the most important war criminals have committed genocide or granted privacy because they cooperate, how are the victims who've lost dozens of family members? Panel, if they were listening to any of our setup, we've already told you that people who commit large crimes are likely not going to get amnesty. We say we look at it depending on the type of criminal that you met. But we're going to show you why we perform much better anyway on our side. We say firstly, on how tribunals lack inclusion meant an ineffective remedy. We say it should not be forgotten that the ICTY was based in the Hague from the Balkans, far away from the Balkans where the atrocities occurred. The effect of this were multiple. One, we say that the victims and the witnesses' denial of access. We think a huge crop of victims from Bosnia and Croatia and Serbia were shut out by the logistical and financial challenges going to the tribunal. We think their testimonial piece in that instance was never heard. But secondly, we say that this geographical distance contributed to a sense of disconnection"

              "text": "a process that involved and understood the local context and experience. But considering the world in which the TRC would have been used, we think it guaranteed a sense of involvement and acknowledgement for the victims. We enjoyed this involvement at Sierra Leone. We enjoyed this involvement at the post-apartheid TRC of South Africa, we enjoyed this involvement when it included all the Uyghur tribes in South Korea, in Canada, and so on. So then we think lastly, we say that the distant tribunal realistically could and possessed nuanced understanding of local customs, languages, and social dynamics with which were crucial for delivering context-sensitive justice. We say some ethnic Croatian tribes, for example, were displaced during the wars and to date have not been returned to their ancestral lands. What is the impact of this? We say, one, that reconciliation efforts were impeded as there was a disregard for the ICT-wide judgments, regardless of fairness, due to the entrenched scepticism that existed limiting that mutual understanding. So we think there are existing tensions, regardless the results that exist that are political and that are cultural and we never envision and you see people in croatia not being able to stand with serbians at the end of the day there's a hate that could potentially spark conflict in another war we think the conflict and the existing um vitriol that exists around it how are we going to weigh this weigh this reconciliation versus legal justice, right? There's an extended harm here. We think people are angry and they carry vitriol in their heart. We think what we do on our side is we provide them solace in providing them this mutual understanding of what is going on in their ends. We say on their side, they find a very skewed version of social justice that is not only going to help them. But even in the case in which that social justice is true, we tell you that it's likely not going to we tell you that that so it provides no closure but in the instance in which it is true we tell you in that it only solves the tensions in that exact moment it doesn't deal with the extended harms that exist before the war and after the war and all the tensions that these particular people have the last argument is on the sacrifice of an essential change for retribution. The premise here is to say, although it had its successes, the ICTY propagated and reinforced instances of ethnic segregation and violence as it became a very divisive process for all involved, with tensions still extending to animosity between the Serbs and the Bosnians in a football match as recently as 2019. We think, too, it inhibits the ability for there to be a just-after-war in the Yugoslavia conflict. That is in three regards. One, we say hundreds of thousands of people are still living in displaced persons in a different country due to lack of reconciliation. Secondly, we say that they were defending accounts of what occurred which sparked tensions surrounding the war memorials and the commemorations in itself. But thirdly, we say that the individuals who testified were seen as traitors. They restricted them from accessing support which they needed to heal both professionally and locally. The TRC on our side, however, is locally based, so the testimonials you get, you cooperate with local individuals. But secondly, we say more individuals are reserved and you don't use nearly as much resources. We then use these resources in things like generally just helping people in psychosocial support. Principally support this because it's important for people to feel involved in what they're doing, to feel involved in the reconciliation process and achieving reconciliation in itself. We think we deal with the depth of the harm at the end of the day. We deal with the idea of having that long term beneficiary at the end of the day. With this, never have I ever been that proud. Thank you. All right, my time will start on my first word."

              "text": "Now on some points of framing. There are a few crucial differences between the ICTY and the TRC. Number one, the ICTY can actually act while the crime is happening. This is crucial not only to find evidence, but also to act as a deterrent. Second of all, the ICTY can actually bring tangible change. TRCs are not judicial bodies. All they can do is suggest. And as a matter of fact, what incentive do corrupt governments have to actually accept these suggestions when all this is going to do is deter themselves? And third of all, the TRC's focus is on finding the truth, while the ICTY focuses on actually bringing justice, on actually bringing accountability, and I'll explain to you why this is the most crucial. Moreover, TRCs are extremely specific to Yugoslavia, and the reason why is because it is contingent on the cooperation of six republics that have extreme ethnic tensions. So why do we believe that TRCs are genuinely ineffective? Well, simply because there's way less pressure for states to cooperate. For ICTY, the international law is extremely important for Western states that actually want to create precedence, right? And this simply does not happen for TRCs, where on the other hand, there's a way smaller role for these international communities in this proceeding that leads to people actually generally caring less. And this means that in a lot of countries, TRCs probably wouldn't even happen, or it wouldn't include all the most important actors, as I've explained. They have absolutely no incentive to do so. Now I'm going to dive into my two substantive arguments."

              "text": "The first one, which is going to be how we're going to bring justice to these victims and explaining why they're the most important actor in this motion. And second of all, we're going to be talking about how the ICTY created an international precedent and set the stage for many more international tribunals. So first of all, why are victims the most important actor in this notion? Very simple. They were the ones that are the most impacted by the war. They live with the grief of losing their loved ones, waking up every morning alone and seeing their pictures, commemorating them every year and remembering what happened to them. This is everyday trauma that restricts their ability to move forward. They lose their mental health, they lose their dignity, they lose their agency. Now why is justice important to these victims? Very simple. Ever since we're little, the idea of punishment is ingrained in us as a social norm. As a child, when you do something wrong, you expect your parents to punish you, right? And so this lack of punishment in the IPY means that victims feel as if their pain has not been recognized. You feel like you have no value and this will linger in their mind. Not only a feeling of grief, but a feeling of anger, a need for revenge. Second of all, it's very important that the international community recognizes the wrongdoings. When the international community sees you and validates you, you feel as if you are in the right, as if others feel the anger that you feel you can relate to them. You feel supported and liberated because the power of condemnation towards the perpetrators of the crime is bigger. And note, this is very important, the process of testimonies at ICTY is crucial. You finally feel as if you have the power over the war criminals. They sit in the chair while the entire room describes and explains why they're in the wrong, why they're horrible and evil human beings. You feel the power over them because you know that when you testify, your testimony will put them in prison, and your pain and suffering finally feels like it is enough to acknowledge your pain. And beyond recognition, it's also important for the victims to know that the war criminals are behind bars and that they are suffering. The way which criminal sentencing works allows victims reclosure. Because you want revenge against them, you want them to feel pain, and you want them to walk behind bars. Seeing their defeated faces while they listen to testimonies and when they are sentenced is a cathartic moment. And finally, it is important for these victims that they are removed from the public life. When these people are behind bars, the public forgets about them. Fine, they may be talking about them in the beginning, but ultimately you're going to forget. And they're no longer able to go on TV shows, the news, and tell their side of the story. They ultimately lose their platform. Now, on the comparative, what happens is you see photos of them hanging around with political elites without the country, which is a horrible reminder for you that they still have power, their life is still normal, while yours will never be the same. Now what is the comparative of this entire argument?"

For starters, they never get to see the person murdering their family, murdering their loved ones, that sexually assaulted them behind bars. You also are not testified against them, which is crucial. In a TRC, you have to confront the asylum face to face, and not only is this traumatic, but victims are also confronting far more powerful people that are experiencing rhetoric and riling people up. It becomes completely unclear who is guilty, who is the bad guy. You are put on the same stand, you're put on the same pedestal, you have the same time to talk, you're, as a child, you feel this sense that when you don't think that someone is punished, they have not done a wrongdoing. I've mechanized entirely now how when the international community recognizes your wrongdoing, you feel a satisfaction. And finally, why were victims owed justice? Two main things. Victims were limited by the international community and their capacity to exercise self-defense. NATO was stopping Croatia's liberation operations for years and waiting for something horrible for a genocide to happen to allow it, or stopping arm trains to Croatia, which were crucial for self-defense. And this obviously means that now the international community has the duty towards victims to bring them back to the state that they were before, which means restoring their dignity and bringing them justice."

              "text": "So what are the strategic flaws that you get from side propositions? Two things. First, they tell us that victims get the greatest amount of closure when they see that their oppressors are behind bars. There are two responses to this argument. First, we don't think in the vast majority of instances those individuals that oppressed these ethnic minorities actually went behind bars. We think out of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of individuals that were harmed, that were killed by the genocide in Kosovo, I think only 161 people out of all of the six gays were actually inducted. We think that a vast majority of individuals that had clearly committed these crimes didn't even make it behind bars. We think that those individuals never got that type of closure that they think these individuals have access to. Two, we think that those individuals that wanted the closure didn't even get that closure to begin with. This is to say that leaders or high-ranking officials like Manos Slometic from Serbia actually died before they were actually indicted, actually died before they were actually sent to be incarcerated for the crimes that they committed. We think the IC2I operated for over 20 years, and we think in that period of over 20 years was a period where individuals that existed within those genocides didn't get the redress that we think they deserved. So we think in the vast majority of instances, individuals didn't feel like they got the redress that they deserved. But secondly, we say that when they tell us that confronting individuals within these tier acids is something that becomes traumatic, what do you think is something that's a strategic flaw on their side? Because in the ICTY, testimonies are still required. Do you think that these victims are still required to appear before courts and testify against individuals that are defending their innocence? In the vast majority of instances, even their ability to defend themselves accurately was made more difficult because the official language of the ICTY was English and French, where they had to go through interpreters for them to be able to get that interest. We think this is something that becomes marginally better when they exist within TRCs that are likely to incorporate the languages that these people speak. We think they are likely to be less traumatic when they actually go to TRCs as opposed to when they actually go to the ICTY. We think this is something that they need to consider. But then what are the few"

              "text": "clashes that we think they particularly don't win on within the state? Firstly, is on the clash of who better provides closure for victims post-Yugoslav wars, right? What do they tell us? They tell us that victims prioritize more than just getting like redress for displacement that happened during the wars that existed. We say this is untrue for two reasons. First, we think that those individuals needed that retreads. For example, the reason why the Serbs currently are not in good terms with Croatians and so on is because they particularly feel like they didn't get the justice that was owed to them by the ICTY, right? Because we think that even in the instances where inductive were made, because of that jurisdiction of like limitations between the language structures of like the ICTY, right? Because we think that even in the instances where inducted were made because of that jurisdiction of like limitations between the language structures of like the ICTY and also the legal text that the ICTY was using to mediate like the trials, we think that those individuals don't even understand why even individuals that were acquitted by the court were particularly acquitted. What this means is that even if the ICTY did do right in like inducting and acquitting individuals, the mere is that even if the ICTY did do right in like indicting and acquitting individuals, the mere fact that individuals on the ground don't perceive its decision as something that was particularly right, we think that those individuals don't get the satisfaction or interest that we think that they want, that we think that they say that these individuals get. I'll take it. Can you characterize how the victims are going to feel when they know that the killers are roaming on the street because of amnesty? We think individuals feel like this already. We think 161 people out of 100,000 people that were harmed through genocide is something that doesn't make sense. You can't say that 161 people particularly committed a whole genocide. We think that's a strategy flaw on your side. But secondly, those individuals that were inducted, the vast majority of them were acquitted treated anyways so we don't think that those individuals got the closure that they needed we think this is something that you needed to continue within your hockey but I want to think is particularly important in like providing that between closure one we say that these individuals that are particularly displaced post you cause love needed to be returned to their to their homelands right you said that the problem, we think my first week already gives you characterization about why individuals are still displaced to this day and that they don't really have their rights being equated, being meaningful and represented within governments because of such displacement. Right? We say that the minority within Kosovo still feels like individuals or their rights are not being well represented because of the ethnic tensions that the Al-Baryan majority within that state is still feeling because of like the lack of interest through like titos who had helped Serbs or Foes to migrate to that area right. I think this is something that the ICTY ignored and we think this continues to exacerbate already existing tensions right. Why is it important for these existing tensions to be gotten rid of two reasons one i think my first speaker already gives you an analysis of why there is a likelihood that individuals are likely to get into violent conflict again right this is to say that if you have even football matches leading to acts of violence where individuals actively throw stones at each other over football matches you think that this continued ethnic tension is what led to the Yugoslav wars to begin with. We think when economic factors were actually the reason why Yugoslavia was failing, we think that individuals and that nationalist rhetoric co-opted such economic issues and made them more about ethnic divide. We think this is something that is more likely to happen on their side. Because we know that the ICY particularly just focuses on which crimes you committed and how best to punish these individuals. It doesn't really interrogate about the ethnic tensions that exist on the ground or the cultural context that exists within these communities. I think the understanding of this cultural context is important so as to resolve the ethnic tensions that these individuals have towards each other because this is what leads to ongoing acts of violence against these groups. But then what's my extension within this page? We think my extension is going to prove to you two things. First, about why we think that even in the best case that the ICTY was instantiated, we still think that it wasn't able to truly address the issues that it meant to address. What are the mechanisms for this? We think there are two. Twofold. One, we say that the mere fact that the IC2I was located in the hate away from the Balkans meant that individuals within the Balkans had limited access to go and give their testimonies. The reason why this becomes much better with TRC is that they can be located within each individual state where Albanian majorities and sub- and safe minorities within countries like Kosovo can actively engage within conversation. I think this confrontation is necessary so that these individuals can actively air out their grievances against these communities. Why do we think this is likely to work? We have seen this happen in countries like Rwanda, where the Gashacha courts that actually inducted over a million people within four years, over the 20 years where they are inducted, 161 people by the ICTY. I think that you have more effectivity in terms of the turnout of the numbers that people come to give these testimonies. Two, we say that you are able to resolve those ethnic tensions. Because we think that the reason why individuals continue to hate each other instead of school is that they feel like the ICTY was an external body that didn't allow them to actively air out their grievances. Because one, that location within the heck limits their ability to go there, but also the language barriers that exist within such instances limit them. But thirdly, we say that the indictment of a Serb majority already makes the Serb community feel like the court itself is unjust. This is to say that even if in the best case that the IC2I indicted people, it may affect that those individuals view it as an illegitimate court, makes it even worse on their side, because we think that the IC2I sows seeds of mistrust and doubt within these communities."

But they did not mechanize how the TRC would solve any of these problems, just saying how it was bad on our side. Therefore, they cannot bring any positive material. But we assert that, first of all, it's symmetric on both sides at their best because as i said previously after a loss in a war you seek a culprit you're very heinous towards the other side you're not seeking retribution so it's very hard to achieve uh to achieve um retribution and cooperation between countries but also without justice without seeing criminals punished on all sides as you said generals from all sides being prosecuted and convicted you will yourself seek retribution. You will seek to hate the others and to bring justice because you have not heard justice. Finally, they tried to counter arguments about the victims by saying, first of all, that not enough people were convicted. We have repeated multiple times that the most important leaders were convicted, and we have shown how this is the most important because from the victim's perspective, the people they see on television the people Saying the hate speech the presence the leaders the generals ordering the massacres of their family those of the people towards they have hate They don't know the names of the soldiers who killed them who received orders who weren't leading the heinous massacres They want the generals the presence to go to prison That is what happened the president of Ser president of the Serbian region of Bosnia and Herzegovina went to prison. The high generals from Serbia, from Croatia, went to prison for their war crimes. That is what the victims want to see. No response on their side, on the perspective of the victims, and on the human side that they feel. Except for the point that they talk about the language barrier of the ICTY, obviously a very weak argument. There was translation. They could speak their side. And on the traumatic side, they say that, oh, people, our argument that people work on an equal level in the TRC isn't true. Obviously, if you see the person who's committed war crimes on the side of a convicted person not getting amnesty, you're going to feel much better because you know that they're the ones being tried, not you, you're not on an illegal stance. We're moving on to our second substantive argument about the international and legal precedents and deterrents created by the ICTY. Now, why were their precedents established? First of all, because of inspiration and test run for establishment of international criminal courts. For instance, the special tribunals in Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and Rwanda, were widely considered to be very successful and convicted dozens and dozens of war criminals. Note that even where the TRC was not efficient, as they said, because it was novel enough and underfunded, courts that followed learned from these mistakes and did better for their victims. And also because it defined new types of crimes and normalized this punishment. The ICTI case law recognized rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, and pregnancy as codified war crimes and crimes of enm man against humanity for the first time and expanding them to male and females. These crimes were rampant before Yugoslavia, for instance, World War II, millions and millions of women were hit, but they were never recognized. And it's the ICTY that recognized these crimes, make it impossible for victims throughout the world to not be silenced and uncompensated, but to achieve justice. Why have these developments been preserved in international law? Why have they established presence? First of all, because convictions at the ICCY cross a new legal threshold in decision-making, showing what's possible and right to prosecute these crimes. Because there's a crucial effect in legal doctrine called the watershed effect in which legal decision-making, because lawyers respect precedence, because of jurisprudence, which is the basis for common law and international law, which is strictly based on precedent. When there's a new decision that is made, it tends to be kept as precedents in international law. And also because the UN and Western powers, like the EU and United States, were centrally established in the ICCY, and they're generally the top watchdogs for human rights in war times. So the advancement of international law and legal systems are useful to them, and they're going to push them with their scope and power throughout the world. Now, what are the impacts of these? They're threefold, and they're crucial. First of all, the victims of sexual violence were given recognition for the first time. These are tens of thousands of victims of wartime rape globally. The scope of this impact is absolutely massive. Even if a TRC was in Yugoslavia, it would likely not investigate wartime rape because TRC did not have the legal ability to establish precedent. Therefore, they would have no power to recognize rape as a crime. They would have none of these impacts, which are massive throughout the world. But also because the foundation of the ICC, the International Criminal Court, which is directly based on the ICTY, allowed for the conviction of individual criminals from countries that do not have their own tribunals and wouldn't have allowed for TRCs. They are countries that don't have their judicial systems, but where war criminals have killed thousands, have committed genocides, have raped young girls and women, which would have no punishment without the ICTY, which established precedent. This is why our comparative is so much stronger, not only in the US law, but throughout the world. And finally, because the ICTY and its spinoff course and cases create a world-recognized and firm way of scrutinizing war crimes. Because these courts deter war in countries from any terrible atrocities, because they're scared of getting prostituted or losing international support, because the ICTY showed that an iron fist would be held down on the most important actors of war crimes. These are the people who make the decisions in these war crimes. These are the people who see for the first time that they could go behind bars, that they would not act in impunity when they killed thousands, when they raped hundreds and thousands of women. And also because when countries fail to abide by the international law and get accused of war crimes, it forces their allies in the international community to stop supporting them. This is because if you're an EU country or the United States and supporting war crimes or supporting human rights, your citizens are going to oppose your support for genocide or war crimes. And the way this applies very concretely, for instance, was when Serbia started ethnically cleansing Kosovo in 1998, the majority of the world felt compelled to recognize Kosovo and support NATO wrongs in Serbia to stop these atrocities. And also, even today, when Israel is killing thousands of Gazas, what some would have called a genocide, the only reason why the fiercest ally of Israel, the United States, is calling them out and threatening to stop sending weapons is because the ICJ directly commended Israel and its leader, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who makes this decision. Again, the importance of condemning leaders of only 161 people, but the most important 161 people, it shows that they cannot just stand by their side anymore, that they ask us all to stop killing civilians. The impacts of the ICTY are immense throughout the world. Better work for Yugoslavia, better work throughout the world, and justice for victims of war crimes throughout the world is what we're extremely proud to oppose. Thank you. I'd like to see the second one. So this is the second. This is the third one. This is the fifth one. Thank you, Che. Can you please confirm if I'm audible if I speak like this? It's slightly louder. It's right back over here. It's just slightly louder. Am I audible if I speak like this? Yes. Perfect."

              "text": "So what then do you tell me in terms of what they fail to do in this particular debate? Three key strategic flaws that they have. The first one is that they come to this debate and then they tell us that they believe that on their side, we get victims having a little bit more closure when this justice is administered. Two responses here. The first one is that we think it's untrue that you actually get this form of justice on their side. Why is this particularly untrue? Because most of these rulings are already deemed to be unfair to begin with. This looks like people in Croatia already arguing that the court in itself was lenient towards the Serbs themselves. We think because people have already this entire perception that these rulings are unfair already, it means that victims in those particular regions do not necessarily feel that these rulings were fair. Yes, there is no amount of retribution that they actually get on their side. But secondly, we tell you that even if that's the case, we think this already takes a lot of time, and in most cases, it's only administered after a series of long and legal battles. What are the impacts of these long and legal battles? We think, one, you lead to a situation where we've got 20 years and we have only been able to inject about 161 people. This is obviously not an efficient panel and we don't necessarily think that they win this debate by trying to argue for this. But secondly, we already tell you that on our side of the House, where we are able to do this, we would have been able to be more efficient and going to be more impactful towards ensuring that these victims actually get the closure that they need. Why then do we necessarily think that the second strategic flow that they did in this debate was particularly problematic? They tell us that on their side, they are able to get better justice than on our side. And their entire stance is basically on how they think they are able to induct the people who were at the forefront of these particular atrocities. What then do we tell you? We tell you that obviously, if this is the case, we can be able to argue for the very same thing on our side. We tell you, Dean already tells you in P1, that we do not have anything called blanket amnesty. What does this look like? We tell you that we have got individuals that we know that they were at the forefront of this particular activity. We think these individuals will be indicted whatsoever, and they will not be able to go scot-free as they try to argue on their side. So, at the end of the day, the harms that they try to perpetuate become symmetry, because we can be able to also tell you on our side that we are going to induct those who are actually leading this particular industry. But, secondly, we then give you an example of how TRCs are likely going to give better outcomes, right? We bring to you the idea of the ICTR, which is the very same thing that was done after the post-Rwandan genocide of 1994 in Rwanda. What was the benefit of the TRC being better than the ICTR in this particular regard? We think that the ICTR in Rwanda, we think that the TRC in Rwanda successfully garnered for this justice through locally initiated Gashasha Court is already good from our P2 right. So at best, their push for justice for major criminals exists on our side as well. And we think Gashasha Courts are even more efficient because we're able to induct over a million people in Rwanda in a period of four years as opposed to their side that are only able to indict about 161 people over a million people in Rwanda in a period of four years, as opposed to their side that are only able to indict about 161 people over a period of 20 years. We think that in itself is problematic. But lastly, on the idea of bias towards TRCs, where they try to argue that TRCs have got a particular bias. We don't think this already exists in our side of the house, because what do we tell you? You need to understand that on our side of the house, we've got these TRCs. We're able to have these locally initiated forums of discussion that allow everyone to actually come into place to speak about this. Realize how the TRC, the ICT was located in the head, which is miles and miles away from the Balkans themselves. To make it worse, the only official languages that were used in this particular region were only English and French. We think that was already discriminatory in this particular regard because a majority of people from the Balkans were not able to speak like this. But before I go on further to crash matter, I'll take it. Yeah, you're talking about all these indictments, but TRC is not a judicial body, so how will they indict? Moreover, we talked about the intent of the government that they're not going to... We tell you, panel, on our side of the house that we don't necessarily think that when you have TRCs, you're not just going to let every criminal go spot free. Why this particularly looks like that we've got individuals that are going to be referred back to the courts that they can be able to get the actual trial. We think this already materialized in countries like Rwanda through the Kachacha courts and was able to work because the TRC in Rwanda was able to take these individuals and take them to these particular areas where they were able to get tried and they were given the sentence that they got. We think that was more efficient and was beneficial. So what then do we tell you in terms of punishment and this particular debate? We tell you that the major quotation that we have in this debate is about whether or not it's important for us to have justice over truth. What do we tell you on their side, panel? We think justice is not as best as they claim on their side because one, majority of these offenders are people who are particularly influential in the legal space. Meaning they are able to get the legal counsels that can be able to propel for their own defense mechanism. Then two key parts happen here. Others already"

              "text": "people who were summoned to the ICTY, only 161 were indicted. What happened to the remaining over 30 people? We think these people were already let go and at the end of the day, their impact was not there. But second, we even think that others will have long procedures leading to their death before even being able to save their sentences. This particularly materializes in a very good example of a separate leader called Slobodan Milosevic. What is Slobodan Milosevic to? He was indicted by the ICTY, but he was only sentenced right after he had already died. So we think this long legal proceedings do not necessarily bring the justice that they tried to argue on their side. But secondly, we think this justice is not all inclusive, right? Because these testimonies were never all inclusive to begin with. What does this look like? Letu and Dean already tell you about the physical and emotional distance that already existed between the Balkans and the ACTY, but we've also been able to stress on this particular channel. So we think, obviously, we're already winning this particular clash. The comparative, however, then exists. Within one household of the house, we allow for more transparency and allow for people to understand each other and resolve their differences and be able to understand each other. Secondly, within local TRCs are able to allow victim healing and facilitation through national cooperation. Within what this looks like is what, as Dean tells you, we have got victim-centered solutions that allow for counseling, psychosocial support, and all things along those lines. We think these are particularly impactful because ultimately the rulings of the ICTY may never be sufficient enough to remove that generational trauma that people particularly experience. We think it's important that we also protect these victims because ultimately they are the ones who go back to society and we think if we don't necessarily protect them, we have something that is going to be problematic. We think on our side, in their best case, we get justice for a few people but on our side, we're able to ensure national healing and truth and reconciliation. What is then the last question in this debate? We think on our side that they're also able to get more justice and truth and reconciliation. How do we do this? One, we tell you that these ideas, these particular tieracies and their structures are locally based. Hence, we remove any issues of exclusivity which were appropriated by the ICTY. But secondly, we think reconciliation gets better on our side because differences are resolved through transparency. Secondly, we facilitate recovery for post-generational trauma because ultimately we put these all forms of mechanisms that allow us to support these individuals after they've been able to be subjected to this entire form of trauma. But in their best-case scenario, where we actually get a code in which people actually get all these mechanisms that they try to argue about, we think they depend on people being able to put themselves forward to tell these testimonies. We think this is not likely going to materialize because people are afraid of persecution. But second, even if it does materialize, we think the distance that already existed between these particular religions made it very difficult for people to be able to give their own testimonies. And lastly, people already feel scared to tell the truth. And because people feel scared to tell the truth, we think, one, we don't get anything in terms of victim closure, but secondly, we also have a situation where history gets misconstrued, meaning in the future there's a likelihood of this happening again because people end up lying simply because they want a word in which they can get better sentences. So they don't necessarily tell us the entire truth and they hide other elements of this particular truth. We think that in itself then becomes problematic because if you're going to learn from anything about the Yugoslav wars is if you get the data and accurate analysis of everything that happened. We don't get that on their side because people are likely going to try by all means to ensure that they get better sentences on their side. For all these reasons and contentious panel, Proposition is proud. Thank you. Thank you."

Then on the first clash then, the first thing that proposition tells you is that the ICTY shuts out victims because it's based in The Hague. So maybe, yes, it is based in The Hague, but there were still local interviews of victims in Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They also do investigation on site. The second thing they tell us is that on our side, we only prosecute 160 people. Note that I have three responses. First of all, it is not possible on either side to prosecute absolutely everyone. Second of all, the people that we did prosecute are high-ranking officials, like Milosevic, like Radovan, and then we think that these are the people that actually orchestrated the war crimes and are most responsible for them. But third of all, from the victim's perspective, there are these other people that victims actually want to see behind bars. Because sure, they probably don't know who was the soldier that went in the door and killed their family. But they have heard on the radio who was the person that orchestrated the war crimes. And this is the person that they hate the most and they want to see behind bars. Therefore, what we prove is that it is sufficient on our side to only prosecute 160 people.

So they have to pick one of two scenarios. Either their TRC finds out the truth and Serbs still feel horrible, or the TRC doesn't find out the truth, and therefore they don't get any of their impacts on victims and on ethnic tensions."

              "text": "The third thing that they say is that victims can't defend themselves and go to courts in ICTY because they feel like it's a traumatic experience. There's two responses on why we flip this claim and that it's actually more traumatic on victims in TRCs. First of all, in TRCs, you give victims an equal platform with the war criminals. So it means that you have the same speaking time, you're in the same room, and you have the same power. And note that this is a double victimization because like you're put on the same pedestal as the other, no, as the war criminals. No, thank you. But while on our side, you are put on the same pedestal as the other, no, as the war criminals. No, thank you. But while on our side, you are labeled as victim, and the other person is labeled as defending and susceptible of a war crime. Therefore, we think it is actually empowering for victims to testify in ICTY because they are affirmed, and they feel like they are directly contributing into putting these criminals behind bars. But second response then, what we think happens on their side in TRCs They feel like they are directly contributing into putting these criminals behind bars. But second response then, what we think happens on their side in TRCs is when you have these talks between victims and war criminals, then war criminals gain an advantage because these are usually politicians who are very good at rhetoric, who are very good at riling people up and then muddling the truth. So what happens is they will likely claim their innocence on TRCs because we don't think these politicians are willing to admit that they did war crimes, because when, especially when, no thank you, when they wouldn't want their whole power to rest on the fact that their population thinks that they're innocent, so they will never admit that they actually committed a war crime. And so what we think will happen is that these politicians will try to muddle the waters and make it extremely unclear which side is actually guilty, because wars are messy and complicated. So what it means is that we think that victims are less able to actually get justice on their side, and that there's a double victimization, which we think does more harm than victims."

Look, their model is that they're going to prosecute some criminals and give amnesty to others. We give you several reasons in Frank's and Matthew's speech why TRCs cannot prosecute because they have no judicial power, right? We said that they had less resources, they had less funding, while the ICCY had like a billion because of international involvement. These countries are fresh out of war. They have no functioning judicial system, and they have no money to give to TRCs either. But note, and very importantly, is that they have no incentives to actually punish these criminals. Look, do you think the Serbian courts would have an incentive to actually prosecute Milosevic when he was so influential that he probably put his own people into the court that the public has a favorable opinion of them? So therefore, we think that these populist politicians would likely not be able to be prosecuted on side proposition. And we think this is harmful for victims. And let me illustrate why it's harmful for victims, because victims see these war criminals still roaming around, who are going to talk shows and claiming their innocence. These war criminals were burning up Croatian flags in squares in Serbia, and so we think that, therefore, it is a horrible reminder of the crimes that these victims have already gone through. But notice also that if they get amnesty, notice that the optics of victims is that when you get someone gets amnesty, it's equivalent to the justice forgiving them. And we think this is unacceptable for victims when their family has been murdered by these people. Now let me just quickly weigh this against their argument on ethnic tensions. We think that victims is the most concrete impact that we have in this state. They've already suffered. They were unable to defend themselves. They're in a position"

The only thing they say is that precedents already exist, ICC, ICJ. That is just like factually incorrect because these courts were actually based on the precedent of the ICTY and established others. There are two main benefits that Matthew brings to you of the ICTY. First of all, it recognized main benefits that Matthew brings to you of the ICTY. First of all, it recognizes new crimes like rape that have never been acknowledged before. And that won't be acknowledged on trial because TRCs can also only follow pre-existing precedents. It can't establish a new one. Note how important this is for the hundreds of millions of women who have been raped during war crimes and finally have their crimes acknowledged.

And I just want to weigh the impact of this argument that we think consists of a unique path to victory. Because we help victims around the world by establishing this precedent. There are infinitely many other future victims of war crimes that we are able to give retribution to because we established the Jewish-Pritish for future courts to exist. Nareb and Carter, to your post. Thank you. Alright, I have the position of the speaker to close the case to the opposition. I invite the vice-mayor to take the floor.

Not only is it right for them to be convicted because they're the one who gave orders, but it's also the ones with the most impact when they're convicted because those are people people know and the people want to see behind bars."

Therefore, a lot of crimes, which would not be uncovered if the TRC started afterward, because a lot of crimes are erased during war times, could have been uncovered by ICTY. This is what opposition one says in the beginning of their speech. It starts during the war. There's disorientation impacts. It goes unanswered. But also, because contrary to what site proposition has tried to say, thousands of people testified in the trials here. The trials were televised and were watched by thousands in Yugoslavia, and thousands of people were convicted. But it's also because there's a crucial contradiction on side opposition about amnesty. They say that not everyone will be given amnesty. The most important criminals won't be given amnesty. We tell you that this contradicts their benefits because it's these individuals that are necessary to know the truth because it's these individuals that have committed the crimes and they can tell the truth.

We've shown it's the most important actors. This has gone unrebutted by side proposition. We say there's a complete disregard for the livelihoods and the feelings of the thousands and thousands and thousands of victims and their family, victims of heinous crimes, victims of rites, rape, victims of death. The only rebuttals that come from side proposition are saying that, one, it is unfair. We rebut this by saying that people were tried on both sides, but also they took too long to convict people. First of all, most of the report criminals were convicted, but also TRCs take long. They gave the example of South Africa in their first speech. It took years and years for the TRC to uncover the entire truth without getting into justice. Finally, they tried to bring an argument about inclusion that is lacking on the ICTY without bringing positive material on their side, but let's still try to look at what was given on their case. First of all, they talk about distance. It's the most important argument, but it was in The Hague that people weren't involved in it. One, it was necessary for this distance, as we framed, because of the war on ethnic connections, there couldn't have been an ICTY in those countries but also as we said repeatedly throughout this debate there's gone an answer thousands of people testified there were investigations on the ground thousands and thousands of people had their voices heard they were obviously included in this and finally there is a clash that should have been a clash but unfortunately was mostly unresponded by such a proposition about the international presence. The only thing we hear is in Proposition 3 saying these presidents already exist. It doesn't really matter. First of all, we've explained in very much detail how the presidents were created by ICTY on the questions of rape, on the questions of sexual war crimes. They were created by the ICTY. This goes unrebuttaled. And so if they ignore this case, they disregard the livelihoods of the millions of rape victims throughout the world. If that is what Proposition wants to do, we let them disregard it."

We told you this from set up and we've told you this is substantively different from just persecuting generals. We thought that was something that was important.

The problem with this is that they muter their own contention by then admitting and telling us how these people are likely to then manipulate and lie and you know be very rough to these theorists and this is something that kills them we don't think that they can have these two examples of argumentation existing together but secondly they told us that you know what punishment gives closure right so we're going to tell you we told you on opposition why their punishment is unlikely to even be accurate. One, we told you because people are likely going to be attempting to reduce their sentences, especially as generals, so they're going to omit certain points of information and are likely not going to do that. But secondly, they told you that even if that wasn't the case, people don't even believe in that accuracy anyway, because people don't believe in the idea of the ICTY because of how it was exclusionary to the locals that were involved in itself, right?"

But secondly, we told you that the situation is generally too complex for them to just divide it up into perpetrators and victims. We told you that perpetrators are also victims victims and it's such a complex situation in itself that we don't get why the ICTY would in itself be able to deal with this at a very large level. And then on extended impact, what is the pretext that we're going to give you here? There is a violent bitterness that sits at the heart of victims. On prop, we say it's important that we deal with this. One, because you get potential war happening as an adverse reaction and the cooperation of economies in general in the instance that we sever this type of thing. It's important that we cater to the extent of impact, right? What do we provide when we do this? We tell you that reconciliation deals with this and we give mix for the setup. We tell you about reliable troop mechanisms, victim-centered remedies, ETC, and we tell you about how we're going to use the remaining money for psychosocial support and things like that. Right, on the way up now, we're going to ask ourselves, importantly, on the extended impact. Why do we value this extended impact over immediate justice, even if they win on immediate justice? One, because people don't even believe in the immediate justice. We told you that because they don't believe in the immediate justice, we don't think that justice really carries it out in its full capacity to perform reconciliation. But secondly, we told you that extended harm is just likely worse because it's unlikely going to spew into further tensions and further political and potential wars in itself. And it's important that we then win or we then address that particular issue in itself. We told you that it's very important in which we find a world in which we're able to cater to the tension in the existing vitriol that is there. So we think, how then do we weigh specifically much better marginally from Prop 1? We show you that the punishment on their side is not even accurate, accurate enough to provide the reconciliation, but two, we showed you that that punishment that they give in itself, even if it was, is likely going to be timely and likely is not going to deal with the situations of actually incriminating people. My P2 gives you analysis on why at the end of the day, those particular people end up dying even before they get incarcerated. So we think it's important that you take our extended harm and how it's very important to this debate and to weigh this. In conclusion, Chair, we say that all struggle to bring perceived justice to a world that above anything else just wants to stop bleeding is an attempt that is much ado about nothing. Proud."

So, frame, what is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and what is the delta between the two? There are two main ones. The first one is who runs this thing. The TRC are run by independent organs, such as the church, but not necessarily. Like in Desmond's Tuto in South Africa, where they are the most effective. This is the most effective example. Therefore, they are unbiased and local, aka in Serbian, for example, etc. But ICT-wise are run by the UN. Therefore, they are heavily based in the West. They are in the Hague, they're in English, they have Western judges. Therefore, they're heavily biased towards the West, but not accessible to, because they're not local, their people can't attend, but also they're not in the local language."

At the end of the day, I can see whether you actually buried the bodies there, but also I can see whether the stories overlap between the testimonies, right? And if someone isn't overlapping, therefore he's lied. But finally, he has to apologize because this is the reconciliation part.

The first one is not enough convicted criminals on their side of the house. Why is this the case? Because the court needs huge amounts of evidence to start prosecuting, let alone convict someone. There is a huge burden of proof. A person is going to jail, maybe for life even. Therefore, many war criminals have gotten away because the prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to even start prosecuting them, let alone convict them there about. What does this mean? I don't know, there is a second reason. But even if they are convicted, many people appealed and therefore they got pardoned afterwards. For example, Vysov Shechel, who basically got away after like only 10 years in prison, even though he was sentenced for life. What is the result? We have only 161 convicted, when 60,000 people have been slaughtered in genocides during this war, dear panel. This is an absurdly low number, and there is a huge amount of criminals walking today in the streets of Serbia, maybe even. But the thing is that on our side, this doesn't happen, because we have not nearly as much a burden of proof. Because, I don't know, the thing is that we only need to have implicit evidence, or simply hearsay, or I don't know, simply a suspicion of someone to be summonsing these commissions. Therefore, it is a lot more likely for a lot more cases to be went through because that's how we actually have a lot more people's cases went through in our side of the house. The second mechanism is that people didn't admit the truth on their side. Why is this the case? Because there is no active incentive to do so, because the more you admit, the lower the sentence you get. I wouldn't admit that I have done three genocides if I'm only prosecuted for one. The intuition pump is simple. If I know that I'll burn myself if I put my hand in boiling water, I wouldn't do it. Pretty intuitive. Therefore, the bottom line is that I wouldn't admit the other two genocide. On the comparative, I would, because I fear the court. Slobodan drink poison on national television. Milosevic hanged himself before trial. This is actually true. Therefore, since this is a necessity as per our model, they will say it all in order to save their skin. The bottom line is that only true, only, and we have a lot of information, and only true information. Why is this so important? Two things here. Firstly, we get to understand the truth which is principally correct. That is why we give lower sentences to people who have admitted that they are guilty. That is why our society values truth"

There are two burdens to this argument. The first one is that we have forgiveness and understanding. Unforgiveness. Why this exists? Because it allows for a symbolic forgiveness process. The TRC allows victims to face their oppressors. Stop with them. But most crucially, hear the word sorry for them. This is extremely important. But secondly, this wouldn't happen on the comparative because there is no incentive to say sorry as they will plead guilty in their efforts to escape the prison. The second reason on basically understanding. The criminals can explore basically understanding. The criminals can explore their thoughts. Basically that they have feared their death. Or for example that they have been radicalized to the extent of propaganda, to the extent that they weren't thinking what they did. The thing is that people now understand their point of view, therefore they are not in their bubble and don't hate that much. Because at the end of the day when they have understanding, you know you can do much more and actually the tension diffuses from there. But why is this actually the day, when you have understanding, you know you can do much more, and actually the tension diffuses from there. But why is this actually the case?

Notice that on our side, at least we have a conviction rate. On their side, they just get the runaways caught free with just telling a simple story. On our side, at the very least, we attempt for justice. At the very least, we try to seek out for punitive measures for the thousands of people who died, who didn't need to die, but then ended up dead anyways. Second thing on how they tell us that they're going to get all this information. This is a symmetric benefit because recognize that before a court proceeding could even happen in the first place, information has to be gathered and it has to be lengthy. So I don't understand why this information is only likely to happen on their side. But then thirdly, on how they mischaracterize TRC. It's not an independent body. The whole nature of a TRC is that it's internal. These states are going to manage themselves. So if they problematize bias, they're also going to have to mechanize to us why exactly this bias isn't going to exist. Even if these are NGOs, and even if these are members of the church, why exactly are they not going to be biased towards the state that they origin from? But then mass rebuttal, they give us no cap on what villainization looks like. They tell us that this is a mechanism on their side, wherein these individuals are probably going to be villainized. But if these individuals are going to be villainized anyway, if it's going to work on their side where they're going to be shunned out of society, then they might as well be jailed. What's the point of being out and about if the entire world is against you, right? But then secondly, even if they're not going to be villainized to that extent, then there's nothing possibly pushing them away from retaining their ill-gotten wealth, from getting back into positions of government, from getting back into positions where they can cost even more lives. They needed to prove this"

              "text": "in order to win. Per first point of clarification on what exactly the limitations of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee is, first, it's how it relied on voluntary participation, right? Recognize that they provide us mechanisms like amnesty and say that this is enough and sufficient of an incentive, but this wasn't enough, right? Because one, victims were firstly afraid of prosecution and persecution, right? They were afraid that other people would come against them and they would be attacked, especially in such a polarized era. But then secondly, on how the witness protection program was very limited under the TRC because of its inherent nature of being publicized, right? But then thirdly, on perpetrators likely not wanting to create more political enemies or concessions that would have given them a much more difficult chance to get into these positions of power, right? But then lastly, we also have to note that you cannot really subpoena these individuals under the TRC anyways. You cannot force them to talk. You cannot force the truth out of them. What they could possibly do is create some convoluted lie or create some convoluted piece of information, which they are more than likely able to do, seeing as they are in these positions of power in the first place. But second limitation, when how they prioritize forgiveness over justice, recognize that this never is going to happen, especially during the Yugoslav wars, where everyone's against each other. More on this in my second speaker, right? But then additionally, what happens here is you neglect the bitter feelings of the people on the ground, the feeling of wanting your mother's death to finally be avenged, right? The impact of this is twofold. First, accountability for war crimes were unsatisfactory. Abusers simply just get to walk free for telling a story, right? But then secondly, there's a lacking deterrence for future war crimes, which I already proved to you why it's so important. We have to prove that on our side. But then third, a third lacking thing from the TRC on how there's no guarantee of push-through with recommendations made by the TRC. A lacking piece of characterization coming from government is how the TRC only provides recommendations. They do not provide bounding check-in balances or new forms of accountability. All they provide are suggestions. This is why in South Africa, they had a difficult time rebuilding after the end of the apartheid because they didn't come up with solutions that were properly accounted for. They came up with idealistic solutions, and the new government had a very easy chance and decision to just disregard them."

              "text": "But then comparatively, the ICTY was created by the UN to set a precedent that regardless of which side of the conflict you were on, any and all breaches of human rights would never go unpunished. This looked like convicting criminals based on the magnitude and the action of their involvement. This looks like involving judicial mechanisms that already existed and were successful. Third, it looks like a clear establishment of facts so that the accused had the opportunity for due process. Two impacts to this. First, this instilled a deep fear of being convicted or pulled out in officials, especially since the ICTY lasted years and lasted for a very long time. Second, this gives victims the ability to feel like justice is being served, like they weren't just on the sidelines watching these individuals walk free after they murdered their entire family. But then even if these individuals were not convicted, it's better than just having to be forced to sit down and watch as your entire family goes by unrecognized, right? This is significant as well because this prevents individuals from having to seek vengeance for themselves and having to seek bloodshed to accommodate their own feelings of resentment, right? More on that later. First argument on why the ICTY was crucial in preventing further conflict. This is true because, one, of the quality of research and fact-finding, government concedes that on the ICTY, you destroy an entire life by sending them to prison. We think that this is an exact incentive why the ICTY had to be so thorough because they were going to send someone to prison and ruin their entire life, their reputation, and their dignity, right? But at the same time, we think that the ICTY also had an incentive because any incorrect ruling and sentence with lacking logical reasoning would have likely led to an insurgence of toxic nationalism, which was already prevalent at the time. This meant that the ICTY had a more rigorous judicial process, but also that any decision made by the court was harder to question. This is that the ICTY had a more rigorous judicial process, but also that any decision made by the court was harder to question. This is true because the court had multiple levels to it. It's harder to question. It's harder to appeal. There's a due process to this, right? The repercussions as well for publishing an incorrect or lacking report is so significantly less than charging an individual. The second layer to this is that victims did not have to avenge themselves. Under the TRC, all you get is a list and a front row view of your abuser walking away scot-free. You get no catharsis, so you likely have harder time moving on because you weren't even given the chance to try in the first place. This leads to things like microaggressions, movements, or violent acts, things that I mentioned earlier. On opposition, you get this form of catharsis because at the very least, you are able to be part of the process. At the very least, you are able to feel satiated in the fact that you tried. But then secondly to this argument is how this individualized guilt and responsibility. Recognize that without the ICTY, the likely prevalent belief is that this region or this race is probably a bunch of war criminals. This area is like a bunch of hate crimes, right? This raises tensions, and this raises a lot of conflict within these individuals. But at the very least, in status quo, there is some form of recognition that crimes were done by both sides because they were able to meticulously persecute each criminal or each political abuser, right? But then even if status quo has some level of prejudice, the TRC probably would have made it worse because they would have made their own conclusions from that long list of information anyways. But then last point on why the ICTY was necessary in rebuilding the post-conflict states. First, on how the ICTY provided a comprehensive legal framework. The international community learned from the ICTY. They used this in other applications as well. But in individual states, it helped dismantle previous structures of impunity, which was used as the foundation of law for these states. This also looked like the comprehensive system of the ICTY, at least being able to minimize feelings of pain and anger because of due process. But then secondly, how this allowed past conflict states to have a form of stability. You get a sense of justice, you get a sense that you actually tried, and I think that's so much better when you vote for opposition. Thank you."

If on our side, you know that this is all you can get in this sort of way, you know that the apology, the truth and reconciliation part is all you can get, you can't get anything else, while on their side you see other victims getting more, you see them getting more years for the same crime, while on our side you have to be satisfied because you got what"

The second thing I want to say is imagine how bad it will feel if they got pardoned after five years after they're sent into prison. Right. This will feel incredibly horrible. The whole of the judge system does not respect the death of your children. This is how it will feel. The bottom line is these people suffer greatly and it is not worth for the marginal impact on punishment that being done once for the people who never got who got pardoned and the victims that suffered by that. Right. Then what else do they tell us on let's continue with deterrence before that yes sure go. The problem is not having enough convictions. How do you get that on your end when the DRC lacks judicial jurisdiction to convict someone? We explain other ways people can get closure and victims can feel good. It's not the only way to punish somebody. There are so many other ways. My first speaker outlines them. I won't repeat them. Okay, great. Then let's continue to the deterrence point. They say, ah, this is likely to deter all other, this is likely to deter other people from doing these sort of particular things. We believe that for you to do war crimes, you need to have significant reasons to do these sort of war crimes, to be ordered to do them, or for you to truly hate this nation. When emotions are at play, you most probably won't consider, or when you are about to die, you most probably won't consider the implication of die city-wide, suing me after 5 years or 27 years, which was the reality, by the way. You most probably wouldn't consider that when you're doing war crimes. War crimes is something that happens emotionally when you particularly hate a certain ethnicity and all these sorts of things. You most probably wouldn't think, ah, i'm going to get sued after 27 years you are not rational while doing this this is ridiculous right what else do they tell us they tell us these people simply would"

Firstly, they will say this. Why will they say this? Because they fear the court. We know that these people got pardoned. We know that these people didn't get that number of sentences. They didn't know this. Right. At the point which they didn't know this, they're likely to go for telling the truth and receiving an amnesty and risk going to jail. They don't know how. Right. And the point is they didn't know this. They're likely to go for telling the truth and receiving an amnesty and risk going to jail. They don't know how effective this cult is. We know it. This is the doubt here. But secondly, the debate is symmetrical if we're talking about the people who won't tell. Because then they will go to the ICTY. Right. So we're talking only about the people who will tell this sort of particular thing. Great. Then let's continue with the, yes, okay, let's continue with the other argument. The other argument is basically on the ICT, why, how it throws ethnic tensions. There are a few things I want to say here. Ah, no, no, there was the bias idea. Okay, they say, ah, the church will be very biased. Like, please notice, we say that this will be done by unbiased institutions, right? But also there is a high incentive for this thing to happen because you want to show some sort of legitimacy to the victims. When it's done by an unbiased institution, this is something that will happen. But when it's done by, for example, the government or somebody who is biased, then this will not happen. They will not feel satisfied. They're likely to protest. No government wants this. This leads to destabilization. This leads to all these sorts of things. But also the church specifically as an actor is really good because it has moral consideration at hand. They want to do the good thing because they believe they will go to hell if they don't do the good thing. This is why the church specifically is the good actor to do this. Right, okay, now let's continue the argument of how ICTY rose ethnic tensions. Now please notice there are three mechanizations here. Firstly, the ICTY is perceived as illegitimate in the countries it operated. Firstly, notice how there was this proportionate sentencing of Serbs. 91 Serbs were sentenced, 44 Croats were sentenced, and 0 Kosovo people were sentenced to life. Right. At the point where this is the case, we believe that firstly, Serbs were unhappy because they see, ah, proportionately, it doesn't make sense, they should have gotten sentenced as much as us. But Croats are also not happy because Croats thought, no, no, they started the war, so we shouldn't have any people sentenced. So both sides are unhappy and both sides think the court is illegitimate. The second reason, judges work from countries part of the NATO and notice that these countries don't like NATO because NATO bombed them in the past in this sort of particular way. So they don't like the judges from this country, so they don't like the verdict that these judges do. Thirdly, this gives platform to be scandalous to the war criminals, not if they're likely to campaign in their supportive countries. This looks like Voislav Shechil, who used... No, no, I won't take POS anymore. He used testimony to discredit the court, saying the court was rigged. We do these changes because they have to apologize, they have to admit their guilt, so they can't discredit the court in this particular way. Right, as my first speaker said, these people are war heroes, you will believe these people, right. But secondly, the decisions did not lead to an effective decision, because it lead to a lot of appeals and releases. Notice, the burden of proof for crime against humanity is incredibly high, and it was lacking due to firstly them refusing to talk, because when they talk they will get a higher sentence, because they have to plead guilty to more things. But secondly, they had to prove that the head officer controlled subordinates, which is something incredibly hard and pretty much impossible when recordings were not a thing. Right. But even if they were sued, the case, the case are revised as the new technology emerges and many of them were released, particularly 60 out of the 161 people done. Notice, this means that the decisions seem even more uncertain and illegitimate to the average person. Right. Then what is the bottom line of this? People on both sides perceive the court as illegitimate, which led to the rising of these sort of particular tensions. And they turn to things like violence in this sort of particular way, because you feel like you have to avenge your country. You feel like you were robbed. You feel like this great person was taken from you, so you have to revenge the ethnicity that has done this to you in this sort of particular way. This means that more violence is likely to happen on their side of the house, with the ISTRI actively making things even worse. Vote for us. Thank you. Is everyone ready? Okay."

We agreed with them, but we told you it happens and or information happens on either side of the house. When you start a literal court case, obviously you would need evidence. You would need to investigate. You get that at the start of the case. Kim already explained why this is better because of due process. She also explained that the truth is useless if you do nothing with it. But secondly, they say that their alternative is not justice. It's simply just the truth and somehow people are going to be forgiving of the person that murdered their family member. There's a glaring contradiction here, because if it is true, using their own premise, that in status quo, everyone was not happy due to the fact that not everyone got convicted, I'm pretty sure that victims on the ground would be more upset and angry and would have more hatred if they didn't even get a chance at a hearing or they didn't get a chance at the court case. I would never forgive someone who took away my mother from my arms, especially if I knew their identity and who they were. I probably would want reparations then. Two lines of argumentation. Firstly, why the TRC will never have the capacity to create cohesive narratives. This is the premise that they miss on their end. The premise of this argument is simple, that nationalistic eco-chambers were established far before the war started. They already hated each other before the wars, and this led to a lot of misinformation and states vilifying, villainizing each other. We needed a body to counteract this denial culture and historical revisionism beyond reasonable doubt. On their end, they still held"

We saw this in Liberia with the civil war when they wanted to investigate the president. They banned them from investigating other groups.

You just get these competing narratives. The comparative is very simple. At the very least, the ICTY has judicial jurisdiction over all of these territories. So these territories cannot withhold information or else they are going to be tried as well. They're going to be tried as well. But secondly, you have to realize on their end, there's more fear in speaking out. Like, for example, one, perpetrators are going to be scared to be subject to the torture by their higher officials, so they're probably not going to out their own officials anyways, especially due to nationalistic sentiment. But even so, even if they want to speak out and convict their own higher officials, there's probably going to be minimal information and it's going to be insufficient then on their end. At the very least, again, there's judicial jurisdiction that makes you need, like, that forces you to have to tell the truth anyways. But secondly, on the victims themselves, on their end, they have to relive the trauma. And yeah, on either side of the bench, they have to speak out. But on their end, you get no reparations. It is not going to be worth it. On their end as well, secondly, is that their narratives can be questioned. You have to realize there's a strong denial culture. Truth can be manipulated, especially by political elites. And if their comparative is that everyone gets to speak out, when you have these competing narratives, everyone can tell a different story. They do not guarantee why it's going to be cohesive in the first place. The comparative then is very clear on three layers. One, on our end, not necessarily everyone has to speak out and be put in court, but those who feel a strong sense of emotion are the ones who are going to feel the most betrayed if the ICTY never existed, are going to speak out. And we believe that secondly, this is going to feel more empowering because you are able to be part of the process. You are able, even if you're unable to convict, at the very least you are able to speak out and do something. And that in itself is good enough for you as a victim. But lastly, is that you have unable to convict, at the very least, you're able to speak out and do something, and that in itself is good enough for you as a victim. But lastly, is that you have support from the international community, and this links to Kim's framing on where this is done by the UN, right? The TRC, again, is an intergovernmental organization, which means these states are going to be doing it themselves. They do not have the capacity to have good investigations because they are literally post-conflict. They do not have enough resources to have these investigations in the first place. At the very least, in the ICPY under the UN, one, you have funding for investigations because it's not only these states funding themselves, but other external bodies as well, like the West or NATO. But secondly, it is large-scale. You get large-scale attention because now this is an international thing. It's not just between states, it is between everyone involved, right? But in addition to that, not only do you get third-party objectivity, but again, you get the attention that you need, especially as these victims. Before I proceed, go PY. Understand that you have to prove why you have the capacity to make people retributed. You have only 161 cases. There are a lot of people who don't have justice on your side too. 161 cases is better than zero on their end, obviously. But lastly, let's assume they can get the information. One, it is delegitimized because there's no judicial repercussions. You can easily just say that this person's accounts are wrong. We saw this, for example, with the Ecuador TRC when they investigated the dictatorial regime and the military generals just said that, ah, these victims are wrong and manipulated the information. This is what's going to happen if you establish a TRC with Yugoslavia. But lastly, there's no guarantee that these people are going to incarcerate themselves again. Like, they're probably just going to invalidate victims. These victims cannot fight back because they do not have a court on their end. The comparative then is very clear. We do not deny these crimes that have been committed and we do not praise the criminals who did these crimes in the first place. We are able to establish a more factual understanding of what happened because this is literally the judicial court. You cannot question it. The truth doesn't matter if there's no action to support it then. But lastly, on the process of catharsis and why justice was better for it. On three main metrics. One, the TRC was hollow and it made you feel powerless because yeah, you spoke up but what comes after that? You just have"

Kim already explained why this looks like microaggressions, and this is worsened on their end, when you cannot individualize guilt, when you're just going to release reports on who exactly killed your family members, and you get no reparations. I don't care how long these reparations take. At the very least, at the end of the day, you got it in the first place.

              "text": "First of all, on effectiveness and retribution of victims, effectiveness of conviction. Secondly, on victims. And third, on the aftermath of all of this. First of all, on effectiveness. A push that opposition is trying to make is, oh, we made only 161 convictions, but you made zero. This is a strong mind-year panel because the thing that we're trying to argue for is that convictions are not the way, truth is the way. Notice, and why is this important? Us finding who the criminals are even without convicting them is way more important because it comes to a precondition to any consequences happening. This means that before weighing as to whether or not the depth of the consequence is enough we have to have a consequence and someone to punish. First of all, this means that the analysis that is coming from proposition as to why we're able to discover more criminals and to catch them is important simply because their case cannot stand without it. Because we don't know who these people are, we are the only team acknowledging guilty in this debate. But also the problem with ICTY is that they are only catching 161 convictions to 60,000 deaths. You can see how the percentages are ridiculous and this is not something that they can acknowledge. What are we pushing in this debate is A, due to different burden of proof, due to different amount of evidence, these institutions like the ICTY are slow and ineffective in catching these criminals. What responses do we hear from them? We hear that the burden of proof is the same. This is intuitively incorrect. For example, in our world, you get no investigation for getting a parking ticket, but you also will get investigated for first-degree murder. This means that the higher the consequence, the higher the investigation, on our side of the house, the judicial consequence is zero. But also, something that they're trying to argue for investigation, on our side of the house, the judicial consequence is zero. But also, something that they're trying to argue for is that on our side of the house, because you're not convicted, you get no consequences. This is incorrect, dear panel. After you admit guilt, you will get extremely delegitimized. Why is this the case? Because the people that support you are the people who are going to listen to you and only you, not the court, because they're so radicalized that you're a war hero. This means that when they hear you say that you're guilty, that they will turn against you because heroes don't do immoral things, because heroes don't murder people brutally for no reason, but also because evidence of these people's tombs are constantly brought up every time you're trying to, for example, backtrack on your apology, even after our framing that was never engaged as to why these people cannot backtrack their apologies and have to fill certain criteria in order to be eligible for amnesty. Okay, second of all, on victims. Why do we believe that victims are better retributed on the other side of the house? Notice, why is jail not enough? One, as the victim, you don't feel the person suffering as much, and you don't feel the positive that much. Why? This person is rotting in jail. You're far away from him. You don't have much information as to what is happening for him. He can be let go. He could be a poet. You don't know. But on our side of the house, what you get is the mindset that you know what is happening to your child. You don't have to constantly sit there and wonder where is he, what happened to him. Later on, please. Which gives you peace of have to constantly sit there and wonder where is he, what happened to him, later on please. Which gives you peace of mind, which affects you to a much deeper level because it's in your mind. These are internal impacts that you have to live with every single day and that you see constantly. But also notice you'll probably be summoned in the TRC in order for this person to apologize to you. This is face-to-face contact which means that again you have more, you're better impacted by the means on proposition. Second point of length. Notice their arguments on retribution are dependent on the individual victim's understanding of morality. Notice some victims may want this person to die. Some victims may want nothing to happen to them because people have different beliefs as to what is moral and what these people deserve due to different reasons. This means that their case is only true to a certain amount of cases. On the other, on the flip side though, we are 100% sure that the only way to get this closure on our side of the house is for these people to confess simply because we proved to them why they have no incentive and no way of finding out this evidence otherwise in court because they will never say it because it will lead to a higher conviction. But okay, three in a bit. You will be retributed anyways because these people will be delegitimized even on our side of the house. Again, on the flip side, you will never get closure. And lastly, notice the amount of victims that we are able to retribute is much higher than their amount of victims because we catch more criminals. This means that even if the retribution is unfairly more on their side of the house, notice how we are able to help more victims, which means that, again, we are able to, again, at the end of the day, get higher retribution. In order to win truth versus justice, we needed to prove why truth isn't symmetrical and why black people are okay with having only truth and no truth process. Okay, actually this came in the first speech. These people, these criminals cannot lie. Why? Because we can chase this information. If you say that the body is buried in place X, you just check place X and see if there are bodies. If the information that person A and person B are giving are contradictory, you just have to figure out who is right by interrogating more people. And if you don't find out that they're telling 100% the truth, you just won't give them amnesty. This is our framing, but you never engage with it. But okay, people say, they say people just won't believe the TRC. No. First of all, notice how political parties have no incentive to discredit this TRC because then they look guilty themselves, because people trust these institutions deeply because they're independent and because they haven't failed them in the past, like the church, for example, because they're not political, putting into perspective like political parties who are obviously biased. But also victims who always listen no matter the rep of this institution simply because they want to know and again they will find out eventually. So dear panel we believe that if you want these victims to be retributed, if you believe that catching 70%"

These cases represented the highest top officials who were responsible for the majority of the war crimes committed in the Yugoslav wars. These were the criminals that represented a lot of the war crimes that were going on.

Because they tell us, coming from proposition, oh, there's an incentive not to tell the truth or the full truth if you're in court. But we tell you that the TRC, historically, does not even incentive not to tell the truth or the full truth if you're in court. But we tell you that the TRC, historically, does not even cross-examine the people that they interview. And if you are delegitimized, if there is a consequence to telling the truth, then there's even less reason to give accurate information. So, it is unclear to me why they're able to get better truth when you still have independent investigative bodies that don't need to interview people under the ICT way, under our will. So we think, at best, truth is a wash, probably it's better on our end, but at the same time, they fail to prove to us how we are able to get justice. Because when we already tell you, coming from all of our speakers, that local courts are likely to be ineffective insofar as there's a bias to prosecute against criminals that hurt their country, or to give amnesty to criminals that did support their country, insofar as there's limited resources, insofar as it's a post-conflict state, and there's likely to be a lot of corruption, it is unclear how catharsis is likely to occur. So we tell you, first, the ICPY is likely to be less biased than the TRC, or at the very least, it has better funding. And second, we tell you that you're better able to get catharsis through justice, which you're only able to get on the RN. But even if the ICTY was not perfect, the TRC would have been even worse. Why? Because we tell you that insofar as you aren't able to get catharsis through truth, this hatred, the lingering hatred that would have remained if this anger was not addressed, if there were no prosecutions, if you saw these war criminals have literally no consequences for their actions because they are given amnesty."

So even if they say that, oh, truth is not the main thing that the TRC gives, but reconciliation or maybe rehabilitative policies, the TRC historically has had no mandate to actually implement these policies. Like in Canada, the TRC, out of the 96 or so policies they passed, only nine have even been implemented in the past 30 years. So it's unclear how they're able to get actual action on their end. It is unclear how the truth is able to give people what they want. We already tell you why that's unlikely to happen. We tell you why prosecution is the only way you're able to get catharsis insofar as there are consequences for the person that hurt you or the people that hurt you. Insofar as it is representative justice through the ICPY that would probably not have existed on their end. We think that it is far clearer that we are able to get catharsis on our end. And therefore the prerequisite of reconciliation and peace in the former Yugoslav region. For all of these reasons, I'm incredibly proud to oppose. Thank you. Okay."

They can only say that the truth and information will allow victims to heal and somehow these victims are going to forgive these perpetrators. We already claimed, especially from Kim, that information will happen on either side of the bench and it's probably going to happen better on our side because we already said that you're literally convicting another person. You need it to be meticulous. Even if it took time, you needed it to be meticulous in order to have a cohesive account or a cohesive understanding of what happened during this war. But secondly, their entire case is contingent on this information being good, and they conceded at first that it will be less comprehensive than the ICTY because the TRC takes less time than the ICTY. They didn't want to have this sort of time lag. So what this means is that, one, we already explained they're probably not going to go through all the evidence like Kim mentioned. It's probably not going to be as meticulous as the ICTY.

Firstly, on the value of truth without justice, but secondly, on solvency after the war has happened. Firstly, on the value of truth without justice. This is where a lot of their case is contingent on. They say knowledge is important. We already told you, knowledge happens on either side of the bench. But other than that, the difference is that on their side, the PRC does not allow victims to avenge themselves. It doesn't allow victims to speak out against the abuses. It only allows them to release these types of reports or release information, right? But imagine you lost your husband on the front lines, your child witnessed the massacre of their entire town. You probably want to have a chance, at the very least, a chance to do something. Regardless of the consequences, these people who go on the stand, they don't care about the amount of pressure they're going to feel after. All they want is a chance to see these people convicted. Even if that doesn't happen, they wanted to go through the process because the comparative then is informal justice. These people who are experiencing these high levels of emotion who can never move on are going to engage in microaggressions. If it is true that this already happens in status quo, if this is true that it already happens in status quo, if this is true that it already happens in status quo, it is going to happen on their end to a larger extent because they do lack the option of a judicial due process through the ICTY. All you had was the TRC. It was ineffective. But lastly, insolvency. We already told you that at the very least, we already told you that grief sticks. Hatred is going to linger. If you couldn't fully forgive them with the ICTY, why are you going to forgive them with the TRC if they're simply releasing reports? What Kim mentioned as well is that at the very least, we were able to rebuild from the ground up because the ICTY set a precedent that no crime should go unpunished, that no stone should be left unturned. We should hold all of these people accountable because of the things they did to the people on the ground, right? This was the reason why they were able to rebuild the systems in the first place. Even if these local systems aren't perfect, even if the international system isn't perfect, at the very least, we have the opportunity to go to court as opposed to forcing these individuals to just read the report and telling them, hey, this report is out, this is the timeline of the events, forgive the person who hurt you. I would never forgive the person who killed my mother within this war, right? You cannot expect someone to do that. At the very least, we're able to give them some sort of catharsis. They're able to go up on that stand and tell you that, Hey, we should hold this person accountable. I don't care how long it takes. I do not care if you do not get the conviction. What they needed was the process of it in order to have some sort of solvency, in order to have some sort of peacevency, in order to have some sort of peace. You get none of that on proposition. What they had to prove was why exactly justice was irrelevant. They had to explain why justice was irrelevant."

Because you believe you didn't get enough.

You can get a verdict without finding a body, for instance, but by somebody snitching. With us, we know all the information, with you know only a bit of the information, which leaves victims even more paralyzed, because, for instance, they know when their children died, but they don't know when they died, where they died, all this sort of stuff. We get all the info, we get some of the info, which makes the victims think about it even more, remember this even more, feel even more horrible in this particular way. Right. Then, what else? Ah, yes, the info is not accessible. Once again, first speech framing. The info is not accessible to the average victim with you. Why? They were made in English. The language is very complicated because this sort of particular, because this court was from NATO, this court is in English. But secondly, evidence is very confidential. This is a thing that you most probably cannot share very publicly, right? But thirdly, it uses complicated vocabulary, right?

We say the court and decisions are viewed as bias. We say that you view them as done by bad actors. We say they took too long time. We say people were getting pardoned and you believe this is not fair. We say they give less sentences. We say all of these things. The only response we get is in third speech where they basically say they have other reasons for them to do nationalistic things. But like, no, we believe this is not the case. Why is this the reason? Because you you, yes, because this is, because you view this person as the war hero. You view this person as the one who started your nationalism, as the one who spread the propaganda that should be nationalistic. When he stays up and says, I forgive, I apologize for this, I did something wrong, you are likely to think, ah, this person is my hero, I looked up to this person, I am going to most probably decide to not do nationalistic things anymore, because he told me to, because I look up to him, because he's my role model as a Serbian person. Right. At the point where this is the case, this rebuttal doesn't work. And this is the most important clash point. Why? Because it affects more people in a more unique way than the victim clash point. Why? Because this looks like discrimination on the best case. Feeling unsafe in the country or in the church, constantly going to get attacked by some sort of minorities, not getting hired because you're some part of a minority. And this impacts every single person from this ethnicity. And yes, all that happened to the victims is incredibly sad. And we are very forgetful and we are very forgetful about this. But like what is important is that the people who suffer from nationalism are more than 60,000 from 25 years ago up to now and up to the future."

We see there's currently a mix of both sides parenting model, although our side is gaining more prominence right now. But we have traditionally been more accustomed to viewing teenagers as teens. You view them to be more irrational, that as a parent, you know what's better for them than they do themselves."

              "text": "Second, what does our parenting model look like on our side? We say adultification looks like a general guidance framework. This obviously adapts differently to different families through trial and error. But generally, here are the main outlines. One, we would give teenagers more freedom on our side. You will likely have more financial autonomy, like a monthly allowance, instead of asking their parents for money on every purchase or having their parents decide whether or not you can buy something. You also probably will be allowed to leave the house more. You have later or laxer curfews. We would also probably assign them more responsibility. This can look like, for example, encouraging your teenagers to gain a summer or part-time job or on a smaller scale. You may have more responsibilities at home to just feeding or cleaning your baby sister, cooking your own food and chores along those lines. Thirdly, then, what is the comparative and their model on Singapore side? We say parents are likely to be stricter with teenagers, such as making a 10 p.m. curfew a hard rule, not allowing them to drink or they face punishment otherwise. We'll concede that you probably also will give them less responsibilities. The bottom line is two models are not only different on what is and isn't allowed, but how parents and children communicate and how they choose to do these things, i.e. on issues like sex. On opposition side, parents likely think these teenagers are too young to do this and therefore ban them from having it with their boyfriend in totality. On our side, parents are less likely to be actively against sex, but they're likely still going to prepare you properly, i.e. they're more likely to teach you how to use a condom right, teach you consent.

Every piece of media and every natural instinct you have as a parent is to be protected.

They overweight risk with constant unfounded fear for their children's safety and the image of them as just a kid being built into their heads, do not think they can make good decisions. This implies on both sides. Parents probably won't just throw their hands up entirely and not care about their children. But also, we see physically or significantly emotionally abusive or neglectful parents are probably not in this debate as well, given the type of parents that would do this are likely symmetric.

              "text": "model you're doing. You don't really care anyways. First argument, how do we better family relationships? Parent-child relationships are extremely important for any teen, but especially for teens who need to navigate through the tumultuous transition to adulthood. Firstly then, in opposition, why are relationships constantly at the risk of getting fractured? Here's the case. This is the reason why. Teenagers are going through a lot of physical and mental changes. They learn more about the world. They understand issues that 10-year-olds probably don't. This also means their preferences are likely to change. So for example, when you are a child, you really don't know what it's like to like to like want to get in to get get into a relationship with someone else. But when you are a teenager, it becomes much more proximate. It is also during this time that there may also be more peer pressure to hang out at night or try out activities like drinking. The freedom to make these decisions on how they spend their time and what they want to do is also something teenagers increasingly want. This desire translates into rebellion because parents continue to treat their children as their teenagers as children. This is inflammatory. This coddling goes against the very desire of teens to be given more independence. Consequently, you get teenagers having to sneak out at night because their friends want them to come out and have screaming matches with their parents the next morning about it. Even if the child doesn't end up sneaking out, there's going to be a lot of friction between parents and children because they want entirely different things. Note that when relationships sour during the teenage years, for many households, it is sometimes irreversible. It becomes hard to go back when you spend years fighting and being frustrated with your parents. Why don't we get better parent-child relationships on our side then? Because we say parents are more likely to communicate maturely with their teenagers rather than patronize them. Opposition's parents likely don't try to justify and have a dialogue with their kids on decisions, because parents still believe that their child is incapable of making rational decisions for major life issues. Instead, the parent tries to teach the child that the parent's opinion is the right one rather than discussed together. Note there's a large difference between scolding your child or actively trying to lecture them versus trying to communicate with them. On opposition, the teenager is more likely to feel like they are being ordered around. On our side, that teenager discusses with their parents who is more likely to listen to them on an equal level. The impact of communicating rather than lecturing is immense. It means the teenager feels hurt and respected instead of frustrated that your parent doesn't seem to believe you can also have a right opinion. Think of a typical parenting scenario. Your teen requests to drink at an after-party after graduation and prom night. You as a parent could bluntly refuse on their side. Many children probably grew up in this kind of household in Asian families when your parents refuse to justify their decisions and just say they know better than you. Or you can take the time and explain to them why it's a bad idea or perhaps against their self-interest to get really drunk at a party and then drive home. By doing this, you as a teen better internalize that your parents aren't just being mean, or more likely going to look out for you. We avoid the frustration in Singapore's world. We avoid this miscommunication and misunderstanding that often happens. The impact of this is twofold. One, that you are less likely to have toxic arguments with your parents that anger everyone. It's not a fun time for any side or any party. But second, this is really important. You are more likely to obey their orders in the first place when you respect them more and understand your parents' decisions more. This means on our side, teenagers are more likely to follow the general guidance as well. Realize how useless Singapore's parental rules are if nobody's going to buy in and follow them on their side. The conclusion is we get far better relationships on our side that also aid a child's development. Before I take the multi-second argument, I'll take that POI. If it is true that parents want to have a good relationship with their child, why is it then that they are unlikely want to explain this in a fairly rational and reasonable way to children in our world when they don't let them do something? Yeah, this is about perception, right? Whether the child believes their parents are trying to lecture them or whether they're believing you're trying to communicate them on legal grounds. Secondly, how we better prepare teenagers for the future. The premise and weighing of this is that the role of a parent extends beyond the first 18 years of a child's life. They must prepare that teenager for the future to ensure once they leave the nest, they are able to thrive. We would rather responsibility and freedom be gradually given to them as opposed to suddenly being thrusted upon them on site Singapore. Why are children very unprepared in opposition's world? Because we say they often get a lot of responsibility thrust onto them the second they leave for college, when they're suddenly given a bank account they now have to manage, when they suddenly do not have parents looking over their shoulder in their dorm rooms. We agree that parents on both sides want their children to be prepared for the future, but it is about the method in which you undertake it."

This may be useful, but it's hard for the teenager to manage when they've never had the experience of handling their own money before, of having this trial and error process. This is why Drew is still largely clueless over his money, our second speaker, by the way. On our side, parents give the children a set amount of money during their teenage years, but the child can spend however they like. They're able to guide them when they ask for advice. It's far more likely the greater autonomy is significantly more beneficial. But we see teens in Singapore's world are less likely to know how to navigate the world beyond their childhood bubble, when they were once discouraged from dating but now are given a lot of sexual freedom. They won't know how to go about safe sex, learn the red flags of toxic partners, or understand the impact of what their actions are. Why on our side, comparatively, are we better in preparing teenagers for the future? Because often, one, you allow them to know how to handle themselves better. And you know how to manage your finances in time when you have different responsibilities. When there's a habit of knowing how to cook your own food for themselves and your siblings, you know how to take care of yourself in college much better. But additionally, teenagers do not need parents to constantly motivate and scrutinize them. When you are used to your parents nagging at you for studying for a test, joining a club, or finishing your work, once you get into university, you don't have any of this. You won't have developed your own habits of motivation. You are more likely to academically struggle when you rely on an external source of motivation. You are likely to have a difficult time on their side of the house when you won't on ours. Let's make a preemption quickly, because they may say teenagers are going to make bad choices on our side of the house. But we say often these choices aren't going to be atrocious. Parents on both sides will try to prevent their children from doing the worst of stuff like drugs, from constantly being blackout drunk because this is a health risk and even a crime in many cases. All of this means teenagers are far more prepared for the future in our side of the house. Proposition to decide that cares for a child's development while opposition actively worsens it. Okay. I thank the speaker very much for their speech. If I can confirm that my panelists are ready, I'd like a thumbs up, nod, tweet, in which case I welcome the first speaker from side opposition to begin the opposition case. Hi, can I be seen and heard? Sorry about the echo. Great, thank you."

Sorry, we're so sorry to interrupt, but basically there's just been a lot of drilling in our room, so could you give us maybe a second to move because we can't hear anything the drilling is really loud yeah um the volunteer can make sure they're yeah perfect thank you Sorry, can I check what was the last thing you heard me say?

Hong Kong, you're muted. um the last thing we got to was the start of the setup of singapore i'm sorry we're trying to really urgently fix the issue because we think it's the floor above that's doing intention would it be better if actually i restart the speech because if they heard didn't care much of the setup yeah um if if that's if that's preferable between the two teams that's fine um but I will note that I'm going to request judges if they're typing to formally like delete everything uh quite mainly and if they're writing to literally rip out the page and throw it out as long as Singapore understands that as does Hong Hong cool okay if that's the problem I'm so sorry for the inconvenience we're trying to fix the issue in um one minute don't worry um we'll give you a couple of minutes uh to to fix it just let us know when you're good uh Singapore I hope that's that's all good Thank you. Okay, the sound has stopped so we should hopefully be good proceeding. Sorry. No worries. Okay. Um, first prop speaker, uh, op speaker, um, you are good to go when you feel ready. Uh, again, everyone please do wipe that from your writing and your mind, if possible. Pop speaker, whenever you're ready. Okay, I'll just restart from the start, yeah? Sorry, I can't hear. Yeah, Hong Kong speaker, are you trying to talk? No, no, no, okay, I think they're talking to her teammates. That's right. Let's look at Proposition's understanding of adultification. They say, and they give examples, that adultification means giving teenagers more chores or a monthly allowance. Sorry, we don't need to defend teenagers being treated as children on our side. In most societies, teenagers are viewed as capable of shouldering some degree of responsibility. That's why they can go out with their friends or drive a car in many jurisdictions. They need to defend giving teenagers actually adult responsibilities, not just sex, but the autonomy to drink or smoke when it's legal, or to impose them the burden of having to earn their own pocket money, as you do in adulthood. Let's be clear about two things. Our side can incrementally increase the responsibilities that teenagers bear, but this increase would happen much more gradually than proposition. And generally, in their world, parents have far fewer mechanisms to influence a child's choice because they cannot use punishments or strong advice for fear that it encroaches on independence, which is a key aspect they have to defend of adulthood. What is our stance? We prefer parenting models which emphasize their status and treatment as teenagers. Crucially, this debate occurs when there is a legitimate choice between these models. So if a teenager must work to ensure that his family doesn't starve, this choice wouldn't exist because they're in positions where they must shoulder adults-like responsibilities. I will forward two arguments in this speech, first on counterbalancing teenage recklessness, second on compromising mental health. Before that, some rebuttal. Their first argument was about bettering family relationships, and they say that teenagers are rebellious, leading to sneaking out at night or screaming contests with their parents. These hyperbolic impacts are built on two very flimsy mechanisms. The first mechanism is just simplistic. They say parents don't let kids fulfill their desires and therefore it creates resentment. They neglect the underlying reason that kids are rebellious, because it looks unfair. That's why the most common complaint against parents that teenagers raise is, for instance, my friend's parents let them drink, whereas you are not letting me do that same thing. We eliminate the perception of unfairness because most parents don't let their kids go out or drink late at night in our world, meaning that we significantly mitigate unfairness, which is the underlying reason for this mechanism. The second mechanism, they say, is that you're more likely to communicate as a parent than to patronize your teenagers on their side. They don't explain why parents don't have incentives to explain to children the rationale behind their decisions to limit their autonomy. Because if they concede that parents have incentives to do this because they want good relationships with their children, then similarly, they will explain their decisions on our side, making their benefits exclusive. This argument is just out of the round. The second argument was about how they prepared teenagers for adulthood. Again, the examples show that this argument is built on a misunderstanding of the debate. A big part of treating teenagers as a teenager is to introduce many of these basic life skills, like, for instance, doing chores, like, for instance, cooking food, or, for instance, imbuing a basic knowledge about safe sex. So it's unclear why exactly parents don't have the active incentive to teach these basic skills to teenagers on our side of the house. Before I move on, I thought I heard a POI. See, in that first argument on counterbalancing teenage recklessness, the premise of this argument is that there are two inherent aspects of teenage psychology that make teenagers structurally overestimate their ability to be an adult. First, cognitively, their brains are wired in a way that breeds overconfidence. Neuroscientific research has found that because teenagers have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex responsible for rational decision-making, teenagers frequently rely on the amygdala to make decisions, which is associated with emotions and impulses. Given that the brain is not consciously aware of how it in itself is wired, teenagers are inherently oblivious to their instinct of overconfidence. The second structural reason is that teenagers are uniquely susceptible to societal pressures because teenage years are a special period of identity formation. Their developing brains are trying to figure out who they are and who they want to be. This fuels an instinctive craving for acceptance and belonging, making them especially vulnerable to peer pressure and popular culture, where shows like Breaking Bad and Sex Education frequently portray teenagers engaging in vice, like for instance, doing drugs, like for instance, having sex. That's why the vast majority of smokers in the world pick up the habit at 17 or younger. The upshot is that teenagers are inherently likely to take on adult responsibilities they cannot handle. It looks like a 17-year-old staying out until 3am in the dangerous streets of Memphis because she thinks she is old enough for that. It looks like a teenage couple having sex because that's a cornerstone of the adult experience before the girl gets pregnant and is forced to go through the traumatic experience of an abortion. In our world, parents balance against this inherent psychological bias teenagers experience by treating them like their age. I know Proposition has said that teenagers are rebellious, but this doesn't cut into the argument because parents don't just advise their teenagers about what they should do. They take active steps to prevent teenagers from rebelling by monitoring what their teenagers do to implementing, for instance, punishments or curfews. Hence, we uniquely prevent teenagers from making risky decisions that harm themselves in the future because it's very and uniquely hard for teenagers to circumvent these measures on our side of the house. Before I move on to the second argument, happy to take that. Given you concede that parents will be more likely to punish their teens on your side, are teenagers more or less likely to confide in their parents when they do make a mistake, such as drinking excessively? My second argument is entirely about how you hurt the mental health of teenagers. Maybe that will respond directly to that POI. Second argument on compromising mental health. The premise is that adulthood is complex, which means that treating a teenager like an adult means exposing teenagers to the full range of complexities of adulthood, not just the joys of having independence, but also the burdens of adult experiences. When we shield teenagers from these burdens because we don't treat them as adults, parents on prop are far more likely to be frank about these struggles because they're key parts of their own adult life. It means exposing them to the pain of adultery in their parents' marriage. It means exposing them to the immense pressure of having to deal with ballooning debt and living paycheck to paycheck. This is devastating for two reasons. First, because children go through many other struggles that act as burdens to them, adapting to new academic expectations or having to adapt to a brand new social environment at school. While these struggles sound trivial to adults, the fact that children have fewer lived experiences means that there are psychologically huge challenges for them because it's the first time as a teenager you're going through such an experience. The second reason is that parents are the main support system"

              "text": "in their O2. So then moving on to clashes. Firstly, on who improves family relationships? Because we told you this is about communication. Parents, when they see their teens as helpless children, are likely to refuse, no thank you, to explain their decisions or engage in a dialogue or debate with them. The impacts of this were very important, not just on better relationships, but also on getting orders that actually followed. Because if the opposition's case is only that parents can tell their kids what to do, great. But if teens never listen to what their parents say, then what case do they have? Parents telling their kids what to do is useless if they don't follow them on the opposition side. They say, if you want a good relationship with your kids, then obviously explanations of your decisions would exist on the opposition side as well, right? Several responses. Firstly, the issue is that a parent doesn't see scolding or ordering their child around as an act that risks their relationship until the relationship is already ruined. They see it as an obligation. You think it's your strongest obligation to enforce these rules to protect your child who is in need of protection. This translates into parents refusing to budge to whatever their teenager tries to say. It's not just about having all these incentives, it's about prioritization thereof. But note also, secondly, the bottom line is that parents on both sides do want the best for their kids, but many parents aren't always the best at communication. They may not always know the best way to illustrate a point or explain the issue for their kids. It's a lot easier to just blanket say, hey, I know best. Obviously, I know better than you. You're only 14. So I'm just going to make the decisions here. Listen to me. It's a lot harder for a parent to then go through all the process, explaining their rationalization, making sure their teen understands. It's about the difficulty and what a parent likely chooses to do. But thirdly, this isn't about voicing your own opinions. No, thank you. But about listening to your teenagers' opinions as well. You may explain your own opinion, but if you refuse to listen to your teenagers, if you don't compromise with them to some extent, that is what generates frustration in the first place, when you think you're more mature than them and that you will always know better. But fourthly, I think this is empirically just simply the truth, right? The average reasonable voter started out as a kid, judge you were a teen too. You probably experienced your parents being the best and ending the discussion there. This is just unfortunately the reality."

              "text": "But secondly, they claim the teens on their framing already get chores and allowed to have sex in the status quo. Their countermodel is slowly engaging in more responsibilities. This is the core of Singapore's case. OK, firstly, I don't think sex is very much a normal thing parents allow now, right? I don't know how lax Singapore's parents are, but they don't seem to be in the majority in the status quo. But here's the structural reason why. Because parents obviously err on the side of caution and infantilization. You are always terrified of your teen getting into a car crash when they drive, and you see them as just a kid in terms of their ability to make rational decisions. So yes, maybe you understand that a teen can make some rational decisions, but you have a constant predisposition, because if they care, and indeed positive incentives you have to look out for them, you will treat them like a child, because that's how you see them. You're terrified of, for example, an unwanted pregnancy. But thirdly note that their model is only a part of the issue, right? Because it's great if you allow more things, like apparently allowing them to have sex, don't know how that's going to happen, but the issue is also the communication that we uniquely addressed that they didn't. Then they say the cause of rebellious behavior is unfairness compared to other teens. So in opposition, every teenager is prevented from drinking and partying. It results to issue. Firstly, let's first note that this contradicts Owens' own analysis in the first argument that due to psychological changes, teenagers naturally want to drink and stay out at night, i.e. it's not a result of relative behavior, but often inherent to teens. But secondly, we give you multiple reasons as to why Owens' claims in the first argument is more likely to be societal narratives. Movies that show teens partying and drinking still exist. But even if it wasn't true, the thing about teens on op is that they don't want to follow the orders of their parents because they feel like they aren't being respected and want independence. That is to say that you still want to do whatever your parents don't want to do. Standard negative psychology. Then they say parents can easily restrict rebellious behavior, so bad stuff doesn't happen. But look at their language here. They say parents are monitoring every action of their child, even locking them in their rooms, apparently, to actually enforce this. It's a gross violation of privacy, and we don't think it's ever OK. It destroys their relationship, if nothing else. But realistically, there are many ways in which a teen can obviously subvert your oversight as a parent, right? Like leaving the house through your secondary story window or going out with their friends after school and pretending like you have other classes. I speak from experience. This response is crucial.

But second question, who gets better outcomes for teens, particularly for the future? I'll take the point before that, though. If parents are inherently bad at holding rational conversations, as you say, how will they do so appropriately on your side of the house? It's about incentives, right? It's way harder to do so, and you don't have an incentive to do so on your side when you treat your teen largely as a kid, and you don't feel pressured to do so. On our side, they have some ability, and you have a much stronger incentive to do so, so you're going to go through the effort and try to learn how to do so. It's pretty obvious. Secondly, on the clash of who gets better outcomes, we said it was really important. It's about college student dysfunction. When you go, not only do you not know how to manage a basic budget, but you you in the first argument that teenagers feel that they aren't listened to or respected by their parents, so they will refuse to follow any guidance, but instead rebel"

I think that's a better way to teach. They say teens engage in recklessness, so this counterbalances it. But firstly, if it is true that teens are so naturally inclined during this period to go out at night and so vulnerable to peer pressure, as Owen spends a lot of time explaining, then teens aren't really going to be hindered because of curfews. Let's not pretend sneaking out and lying doesn't exist, right? Given that parents aren't spying on either side, they're going to end up doing dangerous things. In fact, things become more appealing when parents ban them. It sparks your curiosity. Their final argument is teens feel too burdened and sad because their parents tell them you're living paycheck to paycheck. I didn't say in my intro, if you're living paycheck to paycheck, this is abundantly obvious to a kid. First of all, this also knifes their characterization on how benevolent children parents are.

              "text": "Third and final argument then, on how we get better protection of teenagers. So why does Singapore's world decrease trust between parents and kids? Because we realize that teens on both sides, if they're reckless, would likely try to become sexually active or drinking when they're not allowed to, unless they propose locking them up for hours. Furthermore, parents are likely to be far more restrictive. This is when you're punished heavily for breaking rules. When parents scold you for talking back, it means that teenage, when teenagers make a mistake on upside, they're far more likely to be afraid of punishment. They will keep a secret from their parents because they don't want to face the repercussions. Why do we get increased trust on our side? Because children are more likely to talk to their parents about pressing issues or seek guidance from them. We already explained that teens have sex or drink regardless. But let's say that you experience a problem in the process. Maybe you start to worry that you're late on your period cycle. In ops world, you were terrified of getting your parents involved because they would kill you if they found out you had sex. In our world, when you know where your parents will treat you with more respect, you're more able to go to them to ask for pregnancy tests and get their emotional support. Because you know that even if you did make a mistake, your parents will to some degree understand. Understand that you have an autonomy about this and try to support you in a more rational adult manner. And then blanket condemning your actions because they think you're too childish to ever engage in these actions. Opposition fails to understand the key mechanism of communication and neglects to understand the key relationship between parents, not just in terms of what they allow, but indeed in terms of where the trust is, what you can talk to them about. Thanks, speaker, very much for this speech. Thank you confirm my panelists ready. Perfect, in which case I welcome the second speaker from side opposition to continue the debate.

First, on why the ZS side destroys the physical and psychological health of children. First, on the physical, we gave you structural reasons why children are uniquely reckless, none of which Richard has responded to. I want to be clear here why this is devastating for their case. Because this means that in the status quo, children are more likely to engage in reckless decisions. It means that on the ZS side of the house, they are more likely to go to a nightclub, for example, and risk being sexually assaulted, for example, and risk being sexually assaulted, for example, because they have just no protection of these things. Their only response to this is that, well, but if you are rebellious in nature, you just wouldn't follow your instructions anyway. We have three responses to this. First, because obviously, we think we can cancel out the pressure to go. The reason why in the status quo, there's a pressure to go to these clubs and to be rebellious is because other children are doing this as well. On our side of the house, if the dominant parenting method is to be more safe with your child, then we think that we cancels out this dominant influence. Secondly, we think that there's often pressure from young to listen to the instructions of the parents. The fact that from young, for example, you are given punishments and are told and given active disincentives to listen to your parents. The fact that they look up to them as an authority figure, for example. That is why it's structurally unlikely that they will just rebel against their parents. You don't prove the link here. But thirdly, even if you accept that they will try to rebel against their parents, we think you have the capacity to just prevent this as a parent. The only example of how they do this is to sneak out of the room. I guess the parent just locks the door of the room. Like, there are many restrictions that parents can just impose on these children. And we think that this is important because even if it means that parents, our children, don't always listen to their parents' instructions, we mitigate against the harms of the fact that they were going to go out drinking alone, for example. The fact that if you are a girl, when you go to an area that is less protected, for example, you're likely to be sexually assaulted. We at least prevent these worst concentrated harms on the outside of the house. Secondly, on psychological harms, because we gave you two reasons here. First, that often children already have additional burdens in their lives, like their school, for example, like their friends, and now they're just likely to impose more burdens on them when their parents tell their child that they're, for instance, they're thinking of divorcing their dad, for example. But secondly, because teenagers themselves require psychological support from their parents, and they actively deny this under their side of the house. Their only glib one-line response is that, well, but this is obvious to kids. This is not obvious to kids. For the vast majority of teenagers, the reason why it's not obvious is because parents on our world have an incentive to hide these things because they want to protect them as a child. On your side of the house, parents who, by their logic, treat them as an adult are therefore structurally more likely to tell this to their dad because it means that they are treating them as equals and as partners, for example. So that is why this harm is unique to their side of the house and it imposes immense psychological burdens on children. I want to do weighing here. Even if you accept that very highest case about how they improve the relationship of parents and child, I believe that it is more important. And here's a simple reason. Because a relationship can be fixed in the long term when the child matures and understands why their parents said something. What cannot be fixed in the long term is the trauma of, for instance, going out at night and not having your parents stop you from doing that and just happening to be sexually assaulted. What cannot be stopped, for example, is the fact that you go out drinking one night and you realize that you made terrible mistakes. This is something that is irreversible and we protect on the outside of the house. Second, relationships. I'm going to win on their metric here and demonstrate why they don't actually improve parental relationships. Here's where I want to be very clear. I want to examine the psychological reason behind a child's resentment which is the key mechanism of their case on relationships. Resentment does not exclusively arise from the specific parental action of not letting them dream. It stems from the fundamental human emotion that is particularly acute in children. This emotion of unfairness, that their life is not perfect and could be changed. This is the structural reason why everyone and every child, even adults, for example, always view the grass as greener on the other side. This is important because often, we contrast our current life experiences with other possible versions which could give us more utility as social creatures. Why is this analysis very important? Because in their will, teenagers will still feel resentful because they will still feel a sense of unfairness except that it's now directed to another parental action. The action of, for instance, not giving them sufficient pocket money, telling them that you should be more independent to earn your own money, would be directed towards having to bear the burden of the parent telling them what to do as an adult. So the point here is that because we always have discomfort in our lives and we always look to the other side, this issue of resentment and feeling unfair is a symmetric one that is not relevant. What is more important is that on our side of the house, we protect the fundamental human relationship of trust because reading that on our side of the house we get children to know that their parents truly love them. Before I move on I'll take that to you."

Finally, on my substantive. This substantive will further clash with our case on preparing for the future and show you why we do it better. Here's the reason why. First, because on their side of the house, their mechanism of telling their child what to do in the future as an adult is non-unique because we can also provide information on our side of the house and give you controlled experiences. For example, instead of letting you go out to drink alone, you can just go with your child to drink and therefore teach them what is the appropriate level of alcohol tolerance, for example, to be mindful of. So that's why we can get that on the outside of the house. But secondly, their comparative is one where they just are unlikely to even listen to the guidance of their parents. And the reason for this is because on their side of the house, structurally, they create a culture of independence where a parent's word is discounted. That means that on their side of the house, people aren't going to listen to their parents' tips of how to learn or how to save their money or how to drink alcohol properly, for example. But thirdly, why is our comparative better? Because on our side of the house, we can directly give you advice and enforce such advice. We think this is important for two reasons. First, because it's a culture of recognizing the parent's word and therefore you're more likely to buy into this. And secondly, even if you don't listen to your parent's word, you at least instill these habits on a subconscious level. So for example, when your parent tells you that you can only drink at home and every time you drink, you have to only drink this specific amount, for example. Or for example, when you give them money, you dictate as a parent what they should be spending money on and what they should be prioritizing. These are small mental habits and customs that develop over time where you have a parent that's actively enforcing it. Reading this is important because often when it comes to approaching adulthood, forming mental schema is incredibly important. And the only way we get that on the other side of the house is when we change this and when we enforce this through a subconscious level in the long term. So that's why even on their own metric of preparing for the future, at the end of the day, they have not responded to the most acute harms that they feel to children under their size. By the time they do their next week, it's probably going to be too late. For all these reasons, I've never been prouder to oppose. I thank the speaker very much for their speech. And if I can confirm that the panelists are ready. Perfect, in which case I welcome the third speaker from side proposition to conclude the substantive case after the problem. Can I check that my audio and video are fine?"

Parents are still parents in our world. They're not going to be heartless monsters who tell their children that they should bear every single burden in the world. We told you from first that parents have an inclination to be overbearing on their children for a couple of reasons, but this wasn't just a narrative norm. This was your biological instinct. This was the fact that these feelings are developed in the process of seeing your child grow up, regardless of the culture around you, because parents feel insanely attached to their children. You have a natural urge to protect them biologically. You can't bear seeing your child grow up when you remember them taking their first steps. You still want to coddle them and protect them from the dangers of the world. Intuitively, this is why parents have their heartbreak when they see their teenager leave for university. It's because they still see their teenager as their little child whom they raised and whom they fed. What this means is that for a family that is financially struggling, you probably don't throw every single debt bill pressure onto"

Additionally, on our side, you can still generally guide your teenager. Parents are not suddenly going to be neglectful, but they will interfere less. So if your child is underage drinking, obviously you're going to step in because that is illegal. You'll punish them because it's a clear violation. But if they are of age, it means you likely ask them to drink at home instead, and you probably ensure that they're not blackout drunk, monitoring their amounts, instead of bar them from doing so entirely or be extremely harsh about it.

Singapore claims that parents treat teens as teenagers and not children, so they will still teach children safe sex and assign chores anyway. If we're able to show you why parents and thinking their teens have this special status will likely impose more restrictions that worsen parent-child relationships, we win. Because O2 suddenly claims that the narrative they support is not one of protecting their children, and he tries to dodge the overprotective behavior of parents in the status quo. Let's be clear, treating your teenager as a minor means protecting them. But we gave you analysis. The parents have seen you since you were a child. It's hard for them to see you as an adult naturally, and they're very used to protecting you because that's what they have always done for the first 15 years of your life. This isn't about being the most overprotective. This is about a general characterization. But even if some teenagers are allowed to do that, the majority of them are not.

They say that you're more likely to follow advice for the future if you're used to following your parents' orders and that if you solely introduce your teen to alcohol, they're better prepared for the future. Note that this was actually our side. We're the ones that allow teens to try alcohol at home because you don't see your teen as a legal minor like the motion implies. More importantly, you can't really have advice for these topics if you're emphasizing that they are children or if you infantilize your teen, which is a more likely characterization.

              "text": "Firstly, then on family relationships, we told you that teenagers naturally yearn for freedom. In Singapore's world, when teenagers are constantly denied this because they're still seen as teenagers, this is when frustration begins to boil. When you see your parents as stripping away your golden teen years, the resentment often sours relationships for years down the line. Our comparative is that parents are more likely to talk and explain their beliefs to a teenager rather than patronize or scold them. It also means that teenagers are less likely to rebel. They're more likely to listen to their parents when their parents explain that they should not go to a party because the risk is too high. They gave us two responses. Their first response was that parents want a good relationship with their teenagers, so they communicate regardless. Firstly, parents have incentives, but they also have counter incentives. For the majority of parents, it is so much easier for them to tell their teenager to just listen to them because they're older, because they have the authority and they're able to tell their teen to stop talking back. But secondly, the perceptions of parents and children are different. The parent probably doesn't think what they're doing is a big deal, but it may be immensely impactful for the child. What this means is that a parent doesn't think too much about banning a teen from a party, but a teen remembers how much they were lucked out, how angry and frustrated they were when they were losing out on a teenage experience. Parents are used to not explaining themselves to you for the first 15 years of your life. This is just how they see things are. Their second push was that relationships only sound due to comparisons and unfairness, but none of this occurs under their side. The reason why, firstly, you want something isn't merely because your friend is loud to you, but you see glamorous parties in the media. Often teens feel more adventurous. They want to be the cool friend of the bunch. But secondly, even if parents tend to be strict, the media still portrays teenagers partying, even more so particularly because it's interesting when most teens have lived a life where you tended to be discouraged from going out very often. Drew's told you this, no response. Thirdly, given that opposition agrees teenagers naturally want to drink and have sex, all teenagers on opposition will be mad and frustrated at parents who lock them up. Therefore, at school or through text, teenagers will do something called complaining to one another. This is worse because teenagers often inflame anger in each other and make plans to sneak out collectively together. Fourthly, let's be clear. This debate isn't about mandating that all parents adopt either one model"

Some parents will still be overprotective on our side. Some parents will still prioritize autonomy on opposition. But it is an opposition's world where you get this jealousy. Because as long as you have one friend who is given autonomy, the children in opposition's world will be jealous, they will want to rebel, opposition's argument is one for our side. The way at the end of this clash is that family relationships are key, because when children hold grudges against their parents, it manifests in emotional baggage you carry on throughout your adulthood. By the way, relationships often can't just be fixed in the long term, when you still remember all the hatred you felt towards them, when fixing relationships takes a really long time and you have a lot of unhealed hurt and anger. Secondly, on the protection of teenagers. Before that, I'll take a POI. If parents are fundamentally treating their children as kids on both sides, then your advice and treating them like adults also wouldn't work. This cuts both ways. Therefore, we change the norm. We tell parents that when you love your child, you should protect that child. No, obviously, it's a counterbalancing force. Just because you care about a child doesn't mean you cannot change how you treat them. Secondly, then, on which side better protects teenagers? We told you that in Singapore's world, teenagers are"

Their response was that teenagers will be scarred by going out late at night. Let's repeat this one more time. Parents aren't the FBI. If you lock them in the room, teenagers can still sneak out the window because they want to go to a party, and Singapore agrees that they have this natural inclination. It's impossible for them to claim that they can prevent teenagers from doing these dangerous experiences. The difference then becomes are teens willing to tell their mom that their boyfriend seems to be abusive or that their period is too late? Are they willing to seek help? That's how we help them. But in their best case, teenagers on their side will do so the second they leave their parents' room when they go off to college, for instance, because they think that they have been forced to not do it for years and really want to do it. Maddie told you this is so much worse. We'd rather teenagers experience making mistakes in a safe environment where parents are close to protect them as the worst impact secure. The weighing of this is that it's really unrealistic that Singapore gets a world where no teen rebels. Instead, we protect those who do make mistakes. Lastly then, on which"

Their response was that teenagers tend to be rebellious. Often, it's not that teens want to pick fights for no reason, but when they feel restricted, when they believe their parents do not credit their opinions to the same extent they would credit independent adults, that is when that rebellion starts. This is when you believe your parents do not understand you and that you're more grown up. This is when you're more likely to rebel. Their second response here was that they take adult responsibilities they cannot handle, such as unwanted pregnancies and their burdens. If your family is poor, once again, that's very visible. But realistically, it may be beneficial to learn about that are worst case. When your parents explain to you the mistakes they made that led them to fall into debt, you can avoid that in the future. Regardless, you as a parent still want to avoid the worst harms. So it's not like you'll force these children to pay for their pregnancy bills. This was very extreme. At the end of the day, teenagers need to know how to navigate the world, what safe sex looks like.

But second, I pointed out in my second speaker why we do this better. His substantive explains why, structurally, teenagers are going to be very unlikely under the asset of the house to listen to parents' advice. Because there are many other factors that are significantly more overpowering. If, for example, your parent advised you on don't get too drunk, but you're now at the party where the lights are blaring and everyone else is drinking a lot, that is when you will face significant pressure to just disregard this advice and drink more. We flipped this when we said teenagers are more willing to listen to parents' advice and make less reckless decisions in the long term under our side of the house because what we can do is we can enforce specific habits that influences the way they act in the future. If from a young age, we tell you, don't drink so much, and we actually take you to a bar, for example, and we don't buy you that much alcohol, and we give you very little, and slowly we increase the amount and cap it off somewhere. This instills the habit and the mental schema of drinking less in you. So I want to point out, this means they have no response to our analysis for why their"

They concede in their world, in the most excessive instances, more teenagers might even end up getting sexually assaulted because they're drunk at a club. I want to point out the second response I have to this then. Parents have an ability to restrict teenagers from doing this under outside of the house. We give you a spectrum of tools to respond to their assertions. We pointed out in the more mild end, it can look like punishments, like taking away certain rights to disincentivise you from doing it. In more extreme cases, it can look like literal physical confinement. To see you can sneak out of your window, that's the only response you get in third. We'll lock the window, okay? So I think it's very strange for them to assert that. Why is this important? The way in here is simple. Even if there's more resentment under our side of the house, we are willing to trade that off because on our side, we at least don't let children act on their reckless impulses that have huge harms compared to their side of the house when they concede because they didn't respond to the two reasons we gave you, that children will do these more reckless things."

When he explained even if there's more resentment, that's okay because resentment can change in the long term as you grow older and you understand your parents' decisions. When you yourself become a parent and you understand why they did that specific thing. However, these harms that occur are often irreversible and cannot be changed. So even if you lose on resentment, we are happy to take that. Before I go further, I'll take the POI. Parents being protective is not a force that is overwhelming. It addresses the extremes, but there's still leeway. Do you believe parents can have the intent to protect their child, but believe there's a more effective method of doing so by giving them more autonomy? So functionally, what you are saying is this. You are saying, you know, we're going to stop your child from getting completely blackout drunk. If you let the child go to the party and you tell your child, you can come back very late, you know, we're not going to rigorously enforce this. You can come back when you can. Maybe in principle, you advise them not to get blackout drunk, but unless you are physically there at the party or you don't let them go to the party, there's no way you can stop them from getting blackout drunk and all the horrible consequences we told you would happen. So I think that POI just loses you the debate. Second, I want to flip resentment. Before I go any further, note that third proposition did not respond to what my second speaker explained, but why resentment was symmetrical. He gave you analysis for why, on their side of the house, children will find many things to be resentful with parents about as well. He explains to you, for example, children will ask, why are you making me work instead of giving me more pocket money directly? Why are you making me sacrifice my summer vacation doing this instead? I wish you would love me more. So he points out,"

So this means you cannot buy any of their benefits or resentment because it hurts their side as well. So the last thing I'm going to do then is move on to my second contention of the emotional trauma of teenagers. And again, I want to point out here, they had no direct response to our argument about how this is intensely traumatizing for many teenagers. We told you when a parent teaches you, treats you like an adult, it doesn't just mean nice things. It doesn't just mean letting you go out and come back whenever you want. It doesn't just mean letting you have complete free use of the car. Often, what it means is them having sobering conversations with you. Often, it means them telling you maybe your father and I are going to end up getting a divorce. Often, it ends up exposing these ugly details. Again, the only response we get is parents are inherently overprotective. I'm going to give you one more response that eliminates this response in the case of this clash. As my second speaker tells you, the only reason parents are inherently overprotective is because they think being overprotective is the best way to show their love. The difference is that this changes on their side of the house because the narrative of what it means to be a loving parent is not to be overprotective. In their world, being a loving parent means treating your child more like an adult. It means giving them more independence. At the point where the narrative of what it means to love a child changes so drastically on their side of the house, that is why parents are structurally likely in their world to expose more of these details. That's why parents are structurally likely to offload more of their emotional burdens to children. Even if they want to talk about poor children. Do you know what is even worse for a poor child? When you tell the poor child and you make him live with anxiety that your father has $100,000 in debt. Even in our counterfactual, if you vaguely know that you are poor, we think often giving them these specific details and putting this pressure on them is psychologically crushing. We think being a teenager in their world is testament to just destroying your mental health"

We had no response to any of this argumentation about how this is just terrible for teenagers and emotionally traumatizing. It is too late in prompt reply. Last, on teaching important things to children. And they really wanted to make this about teaching children about how to spend their money. And I want to note that they completely dropped this by third proposition because they realized that this wasn't really an impact they could win on either because of how we flipped it in second speaker. We pointed out it's far more likely that your children actually internalize the important things you tell them when you force them to act a specific way, when you force them to act a specific way and they build habits and build mental schema that they carry on forever. So we think children are far more likely to manage their money better in our side of the house when we force them, for example, to save their money more and we say every week you must save X amount of your money. So what have I demonstrated at the end of this speech? First, their only harm is about rebelliousness. And the only way to impact that is children will do very bad things anyway. What I've done is explained why first, we stopped those bad things from happening. So even if children are rebellious in nature, we have the ability to constrict them. Secondly, they have considered that in their counterfactual, children do very reckless things. So the way off is clear. Even if in our world, there's more resentment, which I've already explained cuts both ways, the difference that on our side, we temper the most reckless instincts of children and we stop them from doing the worst things. Additionally, all our harms of worst emotional trauma stack on top of this to win us the round. For these reasons, I'm very proud to stand with the opposition. Thank you."

Is it even powerful enough to overcome the instinctive, inherent tendencies of parenthood? They say, ultimately, it was unclear how this mechanism worked. We were clear down the bench.

What is left in their case is just at least children won't have sex and get drunk, and mom won't tell their kid about having a bad marriage with dad. Quick clarification before my clashes, because Singapore keeps trying to strawman us. In the status quo, parents are naturally predisposed towards the opposition model, not because of societal narratives, but because biologically you see your teen as a child that you raised. It was ridiculous to claim that because societal narratives change, parents will not refrain from protecting your child because this is not how you should express love. We prefer our model, which is a counterbalance to this natural incentive. A parent being overprotective doesn't mean that they never change. Parents in our world is when you are more likely to try and listen to your teen's opinions, when you let them date and drink, but on neither side will you do nothing to discourage criminal acts like doing cocaine. It's not a contradiction, it's nuance. Learn the difference, Singapore.

You can't punish a teen who isn't caught. So the incentives that Singapore talks about are the same on both sides. You still have peer pressure. You are jealous of the one teen who has freedom. This predisposition to reckless behavior is symmetric because you always compare yourself to the one kid that doesn't absolutely protect their parents. On either side, teens are going to drink and have sex. Singapore can't assert a locked door and punishments are sufficient, unless they're going full-scale FBI and locking kids into their rooms in an authoritarian way. Chloe gave you three key maps that broke the deadlock further. Firstly, the teens are more likely to be open to their parents' opinions and advice if they believe they're respected.

This is the way to permanently ruin parent-child relationships. Note the importance. For the next 50 years, children rely on parents throughout their adult life. Singapore deprives children of this because you've ruined the most critical relationship. Their response is that kids only want to be reckless because their friends are reckless. If they change everyone's parenting, problem solved. Note that this nice three minutes of O1 talking about the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which by the way, is indeed unsubstantiated psychology. Either you are reckless because your brain chemistry or because of peer pressure. They can't have it both ways. More importantly, note how this is still a norm. As long as there are some parents who aren't super overprotective, then you're also going to compare yourself to those kids and want to do more. Then they say, if parents don't have an ability to clearly explain their reasoning on either side, then it's symmetric. But obviously parents have a base ability and can learn more. And difference is incentive. If you don't feel that your teens can engage in dialogue with you, then you won't bother. More importantly, I told you about the prioritization. You don't risk a dialogue because you want to ensure that they don't go out on all costs. Both sides aren't perfect, but effort is the difference on our side and meaningful connection. Their final claim is that you feel resentful when your parents give you more responsibilities. When a parent explains that they will let you hang out with your friends, as long as you do chores or to spend money, you have to make it. That seems reasonable to any individual, even a teen, because resentment is occurring when you feel unheard when you don't feel like your parents are willing to engage in a dialogue with you in every single metric on improving relationships with children indeed on bettering their actions and preparing them for the future opposition is the side that refuses to have parents indeed having any role in their children's lives present or future i thank the speaker for this speech and future."
