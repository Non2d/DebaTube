This looks like psychiatric evaluation simulations that put applicants in non-convicts and distress situations. Training on de-escalation procedures, which we already have in place and mentioned, have increased in the aftermath of BLM. Basic background checks that see if an ex-gang member, for instance, is still in contact with their gang and their agency. Notably, a lot of this already exists for non-convicts so we are supporting a continuation of data second when individuals are new to the job and this also applies to non-convicts too they're likely going to be put in low risk and low tier jobs such as community outreach divisions or being a patrol or regular beat cop until they get promoted b cops are also often paired with senior officers for instance so in our world there's already effectively a probationary period that screens for things like bad behavior violent violent tendencies, and various reactions. Thirdly and finally, in terms of the people who are likely to apply, we think it will and largely be lower level criminals who engaged in crimes of accusation and nonviolent crime, largely because A, statistically, this is the vast majority of crime. But second of all, if you were locked up for decades by the state because you engaged in violent crime it's probably the case that you hate the police you hate the government and you don't want to join"

This is a perpetual punishment that stays well beyond when a sentence ends. On a more nuanced level, however, we think that this is an excessive punishment that is disproportional. It's not just the case that these people have already paid for their sins. It's also the case that the vast majority of people engage in non-violent crime that isn't that egregious, as petty as breaking a car window or drug dealing, for instance, especially in the United States, or crimes of acquisition and subsistence, which constitutes already over half of crimes in most countries. Moreover, however, under the principle, it is often people of color in their world that are disproportionately punished, who are more likely going to be locked up, who are more likely going to be served a guilty verdict, who are more likely going to be carded and overplaced on their set of house. So at the conclusion of this principle, this is a fundamentally unfair punishment. A four-year sentence should end after four years. It does not in the world of opposition. Second of all, it disproportionately affects low-level criminals, people of color, in which this policy is a massive overblown and it's not proportional to what exactly these people did and the crimes that these people committed.

It's a well-paid job where you get insurance and social benefits and healthcare on the side for your children. It provides security for ex-cons who are often overblown by things like crime and jail. It gives them meaning and purpose since they feel like they're actually contributing to society instead of staying in jail. This is especially important in the context where criminals are often blacklisted from other jobs because of their ex-con status in the world of opposition. So rather than re-offending or joining previous crime communities and circles and gangs out of no alternatives, this job brings people a paycheck and stability for the most vulnerable groups of minorities in the world. Before I go on, I'll take a pee. Would you allow sex offenders who have served their sentences to become teachers? No. Let's talk about reforming the force."

              "text": "A central issue with the police in the status quo is that there's a large empathetic gap between the average beat cop and the average convict. The police force is comprised of a body of people who never need to be in circumstances where they have to resort to crime. These are often financially stable white individuals or people of the ruling class who cannot empathize with a black teen in Chicago living in economic destitution. These are individuals who have stable families, stable financial circumstances, who don't have to engage with the other side. This empathetic and democratic gap maps onto other issues as well. When the average beat cop patrolling your community in the world of opposition knows about the lived circumstances of poverty and violence, they attribute bad behavior and violence to the person and not to the circumstance. This leads to a greater likelihood of that cop being violent. This individual and that white cop on their side of the house doesn't attribute bad behavior to the circumstance. They just believe that the individual, that Black teen, is bad in and of itself. In a high crime community where curfew is 10 p.m., a cop who has worked only one shift a day for their entire life because they have financial stability does not understand why a Black man is coming home an hour after curfew late after the third and final shift. when the average union or board member on their side of the house is a 55 year old white man policies do not reflect circumstances on the ground when your patrol partner brutally beats a hispanic teen because they believe they are a drug dealer you don't file a report since you have more empathy for your partner that you've worked with for 11 years rather than the hispanic team because you're a white man we fix this issue in two key ways. The first thing to know is that people who join the force on our side of the house are likely going to have desires to reform the system. These are individuals who have been wronged by the police in the past. But second of all, there are plenty of ex-cons on our side of the house who are likely to join who are going to be people of color. This is true for two reasons. First, in high crime communities, people of color are often arrested the most to a disproportionate rate. Look at the United States, for instance, where in a number of inner police because they know a family member who has been arrested, for instance, where they know that the police has historically been bad for their individual group. What does this mean, then? It means that, number one, empathetic ex-cons and people of color hold positions of power on our side of the house. These are individuals who can climb the forced ladder, who can become regional union officials, who can become precinct captains, and can make policy reforms such as more stringent accountability measures for police that go out of line, which charges abusive officers, and measures that enforce the wearing of body cams and more de-escalation training. Second of all, however, even if they don't get into positions of power, having a presence in and of itself means that you can check what other people say and feel. If you're in a room with another Black man, for instance, who is a cop, you're less likely to do things like policy reforms that are racist, and you're less likely to do things like think before you speak. Moreover, it is just statistically better that we have more beat cops and patrols who relate to people on the ground. The weighing of this argument is simple. The background checks on our side of the house are likely going to be a fair approximation of who is allowed to get into our policy. It is unlikely that the most violent and the most psychiatrically mentally ill person is going to get through our policy and going to be screened by. But what is likely in our side of the house is that we have hundreds, maybe dozens in certain precincts of individuals who are actually empathetic to that person on the ground who's able to relate to the black teenager in Chicago in inner suburbs of the United States because they've been in that circumstance and they know the realities of circumstances of crime and being extremely poor and living in economic destitution this policy therefore dramatically reduces the likelihood of police forces abusing their power and we allow for individuals to be held accountable if it's a case that they abuse"

It's unclear why stability and structure are exclusive to their side. This makes no sense. Fourth, on improving the system. We think that individuals who are empathetic to criminals, or those who want to structurally reform the police, are not going to be selected to join the force. We'll clash with this later, but note that this analysis is devastating to their case, because they rest their entire case on this idea that the people who are going to be selected are going to be those who are very empathetic and are likely to make good changes, but don't think this is true first of all we think it's unlikely that we're going to get lots of people of color for example applying to join the police if you saw your brother or father go to prison while the white man from the right side of town got off spot three i think frankly you'll likely just want to avoid the police in the future otherwise i don't think the earth would have a peaceful dominated almost entirely by white men but no more will be expanding on later in our case, and this is crucial. The police are clear incentives to discriminate. First, Crop says they'll have more people of colour, but they're likely to be discriminated against in the hiring process for the reasons Proposition already gives. But crucially, the police force are only likely to want those who are never going to be perceived as softer on crime, those who are going to be the most zealous, those who are going to insist that other convicts pay for their sins so that they can avoid the kinds of reputational harms that people think are damaging. This ultimately leads to more brutality under their side. Our first argument then on why a significant number of ex-convicts are likely to make bad police officers. First question, it was what is special about police officers? Why do we want to limit entrants to this job specifically? we think police officers uniquely hold an immense amount of power they can detain and arrest individuals they hold a great deal of legitimacy no individual should hold that unless we are certain that they are able to exercise that responsibly if they make a mistake justice isn't done so what are the different groups of criminals who might apply and be selected note that this clash is with the incredibly simplistic stuff we get out of cyber opposition, which is these are nice people who are going to be sympathetic and now want to enforce the law. Let's engage with their best case. We think the ex-convicts who are most likely to sign up and want to reform and enforce the law are going to be those who are most likely to be overzealous and ruthless. The reason is that these people have been through the system themselves. This means that they have seen firsthand the terrible things that criminals do every day in prisons they might be first-hand victims of crime themselves inside prison and note that even if a wider right in ex-convicts applied to these positions even if the group's proposition talks about applied to these positions the individuals most likely to be selected by the police are going to be the most zealous and violent and tough on crime because the police force is going to be incredibly afraid of selecting ex-convicts who appear to be simply court criminals in case they end up being soft on crime and damaging the effectiveness or perception of the police force they will not select the african-american man who tells them they need structural reform and to lose funding so they can give that to social workers they're going to hire the white guy who was caught in a drug deal and is now out for revenge on the gangs he believes want him. But the second group is criminals who seem to have performed but actually haven't. Because aside from the side proposition of assertion, we think it's actually very difficult to tell whether a criminal has truly become a better person. We think all of these individuals and the matter of their incentives have been proven to have criminal tendency. In the past, they've decided to put their own interests in front of the law and morality and they are therefore uniquely likely to do so again we agree that the rehabilitation is currently extremely flawed but note that this analysis itself come back to bite side proposition because it means these ex-convicts are highly likely not to be reformed and therefore to do bad things or exercise poor judgment when they're in these positions but even if these people only committed crimes of acquisition or desperation note that our analysis still stands they're clearly willing to put their own priorities above respecting the law a lot of people are in bad circumstances but we don't think that means that everyone necessarily resorts to crime we think these are individuals who have shown that if they are put under pressures they will likely be in situations where they're working in the police office, they're willing to make this particular decision. Note the nuance here in our argument. We aren't saying that these are going to be people who are necessarily inherently bad or make bad decisions in every aspect of their lives. It is far more nuanced than that. We are simply saying that given all the framing we gave you at the start of this speech about how police officers are in a unique position of power. Their ability to do harm in these situations massively outweighs any marginal benefits side proposition might want to bring you from a couple of criminals being able to find jobs as police officers. We think the impact of this is that you either get massive brutality because police force are only hiring people who are going to be overzealous and who are very afraid of being perceived as software. Or you get people who are likely to have links to crime themselves, who are going to be overzealous and who are very afraid of being perceived as software online or you get people who are likely to have links to crime themselves who are likely to make bad decisions or are likely to abuse that power before i want to talk about public content in the piece sure you say that experience with crime makes you more overzealous but if your experience with crime is being a criminal wouldn't it make you more sympathetic to being in your engine i think you've misunderstood our analysis here Our explanation is that when you go into prison, you are very likely to become a part of a gang. You are likely to be a victim of a gang. You are likely to be a victim of further crime. You are likely to see the very worst things that criminals do to each other. This is going to be incredibly damaging because you perceive yourself as one of the good ones, one who has done their time and paid for their sins, but everyone else you perceive as bad because you've seen the worst of what criminals can do while you're inside prison. Second, on public confidence in the police we think many people are just genuinely afraid of convicts because they have bad experiences and if you know one conviction done something where you've read a media story you can get all like that you view them as one for multiple negative group this massively harms us if you implement this policy i know this isn't contingent on the first point the perception that convicts are untrustworthy exists regardless of how good they actually are. We think in addition, the media is likely to make this perception entirely worse. This is likely to be a point of actual policy, so its implementation will be advertised and prominent in public discussion, and the media will sensationalise these stories and make it dramatic. But note that this damage has a particular impact on vulnerable groups like women. Now, when you're walking home alone on a dark street and you think someone might be following you, you are less likely to trust a police officer across the road because they could be a sex offender. Or if you're a member of an ethnic minority you know that white supremacist ideology is uniquely powerful among white convicts because ganders are organised in prisons along racial lines, you're far more likely to fear the police, you're far less likely to report a hate crime. For all these reasons, I'm so proud to oppose."

They think a person convicted at the age of 19 for smoking marijuana or something trivial like that is somehow morally equivalent to a pedophile, according to their POI. Canada's characterization of ex-convicts by comparison was more realistic and more hopeful. That many of these ex-convicts were people who made unfortunate mistakes, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, in the wrong color of skin, and that many of these people wanted to make the world better, or at the very least themselves a better shot a shot at a better life Canada thought this was the least they would deserve that is why we are proud to propose I'm going to talk about"

              "text": "of who these convicts are, I think much of England's case relies on a mechanism about the hiring process for some reason selecting for bad hard on crime people which is like fairly unsubstantiated. I'm actually unsure why it is that police units for some reason want to hire more violent people. We think it is far more likely that police units want to improve their legitimacy through hiring people who do not crack down or commit brutality. This is actively bad press. In the wake of George Floyd, many police units had funding rescinded across the Western world for committing acts of brutality. And this is an active reason as to why you would prefer people who are softer on crime. Also, because even to the extent that people within the police force might be somewhat, you know, have violent tendencies in the status quo for reasons they still don't explain. There are also other actors that have effects over the hiring process. So municipal governments, for instance, that participate in hiring processes of police officers, people who are police commissioners are at the top of the meat targets for reducing brutality in much of the world. So these are all reasons as to why you are unlikely to pick the most deranged versions of the comics. And even to the extent that you do, presumably you could have just found violent people who happen to not be convicts as well. And I'm actually unsure what the margin is here. And then they say prisons are really bad. And there are things like gangs, which convert you into becoming more violent. I think our stance largely dealt with this in the sense that we said the worst people are likely to be filtered out for things like psychiatric evaluations, through simulations. And even to the extent that they ended up in the police, we talked to you about how in the introductory stages of being a police officer, it is unlikely they are put on incredibly high risk tasks, such as facing an armed robbery. And it's more likely that at the beginning of your career, they're put in pairs with other police officers. They're forced to observe so that they can see how you react to different situations. And so the worst apples are likely to be filtered out in our side. I don't think they sufficiently respond to that. We also just give you a number of other reasons, which I don't think get response as to why the majority of people who are ex-convicts are nonviolent criminals to begin with, how many of them are from racialized groups, how they're unjustly convicted. And I think second opposition speaker probably needs to deal with that secondly then talking about the principled crash our claim from first was this unjustly excludes ex-convicts who had already been punished i think they respond with examples and not analysis they say we already hold criminal records therefore this means that we prioritize the safety of innocent people over people for our conflicts the first thing is that obviously like i think we broadly oppose job discrimination against people with criminal records and And secondly, they have this like"

The first difference between these cases is on the likelihood of harm. There's some possibility in any case of employment that an ex-convict is going to cause some degree of harm. So they say they would make the ex-convicts drive buses instead. There's probably some possibility that an ex-convict harasses someone on a bus, for instance, or crashes a car. So thus, the question in this round is how likely you are in different situations to be relatively more violent. And I think in order for this to be analogous in any way to pedophile, I think to prove an incredibly high threshold of increased violence,"

We talked to you about racialization of crime, we got very little response. So that is why it's different from pedophiles. And notice the intuition behind this claim as well, that we should never deprive someone of opportunity for the significant just cause. It is true across most societies, for instance, that racial minorities are more likely to commit violent crime due to structural economic reasons and racial oppression but it would be absurd to suggest as a result we should bar black people in the us from the police force or indigenous people in australians from in australia from the police force regardless of whether doing so would have marginal instrumental benefits because to bar someone from employment on an arbitrary basis distorts their dignity and entitlement to fair treatment in an unacceptable way.

And I'm not spending a lot of time here, because I don't really respond to a lot of the arguments we give you from first. In terms of why this alters police culture, on why the violent police culture festers due to the absence of the oppressed people in the room. The cops can make jokes about the criminals they've locked up. They can get away with harassment in interrogation rooms. In the police car, they can make racial assumptions and get away with it because you have no people who are from the relevant community who are represented in that situation. Secondly, we talked to you about racial composition, the fact that people from oppressed communities tend to have less internalized biases and tend to be more understanding towards those who are racial groups, and that in communities where the proportion that people from oppressed communities tend to have less internalized biases and tend to be more understanding towards those who are racial groups and that in communities where the proportion of people who have were ex-convicts within a specific racial group is high talking about a quarter of people in some black communities in the us it is likely to significantly alter the racial composition of peace in a way which negatively affects their ability to execute justice fairly before i talk about my constructive argument i'm happy to take a point about this one who is a police officer who's been shot up by criminals more likely to employ? A black man who earnestly says there are structural problems with the police, or a man who says he hates all criminals and won't hesitate to pull the trigger? So I don't think there is a binary between those two. We think there are like, A, I think I already responded to this when I talked to you for the incentives to reduce things like brutality, and there are probably people in between, or just generally dislike the effects that crime has on the community because they've been through that community, and yet think that there is an ability of people in high crime communities to do good."

So when you think of the police, now you think of your neighbor, George, who's from the same high crime area as you, rather than like Derek Chauvin. This means that people are exposed to a new version and conception of the police. They are conscious that these are people who have walked through the same streets, people have made the same mistakes, and people have lived in the same cramped cells and prison hallways. On a macroscopic level, it means that the police are more racially similar to high crime communities that they police as we point out earlier and first that keeping these people out of out of the police meaningfully tilts the racial composition of the peace towards white privileged people who have very little in common and very little personal connection for the communities they please and the important implication is that trust receives full engagement with law enforcement. It is scary for a woman of color experiencing domestic violence or a Black kid in the U.S. who is mugged on the street to speak to a force that they see as oppressive towards their community and as inadequate. A sense of personal connection bridges this gap, and because it means that you have the belief that the officer will not be judgmental towards you, you have some common ground upon which you can connect. This means that more victims of crime receive justice and hope in our world, and even on their metric of saving innocent people, we are far more likely to have people have justice delivered towards them after the fact. In opposition, these people are less fearful and silent to speak out. We think that is far worse. When punishment is levied outside the courtroom, every convict serves a lifetime sentence.

On our side of the house, you might hire police officers who are somewhat privileged and who vaguely dislike crime.

So therefore, in the best case scenario, individuals who are likely to genuinely reformed are likely to be significantly more abusive than ordinary police officers. But let's talk about the second group, which wasn't engaged with. We think ultimately the rest of convicts, convicts that they hire, you open their wrists to other forms of abuse. That is to say, it's incredibly difficult to screen individuals. And we think that people may not be fully trustworthy, even if they've proven to have some kind of criminal faculties, i.e. they put the law before themselves. These are two unique groups of people, both of them are worse than ordinary police officers. The second clash is on the idea of the perception of the police and criminals. Their argument is that it's good to have relatively accessible people who you can engage with. Two responses. A. As Maya explains to you, the dominant prevailing narrative is that convicts are stigmatized broadly in the status quo because they're viewed as a threat to the fabric of society. The second thing is even in these minority areas, if there are incentives for the police to appear legitimate, then they can hire certain minority policemen on our side of the house. The difference is whether you hire minority individuals who have hurt that community by engaging in crime. Thus, we think that because you as a potential member of the public cannot tell which people were convicts and which policemen were not convicts, you're likely to distrust convicts as a whole, given the extent to which crime hurts these people on a daily basis.

I'll take a P.O.I. So I think you basically engage exclusively with cases of violent crime. Why should a person who commits like a drug crime when they're pretty young serves a few months and doesn't. No, I gave you this example, right? If you did a drug crime, that means you were a victim of drug dealing, which means you are likely to despise drug dealers and the effects they had in your community which means you're going to be incredibly harsh on drug crime okay i gave you that example so why does this hurt cohesion within the police force we think cohesion is incredibly crucial in the police the police need to be able to work together to enforce the law because it's an intense job where trust is crucial during an investigation when you're in a high pressure situation your life will depend upon your co-workers, given that you need to be making very quick decisions. Why is there likely going to be mistrust here? We think the police are likely going to have a general hatred towards and prejudice towards convicts. We think the police are likely going to be individual to hold a relatively high principled view of the law, and are likely to dislike those who break it. But also, we think that police are likely to associate ex-convicts with the people who put their lives in danger every single day. The final reason why these people are likely to be mistrusted within the police force is that they have proven poor judgment and that therefore are likely to be perceived to have associations with crime. The point here is that this takes out a lot of the proposition case because a lot of the proposition case, because a lot of the proposition case suggests that these convicts might get promoted. They might do well in the system. You'll be able to convince other police officers to do well, but that's not going to happen at the point in which they're likely to be mistrusted. They're likely to be ostracized. In fact, that's the reason why these convicts are likely to be even more overzealous, because they need to do an overly aggressive job in order to gain the trust of their other police co-workers in order to be perceived as someone who is not a criminal and therefore wants to be someone who is harsher on client at the end of the day black lives matter is not a mainstream movement the most powerful people in communities have incentives to push the police to be harsh on client which means the police are likely to hire individuals who are going to be harsher than ordinary police officers that's our margin we're proud to oppose"

              "text": "And I want to talk about our principal first year, because it receives very, very poor engagement. The first thing they say in their second speech is that you can hire criminals to other jobs. So clearly, they don't have fiat to do this. So they have to convince you and give you some likelihood analysis as to why convicts are likely to access these jobs. They give you no such analysis, so you shouldn't count this point anyway. But let me give you some reasons why it's unlikely they hire for other jobs. The first thing to note is that police is a uniquely undesirable job, right? It's hard. You're walking the beat. You're risking your life. You're putting a lot on the line when you're a police officer. That's not true of firefighters, and it's not true of public transport drivers, which are the examples they give. And that means that convicts have a unique advantage when applying to police jobs, because they don't have to compete with average people who also want jobs. So we think it's unlikely that people are able to get jobs with the state. We think convicts are unlikely to get jobs with businesses, because it just looks really, really bad for those businesses. The second thing to note about these jobs, as Anushka points out, and they never deal with, is why it's better to have a convict a like public transport driver who's alone with a woman on a bus at night why that same distrust and that same potential for abuse doesn't exist on their side so this response doesn't make any sense the second thing they say is this is hinged on practical risk and then they kind of give a third response which says you should specifically improve the unfairness of the system and these are linked together because essentially what they're saying here is whichever side proves a more apt solution to unfairness in the system as opposed to genuine guilt is the side that wins this debate and i just want to note here that on opposition it is their solution that is general because if you look at the motion they're disallowing all convicts not just murderers not just rapists not just people who did assault all convicts from working in the police force but it is obvious in this round that not every convict shares a same level of responsibility, and some convicts obviously have no responsibility for their crimes at all, given that some innocent people are convicted. And so if you recognize that fact, you just have to consider if we would do what they are proposing to do in any other situation in life. Would we prohibit every single African American from"

What's the comparative? Well, these people are already criminals. They're violent criminals, as characterized by opposition. And it seems pretty intuitive that maybe they just keep doing crime. I mean, they don't have access to good jobs, as I framed. They don't have access to prestige. They don't really have a way to make a better life. Nobody's trained them out of their anger issues. Maybe they just do crimes. Why is it better that these people are on the force, even if our worst case? Firstly, because they access a steady income. Secondly, because we give them a sense of purpose at the point at which we give them a steady job. Thirdly, because there's a degree of accountability and monitoring that comes with being a cop. You have a partner, you have supervisors watching over you. And fourthly, because we give you psychiatric and de-escalation training that can help manage anger issues that often plague violent criminals. And so we think on our side of the house, even in their very best case, where they do get these violent offenders on the force and they aren't screened out, we prove a better comparative because we'd rather these people be under watch than be out on the street. I'll take a PY before I move on. Given this is a policy motion, we can have the FIAT introduce an alternative and hire these people in other public services, utilities, etc. Yeah, we can have FIAT if we say it in first, not in third op.

              "text": "Second theme then on policing. Firstly, on policing reform. We give you a lot of structural mechanisms that are pretty poorly engaged with on their side. They essentially give you a bunch of psychological counter-assertions. So the first and key mechanism in their case is that people who are criminals are overzealous against other criminals because they go to prison and they get hurt. So the first thing we note down bench is this applies in a select number of circumstances, namely when A, these people have actually been victimized by other criminals, which is by no means the case in every situation. Secondly, when they value that victimization more highly than their victimization by the state that imprisoned them. And thirdly, when the specific way that victimization plays out in the real world is like this weird act of taking revenge on other criminals in some sort of punisher fantasy. We think this is incredibly unlikely to affect the majority of cases, and the analysis we give you is much structurally more reasonable. What is our analysis? Very simple. If you are a criminal, you understand what drives people to crime. If you understand what drives people to crime, you naturally understand other criminals. And when you have understanding for someone, you're more sympathetic towards them inherently. This is a simple mechanism that applies in all cases in the majority of crimes of acquisition of non-aligned offenders, of drug offenders, of innocent people. Most people who commit crimes, this logic applies to. We think we outweigh them on that point. And we think we do access our benefits of better policing here right we say these people have more empathy for other criminals they encounter on the street it's harder for an us versus them mentality to form when you have somebody who has been on both sides of the aisle in the convict world and the police world a lot of bad police encounters in fact the worst police encounters where things escalate are caused by this us versus them mentality that's not something they ever sufficiently respond to on their side. Now, they do say that for some reason, no POC or empathetic people will ever be hired by the police force. And I just think this is ridiculous. The first thing to note is they make this assumption throughout their case that like you come to a job interview and you're like, I want to structurally reform the police force. I don't think that's an interview question that's ever asked. I think it's probably you hire people generally based on skills and maybe some reformers get on the police force and that's fine the second thing they say is that in the cases where criminals did crimes they're just always likely to be worse police officers than the status quo we think that's just untrue right even though they say they try to frame that like small offenders still committed crimes that I think they're above the law we think there are a lot of other compelling reasons to make crimes. You're economically desperate. You made a mistake. Maybe you legitimately changed as a person. All of these things structurally factor in why they're not likely to be worse than the average person responding to situations. And then we give you additional characterization on why they understand criminals better and perception improves. And let's talk about perception briefly then. Well, what do we say in our perception argument? It's specific and clear. The community that you are a part of, the high crime community, sees you as a police officer rather than Derek Chauvin. You are more representative and you have personal contact and relationships with criminals rather than being this sort of outside force that's imposed on a community. And so we think the actual community you are policing is more likely to trust you. So even if they prove some of their perception stuff, which is kind of silly, they don't prove a tipping point because cops only operate in the community that they're actually in. So only trust of the cops within a community matters. Arguments specific, theirs is very general. Why does their perception argument not stand though? I don't think it's a tipping point for most people for calling the cops. If you think the cops have like some criminals, you're probably more scared of the crime. The difference on our side is years and years of police abuse which needs to be overcome not this new policy that just came out yesterday we think finally i've been engaging with their best case throughout the whole speech we give you very convincing reasons and stance why bad people can't join the force to begin with you have to take psyche vows you have to do live fire training that tests your reaction and your discrimination you have to have background checks you have a probationary period. You have a partner. You take low risk jobs initially. There's checks at every single step of the way to prevent bad people from accessing these systems. And so we think even though we win on the best characterization and the best case that op gives us something they never do the charity of engaging with on their side, we actually prove a big likelihood why these criminals never joined the force to begin with. And in that situation, we clearly win this round. So for those reasons, please, please vote prop."

First of all, on the rehabilitation of conflicts. And I'm starting with this because I think it is the least important clash in this debate, and it's very quick to resolve through our side. The main problem with Canada's analysis here is that we are never given a reason why the only way we can rehabilitate these people is by letting them join the police. The first thing they say is that this is a solid economic opportunity for people who are low-level criminals or people of colour, and we'd rather them have this job than re-affect. I'm not sure why this is the only job that they are able to do, which gives them money in order to improve their life. What's their response to this claim? Because we raised it earlier. They say, well, you can't get any other jobs because everyone hates convicts, everyone's scared of them and they're untrusted. Hang on, panel, I want to point out here this contradicts with their later analysis when they say that they're going to massively improve trust in police because somehow everyone loves convicts and feels safe when they're patrolling the streets. But secondly, we think in the same way that prop has to be up to allow these people to apply for police jobs, we can let them apply for other public service jobs. We pointed this out at the beginning of Maya's speech as the first point in our stance, and we pointed out again in APOI, at which point they concede that this does indeed take out their analysis here. And all they can say is that we didn't mention this in first, so we can't be at it in third. Now, either Canada were not listening to Maya's speech panel, or they are trying to mislead you. Either of those is not enough to win them this debate."

They say that they've served their sentence and they've paid for their sins, and therefore we can't continue to restrict them. We just don't think this is empirically true. We think we regularly convict, we continue to have restrictions on convicts throughout their lives. This is why we have criminal records. This is why we don't let sex offenders work in schools. And they accept that obviously we should restrict some convicts to some extent. They just say we need to prove a high amount of harm in order to restrict them. Recognised that in saying that they can see that this principle is entirely practically contingent so I'm not sure why then in the next sentence they say that they're able to win independently on it. But we think that this does have a massive amount of practical harm. We think giving them a gun, letting them represent the government, putting them in a position where there is massive trust placed in them is obviously a massive risk which we are not willing to take. And we don't think it matters if they were forced into this crime out of necessity, because many people are in poverty and they do not turn to crime. And no, panel, that their final genuinely quite insulting response to this is to say that this is morally equivalent to banning Black people from the police force. We don't ban black people from the police force because that is racism. We ban convicts because they present more risks to the force, which is obviously not morally equivalent. We can then we clearly take out their principle and show where their analysis doesn't stand, but let's talk about"

              "text": "who gets better for policing because this is the most substantial clash of the debate. Firstly, they talk about reforming the force. They say that these people understand the reality of life and they're going to be sympathetic. They're going to be less harsh. And this leads to structural reform in the police. Their first response is that we told you that instead, the people who are likely to get these jobs are going to be the ones who are overzealous, who appear tough on crime, who have the same attitudes as the police officers in their interview. Their first response is to say, not all convicts are those overzealous people. That's crazy psychoanalysis from Team England. Let me be abundantly clear here, panel, because every one of us has responded to this. And I can only assume that Canada are willfully misunderstanding. It may be true that many ex-convicts are not overzealous. It may even be true that most ex-convicts are not overzealous. Take a second to note this down. Our burden was to show that the ones who apply to join the police and the ones who are accepted by the police are going to be the ones who are overzealous. And know that this doesn't mean they're violent criminals. It means that they've been exposed to violent crime. It means that they hate the violent criminals that they met while in prison. And the reason why they want to join the police force is to do something about it. They say in response that police forces don't have the incentive to employ someone who appears harsh on crime. Three responses here. I want you to take a second to think how counterintuitive this claim is. The role of the police is to clamp down on crime. Obviously they want to employ someone who will clamp down on crime. We think this very much is a question that is asked in your interview because it directly relates to how good you are at your job. Secondly, know that simply asserting that Black Lives Matter happened doesn't mean now that the police are trying to employ someone who, in Canada's own words, are soft on crime. We think the police force is dominated by people who have spent their entire lives fighting crime, who have been shot at by criminals, who believe that criminals are evil people who cannot be allowed to continue offending. This is the prevalent culture within the police force, not that Black Lives Matter and that the police needs to report and recognise that that is the exact structural reason that police brutality is a problem in the first place. But I want you to recognise, panel, that even if the incentives to cut down on police brutality do exist among police officers, they probably prioritise their own safety over the idea of improving the force. Because even if they believe that racism is bad, they are much more worried about employing someone who may be soft on crime, or who may not pull the trigger when you're under threat. This is a much more pressing issue for them, and something that they're much more likely to consider highly when they're interviewing you. But I want to be charitable, because Canada never was. Let's take them at their best case and say they do get the job. Even if they do, once you're on duty with another officer, someone who isn't a convict, and to take their own example, you see a black man walking home after curfew, what do Canada really think happens? Because when the ex-convict says, actually, maybe we shouldn't pull this man over. I'm sure he's not doing anything bad. Or he gets angry at his colleague for being too harsh on him. The biases of his colleague are reinforced. And this person is likely to be dismissed or never promoted in the force in the first place. That means their nebulous impacts of them getting to the top of the police force and changing policy never stand in this debate. Finally, though, if you don't buy any of that,"

They can do many other things in social services, which should also lead to this change. Thisbuttal is important this was their most substantial point which they spent the fault of their case on and we show why their analysis is incredibly why our characterization is much more realistic before i go on i'll take a few lines sure so maybe there's some initial suspicion of officers hiring these people but there's six month probationary periods and training periods where you can form direct personal relationships and you don't have to rely on these stereotypes. During that time, you have an incentive to appear as strong on crime as possible because that's what the people above you want to do. We think that is exactly why they're going to be harsh on crime. But also those are the people most likely to apply for these jobs in the first place. We told you there are two groups of ex-convicts likely to get jobs. The ones with the overzealous ones, and note we think these groups are the most persuasive ones, these are the people who are being overly harsh, who are more willing to pull the trigger when it is unnecessary. You get all of the bad impacts that a proposition wants to talk about. But the second group is those who have not performed, and know that they never respond to the damning impacts of letting these people in who are actively detrimental to policing. They never engage with this because they believe their case directly cashed with it, but given that we've shown that our characterisation of these ex-convicts is more realistic, we win on the most important clash of who gets better policing. Finally, on trust in the police. I've already pointed out that they contradicted their analysis earlier, so I'm not sure how much more I need to do here. But let's talk about which of our claims is more plausible. They say that people will see there are convicts in the police force and so people are going to trust them more because people relate to convicts. We say people are much more likely to fear convicts and that fear will be imprinted on the police. The only analysis they give for that claim is that people currently believe that police are separate and they have no common ground. I'm not sure why you need the police officer to be a convict to change this. Why can't you have a police officer who just grew up in the same neighborhood as you and then you also get these impacts of relating to them. But in contrast, we told you you're much more likely to be afraid. Why is this more likely? Because firstly, it plays into the other societal narratives about criminals, because everywhere else in life you're told to fear these people. And because secondly, the media are likely to sensationalise these issues, which make you more afraid than you should be. That means on balance, Panel, when you're working out which interpretation is more likely, you must side with opposition. Panel, we think we show why you are likely to damage trust in policing where you get worse policing and why they lose on principle incredibly proud to oppose"

But even if you do, the police force don't select you as an officer because these institutions are averse to change and they want to keep the status quo, which is why we don't have structural reform right now, but also because they know there'll be huge backlash if they select anyone likely to be biased or soft on crime. So they pick the individuals likely to be the most zealous and the most brutal. Note that the response of, but the police have strong incentives to avoid allegations of brutality, doesn't apply either. As we explained in third, people view the ball of the police exercising force on behalf of the state, so they're likely to be willing to give the police the benefit of the doubt when they use excessive force in difficult situations, but not when a convict playing into every other negative societal narrative about criminals commits another crime or lets another criminal get away. Therefore, the incentive to avoid allegations of being soft on crime massively outweigh the incentive to avoid allegations of police brutality. And even if you are hired, as we talk about in third, you are pressured by your client leads into being overzealous to prove your loyalty. And note the comparative case, you are far more likely to have incentives to be overzealous as opposed to non-ex-convicts. And that does not just last a six-month probationary period, panel, it lasts your whole career because people will always be suspicious for reasons that side propositions concede so you get far more brutality than under the status quo because there are extra pressures and extra scrutiny that side proposition is so proud of in their very fine model but note that"

The side proposition never explained to us why we get better trust, they simply asserted that it isn't a tipping point, but given that their own analysis relies on this being a tipping point, I think for the debate to take place, they have to accept that this argument stands and crucially that this policy massively damages the trust vulnerable groups holding the police and therefore the ability to access justice for all those reasons so proud to oppose.

This was absurd for three reasons that we told you. Number one, in Anishka, we told you it's untrue. The police isn't great, but they won't just violently commit brutality and abuse individuals. Anishka gave you a host of incentives out of self-preservation, out of perceptions, out of local backlash, especially after the wake of BLM on why this is untrue. Second, we told you that this is not every single police force. Not every single police force and justice system exists out of the US. There are more reasonable interpretations of police that they need to engage with. Thirdly and finally, this is important.

              "text": "post-conflict societies. This House would grant amnesty to perpetrators of crimes rather than seeking prosecution. In this speech, I'll be going over a couple of points on framing before discussing two key standards. My first on how times of conflict generate crime. The second on how the prosecution process that happens in these post-conflict societies is often unjust. On to framing them. A few points under this. The first is noting that this motion is focused on the position in which we are arguing these kinds of warrants here. Notice this takes place in a post-conflict society. So whether this conflict happened from state versus state, state versus the people, or people versus people, the end goal is always going to be the same in post-conflict societies. A desire that after years of war and tyranny, you would be able to achieve something like peace and stability. Note, that is why on our side of the house, we will consistently uphold that principle over anything else, because having things like peace and stability is a prerequisite to ever having things like a fair justice system, a sustainable economy for individuals to thrive on their own, or any form of accountability. Second thing under framing is not addressing certain characterizations for today's debate. We would like to give a characterization of what crimes happen in post-migrant, conflict-ridden societies. In places like Vietnam, Iraq, and Yemen, in their very, very worst days, we would say almost every individual that was living within those conflict-ridden areas was exposed to some form of crime, whether they were partaking in it or witnessing it. So note, when we talk about these types of arguments and how we are going to be upholding these types of prosecutions, we are talking about a world that we would heavily advocate for is granted a one-time amnesty for all the crimes that were committed during that conflict time lapse. We think that's pretty simple to be characterized based off of international actors."

              "text": "Now on to our first substantive, which focuses how times of conflict uniquely generate crime. Note, while it is difficult for us as six debaters to be able to characterize what living in times of war is like, I think we can be a little bit generous with being able to assume what the lives of these individuals is like. When bullets are blazing past you, when there are screeches of bombs dropping, when you don't know if you're going to be able to have food or water within the next day, weeks, or months, it is absolutely okay to begin falling into the mindset that crime becomes an inevitable means to being able to get to necessary ends. Two ways into how this happens. First is a focus on individual needs. This one spans like food, shelter, water, basic things that you need to just be able to live as a human being. These are uniquely denied in times of conflict because either A, they're destroyed by boots on grounds or rebel forces because they want to harm infrastructure or food aid packages, or B, there's a lack of a sustainable economy for me to be able to participate in to create money for myself to buy groceries or buy a house, or just be able to create food in general. Or three, international actors began imposing certain things like sanctions to help me out, yet this uniquely cuts off accessible means of goods and medicines that were once there before my society was in a time of conflict. There's no longer a government to provide me things like welfare. There's no longer a means for me to be able to ensure that I get these types of very very necessary of like items to be able to survive. So the alternative becomes things like crimes of acquisition, theft, to be able to elude, to be able to get these types of goods and basically be able to survive. The second B is noting what happens for groupies. This happens on a much more broader scale. As a society, we have a desire for things like order, stability, and protection. But all of these things are uniquely denied when your state is either absent or in providing care for you, or simply perpetuating harms actively against you. We think this happens in a multitude of instances of conflict-ridden societies. It means that crimes now, like violently attacking an individual, are no longer me being a selfish person in a society, or being a bad citizen, but rather that I am taking a form of self-defense. Because in a conflict-ridden society, I can't call the cops. I can't rely on my government to protect me, which is why we-ridden society, I can't call the cops, I can't rely on my government to protect me, which is why we need it so, so very clear that if there was no government to be able to provide you these types of things to sustain your life as a citizen, then there should be no government to try and hold you accountable and prosecute you when they decide to make their own case, since this seems to be a very serious POI moment. Look, this is not exclusive to post-conflict societies. You still have low-income communities in many developing nations, where you don't have the very same thing. Does your principle extend to these communities as well? No, because in a non-conflict society, where there are governments that aren't looking out for low-income people, we think there's still a way to be able to demand certain welfare programs. I literally just spent five minutes of my speech telling you why uniquely, in times of conflict-ridden societies,"

              "text": "is how the prosecution process is uniquely unjust in conflict-ridden societies. Even if you buy that people are guilty and that they need to be upheld and get some form of accountability on their side of the house, note that this argument still takes them at their best. The state of post-conflict society has a uniquely faulty actor providing justice for a mass amount of people. Let's just walk through these types of conflicts and analyze why this is true. When it's state versus state scenarios, like what happened in Vietnam, we think oftentimes what this looks like is one state win. This state then begins to use their power through militaristic ways, which then creates harsher crackdowns, longer sentences, and unfair trials against those small minority peoples that was once beat in an already used-out conflict. The second would be one that focuses on state versus people. We think the vast majority of instances, when it comes to these types of conflicts, the state has the ability and advantage to always be able to win against the people. Thus, you access the same type of crackdown that I just addressed under the first one. The third is a more different type of scenario that happens to be complex. One that focuses on people versus people. Note that when it comes to things like civil wars or ethnic conflicts, post-conflict uniquely means that someone has won this. So the new ruling ethnic class now has an incentive to be able to provide faulty trials when they're bringing up old issues that have already been resolved. We say these create very, very faulty tasks for being able to uphold a criminal justice system. We don't think that this is necessarily fair. But now, we have to address why this is so, so important. Remember the framing that I gave you at the very top of this speech, where the most important thing that needs to be upheld in post-conflict societies to ever be able to achieve things like sustainability and peace is being ensured that you have fair processes. This uniquely ensures that you never get rid of these types of things. Very, very proud to propose."

Third, an argument to why we create better post-conflict societies. Three points to our stance. First, we say that actually what happens in reality is that you punish both sides of the conflict equally for the crimes that both perpetrators from both sides have committed. Why is that so? This leads me to the second point. How does this actually work in reality? We see that no thank you, it's like international organizations that oversee these conflicts and that very often, for example, have peacekeepers in these conflicts and gather massive amounts of intel or have other forms of intel gathered through which they have evades. In this case, these people that have committed the crimes very often are tried in institutions like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court in Hague. And we see these processes as analogous to the North American trial that has happened after the Second World War, in which Americans, Germans, Russians, and people from Britain have all been charged for the crimes that they have committed. And thirdly, we say that the punishment we have is actually proportional to the crime that is being done. That is to say, no thank you, when someone steals something, they do not get a life sentence, right? We say that their life is actually pretty opaque."

              "text": "Now to the rebuttal. Firstly, to their characterizations. No thank you. We say that like most people in the acts of war do not actually steal or do not actually kill other people out of necessity. Very often, like trying to keep your own agency in the fact that you act in accordance to laws. You do this only out of like the greatest necessity, right? But second, we say that they completely mischaracterized the world here because it's not just petty crimes out of necessity, it's also acts such as war crimes and such as rape. Now to their first argument on why we disproportionately punish those that have just been doing crimes out of necessity. So first, there is a thing in the justice system or principle that is called extenuating circumstances. This means that when you have committed a crime out of necessity, that is to say, like you would literally die if you would have not stolen some food or some water, right? It's not a crime because you have prevented something worse. And the very same thing is present with self-defense, because if someone attacks you and you defend yourself, it is also not taken as a crime. And by this, a large portion of their case falls. No, thank you. But secondly, we say that here that they are inconsistent in principle, because they say that the government does not provide for the needs of these people, but like many governments in developing countries also do not provide for the needs of the poorest people, and yet they say they should not be justified in committing crimes. We say that they have to correct this in their second speech."

              "text": "Second argument. Two main reactions here. Firstly, we do not agree with the contextualization that the people are mostly tried in these countries. But secondly, we believe that even if they would be, we say that the impact of not punishing people that have committed massive war crimes would be really bad, as I will show you in my argument on why we need a better and more just post-conflict society. By upholding three principles of law. First, retribution. Second, deterrence. And thirdly, facetation. Before I start with retribution, go. Court of Justice makes sure that they prosecute individuals like giant war criminals or generals. Note, our side of the house is focused on the in-state government that harms those individuals that take crimes of acquisition during conflict. Like, we don't agree with this character. Yeah, sure, they punish these, but they punish them on both sides. We don't see the implications of this point really. Okay, so firstly to the point about retribution. Three points here. First, we see that there are people that have just done crimes that are so repugnant and so disgusting that they simply have to be punished for the sole virtue that they have committed these crimes because we simply as a society, or like a human population cannot accept them. So when someone orders like a genocide of a village, you just simply have to punish that person no matter what are the implications of that punishment because you cannot let people like these go unpunished. But second, we say that very often families in the countries that are post-conflict feel unsafe insofar as the people that have created a lot of the conflict are not punished. Note that you feel like your own state is very often going against you, or you feel like there is, or you have sleepless nights because you know that someone that has raped your mother is out there free."

              "text": "not punishing people creates vigilante justice. And why is this so important? Because you feel like justice has not been done. You feel like the people still need punishment. And this is especially important in post-conflict societies where there is still a lot of tension, when there is still a lot of unresolved business. So they tip the point and people are on their side more likely to commit this vigilante justice. Why is this so wrong? Because people cannot assess the situation as objectively as the courts that we are talking about can, which means that justice is not being done. But even if this were not true, they just very simply increase the tensions between the two groups or more groups in the post-conflict society, which stifles the ability for them to achieve a nation that is peaceful. Second layer, the principle of deterrence. Two points here. First, you set a powerful precedent in a society once you punish the people that have committed these heinous crimes. Why? Because your society or your government very often is starting from scratch, which means that you need to establish the rule of law, you need to set some principles, and you need to, for example, a whole human rights note, thank you, that set the direction of the way in which the country will be headed. You cannot tolerate intolerance and these crimes. And this has two major implications. First, it affects the mindset of the people in the country, because insofar as they see that the war criminals in the country have been punished, they know that this is something that is not tolerated, and their mindset, no thank you, will adhere to this principle as well. But second, it sets sort of a way in which the politics of the country should head as well. That is to say, the politics of the country will also strive to go for these principles, to stand for human rights, because they know that this is the right thing, and so far their society has been built on these principles. But the second layer here is that if there were to be a conflict in the future, in the country that is post-conflict or in any other country, we set a precedent that these crimes will very simply not be tolerated, which means that there is a large deterrence towards the people that would have committed these crimes to not commit them because they know that they will not be safe after the conflict is over. Third principle, incapacitation. Very simply, the generals and the people that commit war crimes or people that enjoy the war crimes and they are high on the power that they get during the war, which means that they free is a safer society that adheres to the most fundamental law principles under our side. They mischaracterize the debate. Vote off. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Opposition made this debate as messy as they possibly could have."

We prefer our definition because it encompasses more people. At the end of the day, we don't really think the Motion Setting Committee wanted this debate to be about whether or not we should let murderers and rapists go free, but also at the end of the day, if we have to bite that bullet, we're willing to do so. To be clear, our definition is better for the round because we're closer to the heart of the motion, but we will engage on proposition's best ground anyways. In this debate,"

First, it is so unlikely that if one state wins, that both states are going to be held accountable. Moreover, let me tell you, the UN is a terrible and weak actor. Like, the UN couldn't have less accountability and couldn't have less enforcement mechanisms. The best enforcement mechanism they give you is peacekeepers. The same peacekeepers who rape and murder in order to preserve stability, we don't understand how by advocating for peacekeepers, the harms aren't order to preserve civility, we don't understand how by advocating for peacekeepers the harms aren't being put on their side of the house. Moreover, this debate we tell you in Proposition 1 by this House very clearly means should the post-conflict states and their domestic criminal justice systems hold people liable. So even if you buy all of their analysis about international organizations, we don't think that's unique to this debate. We think that can still happen on our side of the house. What then is who wins on the principle? They broadly give you an argument about retribution and holding people accountable, particularly for egregious crimes like rape and murder. We have four responses. First, we say peace and stability always outweigh because that's a prerequisite to having a justice system which can hold these things rape, and murder. We have four responses. First, we say peace and stability always outweigh, because that's a prerequisite to having a justice system which can hold these things accountable. I'll answer that in a practical portion of my speech. Secondly, it assumes that these repudiant crimes are ever pursued."

One, if it is true that these military officials command these awful things, and then the military wins, we think it is more than likely the military would not then prosecute themselves. Secondly, even if that's not the case in a divorce, the Netherlands state that wins. The burden is still on the victim to come forward and even lead to the prosecution in the first place. Our third response is that the argument assumes that the good state always wins. We say the harms are worse on their side of the house, because bad actors will always crack down on the dissidents who fought against them but didn't win the conflict. But good actors, their best case scenario only sometimes prosecutes some people. They can't possibly prosecute every single murder in rape, but in every single case, the bad actors will find a way to crack down on the people they see as a threat to their stability. Fourthly, we win on the number of people who actually access justice. Turn this argument against them, because at best they win victims, but we say the vast majority of people are being denied justice in a world in which they committed crimes of acquisition which were caused by the state. The only way to give those people retribution is by granting them amnesty for crimes which they had no alternative but to commit. What did we hear in response to Layla's substantive material about how this is literally self-defense? They said, well, extenuating circumstances can be wiped out in court. I mean, come on. How assertive can that response be, and how hopeful can it be that courts are somehow not going to prosecute these crimes within the majority of cases? When bad actors win, they are likely to do so, even if it's good actors, this week on public court. Then they said this is an inconsistent principle."

We'll take the radical stance that if you're starving, poor people should be able to steal bread. On to the practical. What do they give you? They said that it will lead to deterrence. We say this is contingent on proving that they are ever deterred because their actor finds a way to hold people culpable. But at the end of the day, if you think the UN is an inefficient actor, the deterrence can never happen. If it were true that deterrence would happen, we wouldn't see conflict states in the status quo. What did Lila tell you? They destroy stability. Why is stability so much worse on their side of the house? There are two groups that become disillusioned. The majority are the losers. The majority are the people concerned with crimes of acquisition and self-defense. They're most likely to be prosecuted because they have a lack of resources to fight it. But the masses now see the state as an illegitimate state because it's punishing people for crimes that the government created. Moreover, they disrupt society because they take out the community leaders of the masses. Why? Because these community leaders are the people most likely to take the risk upon themselves to commit these crimes. So even if they win, they hold everyone accountable. They're taking out the community leaders who keep things safe. At the point at which they get massive amounts of people who are disillusioned by the state, if anything, they just create more instability. Why is instability the thing you should worry about in this round? It's necessary because if stability isn't guaranteed, all of their harms are inevitable because you create more conflict states. You create more rape and murder on their side of the house. You create more war crimes."

I'll now move on to my third substantive argument, which is on how post-conflict prosecution is terrible for prisoners. Post-conflict criminal justice systems are not cheery. They're likely to be worse in their world for a few reasons. First, it's a lack of resources. I'll take that one. If you characterize these countries as so terrible and so unjust, how do you know that they will just let their opposition go free? Because the motion guarantees us that we can handle this. The first reason is a lack of resources. Irrespective of the type of conflict, the state is likely to be strapped for cash. Either it's a new state, or they spend tons of money on preserving their sovereignty. As a result, the state is unlikely to achieve justice for these people. Their best case scenario, because when prosecutors have limited resources, they can only afford to choose the cases that they know they can win. Poor and marginalized folks that can't afford legal fees to protect themselves are most likely to be prosecuted. But the rich and powerful, the people most likely to commit the most heinous crimes they talk about, the actual generals are likely to insulate themselves because they are the ones in power to create the preconditions for these crimes. Because they can do things like bribe prosecutors, lobby officials, afford good lawyers, or at the worst, literally move away from the country because they have the most to lose. The second reason this is so bad is because systems become very punitive. In every single case, a post-conflict state is in pursuit of stability. It doesn't matter if it's relatively benevolent or a military takeover, they become more punitive. In order to put up a facade of stability, they start being as punitive as possible. What does this look like? It looks like increased police brutality on the front end, increased corruption within the actual legal system that skews towards incarceration, and terrible conditions once people get to participate in prison in the name of stability. As a result, at best, the proposition achieves bad prosecution for not the people who commit the most crimes. At worst, they're actively making the state even more unstable. Proud to propose."

Second, we tell you this is incredibly probable because of a mass power vacuum that happens on everything in the house because you don't have anyone present that would regulate it. Third, we tell you there will be individuals who are the most extreme, therefore those who lost, who still have an innate desire to inflict major harm.

              "text": "There are three arguments I want to make here. The first one is that the heart of this debate is about whether the state or being in the situation of a conflict society justifies the crimes that are committed in that society and how that state of conflict influences people's mindsets when they're about to commit crimes. That is the heart of the debate. That is where the criminal justice portion of the debate lies. That is where the philosophical portion of the debate lies. Why is proposition's characterization so much more central to this debate? The debate is not Nuremberg trials good, bad, Nazis good, bad, Nazis prosecution question mark. The debate is significantly more complicated than that and more nuanced than that. We brought you characterization about post-conflict societies. Just because a state went to war doesn't make it a post-conflict society. After George Bush randomly decided to invade Iraq, it didn't make the U.S. a post-conflict society. After George Bush randomly decided to invade Iraq, it didn't make the U.S. a post-conflict society. The characterization of the proposition is brought to you is that these are places where geographically the area itself has gone through large amounts of conflict. Therefore, the government that is likely to be formed, the government that is the actor of this motion, is likely to engage in all the incentive structures that we've brought in. The second point I want to make here is that it is about the perspective of the domestic government. We were clear about this from the problem I should want in our framing, which means that opposition is too late to decide. The third thing is that I'm not only just quibbling about the model. Let's say you take some of opposition characterizations at hand and say that some of their characterizations are right. Proposition, additional to our characterizations, has been incentive-based arguments for why these governments are likely to engage in these practices. We've said in a post-conflict society that a new government is likely to be weaker because it doesn't have the ability to maintain lots of infrastructure or a strong criminal justice system. We've also said that the new governments are likely to want to pursue stability, and thus they're more likely to engage in abusive practices. Which means even if you think the characterization debate is just us quibbling about definitions to each other, you know that proposition has engaged in an incentive analysis that makes our arguments significantly more likely, but also from the proposition one, we were willing to take them at their highest ground, which I will do thoroughly in this speech."

We gave you examples where our policies happen. The Nuremberg trials, Yugoslavia, it wasn't the respective government that was doing it, it was the international community. That's just how it works. Well, also in a lot of those post-conflict societies, those governments themselves also have to decide what they're going to do with the people that committed crimes while the conflict is going on. But in this speech, I will take away your highest ground in those examples in just a second. Let's talk about broader stability for a second. This is the most important impact of the debate, and opposition cannot run away from this, because we've told you from the Proposition 1 that stability is the most important thing. Luke expanded upon this in his last speech, where he talked about if stability is a necessary prerequisite to get into justice in the first place, and the worst possible thing for a corresponded society is returning to a state of the poor."

Crimes of acquisition particularly, the state can rattle up and replace them in prison because those populations don't have the ability to fight back. They themselves give you the incentive structure that these states want to have a perception of stability, that they want to have their own criminal justice systems and their own governments appear to be more legitimate. When that is the state's desire, they're going to go after people that they think they can easily lock away to show off how excellent their government is. Those things that threaten stability.

But when the bad guys win, it gets even worse, because you get targeted prosecution against certain portions of the population. Then the second mechanism I want to talk about is that let's say they're correct, that these crimes are not successfully prosecuted, that they're put in jail. But this is still bad for stability in post-conflict societies because you have a large number of the population that is still branded as criminal, whose existence is still illegal, who can't interact with the government. This makes pursuing stability impossible in those societies because those people, even if not jailed, are still carrying around a mark of criminal because they engaged in theft during the conflict itself. That is still a requirement for stability. The third is let's talk about their high ground. Some of the examples they're giving, I don't think I want to find a bullet on, which is like the Nuremberg trials, but let's talk about a more reasonable one. Actually, this is a completely very, very unreasonable one, but here's where we're really willing to fight the bull. Let's talk about post-Civil War United States. Listen to the comparison. Imagine if after the Civil War was just completed, it was completely abolished, the entirety of the United States federal government decided to lock up the parents of every single white family in the South. Yes, it was okay to maybe persecute the generals that fought for the South, but if you attempted to lock up literally everyone that was responsible for crimes in that situation, you would have had Civil War Part 2, which would result in everything that they're talking about becoming significantly worse. Which means even on their highest ground, the most unreasonable, heinous acts that they want us to defend, sometimes in post-conflict society, it might be necessary in the long term to achieve broader stability, to achieve reconciliation, to not prosecute those crimes, which means even in the most heinous of instances, we're talking about at least there is some debate about whether it is good to prosecute or not. What compare the material they bring you? They say we should prosecute crimes like rape and murder. Let's talk about whether they get this on their side of the house, because they didn't answer these mechanisms. You don't get prosecution on their side of the house. One, there would be a burden on the victim of these crimes to report these things to the government. In a post-conflict society, that seems unlikely to me. Two, there would be no desire to actually end up these crimes because a lot of times the victims of these crimes don't know the name of the perpetrator. They know that they were just part of the opposing army. And if this is about the domestic post-conflict girlfriend, they're not going to be able to have those people within reach anyway. But let's take them on their highest ground. International prosecutions. Here's how body cameras work for the UN. That's how the UN decides to go about engaging in all their mechanisms. It's on their side of the house, they have an incentive structure. Then, let's say one state beats another state. In the context of the United Nations, the United Nations is heavily influenced by Western powers, which means that's why the United States got away with a bunch of war crimes, because there were international mechanisms that favored the United States of America. That's our point about international mechanisms. Then, vigilante justice. If I win the argument that they were going to fail to prosecute these people, then it makes vigilante justice more likely on their side of the house, because the failures of the criminal justice system will be done there. In a world where we're starting a society from scratch post-conflict, it's much better for everyone to have a clean state. People will be less incentivized to engage in vigilante justice, because they don't want to risk losing the stability that has been worked so hard to earn. Their last argument is about international legitimacy, and it's something about the UN Security Council. One, there are a bunch of other reasons why the UN Security Council chooses to or chooses not to recognize states. One of the real incongruence for the United States is just like oil, but the whole point here is playing politics with prosecution doesn't really put us establishing a clear link in this argument. Second, if this argument is about the legitimacy of post-conflict states, proposition's material is significantly more necessary to the legitimacy of these post-conflict states, because it proves that they should crack down on certain populations, engage in abusive practices, and there should be a level of amnesty and clean state to start. The second theme is a little less important, because it's just about the principle analysis, which was pretty much missing in their entire two. We brought to you a lot of substantial principle analysis for why the state of being in a conflict justifies the crimes that are committed, and an entire substantive argument about why the prisons in these countries are likely to be abusive in the first place. This would implicate a lot of the material opposition he's bringing you, because they're not successfully prosecuting these individuals, and if they are successfully prosecuting these individuals, they're not putting them in places that are likely to resolve the conflict of broader civil society. The reason retributive, horrible prisons that have no good conditions for prisoners are bad is because they take people who commit things like crimes of acquisition and turn them into hardened criminals, which means at the highest ground, when they're jailing these people, we think the jails in those conflict societies actually makes the situation worse off, which means that every layer of the debate, no matter where opposition takes their highest ground, we are winning. Thank you. To conclude, we will call on the third speaker of the office of the fact that propositions are used in a bubble where there are only bad governments and only crimes committed out of necessity, we should take this in big."

              "text": "Here, first of all, the first problem in debate was that proposition argues only for the crimes committed out of necessity. Even though we've challenged them to explain us, first of all, where is the lie? Like, how can you say that this was the crime committed out of necessity and this was not? This was really unclear and they were never able to explain this mechanism according to which they are actually receiving justice. No thank you. Also they never showed the exclusivity to the post-conflict society because there are more cases where there are crimes committed out of necessity. It is not only in poor countries but it can also be in more double point. No. Second idea here is the fact that they're saying it is justified to argue for this large number of people. First of all, we told you that we are okay to take this and because of the fact that our punishments are proportional, nothing really, like nothing terrible happens to those individuals. But secondly, the point here is that we were arguing for the most severe crimes and the point that they never really engaged with this does not mean that this criteria is inherently wrong. Because these severe crimes are the ones that have the biggest impact on the society. Therefore, they never really reacted and we should take this away just on that point. Third, this idea of political capital to intervene and to have our world as it stands. First of all, we told you that if they have political capital to propose this amnesty, we have political capital to have international committee that in court takes both sides off in the war and basically makes the justice and tell which punishment according to the evidence they get. Secondly, they also put on us very unfair burden when they say that we have to argue only for those unfair courts because at the point at which they are able to push through amnesty in those unfair courts, we are able to have this international committee and to have really fair process. And fourthly, we have this idea of punishment. And this is very important, as they never engage with our idea of proportional punishment and the fact that we have accentuated circumstances considered. It's not like that you have a person that, out of necessity, has stolen some food and he will get a life sentence. Not at all. First of all, we really doubt that this person would get to this international court, as this is something that is not that severe, so it is not likely to be considered a huge crime. But secondly, we also claim that from that point of view, when we have more severe crimes, we are also more likely to have evidence for these crimes and we need to get punishments. There is this necessity. And they never told us why in their world these crimes that were really severe and that caused huge harms to the individuals because the fact that you stole food is not something that would create this magnificent harm that would influence the rest of your life. Therefore, point, no thank you, finally here in this punishment, they never justify the fact that they are taking away this punishment as such. They never engage with the fact that we are claiming that it is not principally okay to"

They told us, and this was what they claimed from the debates, it was the idea that we have bad states and bad governments that are quite weak and that we cannot really make justice there. First of all, no thank you. If we take them under high strung and say that this is really the scenario, at the point at which these governments will be able to push through these amnesties, the only thing is because they do not have really high quality, for example, police and other things, the backlash is much more likely in these bad governments in a horizon after they impose these amnesties in there. Secondly, we believe that when they want to claim, when they want to have safe and peaceful societies, we cannot really argue only in that scenario, because in their world, these countries are much more unstable as they don't have the justice we deserve. Yes? We didn't say definitionally that there are crimes of acquisition currently. We gave incentives for why these crimes are likely, even if they're not the majority, and these crimes, and the crimes you're talking about, are unlikely to be punished. Please engage with our material. Okay, thank you, I will, but only later in this week because I want to first of all clarify the vigilante justice. So now, let's take a look here. First of all, we have really little traction and it is too late in their third speech to come up with the reaction as I should not really provide you with new content for the debate. But let's take a look at what they're saying on their eyes and say that what they're saying that vigilance justice is more likely on our side, we did not really get the analysis of what they're... The point here is that on our side, we have more justice done. When they claim that these rapes and murders are very hard to get some kind of evidence, there is the problem. Because what is more likely that you get the evidence of? The fact that somebody stole food from a shop? Or the fact that somebody murdered someone and very likely this was some hard footage, there were witnesses and there is something that is like much more likely to be evidence. Therefore, the fact that they claim that there is lack of evidence still does not engage with the idea that there are some murders we know who has committed them.

And because of the fact that we want to have stable societies, the ones that keep peace and that makes this deterrence effect and retribution, which was by the way also largely neglected in their case, it means that under our side, the fact that we have stable societies, this scenario is much more likely. And finally, the lack of engagement on this incapacitation point, where we told you that there are criminals who want to make more crime, which is dangerous to society, and we need to punish them, because otherwise they will commit more crimes, and this is just wrong for our post-conflict societies.

And second, I'll talk about the principle, largely neglecting down the bench on side government. Look, what happens on team government? First, you have a huge amount of vigilante justice and only got a few lines in government living here. Why is this problematic? Because we told the jurors a huge incentive for these people to continue doing terrible things on the stakeholder, on the individuals who were part of the extremist side, possibly initiating the conflict. Because now that they have a weapon, they get power. Therefore we told you this is negative because it destabilizes individual on individual view, individual on individual relationships. Second, we told you through the victims who felt that they did not get the justice they deserved because someone in their family was killed and the person who killed them, or at least the side responsible, got amnesty and their flight and running free. We told you we'd change this. We'd change this because of the incapacitation. Meaning the individuals who'd be shooting go to jail. Meaning the individuals who'd be voicing through brass movements or through like political media that this extremism must continue would be put to jail. Meaning the individuals who would be voicing through brass movements or through like political media that this extremism must continue would be put to jail. And put to jail far far away from these individuals therefore there's a global loyalty of even spread. That's what you're going to go to jail for. Second, what we're telling you is that very often you won't get international help. Why is this so? Because we're telling you to take a soft stance. This was my extension. We told you it was improbable at the point at which, in general, the international community condemns states that you don't solve these issues. We gave you the example of Myanmar. You will not get that help. What this means is you won't get these Western funds. What this means is you won't get the dissents of the United States, like the bastion of democracy helping you in solving your conflict. At that point, we tell you if anything, you have on their side, people who want to kill, running free and they're doing nothing about it. And an international commission invites you. If anything, and this is the second part, is that this is not justified because at that point, the people who they say are most vulnerable are even more vulnerable.

Why is this question so important? We said that if the state doesn't stay conflict free, then all of their harms are inevitable. They don't have a criminal justice system to access retribution.

What if the individual is intoxicated by side effects of a medicine that they prescribed? Your cases are just about specific cases of rape which are rape coaching and criminal justice and does not accommodate the variety of cases of intoxication. I'm not sure I will answer that.

The narrative that surrounds this crime, because you're a drug, you're not as responsible as other cases, right? We think that's really, that's the kind of norm that's created through this system because the state officially recognizes as a mitigating factor and legitimate cause of defense, right? So as a result of that, two harms happen. Firstly, victims are damaged in the court trials, in the process of court trials, when they hear that the offender says, because of alcohol, I wasn't irresponsible, right? We think that narrative stuff that exists in the court is very harmful for victims to enter the court, and we think that's a double jeopardy for these victims. But secondly also there is a repetitive, there is a danger of repetitive crime, right? Please note that the drug rape problem has a repetitive tendency, 60 or 70% of repetitive tendency, right? So if it's because of the alcohol you don't regret your action at all because you raped the alcohol and nobody blaming the actions and your ability to judge, right? So, which resulting in more and more numbers of victims being raped after sentencing and after sentencing of offenders and everything. This problem has been so long left in especially in Japanese society and other universities, you know, raping culture society, right? I'm sorry. So, we think that's the problem.

So first reason is because as I stated, it's your choice to choose to drink and choose to maybe prescribe, pre to maybe prescribe the medicine in a situation where you might do something wrong. So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments and it's probably your choice also, right? So meaning that, even if you do things while you're being drunk, at the point in which you choose to drink and to actually go into the society knowing that you might be humble, we think this person should be fully responsible for their actions, right? It's totally different from, for example, insanity defense, where people don't choose to be a mental illness or cannot really control themselves, but it's rather the way that you choose to drink, right? So it's a matter of moving to the drink-drunk driving, where you probably drink and you drive and you're punished, right? Even if you have lost your judgement, that doesn't mean that you are not responsible for action. You should be punished equally, right? So why is this important at the end of the day? We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the beauty of justice for victims, right? Victims don't care why you started drinking or started, you know, you lost your judgement ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which those are the ones who didn't choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example. And like, we think that's, for that sense, we think intoxication defence is immoral as a defence and should not be really justified and for that reason I'm very happy to propose."

If the court believes the application of that defense is good, maybe it will be applied. If the court doesn't think it should be applied, it will not be applied. They cannot simply win this debate by throwing random examples which sound bad.

So from a little bit of opportunity, I want to talk about two things first of all why do you know justice should maintain intoxication defense principally and I will secondly deep dive for specific cases why is this why is no reasonable to abolish intoxication defense and your center house application you know before that several on the independent report also to the Prime Minister. So, first of all, they provided cases about rape, right, repeatedly. I don't say it's completely irrelevant at all. But probably regarding rape cases, are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense, but in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of sentences for rape are generally, generally very low. Those kind of issues are constantly discussed in the current context. We say, when they're talking about rape is very lightly treated, it's not about this debate. They want to, they need to talk about it in other debates. And secondly, they are talking about victims, right? Criminal case, victims are victims, right, are respected in the status quo. But criminal cases don't respect victims' right to much extent, unfortunately, as a system. Victims' voices are hard as one evidence to discuss culpability, but victims' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be hard already in the status quo. If you want to argue some compensation things for the levels of rape victims, it will be another debate about intersexual defense in civil cases. That will be a completely different debate. Then also it's the same for insanity defense. Victims don't care if the people have mental illness or so, but still insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator's right and prosecute individual in the fair and honest. That's the core principle of criminal justice system. So let's move on to my first point about principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the prosecutor individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice system is built on a trust of citizen. Every single individual should feel it's a fair jurisdiction under equality of law. That's why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law, if people feel it's not fair, I don't have any responsibility for this particular crime, that criminal justice system cannot work in the first place. And secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of individuals to a great extent, which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for the consequences caused by the person without any doubt. That's why we assume presumption of innocence in order to protect the right of individuals who commit a crime. That's why we put a burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors, not on the side of defendants. So that should be consistently working in a status quo. That's why I think intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house."

              "text": "Then let's move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained. So for example, taking alcohol and other intoxicants substances are often times inevitable. For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it's really inevitable to go out drinking with customers. It's not limited to alcohol, for example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things which they can do in a very ordinary situation. For example, you may receive the camphor as a drug for influenza, but in those circumstances, patients don't have any ways to avoid taking those medicines, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their cyber house. But in their circumstances, they will abolish every single intoxication defense, the people who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances, and the people who commit a murder when they take the time before, are going to be prosecuted in the same way in their cyber house. That is similarly harmful in terms of fairness for individuals who don't feel like, I'm fairly treated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons. That's why we think that should stand before moving on here. Okay, TamiFo is taken in the case of the influenza, right? You choose to go outside being severely ill, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the complete harm of big red victims in Britain. I don't understand your point of information. Taking time for is also the realm of this debate. We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicant circumstances."

              "text": "So why is this analysis important? Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defence from insanity defence in their cyber house was that a person didn't choose to be in that situation. But in many circumstances, even about alcohol and other toxic circumstances, a person didn't choose to be in that situation. For example, they don't choose to be full, they don't choose to be going drinking with customers, that will be the order from, for example, the boss, that is not a controllable consequences for individual, that's why they are mainly distinguished, the intoxication defense from other defenses are already not standing in the outside of the house. And also we told you, how many times we have, so that's important. And also we told you in those circumstances, for example, customers are punched by those sales reps, don't care whether people are drunk or not. But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for that consequence is severely different from people who are doing the same thing in the ordinary circumstances. We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility. There will be sentences anyway in our cyber house, but we say there is a slight difference over the responsibility that the individual can take. That should be affecting the sentences the individual will receive in our cyber house."

What we've told from the position that rape is not only a problem about intoxication defence, but there are other things that also evolve when we talk about gender biases etc. We don't deny that, maybe that is a problem we also have fixed. But also what we have conceded, had a concession from our position is that he didn Bob, when we talk about gender biases, etc. We don't deny that. Maybe that is a problem we also have fixed. But also, what we have conceded, had a concession from opposition, is that he didn't deny this idea of gender intoxication and defamation is one part of the big problem that is associated by getting a verdict to defend it already, etc. The problem we have is that there are people who say, that person was drunk, so he raised a human to deserve punishment, but still he deserves a less punishment, a mandatory factor, because it wasn't for himself. When we talk about boss requesting employees to keep drinking for increasing sales salary, he said, well, I'm forcing him to drink a lot in order to increase sales revenue, but part of it is something mandatory. Then he can go and receive a certain less punishment than he actually deserves. We don't really care, keep going on. That is a problem we want to fix. We want people to be responsible by saying even though you were drunk at some point, it was you who made a decision to keep drinking, right, in order to increase ourselves revenue. It was your choice to go outside when you're drinking a medicine that has a strong side effect without having any protection by your family members or any other person, people, or any provider from the state, right. We think those people should be responsible for being a condition that they become drunk or they become addicted by drugs, etc. That is the problem we want to fix. And we have to realise, all this problem of, we're not saying victim can make a sentence, right? That's not what we want to say from Prime Minister, right? What we want to say is that victims should receive a certain level of punishment that they deserve through the criminal. We think that is something justifiable. What we're saying is that the criminal defendant should receive a proportionate punishment that is justified to have, and what we're saying is that it is necessary for the retribution, for the rehabilitation, etc. Meaning, we think it is necessary to give enough punishment. We think that action of being drunk is something that deserves punishment, does not deserve any criminal defense, intoxication defense in any case."

              "text": "So second, let's talk about the most plausible case for opposition, what they have told us. So they told us, their stance was, there are some cases where this intoxication defense may function, right? Well, that's true, but at least we want to hear from them, what are the cases, are there some cases that this intoxication defense is sometimes necessary, right? Unless they're going to do that, I'm just going to say it's sometimes necessary without knowing when it is. Then the first case we heard was, look, it's about medicine that has side effects. We agree that being a disease, there are cases when it wasn't your fault, right? That maybe your body wasn't functioning properly and got a disease. That's true. And you had to drink a medicine. That's true. What we have to recognize, as we have talked to from prime minister, is that if you got drunk and you know that you have a strong side effect, as we explained by a doctor that you have a strong side effect and sometimes you lose conscious maybe, you have to ask someone else's help, right? Because the entire society is not consenting of you walking out with losing your control maybe by the effect of side effect. Other people are not consenting to receive a possible harm by your actions, we don't think other people should be blamed on that point. What we want to blame for those victims, the criminals, is that it was you who knew that a drug could give a side effect at that point. You should have asked, and you could have asked, a help to other people. You could have asked your mom to lock up the door so you don't have to go outside and keep bullying other people, for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather, any other family members, to be with you when you have to go outside or keep bullying other people for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather or any other family members to be with you when you have to go outside to a supermarket to buy a drug for example. So that person can control you when you have used a conscience and may start attacking someone else. There are lots of options that a person could have taken. A person has actually negligence and say I'm not going to take any of those options and they're just going to go out because I want to. And I think actually forgiving a part of it because you because it was a side effect. I couldn't do anything about it even though that person could have done a lot of things to prevent it. That person didn't do it. They think that person deserves the punishment at that point. Your logic was people should be punished without any defenses because you made some decisions that caused crimes in the end. Why don't you maintain insanity defense inciting effects? Because mentally ill people chose to go outside which caused crimes. Well, the distinction here is right, this is the distinction, right? So, when a mentally ill person, right, decided that that person is going to go out, that person, already before going out, does not have a full capability of deciding what's going to happen when they go outside. Or what are the other, like, viable alternatives that that person could take in order to prevent all the possible harm to that person? That's the distinction. Before people become drunk, they're not drunk. Obviously, they have certain constraints that are controlled by them. So that's the distinction between insanity defense or target of people who are mentally ill. Second case was, look, other plausible case was, the boss is going to force them so they have to drink. Firstly, requirement from the boss isn't absolute. If you're going to deny, it's not like you're going to be killed. There are a couple of options you can take. One worst case scenario, just quit. Second option, just go to a harassment center or whatever, just to claim your boss that you're being coerced to do all this alcohol harassment whatsoever. We think that person are more likely to be told, you should not coerce your employees to drink too much. With that person, you're going to be switched because there are lots of problems that are associated with harassment and compliance that are associated in any other country of Western world democracy, including Japan, that it's a wrong thing to keep doing all this harassment, and we should be nice to those employers. We think that very functioned as well. There are lots of options that a person can take. And moreover, if that's necessary, we think that boss should also be coerced into punishment, etc. That person is making those employees lose control by the coercive orders. There are lots of options that customers or employees can take. Obviously, it was not inevitable. It was your choice. And more than that, that person didn't have to keep drinking forever. We have to realize that all these problems often happen when these individuals drink often too much over their capacities that they cannot control anymore. They also had an ability to control how much they can drink in the vast majority of cases, but they didn't do that. They have realised, what the boss told me to do is drink a far lower capacity than I can have in order to create all the problems. We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control in their mind but they didn't choose to and therefore those people deserve punishment. That's why in vast any cases, intoxication defence should not be allowed. It was your fault, you deserve punishment. That's the request."

For example, they're talking about, the first speaker is talking about like the rape culture, etc. Two responses here. The first one was fundamentally it's also nothing to do with the, the this motion based on the, it's obviously that different with that principle level. For the moment we think that the rape culture is obviously the relative with the phaser of the court making particular decision making or not. So even if that, even if it's so significant with that related with, and also after this system, people recognizing that the responsibility or the situation in the toxination, it's rather counterproductive, I think. Because if the last people that, even if you are becoming intoxicated, you have to take responsibility, rather the victim is a break. For example, the majority of the cases of rape culture, is that the responsibility of the victim. Even if you drink so much, but you are in a toxic situation, you have to take responsibility, etc. So that's the situation, it's rather counterproductive to enhancing enhancing rape culture but it's not so much related to this motion anyway so okay that's the only way that it's"

First of all, before they becoming that intoxication, whether or not they can that to become intoxicated or not. So, we think that, as my partner already told you, it's obviously inevitable to become intoxicated. For example, taking medicine or certain pressure from the boss's existence. They don't just quit or just control themselves, etc. So first of all, as I already mentioned, we were also happy to consider that to what extent this pressure is so huge or not. So that we still recognize that even the power harassment is recognized, or sexual harassment is problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it. Some people are forced to do particular action.

So on the occasion, even still, they believe in us. Maybe I can turn into them rationally. Maybe I do not commit crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation. So on the occasion, they easily do that to understand whether I'm rational or not, but still they need to keep their original rights.

For the more you say, if you want to becoming intoxication, you cannot that consider so much. What I mean by this is if you want to become intoxication, you cannot consider so much. What I mean by this is that if you become intoxication, you can understand what that linkage is with your action and what is the consequence of that. So for example, just people who drink too much, so punching something, so they do not understand whether it's damaging this something, or also how to damage themselves. People cannot understand the consequences of their actions. They can imagine that. That's why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people. Because they cannot understand what their actions are and what the consequences are. It's very similar to same way that child defense or the insanity defense, these kind of things. So that's why they do not intentionally that they're committing crimes. They rather just accidentally committing crimes. It's not easy to think that this is a responsibility of that person. So what I told you, first of all, this is a debate about to what extent people have a responsibility. The first of all, we's not easy to avoid becoming an intoxication. The second one is that after becoming an intoxication, people cannot control themselves. That's very simple. That's why we propose."

Firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one's own self-controlled choice that one entered the gate to intoxication. So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, begins from one's choice in the first place. Not only that, the continual substance addiction, or the ongoing process of being addicted, can be avoided, could have been avoided avoided by one's own self-controlled choices, for example going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals and that choice, or that self-controlled choice was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions. So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-toxicated defenders' cases. So we think this is a massive difference of substance addiction, substance intoxication, from other cases such as mental illnesses, because obviously there's no self-control in the process leading to mental illness and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses.

So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control. Also, the fact that we abolished intoxication defence will enhance our ability to deal with such programmes as forcing and persecution related problems. The point is that the way the society approaches crimes expresses the society's view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing to drink is dangerous, time reform is dangerous, and all these evaluations to the options proposed problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated on a daily basis. And we think these kinds of effects don't exist for mental illness, right? We can't warn people against becoming mentally ill. And we think this is a clear distinction."

The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances, and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were causing this situation, because they were telling us that for some minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice. I don't think that's how justice should work. Three questions. Firstly, on is this policy beneficial, or is those benefits justified in taking this policy?

One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in addressing the situation. We're talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice framework, we're talking about investigations and assessing of situations of exceptions in drug cases being highlighted as Scandinavian nations taking more hard criminal sanctions on rape cases where people are doing active things and trying to get away with it. These discussions are happening and these things are gradually changing. I don't necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute because if you are able to put in specific clauses about drunk cases in rape situations, then they achieve their goal. They are arguing at best saying that we should abolish"

Because if it takes the alternative, you don't have to take all, to sacrifice all the alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked about, people who are intoxicated by the time of war and things, and get all their benefits. So I don't know why they're willing to get the trade-off. But even if we concede that they can get the benefit, we argue that criminal justice is about inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation. So ultimately, your attempt to prioritize one specific case for the sake of sacrificing other considerations and other situations is against the basic framework of criminal justice. You're abandoning the attempt to be proportionate and inclusive of a variety of situations and considerations that are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was the clearest substantive from the leader of an opposition. But another even-in-case is that if the point of justice is so distorted by offensive or racial, patriarchal justice and things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help because it's still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and things going on there and you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved. They also said that victims are offended by the attempts to prove that they're not really guilty, and that kind of victim sentiment is something that should matter. We don't think that it's important, because they have not responded to our legal options to stand about how victims' emotions are not considered criminal justice, which is a factual thing. But also importantly, their argument is invalid because if their argument is true, they are saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defence would also keep discussing the victim and that clause of insanity defence ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they had to do this kind of thing, made it disgusting to the victim, so they were willing to abolish that. But that's not how they made the principle of distinction. I don't think that's how, obviously, it should work. So why we think that argument, even if it's beneficial, does not justify taking this policy. So thank you. The last practical thing they said was that crimes increase, we won't deter. We think, obviously, you know, it's this that a 10-year sentence might become an 8-year sentence with the existence of this defense. You have the social sanctions and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it. I don't think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate. But also deterrence is just one part of the clause. So if deterrence is important in that specific case, we might increase the punishment. But there's not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent power clause that exists in the criminal justice system, so I don't know why abolishing makes sense. Sure. Wait, hold on. On to your PO, in your planned and compulsive crime distinction, the intoxication crime is willful on the side closer to planned murder, for example. We think think because... I won't talk about that. We think intoxication climate is akin to willful negligence, if all others is also. Okay, let me deal with that. So, second question."

But also importantly, they say that insanity is okay, but drunk is bad. We think that's a bad argument, because essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally vulnerable and you can't think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational or they are not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances. Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take choice of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware of the risk that they might go kind of mentally unstable and do these acts and they're not willing to impose on these individuals and understand the distinction. And the last point about planned crimes and composite crimes that's important because their argument is technically saying that you drank and you chose that should take the full responsibility distinct from other people that are rational. Meaning that if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the responsibility. Meaning that if you opt into it and know that you would opt into a framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that's technically saying that the well planned crime which you opt into fully and the compulsive crime which you have been compulsively obtained have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that and why you think that. It doesn't matter and it doesn't make sense to take this poll."

But conversely, how about intoxicated individuals? They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but they chose to drink a lot, that would be a conscious choice of individual. They may be aware of some risk at this point, but they didn't choose to buy a knife, they didn't choose to meet a person that they somehow hate, they didn't choose to stab a knife into a person, maybe they even don't remember everything after they actually went drunk. So, toxicated criminals are still very bad people, that's also murder, but they should be sentenced according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate, or those kind of expected risk is very different from cases where individuals are very conscious, very have clear mind to kill someone, there will be some differences."

Maybe you didn't choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early, and you didn't choose that, and you killed someone, and you should be mitigated, right? We think anything then should be a mitigating factor and we think explicitly we said drinking and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously therefore you should not be granted the mitigations, right?

First, is that we think the gang is when a member collectively identifies and adopts a group identity and they create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation. This could look like holding a lot of tattoos, Mr. Speaker, where you collectively identify through group tattoos or any kind of weapons or certain weapons or certain drugs. Secondly, we define what a gang is when the purpose is to literally pursue violence and a crime as a whole organization. And thirdly, we say that in the case that we criminalize gang membership and the police is able to prosecute certain members by identifying that they were part of a gang, we're happy to put them through extensive rehabilitation and at the moment in which they still don't have deep ties with the gang yet. In case that they are deeply involved with the gangs, we'll make sure that they go through rehabilitation and they're not part of gang culture such as in countries like America, and make sure that they cut absolutely every single tie with the gangs for the sake of crime."

Secondly, I'm going to be talking about why this is a just and necessary policy. And thirdly, I'll be talking about why we decrease crime. Quickly, on terms of the criteria to criminalize, we say that if we prove this criteria applies for the sake of gang membership, we should take this debate. We think criminalization comes with two metrics. First, is that if we ensure that criminalization is able to deter the occurrence of crime. That's why, for instance, we criminalize guns in a lot of nations because we think that guns are deeply correlated with the actions of crimes, even when guns aren't literally the sake of crimes. But just because in terms of correlation, we think that when criminalization deters crime, we think that is okay. And secondly, we think it is important to protect the sustenance of society and make sure that society is a more safer and more sustainable place for innocent citizens to live on. If we prove that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter crime or prove that society is going to be a better place, we should take this debate. With this in mind, I'm going to talk about my positive manner."

              "text": "First, let's talk about why this is a just and necessary policy. I have two layers in this argument. First, let me contextualize what gang members first do. We concede that membership does not equal violence, Mr. Speaker, but we say that gangs are inherently about committing violence and committing crimes. I think that the fact that you are trying to opt into this cycle and this organization of violence in and of itself is self-indicative of the fact that you are interested in crime, that you want to commit crimes or you want to steal someone or you want to brutally murder someone or you want to rape someone. I think the criminal justice system is there in order to prevent any incentive to commit crimes. And we think that on our side, it's more important to stop before actual casualties happen. How do we see this in the current status quo? It comes like we prevent strangers from looking around schools because just the fact that you might be a pedophile isn't necessary and trying to prevent it before any kind of pedophile takes action on the children in and of itself is important. Similarly, we think this is analogous to this motion because we say that in the case of gangs, we think just the fact that they were gangs is enough evidence that they're probably going to commit crimes in the future. And we want to prevent any kind of casualties from happening. We think that based on this we think we should win But second layer is that we think that in the many there's a many cases We're usually used or juveniles or course into this system given this We think our side is gonna be much better at preventing coercion Why is this because we think the coercion by force in it of itself is firstly an unjust principle That we should allow these people who are, who have the course by using this illegality and this criminalization as an excuse to prevent entering this gang in the first place. We think that given the youth and juveniles usually enter gangs because of this, just like mild nuance that like, Hey, being, being a part of a gang is cool, especially in countries like Mexico or Columbia, we are able to prevent this because we think that by the state in and of itself saying that gang membership is something illegal, that it is dangerous, we think that youth and juveniles, first of all, won't have any incentives to go on, but secondly, they won't be able to be coerced as much because these other gang members know that they themselves are in a predicament where they can be arrested and have their futures taken away. Given this, we think that it is just as necessary, because first, we have to prevent future crimes and deterrence. And I think that the fact that you are in a gang means that you're more likely to commit a crime than not doing so. Give me a second. And that the comparative is that it's too late on their side, because you can only arrest gangs at the moment in which they do commit a crime, where there are actual casualties, where there's going to be raped victims murdered victims or any kind of casualties in general taken all right so if so if you're going to say that criminalizing is going to be a deterrent why there are a lot of some drug smugglers or doing other like frauds even your minors and even you're going to be arrested if you did some of these kind of things.

First is that we actually reduced gangs in the first place. And I'm sure, like, just in the POI, opposition might say it has no effect. The reason why this is effective is for two reasons. First is because I think the fact the state is saying that it is dangerous in and of itself is important. They talked about in the case of scams, but we're able to decrease that because we're saying that even trying to be a part of an organization that does scam in the first place is bad. Given in the status quo, there's not enough deterrence."

Because there are a lot of people, like the people who are doing cooking or others, it doesn't commit a crime. Or secondly, we say that other people, and secondly, we say that it is very vague until who you're going to punish. It is very vague for it. And we think it is unjust to punish something. Even the criteria is very vague. We like to go to our argument because we finished our point. No, thank you. All right."

              "text": "Going to our argument, we have three things to talk. Firstly, we like to talk about the fundamental ideology of punishing individuals. No, thank you. the crime. For example, the cooks, or the people who are cleaning the room, or like that. These people doesn't come in and harm others, or doesn't do something wrong. And some people also didn't know the truth that they cleaned the room of the gangs, or like that. So we think these things are unjust for three reasons. One is that there are the cases that you didn't know. For example, the Yamiye Yomondai or like other cases. Even these people don't know. We say that some kind of like crooks or like other people are going to like be criminalized because you did something for the gang or like other things in their paradigm, right? We think that it is ridiculous because they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill anybody. They didn't rape somebody, or like that, but they're going to be punished. We think that it is, you know, secondly, we say, and secondly, we say that the criteria is very vague, so we think that it's going to isolate these people. Because if we say, like, other people want to help these people who are in the gang, and they want to go out of the gang. However, if these people are going to, like, help these individuals in the gang, maybe, well, if the police are going to have those, like, stigmatizations, then the people who are related to these, like, gang members have the possibility of being a gang membership, we think that these people have the possibility to be punished. And because of this, the other people are going to have more hardship to help these people, right? We say that because of this, we think that it is actually not going to be a deterrent, but rather these people are going to be in these gangs, and no one is going to help them. We think it is very harmful. The third reason is that, principally, we think that if you did something wrong, we think that these people should not be punished. For example, if you didn't kill somebody, or if you didn't do some kind of crime, we think that these individuals should not have any kind of any kind of like punishment or like death right and people have to have the right to have and have the right to not to have like criminalization or like others we like to talk and we like talking"

              "text": "our second point all right our second point is the rehabilitation just needs to infect the underlying and underling to cause more crimes all right so so firstly, now in the present situation, we say that the rehabilitation just just forced these individuals to do more like work or like the simple work or like other things and it's not going to be a fundamental solution for this, right? And moreover, we say that it is causing more harm because even now, there are two people. One is the people who have rehabilitated. Second is the people who have not rehabilitated. Even though they did all the terms of the corporations are not going to accept these people because they're going to prioritize the name value or other things. And we say that these profit seekers are going to know, going to try to see for what kind of things they did at task including these criminal records. So, actually, if they become an applicant, these corporations, if actually not taking, not going to adapt these people into their companies, actually, this rehabilitation is not working well. This means that these people are going to be excluded from the society. So, what is going to happen? We say that these criminals are going to have more unionized cases and they are going to do more crimes. Because they don't have any weight or like any kind of like work, we think that these people have more possibilities that they're going to commit more crimes, or like make more like organized crimes or like organized gangs. And actually we think that this is going to make a vicious cycle which leads to more crimes because these organized gangs are going to do more crimes because they want to have money like drug smuggling or like others and we think that it is very harmful and certainly we like to talk that how and these things it's not going to and even now and even though they are going to criminalize we think that this is not going to be a fundamental solution. Because if it's going to be something like the organized crime now or in the future, we think that the people who are going to be arrested is only the underling, the lower position people who are the minors or who are the low position members. And we think that these people are going to be arrested. But if it's going to be an organized crime, it is very hard to know who is the top leader or where is the top leader now and we think that because of this these people are not are going to are going to put all of these crimes to these lower member people and these lower member people are going to make more crimes in future that's actually why we're going to say that these things are not never going to be solved and it's going to increase the crime that's actually why we're going to oppose.

However, as we all know, the police are always trying to disassemble those gangs by trying to find those crimes that they commit. So there's this contradiction between the government and the police. doesn't directly say that the gangs are out of law, the police is taking action that clearly shows that gangs is not under the law. And this is creating a confusion within the public, especially to the juvenile, as our first speaker briefly mentioned. Because the government is standing on an unstable and unclear stand, the public do not have this strong understanding that being a gang member is a crime. But if we take this motion, this will change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime. But if we take this motion, this would change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime without conscience, and there's no doubt within it. Because we know, because the government is clearly stating that it is a crime, it is a crime to kill someone. And so this will apply similarly to this case too. And if the government clearly shows that being a gang member is a crime, well, eventually, even the young will eventually know and understand clearly that being a gang member is a crime."

And also, it may be questionable whether a gang member actually committed a crime. Well, it is true that not every single member of gangs does not commit crime. However, if we compare the possibility of committing crime between a gang member and a non-gang member, no, and as I first, as I clearly stated in the first, in the beginning of my speech, our purpose is to prevent the future crimes. And by banning the action that comes before committing a crime, which is becoming a gang member, we will be able to decrease the number of crimes, even if we may be able to decrease the number of crimes, even if we may be not sure whether the person was actually going to commit a crime after being a gang member.

And this is the problem in the in in in mostly in japan so and this those people have almost never mind to become the member right because um they they will they will have interest by by their like like not like like they they might they might have have like like saying something about good for themselves by some some strange religion but this happens same in the invitation of gang organization? Because gang wants members to expand their activity. So if we take this motion, we have to criminalize these people who have less or no feeling to commit a crime, commit crimes, or even become a member of the gang, right? So we have to, government have to protect them because they're almost victims. So gang wants members to expand their activities. So they might, they will invite invite many people that do want the member of the gang will say this organization is not a bad organization. So if we take this motion, these cases will occur so many times. So we can't protect them by taking this motion."

So, first of all, they can, they think that they can decrease criminals by taking this motion, and they can prevent crimes by taking this motion. But there's lots of gang organizations, and by taking this motion, we might criminalize the member of the gang a few but this is much harder more like because these people who are arrested mostly are in the low position as first speaker has said so they have less will to do crimes than people who are in the top of organization and sometimes the people who are in the low position have strong will, but the people who have less will are existence. So if those people are in the prison, those people or more wicked people are in the prison, right? So we think we cannot put them who had the member of the gangs in their old life, right? So they will return to the society in the future. So, as the first speaker has explained that we, like, if we take this motion, we will make the network between criminals by having community with them, right? So they said that by taking this motion, it is very safe and sustainable. But if you take this emotion, we will... Will the crime decrease by taking this emotion? No, right? No, because they will make networks and know what's the crime or what's the good way to do crimes by not to know by the police or something like that? So this occurs that people commit crimes again. So their purpose was to prevent future crimes. But our side is more better because as I said, it is an important way or an exacting way to protect this society by taking this. But even if you take this notion, we can't eradicate the real organization. That's what the first speaker has to say, right? So for this reason, we would like to oppose. Thank you."

The fact that they didn't respond to this is a concession that these gangs are dangerous and that we have to stop them and they concede that in the case of violent gangs it is necessary to criminalize gang membership. At the moment in which they failed in replying to any of our arguments about this community of violence we think they dropped their argument that gangs are fundamentally dangerous that we ought to prosecute them. But secondly is that the only reply we got was that there could be gangs that clean up rooms i think this is a pretty inaccurate description of what a gang is right like i think the only time these gangs are going to clean up room is when they murdered someone in the room and they're having to clean it up but let's assume that these gangs can be like so fluffy that they're just like maybe their only intent is to hold like a tea party and just eat cookies let's take this but we think that this argument still like neglects the premise and the incentive of these members who want to enter gangs we think the incentive of these gang members are to commit violence are to commit crimes youth who are potentially cursed or youth who are just interested in this slavish ways of violence and crimes. We think that if you want to just clean up rooms, it's much better on the counterfactual. Where on our side, we're still going to provide things like regulated government offices where if you want to clean up stuff, you can enter the Red Cross or UNICEF. And I think this is much better on their side, regardless of what incentive there is. It's better than some unregulated, potential dangerous, unorganized group. We think that counterfactual is good. Look, the comparison is that even if it is vague, that is not a reason why you have to oppose criminalization. Although, for instance, we do criminalize hate speech in a lot of countries, even if the metric of hate is pretty subjective and vague. We think that this ignores opposition. The reason why we are able to criminalize gangs, even if it is vague, because we think on our side, we include courts in the equation of criminalization, which opposition absolutely neglected. That is that we think that courts are able to at least determine what is violent and what is not through the legislative procedure. And that's why we're able to criminalize hate speech. And we think this mirrors the logic and we think that we're able to criminalize gang membership because we do have this final barrier that is able to determine what is violence, what is not. And I gave you a very explicit model in the first place of what a gang is. So it simply wasn't enough, and their whole 50-minute speeches absolutely drops, because this metric of vagueness is not a reason to oppose the criminalization of gang membership. Just in the same way that we have to look at incentive, and we prosecute attempted murder, and not murder, but the intent of committing murder is in and of itself important. So the incentive of committing crimes is enough reason of criminalizing. So the incentive of committing crimes is enough reason of criminalizing gang membership in the first place. Therefore, we think that their whole argument is false. Let's look at the more important question then. Occurrence of crime."

Given that gangs are going to exist, we think that companies have a certain right to know whether they were a gang member or not. Look, just imagine the top gang of Mexico, which is the Sinaloa cartel, to be a part of a company of a gun shop, Mr. Speaker. We think that in these cases, they're still going to be much worse because companies don't know they're hiring literal criminals inside their like pretty dangerous like organization, which holds like handles weapons, for instance. Or just imagine an organization of like scammers, of a gang that only commits to use some burglaries to enter a very important like finance company, we think like Golden Sacks, right? We think that's bad because companies have a certain right to know that they have to protect other employees who are not gangs. And on their side, we think that it's simply, we think that it's good that companies do know if they're gangs or not, because that's literally the point of criminalization, right? To ensure the benefit of society. They weren't able to engage with this. However, let's say that we still want these criminals to employ these ex-convicts, right? Why is this better on our side? Because we think just in the same way we do for juvenile, we could just hide their identity up. That is, that we don't allow criminal companies to give access to criminal records. And on our side, we're telling you that we're going to give rehab, job training, and community sentencing. We think this is more than enough incentive for companies to employ them in the first place.

They're forced into a community of hatred and violence. And we think just in terms of broken window theory, which is that if you are in a community of violence, you're more likely to commit violence. We think that rehabilitation isn't effective because you're surrounded by a lot of people who commit crimes. Just in the same way that if you're holding an anger management class, but you're literally forced into this gang or gang community and seeing like a lot of fights every day, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective. On our side, we told you, so we separate them from these groups because we like, we take them out of the equation of gangs at the moment in which they try to to enter so they still don't have deep ties with these gang members yet therefore we're able to prevent them from holding deep ties and allowing them a better integrating society by having a lot of rehabilitation so we think that in terms of rehabilitation and reintegrating we do it better on our side look the failure of opposition was that they weren't able to provide any reason why the whole existence and accepting gang members to be in society is actually able to deter crime.

There's two prongs here. First, on necessity, we tell you that in the status quo, ex-cons are largely discriminated against. In the status quo, the reason ex-cons can't join the police in the first place is because there exists a narrative and stigma that they're all extremely violent but the principled reason for the justice system to exist is reintegration and therefore they have an obligation to extend mechanisms for reintegrations that are lacking in the status quo and counter this stigma this means that even if this measure is ineffective, it is principally legitimate and therefore creates a condition in which the government best fulfills its mutual obligations towards citizens, towards ex-comvicts. The impact here, panel, lies in the idea of safeness. Crimes don't always occur in vacuums. Criminals are not inherently bad people who intend to commit crimes due to contextual conditions of injustice. Everyone has a right to be recognized as dignified enough to apply for a job, and this dignity tends to materialize in beneficial things for ex-convicts."

              "text": "In Portugal, drug addicts were given jobs at the peak of their addiction, and for that reason, they reintegrated effectively into society, they picked themselves up, and 98% of them ended up quitting jobs. We think the mechanisms for people to reintegrate have to be proposed by the government. This narrative is especially significant because it humanizes conflicts, it gives them tools to achieve the very things that they have and in here in their human condition and it limits justifications of violence against them simply because they are ex-convicts note in the status quo this causes conditions of unpunished police brutality for instance that cannot continue to go unchecked because this mechanism is separate from effectiveness palin you must weigh it significantly because we proved two things one why this improved the police force but two why in principle this was so beneficial because it dignified criminals and it helped them materialize their humanity yet further if ex-cons can join we think this measure creates three significant benefits one convex are re-indicated because the institution that oppressed them allowed them to enter it no this creates a unique tipping point towards breaking the stigma because the institution in charge of protecting you as an individual tells you it's okay the institution you charge you with your life with the institution your trust is telling you that ex-cons are trustworthy as well. Panelists is a unique voting condition because this debate's biggest impacts lie on ex-cons on our side. We clearly benefit from them the most because even if they're rejected from this job, they have marginally better conditions for them in day-to-day society due to this destigmatization. But second, ex-cons are likely to be less stigmatized because police officers are constantly in contact with them. They know that they're people, they have seen successful conditions of rehabilitation. We think for this reason, it's likely that this job is beneficial for them. And for this reason, we think that if you want ex-cons to be better off, you vote proposition. I'll take your POI before I go into second. Yeah, what does the speaker think is the main reason why these ex-cons would want to join the police force? We tell you that ex-cons on both sides of the house are disenfranchised and lack opportunities. We think that's the mechanism on why they want to apply. We tell you that for that reason, giving them additional benefits to go in is significant, but we also think that there is a measure of reivindication. These people want to show society that they are worthy of respect and are therefore also likely to join in the first place. We'll prove to you in this second substantive why this measure improves the police force. We tell you that allowing ex-convicts to apply creates four beneficial conditions. One, society now perceives the police as open to change and adjusting to the changing needs and narratives of societal behaviors. This occurs separately than if people want to apply or not apply. These benefits aren't contingent and therefore opposition can apply them as so. Even if this measure is ineffective, it still incentivizes an institution like the police to begin adjusting systems that have been historically oppressive. Simply, panel, the condition of the justice system becoming more malleable is beneficial because it can marginally better serve society when it's open to feedback, when on our side it is not seen as a historical institution that never moves, but as something that can adjust to changing needs of society. Second, the justice system for the first time receives feedback. For true justice, the system needs to be constructed and serve the individuals it affects the most. We think principally the justice system falls when it ends up harming disenfranchised individuals more in a retributive justice scenario. On our side, one of the justice system's biggest actors, the police, are now accepting ex-convicts. In principle, here, the justice system gives them back the very condition of humanity that they lost, regardless of effectivity. This is why you vote proposition. On our side, you're constructing a system that serves the individuals it oppressed. Opposition needs to justify why the status quo is enough when it definitely isn't. Practically, in the status quo, having ex-cons allows policemen to have greater checks on problematic behavior when they enter these spaces. A marginal benefit proposition is unable to materialize, especially when we understand that policemen have become increasingly oppressive. But third, as ex-cons become increasingly integrated in the long term, we think criminals' viewpoints help the institution materialize systems for equity. Panel, these are the most effective because they directly respond to a context and condition of people who understand what the system lacks. So even if these changes are very small, they're very effective for this condition. Even in our worst case scenario where this measure creates backlash, final, we think you weigh here on scale. Improving an institution that serves the entirety of society, the police who today are not fulfilling their principled obligation towards those they're designed to serve will always outweigh backlash or even a societal condition of this trust that can be created in our worst case scenario because in the long term we have greater mechanisms for correction of this mistrust as these institutions are constantly subject to feedback and are open towards responding to the necessities of citizens and of those it oppresses for justice this is a clear proposition ballot."

And finally, on this idea that cops will actually become less oppressive or that the institution of the police force will become less oppressive. So firstly, on their model, look, they characterize themselves and pay close attention to how they did this, that the majority of people in prison were in jail for violent crime and that like the people who would be accepted into the police force needed to fill fulfill these like extenuating circumstances look i don't think they can out frame and get away with squirreling the motion just to saying that it's going to be a minority of these ex-commons that are going to be the only ones that have access to joining these like these institutions because that already like removes up the ability for them to access the majority of their benefits as to why the majority of ex-commons are going to be able to reap the benefits of this change right so look they need to bite the bullet on this because if the majority of criminals are all like in jail for like violent crime then that also means that the majority of ex-cons will be in the police because that needs to be proportional to the ones in jail right like violent crime then that also means that the majority of ex-cons will be in the police because that needs to be proportional to the ones in jail right like that's very crucial and even the ones and pay close attention to this when they're saying that the ones that are turned away like look we're going to say that like if the majority are turned away then it's literally symmetrical to the status quo or like there isn't any in the in the police force but the only change on side propositions house is that hey you get more wasted resources with the whole like application process and needing to interview all of them. But more importantly, it's going to build more resentment, and it's going to build more stigma, which is the very benefit that they're trying to claim. Look, we flip that because we're telling you that when the majority of ex-cons were trying to access and be part of the police force are turned away because they did very bad things and they committed violent crimes then that's going to be a problem because that's only going to create more stigma for the prisoners that weren't able to access those and those are going to be perceived worse in society because they were not given the chance at like at retribution by joining these institutions that's why we feel we get more stigma and more resentment inside propositions house look they're claiming also that they're going to humanize these people but they can't claim humanizing if most of them get turned away because again you get that increased stigma to those and and also i'm going to clash this with a lot of my substantive on why we actually get more humanization with the exclusive alternatives that we get on our side but finally on this idea that cops are actually less oppressive in their world look first of all we think that these like idea that cops can only become less oppressive if you're allowing ex-cons like work at like as part of them is false we think that they're like painting a very false dichotomy here we think that actually we can get like the institutions to be like less oppressive still within our alternative because you're giving ex-cons the ability to effect more change and more on that later but you're also going to get this idea that like um cops need to uphold the rule of law and they need to stand for that and the public needs to see that they will always be upholding like a high standard of the rule of law because people who are cops firstly needed to respect the law as citizens and then as cops right so under this idea we're going to be clashing a lot but look first of all"

              "text": "let me get into some points of framing like why do people commit crime first and foremost look there are three different types of criminals firstly we're going to talk about the ones that like are actually malicious and they're intense they benefit and they want to benefit from crime and they have no remorse and therefore they have this incentive to join the police force because it gives them a leg up and my partner will be specifically dealing with that second of all we have people who may not be bad but they've made bad decisions be it because they have little discipline because they have a short fuse or they're highly emotional and that leads them to making very bad actions with high repercussion we think that the police by nature of their job needs to be very calm and very like even tempered because that's what allows them to do a good job and finally we think that there are people who like they said in their own characterization have grown up around entrenched poverty, and then we're pushed into doing that. With that being said, the second point of clash here is that the police have access to a lot of like information rich confidential records, resources and insider information that will specifically be dealt with in that second speech. And finally, this idea of stigma, look, we agree that whether unfounded or not, like people generally have poor, like poor views or perceptions of criminals. And that's because politicians have incentives to be tough on crime. That's because the media likes to sensationalize the worst kinds of crime. And we think that that's like exceptionally, and that's a truth in the status quo, whether proposition wants to or not. Look, the stance here is that the main metric or motivator for ex-commits, like they said, they wanna redeem themselves in the eyes of the public because they wanna be helpful and they wanna be be useful we think that that is only up like that can only happen in our side of the house where they aren't part of the police force because of two or three arguments from side proposition the first is this idea of public trust and how it's based on existing perceptions and second of all why they can't actually help combat them in side props only under our alternatives and finally we're going to be talking about why it facilitates crime look sec this first argument on like public trust and the frame the premise here is the framing that we gave you on stigma and why people are already unlikely to trust cops so when people see that the very ex-convicts the ones that are like guilty of disrupting society take jobs in these very high stakes position you get that one their decreased trust in the institutions that put them there in the first place but second of all there's a decreased trust then in the police force that is built of of ex-convicts as well because the people that are meant to protect them that can't live uh the people that are meant to protect like can't actually live up to their very same promises because they were the same people who were disrupting their society to begin with whether it's true or not there we do think that there can be some ex-convicts with good intentions but people are not going to perceive it as that and that's why you get a fall in like this trust in the key part of the like law enforcement system and that's why you see like an emergence of like saving vigilantism or people who don't trust the cops so they take matters into their own hands and that becomes like that creates a very chaotic society and that like means like a myriad of harms in that sense before i move on yes a very quick point on what on your side what safety nets do ex-cons have to reintegrate that's literally my second point so don't worry about it i'm getting there and second of all let's talk about trust within"

What happens when the person next to them used to be the person in front of them? That creates for a very mistrusting environment and panel, this is very crucial. So when police officers can't trust each other, not only does it risk their lives lives but it prevents them from actually doing a good job and even from the perspective of the ex-convict they're going to build more resentment because even if they have good intentions and they want to do a good job the rest of their colleagues aren't going to believe that and that's why they build a very strong resentment against their colleagues or the people that they're supposed to be wanting to help and that's going to be very bad for these stakeholders but second of all on this idea where they can't actually help and these safety nets that team mexico was asking me about look what do vulnerable people um like in who like might be susceptible to crime respond to best and that's i think the very powerful thing that ex-convicts can do is prevent crime before it happens especially or like exclusively outside of the like police force in the first place look when you get a cop for example or like people who say are in these areas that are like filled with like entrenched crime they see cops again with a lot of stigma because of the like harms that they've been done right they see them as racial profilers they have a very bad perception of cops within these communities that are wrong that have been wronged by them so when they see someone who is part of their community and instead joins them, they see them as traitors or as someone who, like, by their own job needs to put them behind bars because they were forced to commit crimes that they may or may not be in agree with. But that's period, right? Like, these ex-cons will still have to put them behind bars. So they can't be able to reach them or they can't be able to build trust. Or alternatives, for example, like being part of therapy, of counseling, of motivational speaking. This is very important and exclusive to our house because of the fact that they're able to help them so much more because they're more likely to reach the very people that feel disenfranchised and that feel like they can't trust the police in their status quo.

I think they needed more analysis to warrant this huge, huge impact. But let's talk about the trust that people have. We already gave you a way off from first proposition that I want to highlight very clearly. On our side, sure, maybe in the beginning, people are not going to trust the police. But we think that when you are normalized and when more convicts are actually accepted into the police force, then the fact that there's more people that are ex-police are normalizing the fact that these individuals are key workers within the police force, I think in the long-term, we can get that trust.

I think I would first note that there's no exclusivity of that point, right? Because they tell you counseling exists, it helps ex-convicts. If that already exists in the status quo, that is a mechanism that is parallel, that is not a benefit for their side. But I would say even if exclusive counselling exists on their side of the house,"

              "text": "I think the fact that you are giving them a job opportunity is a bigger benefit. The fact that you are recognised as someone to be given and worthy of a job, which is very, very different than in the status quo, where you are painted as someone who does harm and is an aggressor, you are not given a second chance. But I want to then bring back the first argument on reintegration and why the principle was so important, because they completely just dropped the principled obligation of the justice system. Because if they themselves recognize that the point was to prevent harm, then preventing harm is to make sure that people are reintegrated or actually rehabilitated and can function within society. We understand that ex-convicts aren't perfect, but on our side, we have better checks and balances for these individuals when they're reintegrated within society, maybe have a place in a police force, are checked and balanced due to like having a job that requires like mental and physical capabilities. We think on our side, you have better mechanisms to treat and make sure that these ex-convicts are doing the best that they can. I think the strategic value of this question is that we prove the necessity of the policy, right? Like why this is so necessary while in the status quo, you are simply leaving behind the most vulnerable individuals who require a job, who require redemption, who require an opportunity. Let's then move into our third argument on societal perceptions, where we'll prove to you that these harmful, harmful negative stigmatized views of ex-convicts are enhanced on our side this is directly going to engage on the worst case scenario that opposition wants to paint you on why they're going to continue to be stigmatized continue to have resentment we think that the problem in the status quo as both sides agree is the fact that these convicts are perpetuated and seen as aggressors not reliable actors but is the fact that these convicts are perpetuated and seen as aggressors not reliable actors, but also the fact that these police force and these individuals are machines of abuse. I think there's two key ways that we change such societal perception. The first thing is that if these individuals actually join the workforce, they're legally finding to be protectors. They go through the training, are taught to be safeguarding society, the role they take on as a police officer, marginally increases and benefits the societal perception that currently exists in the status quo i think the very fact that they applied to the job in the first place knows that they at least want to have a job keep it therefore we'll actually make sure that they're safeguarding policies that they're going and aligning with what is necessary for the job but secondly on our side we do think we stem, we can humanize the police force, right? Because you are more likely to add nuance to the type of people that are included and represented within the police force. These individuals, ex-convicts are directly those who have felt the impact of the justice system. We think that when they're included, when they're represented within the workforce, that humanizes them rather than just simply seeing as corrupt seeing them abusive as in the status quo i think in our absolute worst case scenario where these individuals are violent at least they are part of a workforce where they can be held accountable can be seen by the public eye i think that wins us even in our worst case scenario we proved you the necessity of this we proved you why ex-convicts absolutely left with no alternatives we are so proud to propose i thank the second proposition speaker no worries spain i know it's"

              "text": "First, I want to talk about the decision that makes Team Spain's path to the ballot extremely complicated in this debate, and it's in regards to the counter mechanism they bring. Two errors here. The first one is that they never warrant why this is exclusive, and this was even conceded by the second speaker, meaning that all of the benefits they claim on their side of the house can be easily absorbed for hours and therefore this mechanism, thank you very much, helps us a lot. But note that they bank their case on alternatives like quotas and counseling, yet never explain to you how they disappear on our side. We think that this is incredibly important. But secondly, they never take into account that they'll never improve a status quo that they themselves criticize, that they themselves characterize as harmful, that they themselves concede have stigma, have no opportunities for convicts, and still these mechanisms of counseling and all this aren't enough to fix it. That is precisely why we're proposing this motion. That is precisely why you only have a marginal case that we can largely absorb so let's go on to the first question which is under what side of the house do we have better conditions for ex-convicts they told you that ex-convicts if they don't get into these jobs they will be resented first we believe that they're more recent under your side of the house because they get no opportunity whatsoever to apply to these jobs. I think that therefore the mechanism and the narrative that you're sending under your side of the house is that no one that has stepped into jail deserves a place in a job in the justice system. I think this is a lot more detrimental, and that is one mechanism in which you get more resentment under their side of the house. But then they told you that the solution they propose is counseling as and therapy note that these aren't mechanisms of reintegration these are mechanisms of rehabilitation and i think that therefore whenever they never prove to you why ex-convicts are likely to have access to opportunities like basic jobs under their side of the house, I don't think they can win the debate because they never explain to you how they're likely to reintegrate under their side of the house. But lastly, they brought to a third argument on increased crime in which they essentially talked to you about this ex-convicts having access to guns and information and how dangerous that is for society. society first this is our complete worst case scenario a worst case scenario in which you literally ignore the mechanism we gave to you in which this ex-convicts have to go through processes like background checks have to go through mental health checks etc we think that therefore we largely mitigate this risk when we have these kinds of mechanisms implemented under our side of the house. But secondly, if they want to claim that counselling is so good and so effective under their side of the house, then we can largely assert that these ex-convicts are being rehabbed effectively, and therefore the possibility of them doing these kinds of actions is very small, taking them at their highest ground, where those alternatives are even slightly better on their side of the house. I think that's in the moment in which we can appropriate this analysis and tell you that because of that rehab process they're less likely to like reintervene."

              "text": "But lastly, we talked to you about the importance of having a job. We talked to you about like an experiment done in Portugal, where they set drug dealers to have jobs and they stopped being involved in these types of crimes. Why? Because having a job, it's having a form of literally being busy with something that isn't crime, of literally learning to coexist with other individuals. We think that therefore, because they never proved to you a single mechanism as to how they will get jobs for these people they can't claim any of these impacts but what did we tell you in regards to this we brought to your first argument on ex-convicts in which we told you at first they're in a space in which they're less likely to be stigmatized why because policemen believe in the power of the justice system, because policemen are less likely to stigmatize like this ex-convicts whenever they have seen success stories of convicts that have come out of jail successfully and that have like undergone trauma and still were able to thrive. Therefore, we understand that if these people get in, the kinds of jobs we can guarantee are a lot better because they're marginally exposed to less stigma to whatever job opposition wants to claim these people can get in. But secondly, even if no one gets into these jobs and they're rejected, we believe that those that don't get into the justice system will be benefited because they're seen as valuable people because the police forces are sending a narrative in which they're telling society as a whole that these people can be recruited for these kinds of very important jobs i think that therefore this has a trickle-down effect in which if the police forces trust so much on these people to be able to have an important job, such as being a policeman, then it is very likely that they trickle down into other kinds of jobs, into other kinds of industries, because the institution provides this trust, because the institution tells society that these people are valuable."

You've been running up and down your bench that the, like, it's exclusive benefits of, like, reintegrating is exclusive only under your model, and yet you're trying to take away the benefits of alternatives. So which is it? Is it exclusive to making them part of the police force or not? We think that what you're confusing is that you're literally giving us an alternative rehabilitation, which is something that we also have on the our side of the house. Reintegration is the exclusive part. So, secondly, under what side of the house does the justice system become more efficient? They brought to a first argument on public trust in which they told you at a they're going to get access to extremely confidential information first literally the way the justice system works is that they go up rankings and therefore they start getting more important cases when they prove themselves as trustworthy this is not only something that happens with convicts this is something that happens with literally every single person that gets into the police forces. We think that this wouldn't like stopping the case on the other side of the house. But secondly, we tell you that these policemen get trained and therefore they have mechanisms of checks and balances to prevent leakages, even in our worst case scenario. I think we outweigh this because they're basing themselves on an extremely small probability. But then they talk to you about decreased trust in the institutions. They talk to you about how trust in the institutions. They talk to you about how the public has no trust. We believe that the trust towards the police isn't very big in the status quo. Both teams can see that in the moment in which they give the characterization on vigilante groups already existing in the status quo. So therefore, even in their best"

We put a second argument on the justice system, in which we told you at first, this justice systems are more likely to be open for change in the sense that now ex-convicts have a right to be heard because they literally belong to the institution. They can criticize jail. They can criticize all the things they went through when they are a part of the institution and the institution legitimizes them. But even if this wasn't the case, we talked to you about the importance of having insight in the mind of criminals. We understand that particularly in the example they bring to us of cartels in Latin America, information that former cartel members can give on these kinds of cartels is extremely valuable. We think this is something worth fighting for because the police in the status quo is ending with mechanisms that actually promote justice. We bring it back thank you"

              "text": "For example, in the United States, we see constantly increasing levels of African Americans participating in the police force. This is something that we generally support, but we do not support these people being convicted criminals. Look, the idea of like being able to give feedback to the justice system. This is something which ex-convicts are able to do without having access to the police force. I would also note that the police force is largely disconnected from the justice system and the courts, so we don't necessarily understand the mechanism. That's exactly why once they're like a low-level police officer, they would suddenly be able to like reform the justice system. I would argue that acting as someone who like, you know, like fights for this justice like outside of the police force would be far more effective. But also look at this situation here. Look, sorry about like not misunderstanding the idea of 80% of violent criminals, but even 20% of violent criminals who get freed from jail, it's still realistically a lot. I wanna contrast this with the idea of the model of being able to turn people down. So we have two different scenarios here. The first of all, is that even if it's a small number, some number of violent criminals are now in charge of enforcing the law. Look, you're unable to like filter out all of these violent criminals with the vague model that Mexico gives you. The idea of saying that they go through a training program or go through a legally binding process is not enough to mitigate the harms of violent criminals who are likely able to get into the police force with this model regardless. Or you have the alternative here of so many people getting turned away because you have a fear of violent criminals being on the police court force so you are not able to access the benefits from proposition because you cannot change the perceptions or access the benefits if the police like if ex-convicts are not being hired at extremely high rates look at the like exclusive harms we bring you though first of all is the opportunity cost and like a waste of resources if you're just turning people down, that's like minor. But secondly now is the stigma that increases for ex-convicts who are turned away and are not allowed to access this job. If they want to look at stigma, I would argue that the stigma is far worse for these people who now get turned down. If violent criminals are such a big problem, I would argue that that number will likely be very high. But secondly, the thing I want to touch on here is why people join the police force in the first place. So generally speaking, you have two reasons. Firstly, you have people who are well-intentioned, and secondly, you have people who are malicious. I'll touch on why malicious people are obviously bad in my substantive, but let's look at well-intentioned people. First to note that Mexico gives a substantive argument on people being well-intentioned in the police force, which like drops all of our announcements we give you in first and does not directly clash with it. What do we tell you? That even well-intentioned police officers if their ex-convicts are unlikely to help people on the ground because of the hierarchy that you see when they interact with people which is to say it's unlikely you shift perceptions when the person that is the like police officer trying to persist those perceptions on the ground level is to not commit crime and like that sorts of thing or is someone who has power over you, who has the ability to arrest you, this is unlikely to meet like the like universal like respect level that is necessary to shift perceptions on the ground. We would argue that things like therapy, things like counseling, things like, you know, like motivational speaking are far more effective at accessing those benefits because that power imbalance does not exist. But I also want to touch on this idea of trust, which is very important. Look, Mexico essentially asserts that these people are going to be trusted this assertion is not enough for them to win this debate because look at the harmful perceptions of conflicts which exist convicts which exist in society and what is the mechanistic reason for this because the justice system tells people who are ex-convicts that they are bad people and even if it's not true this perception does exist therefore the difference is now that this lack of trust so like the difference in the status quo between like convicts in general and complex specifically in the police force is that trust gets extended to the police force which requires public trust to function and lastly this idea here of long-term trust they don't really mechanize why this is the case look i think this is likely untrue because the resentment from police officers who put their lives on the line to convict criminals now they have to work alongside but also the idea that this doesn't work with society is the knowledge that criminals exist is enough to lose public trust and also because of the fact that interactions with cops firstly are very rare so perceptions on a societal level are unlikely to shift and secondly these people do not know that the cops were ex-criminals when they interact with them therefore they are unable to shift perceptions on the ground level all of those benefits they are unable to access on their side of the house note that the society is a majority in terms of perceptions and they are unable to access them i'll take the point why would minority quotas counseling for congress only exist on your side of the house look we're telling you that sure to some extent it is symmetrical the difference now is the harms when it comes to things like trust and when it comes to things like what i'm going to get into now about facilitating more crime that is what is not symmetrical so how do you facilitate facilitate more crime on team mexico side of the house first i want to characterize what type of people that we're talking about here we're looking at people who are like so deeply entrenched in crime that crime will always be a part of their lives look they like grew up in lives lives of crime these are people who like don't have families but have families in terms of the people that they interacted with in crime networks in gangs extremely tight familial like bonds something which jail times can really not undo now when these people have access to the police force specifically ex-convicts having access to the police force they now have access to weapons they have access to evidence things like dna or forensics access to knowledge on police raids or like where the police will be patrolling at certain times access to a police chief that can be lied to and i also want to note here why is this something that can like not be mitigated on on like side proposition side of the house assuming that ex-convicts are allowed on the police force at all as per their model because there is no way to know when ex convicts intentions when they join the police force which is to say the only thing they have access to are likely you know like a record of crimes that they've committed i would argue that like convicts are like realistically if you want to look at like interview processes it's very easy to lie and say you are well-intentioned when you are not therefore someone who's committed an armed robbery if you're just looking at like face value"

Look, even if we take them at their best and say we still think we do more for ex-cons, but the reality panel is that there's a lot more at stake in this debate, right? Because when you're talking about something as crucial as the way that policing and crime is perceived generally by society, it's going to affect a lot of other things. And i.e., that's where it's important to consider things like the way people perceive their justice system, the way police do their jobs, and also the way that future crime is prohibited or not. And this is where we also win on a long term kind of scale. I'll talk about that later when I get to my final bit of class. But first, these S-cons. So two scenarios here. One is that they apply and don't get in. What happens here is that it builds a sense of resentment because they're offered false hope. They tell some first the majority are going to be rejected. So there's really no harm done if we think that it's dangerous for them to get in, right? So they're kind of preempting this idea that we're going to tell you that it's like really bad if they get in, right? The reality is that it's also bad if they get turned away, right? Because like I already told you, it's virtue signaling and it's going to close doors in other areas of opportunities, right? Because they feel like, oh, they have a job here and they don't need it over there, right? And like the harm that comes there is that these people feel like a system that like promised them help is now turning them away and that's going to lead to more resentment and more feelings of like no dignity for themselves it also just takes away the time that they could be putting in to better alternative to themselves right to something that's going to do more for them rebuilding their like self-love after going through something like being in jail which both sides seem to agree is generally kind of a traumatic thing we think it's actually worse for their dignity when they're turned away, when they're trying to show improvement. We think there are other paths where they won't be turned away that are going to be frowned upon a bit more inside the population's world. So what happens"

It exists in almost every single level of society, except among the few people who can empathize with criminals because criminals who don't commit crime out of hatred, but rather necessity. And those are the people who have committed those crimes or people who have loved the ones who have been through that situation. The reality is the majority of society is not reflected in that. The majority of society is resentful of these people because of like the way that politicians are hard on crime they tell us their rebuttal to this is that that's the status quo you're you're like siding with we never once told you that we think the status quo is perfect we've been clear from the beginning that we want this stigma to change and it is only going to change if we decrease crime necessity and other things like that. Again, more on that later, right? Then let's like take them at their best and say that like, oh, even if they are well-liked and well-respected by their co-workers once they get in, the reality is they're likely going to be rejected from the community that they came from. This isn't the majority of cases where people commit a crime of necessity and then they go back home as one of the people who arrested their loved ones, essentially, and are now rejected by the people that they grew up with, right? This is because the perception of criminals towards cops and also cops towards criminals, right? And they're likely still not going to be trusted by society, even if they're trusted by their co-workers, because they have a much lower degree of one-on-one engagement with society, i.e. if their co-workers trust them at all, it's likely because they, like, see them day-to-day and see that they're a good person even though they perceive them poorly the average citizen does not get that kind of engagement and therefore is still likely to trust the news and general political like pushing that is anti-con um convict not communist my god then on the idea of the justice"

These are the kind of things that are really difficult to change in either side of the house, but we actually think that side prop is worse off for it because they're giving these people a sense of false hope that they can change it when they're likely just stepping into a work environment in which they're going to be disrespected and degraded every single day by the people that they're supposed to put their life into like their hands, right? Some idea of like whether the justice system is going to get more modern and better on which side of the house they tell us that the only way to change the police system is from the inside the reality is that we've already tried that and it hasn't really worked that's why a lot of people around the world are protesting against police officers because they can't really fix themselves right and this is also where they lose this point about stopping criminals from getting in because of good training and stuff they can't even catch bad cops who don't have criminal records we think they're gonna have an even harder time doing that when they do have a criminal record right and now on this point about like uh will will people trust them right they tell us that like that basically again they only attribute this to the status quo the reality is that the impacts here are super strong on panel. When people feel like the people who like committed crimes are now meant to enforce the law when they violated in the past, they likely fear their own police officers. They think that the rule of law has become flimsy in the society and they are more likely to want to take justice into their own hands. This is where we see the law degraded publicly. This is where we see more violence and chaos in our society. There is a reason that police need to be highly trusted by people. There are reasons why the ACAB movement is so detrimental around the world because when people feel like their police are not doing a good job, it destroys the integrity of the justice system and the democracy that these people live in. This is a huge impact that COP has not"

Because like, this is where we see the impacts of like financial pressure on jails, of the government system being overworkeded because so many people are committing crimes. And we again create more ex-cons who have to suffer through the consequences of our reality on either side of the house. The reason we do a better job of preventing this is because we encourage ex-convicts to get a better path to the people that are more likely to commit crimes of necessity. This is the crime that we can anticipate. And this is a crime that police officers cannot actively combat because these are the people who by nature are not trustworthy of police officers, right? I can think of very few more opposing roles other than police officer and cop, except for maybe prof and op, right?

Why? Because first of all, we're giving the police and their institutions the ability to uphold the rule of law that is so essential and that's why people trust them because that's what they're viewed upon because they have very high standards for what like their own conduct as citizens but also in terms of the things that they're responding. In the moment that you get people who violated that, you lose it, you loosen this idea that there's like trust in in the rule of law and law enforcement and second of all this idea that like there's um that more people trust like ex-cons when they can reach people and that only happens in our side of the house when you reach them as people instead of as cops when you get one community that's been like violently affected by crime they won't be reached by a cop because that cop even though they empathize with them, if they're going to do a good job, which Team Mexico says that they're going to do, and to some extent, we agree, by virtue of them having to do a good job, regardless of how much they empathize with these people that are affected by crime, they're going to have to put them behind bars, period, right? And even we told you, even if that's not the case, and they empathize with them to the point where they're willing to like skirt the law and like let them off, we're also telling you that that's obviously going to be harmful to society because they're letting criminals away.

Rehabilitation is a system that uses methods like community-based sentencing to prioritize turning criminals with ill intent into functioning members of society afterwards. This works like systems like the Criminon Rehabilitation Program in the United States, which saw a 0% recidivism rate after it was implemented. Generally speaking, we envision decreased sentence lengths and will prioritize helping criminals instead. Secondly, we concede that we will not solve all problems of justice. However, we believe that the stigma of criminalization levied on criminals will eventually disappear. Finally, we will provide the same services, i.e. psychological counseling and community-based sentencing, to those people who have not yet committed crimes as a way of proactively stopping people from turning towards injustice."

              "text": "First, on justice. We think that the majority... I want to begin this argument by characterizing the vast majority of instances as to what causes crime. Because the vast majority of crimes are results of these structural failures of the state. Where in almost every part of the world, the majorities of crimes are crimes of acquisition, like stealing, stealing. And that's a result of you being poor. And the reason why you being poor. And the reason why you are poor is because the state does not provide you with the adequate resources for you to have the basic standard of living. That's why in nations like the U.S., they see the over-criminalization of poor African Americans, and where 88% of crimes within that state are crimes of acquisition. Therefore, the state has failed you in the position of basic resources. And because of that, the state has an obligation to provide you with the reparations, the education, and the opportunities that have to apply to you, and that happens through rehabilitation and informed reparations. Why is this important? It is because the moment at which you are born into a state, the state gives you a promise. Because a sacrifice of rights in terms of taxation, for example, and this is a reciprocal responsibility to provide you that fair and basic standard of living. Secondly, we don't think that Team England is going to come up here and talk about murder and rape in terms of heinous instances of crime. But recognize that even in those instances, the vast majority of violent crime are correlated to these same reasons. Because in the lack of alternatives, you default to things like gangs in Chicago, where drug violence is rampant, and to the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, where crime is also a violation of justice. They might stand for a soft mix of rehabilitation law and other forms of justice, but note that the consideration of other measurement prevents rehabilitation from operating at its maximum capacity. Two reasons why. First of all, countervailing considerations damage the effectiveness of rehab. Because when you add other considerations, such as retribution or deterrence, no thank you, that's when rehabilitation becomes so optimal. Because when you add things like retribution, which extends sentencing claims to suboptimal things that are beyond the time necessary to be successful in rehabilitation, and you spend more on the prison infrastructure, money that could be going to more successful rehabilitation programs, that's when rehabilitation becomes far more unsuccessful, given that it's a most just system of publishing. But secondly, note that all these considerations are oppositional towards the efficacy of rehabilitation. Deterrence, for example, values things like extreme punishment to prevent future crime. So take the example of a criminal who goes through anger management exercises under a form of rehabilitation. But because deterrence still exists on their side of the house, they have to go back into the prison cells and stay back and watch the prison fights and room with prisoners that believe that the state has failed them. That decreases and diminishes the effectiveness of this justice system on their side. We think there's only a prismally justified metric of punishment. If prisons are so bad, then why do you support sending people there for any medical time? Okay, Steve, the prison's bad in the status quo. That's why we're forming the system to emphasize some other metric of it to make it more effective, that's what I was thinking."

              "text": "All right, next argument, as to why we better take down crime. I first want to characterize to you the purpose of the criminal justice system, i.e., the reason why the state creates things like courts and prisons are to protect individuals and to optimize social outcomes by decreasing the occurrences of crime. And this is also for victims, if they want to talk about victims, be just, because a world in which we optimize the justice system is one where victims feel safe in. The problem is their system values the draconian and archaic system of justice, because the draconian system of retribution is a misconception that this is the only way to punish people. A system that violates the human rights of individuals. And this is also a system that is incredibly ineffective, which is why one-sixth of the crime in the United States is done by repeat offenders. This is due to two structural reasons of their assignment of the House. First of all, note that prisons and the environment that it creates perpetuates crime. Because the environment that you're in are people who have committed heinous acts like murder and rape. So you have to join things like gangs. That's the only way to protect yourself in this heinous position. You are next to murderers and rapists who tell you and for their narratives of mistrust against the state. This is a community of anger. And this is also bad, because in places where they have this retributive system, recidivism rates, i.e. occurring committee crimes after you have been involved in crime, increases, which is why retributive systems have failed in Uruguay, USA, Honduras, and France. This is an archaic system that fails in their obligations to protect people. But secondly, know that when people get out of prison, a post-prime role is suboptimal to minimizing crime. Why is this the case? Because there is a stigma against prisoners. That when you are an ex-convict and you're trying to get a job, and you have the stigma of a prisoner standing on your resume, you do not get employment, and you do not get a job to to get decent living standards, which turns people to more crime. We solve this through three reasons on our side of the house. First of all, one, intuitively, we solve the root issue of crime. So things like not having an economic stability can be solved through drug trade. Things like being not being able to turn to, forcing to turn to things like drugs can be solved through drug rehabilitation. I mean, that's comparatively better. Secondly, you get people to live better lives through things like community-based sentencing, means that you're able to treat these people in a far more humane way, and tells people that they can be integrated into society. And note that there are still deterrents on the outside of the house, because when you put under things like house arrest, your freedoms are still stripped away from you, and we think that's a suboptimal rule which any prisoner, or any rational individual would not prefer. But finally, outside of prison, when you implement a rehabilitative system, it is better for the comparative because you reduce the stigma against these prisoners. The fault in the status quo is the perception that this justice system has created, that the only way to punish criminals is to be retributed in deterrent systems, to strip them of their rights, to tell society that these are people not deserving of human rights. That's why they're not being hired. We shift that on our side of the house, to dehumanize criminals, that they are deserving of human rights, that they are bidding for integration, which is why we prioritize a system of justice. So, the justice is a just system of punishing, because we better reduce crime on our side of the, you should go to side proposition. Thank you."

We think these are the most important group in this debate for two reasons. One, they are more vulnerable. They are emotionally distraught from being attacked, or they are physically distraught from being attacked in that same way. It's the same way as if you're raped all the way through to if you have economic to do against you by theft. Second of all, they did not consent to being harmed in the same way that someone who did commit an act at the point of committing that act explicitly consented to being harmed, whether or not there were slight worse oppressions based on their background. Only on side opposition do we think that punishing individuals by the circumstances of that act would lead to a positive effect on victims? A sense of compliance. We are the only side of this debate that can stand for that, that can stand for providing victims of these abuses with closure.

We told you that deterrence and rehabilitation inherently counteract each other. Because one has longer sentences, one tends to have shorter sentences. One treats prisoners humanely, and one treats prisoners like dogs. We told you that that's fundamentally different. They don't deal with that. Moreover, they don't deal with the stigma that comes along with this, something that I'll engage more later on."

It's like saying some woman becomes CEO, so we shouldn't help women as the state. It's incredibly ridiculous. I would say that the state still has a very great obligation to these people. If anything, it's mitigated to an extent. They may still have some choice, but to the extent that the state has an obligation, overtly punishing this group of individuals is incredibly important. Next, they said some people fundamentally deserve to go to jail because they consented to commit crime. No, because in the circumstances where the state has failed, where you have poor education, where your family has been poor for generations and all the people around you are poor, it's not always a choice. And even if it was a choice, we would say that this is a tautological argument, right? Just because saying, like, sometimes we want punishment because we feel like we want punishment doesn't mean that we actually should have that principle in the criminal justice system. Sometimes people want vigilante justice. That doesn't mean that we enact that. So, if we can prove that we actually get better outcomes, we would propose that that's a better"

              "text": "system of evaluating this debate. Why? Because they care a lot about the consent of the victims, and we agree. The consent of the victims is important, but the consent of future victims which will be harmed is also important, and that's what we take out. But also, just dealing with their principle on victims, we would say that the majority of victims aren't as hateful as they would say. In fact, in the US, the majority of victims, something like 92% in the last time I read this study, actually don't want the draconian punishments that are being enforced right now because they're seen as hateful because these people don't want to be punished. But to the extent that people actually are so hateful on their side of the house, generally they are hateful toward the criminal because they committed an heinous crime that cannot be reconciled, such as a person who committed murder or rape. These people are the people that are most likely, on either side of the house, to be locked away for a long time because it's incredibly hard to rehabilitate these people. But ultimately, in the most important way of the metric, we think that preventing crime as a whole is more important than mitigating the effects of some crime for some victims, although that may be as well important. Next, let's talk about how we get better outcomes, because this was completely unaddressed on their side except for like 30 seconds of their last speech. I think given that they said that's the most important part, they should already be losing this debate. What we told them is that rehabilitation is done better in almost every single case on our side of the house. There's a reason why the rule of four days exists. That is to say, when you go to prison and you come out, your job prospects are now 40% lower. You are likely to be paid 40% less if you find one, and your family is 40% more likely to fall into poverty. The simple reason is because these people are ruined in prison. There's a social stigma surrounding them by their own metric, which says that criminals are evil people fundamentally, and they deserve to go to prison. Moreover, they are being de-skilled during that time. When they come out, they do not have the same skills. they have that black mark on their record that they cannot remove. Note the things that we talked about as well, like the criminogenic effect. Like the fact that you are surrounded by people who most likely would recruit you into gangs or toughen you up in prison just in order to survive. These are the most likely people to be taken out on their side of the nomination, far more crime. Their only response was, ah, we get more deterrence on our side of the house somehow. This is fundamentally misunderstanding the human condition. Because I don't think that the average human is evil enough to just randomly commit crime just because they feel like it, right? We would say that the moral obligation you feel to other humans is generally a good enough reason not to commit crime. Note, also, we have other forms of soft deterrence on our side of the house. It's not just like a two-week sentence in these places. It's like, for example, staying for a longer period, having your freedom stripped from you. Note, this is not as big an obligation, but it is still an deterrence, because people generally don't want their freedom and opportunities taken away. Finally, we would note that these crimes that they talk about are often crimes of passion, things that aren't premeditated, and therefore deterrence factors in. The premeditated attacks they talk about in the very, very, very minute cases, as they can see, are probably going to happen under either side, because these are just actively people and crazy people. Yes? In the case of crimes of economic acquisition, the way to rehabilitate people is to make their economic life better. Would you criminalize those people? And if not, what happens to crime rates for crimes of acquisition? Yeah, generally if they commit a criminal act, what we're going to do is send them to rehab, give them job training, give them anger management classes, whatever they need. That's exactly the premise of rehabilitation. They don't get that on their side of the house"

How do we get that better on our side of the house? This is my new piece of substantive. We tell you that organized crime syndicates are empowered when members of the community that is most affected feel ostracized in the criminal justice system. That is, when African Americans in Chicago cannot speak up when they see drug crimes being committed because they are fundamentally afraid of the criminal justice system. They fear if they walk into that police station, they will be ostracized, they will be hated upon. It's much, much harder then to get witnesses and inside information which is necessary to take down these gangs and organize crime syndicates. So, therefore, in that winning mechanism, if we get better by it by not actively ostracizing these group of people and making an adversarial narrative between the prison system and them, we get far better at the dealing of criminal syndicates which cause the worst crimes. We would note that the self-help mechanisms that we talked about earlier are important too. Because the reason that people slick into drug addictions is because they're afraid to go to the state. That's why when Jamaica implemented an amnesty program, drug addiction rates fell dramatically. We get far better outcomes because we stop the root cause of crime. Because people don't mean to hate the state. Because people don't mean to commit crimes of acquisition. They perpetuate that on our side. Their side is much worse. Very proud to propose."

And by the way, that's a direct response to their point about crime rates going down. They say that people aren't evil enough to commit crime, and that most people have a moral obligation. Now, one, note that that is a huge concession on choice, because we tell you, two, that most people aren't evil enough to commit crimes, even crimes of economic necessity.

They're committing them because they're economically necessary.

Most people don't recognise that these individuals have been failed by the state. Most people believe in ideas of justice, of balancing the scales. Why? One, because it's intrinsic. We say it's something fundamental to human nature that bad things should go unpunished. We see that in the cry of a child, but that's not fair. We see it in the fact that every religion has some concept of justice in the afterlife, conveniently reusing the analysis from the Octo. We see that in all legal systems, ond nid yw hynny'n dda. Rydyn ni'n gweld hynny yn y ffaith bod pob ddyniaeth yn cael rhywbeth o ddydd yn y diwedd, yn gyffredinol, yn defnyddio'r gwaith o'r octoed. Rydyn ni'n gweld hynny mewn holl systemau leol, yn eu cydnabod y dydd o ddydd, yn ymddangos i'r dymuniaeth cymdeithasol am dydd. Ddwy, oherwydd dyna dymuniaeth cymdeithasol, oherwydd mae'n gyflawniol, oherwydd mae gynnwys o dydd wedi'i adeiladu i'n cymdeithas o ran y cyfryngau, o ran ffilm, o ran y sgyrsiau in terms of film, in terms of the conversations that people have on a day-to-day basis. So what happens when you see people not getting what you see as fair sentences, but instead being let off easy? What happens when the person who commits a violent crime is given two weeks of counselling and then let's go back onto the street? What happens when the person who steals from you is given a slap on the wrist and maybe has to go and see a parole officer once every couple of weeks? We think that when people see a miscarriage of justice, that leads to anger. One, because it violates their notions of right or wrong. That ranges from petty theft to rape. Two, because people feel less safe themselves at the point when they're in a society which they perceive as having people who are dangerous criminals in. Three, because people lose faith and lose trust in the justice system. And four, because the media is likely to play on the very worst cases of individuals and point out the kinds of miscarriages of justice that we say are happening. What happens then? One, you get vigilante justice. Because the perception that the state is incapable or unwilling to do what is right leads to people taking it into their own hands. Because if you're a shopkeeper, if you die for, who regularly gets stolen from, whose wealth is taking a hit, even though their crimes are economic necessity. When you see them not getting punished, when you see them getting off easy, we think you're much more likely to seek out and attack, take justice into your own hands. That's bad, because you often don't attack the individuals who are actually committing crimes, but individuals from the kinds of groups that are committing crimes. So African-Americans who don't necessarily commit crimes themselves actually do get attacked, actually do get people trying to carry out justice on their own because of the perception they are criminal groups. At the very softest scale, it looks like people excluding individuals from society. For example, if you're doing community service, it looks like you're being abused by other members of that society. It looks like you're being spat on. Secondly, you get discrimination in hiring because we think people are much less likely to want to hire individuals who have come out of prison at the point when Mae'n edrych fel y byddwch yn cael eich troi arnyn nhw. Yn ail, mae'r gwahaniaeth yn cael ei gael yn gweithio. Oherwydd rydyn ni'n meddwl bod pobl yn llawer na ddigwydd i gael unigolion sydd wedi dod o'r brisyn ar y pwynt lle maen nhw'n gweld y unigolion hynny fel na fydd yn cael eu gweithredu'n iawn neu na fydd wedi gweld y ddiogelwch y maen nhw'n ei dderbyn. Beth sy'n digwydd yna? Un, mae bywyd y unigolion hyn yn anodd. Ddwy, maen nhw'n cael eu troi i'r crwm eto oherwydd nad ydyn nhw'n cael eu gweithio. because they're not being hired. That's a direct response to their material about how low recidivism rates and about how perceptions of criminals improve. We think at the point when criminals have not seen proper justice, people will see that as well and hate those criminals even more. For all these reasons, I beg you to oppose."

And we told you, even if there were like 10 or 12 evil people that should be punished, that we're vastly outweighing their benefits, because we told you that 88% of the crimes committed in America are committed by evil people, they're committed by people who are making out an economic dissension and they want to punish all those millions of people simply for the vast minority of evil people who think that that principle is vacuous. But more importantly, we told you it was mutually exclusive that the sentence length for treatment for optimal rehab is inherently diminished the moment at which you try to consider other factors. Why? Because oftentimes, other factors and other circumstances were principally oppositional. Note the fact that retribution and deterrence literally make harsh excessive punishments to try to get people to not commit crime. So they are having a huge trade-off there. Finally, their principles shrunk to the idea of how it's a waste of tax money. Let's just think about this for a moment, right? Because what if that is the purpose of tax, which is to enhance state utility? And we think the average taxpayer would rather spend money rehabilitating someone and creating them into a productive citizen that can contribute back into society than spending it on a prisoner who will never get out of jail and who will always be a drag on society. So if they want to talk about tax money, we think we've won that point. Then they said, well, on our side we have more money to rehabilitate non-convicts. Here's the problem. One, people in poor communities are often convicts, and this means you don't give those people rehabilitation. But secondly, in response to what the second speaker told you, about how on our side we literally have more money, because people aren't being sent to jail for such long periods of time, And in response to what the second speaker told you about how on our side we literally have more money because people aren't being sent to jail for such long periods of time. And it's less time you can spend on food for these people, more money you can spend on infrastructure that exists on their side of the house. So if there comes money, we think we want that anyways."

The problem with this argument was that the CJS includes a healthy mix of characteristics. The ability to garner political capital for rehabilitation is greatly diminished. Why? Because of the very rhetoric that opposition has been saying. Because these people are animals. These people are people who deserve to be in health. We think that that rhetoric is literally what stops getting rehabilitation to the people who need it most. But then they said, you still send people to prison, isn't prison so bad? And we told you, no, because the conditions are clearly different. And it's not enough for them to scoff at us and say, well changing prison lanes doesn't actually change anything. Because we gave you two key distinctions. Number one, the way people are treated. And this is down to the micro nuances of how guards treat prisoners. Because on their side, they're more likely to be dehumanized, to be treated as animals. We solved it far better. But secondly, because we make the conditions better, because we think stuffing ten people into a cell where there's likely to be rape and gang murder is not a conducive condition for people. We solved the conditions, so we make prisons a lot better, right? More importantly, we told you existing prisons that they're running to defend exacerbate criminal behavior because ultimately they engender crime when the life within prison leads you to have connections with other criminals."

And her response to this was, well doesn't stigma kind of increase on your side too? No it doesn't. Because the main reason why the stigma exists on your side of the house is because the way criminals are perceived means they're unfit for treatment, they're unfit for employment, and they're unfit people for society in general. We told you we solved that far better on our side of the house for three reasons. Reason number one, because we solved the root cause of crime. We solved the crime that has occurred because of economic necessity. Reason number two, we humanized individuals and reduced the stigma. Why? Because when we provide people with job training, when we provide them with the things they need in the rehabilitation centers we need on our side of the house, these people are far more able to integrate into society, and society is far more likely to accept these people.

Because people, as you say, are people who just want mob justice. They're people who believe in the criminal justice system and can believe criminals are humans too. Their response was, well, don't you kind of deter people, right? We told you, this is the very same rhetoric used to fuel the war on drugs. Because deterrence and partial punishments clearly don't work when the trade-off is feeding your family or getting you into prison. People are always going to choose the latter, and they've never analyzed the structural incentives of criminals. Finally, let's talk about the idea of people and victims, because they say we provide closure to victims. We told you that if victims were their most important stake out here, we prevent future victims. So rather than having someone go through the trauma of getting a crime committed on them, we stop that in the very first instance we think that's better. But secondly, we told you on our side of the house that a lot of the expectations and hatred that they're talking about is hatred that is garnered by state rhetoric. That is to say, the hate that's likely to occur on their side of the house and the vigilantes that are likely to occur on their side of the house is oftentimes based on the fact that the state wows up people, that the hate that they have is manufactured because expectations are dynamic. That is to say, there's not really a difference between a 20-year sentence and a 25-year sentence, right? So it's unclear to us whether those extra 5 or 10 years on your side of the house make any marginal difference in how people feel. We told Jews, the moment that you're saying these people are animals, you're saying these people deserve no better, that is when you get hate for the very first time, that's when you get vigilante justice. When they're treated as humans, we allowed them to be like that. For these reasons, we were proud to propose."

The terror that they still fear waking up in the middle of the night and remembering the time when a man was standing over them with a knife. That is why we care about victims so much.

We told you that deterrence specifically for economically motivated crimes goes down as a result of this policy. They say that deterrence exists already, but they can't have their cake and eat it. They can't claim to have a system that benefits minority groups by basically not punishing them and claim that there exists a substantial deterrence. The reasons we told you that crime rates actually increase is as a result of opportunity. And the point at which they spend millions of dollars paying for psychologists, paying for counsellors for some of the most evil human beings on planet Earth, is the point at which they cannot afford to educate African Americans. The point at which the overwhelming majority of states and states that aren't America cannot afford to provide people with the things that mean that they do not have to turn to a creative crime. If you believe some crimes are simply wrong, then we shouldn't be sending people to community service, vote for proposition. But if you also believe the best way to stop crimes is to tell people that they shouldn't do it, that they will be posed for doing it, that is also the point which this debate has to go to opposition."

So, if you agree that we should give the worst offenders life sentences, and we should treat everyone else with rehabilitation, you are probably conceding overnight consent to our case.

That was a very expressive coercive force. And no, the solution to two people being coerced is not to punish everyone, it's to try to solve the problem at hand.

So the reason they said that is spending $70,000 per year on criminals who stay in the system for much longer and are much more likely to come back is much more expensive than hiring some counselors. Much more expensive than spacing them out. They get far more criminals. That's why it's far more expensive. No response."

Finally, we told you that the criminal justice effect happens uniquely on our side, they said it happens anyway. That's a fundamental misunderstanding. We're not sticking them in overcrowded prisons anymore right next to the worst offenders. We are separating these people. We are putting them in different sentences, often community sentencing. That means that they get lost opportunities, they get hatred, they get communities that are surrounding them that often incite more violence. Note that people will still hire them and they're prepared to be more likely to hire them on our side, because that black mark does not exist. Finally, the upshot of this argument is that in the short term, maybe we have largely less deterrence, but in the long term, we stop these systemic factors in the majority of cases. Finally, on violent crime, they fail to respond, firstly, because this is the smallest minority of cases, and secondly, we thought we'd better solve it by having witnesses that can speak up. People that aren't necessarily part of gays, but saw crimes happening and give insider information. For all of these reasons, we stop the systemic groups of crime, we prevent gangs from forming, we prevent people from falling into the poverty trap. We are very proud of the vote."

Fourthly and finally is the fact that the kind of justice that we're explicitly following and pursuing on our side of the house is a reformative type of justice and not the punitive kind that ICTY supports. Our stand is victim-oriented. We don't think that victims get justice when they see a leader who's committed multiple genocides being put behind bars for eight years. We don't think that that's the kind of justice that victims seek on our side of the house. When it comes to argumentation, three arguments. First, on how TRCs lead to better victim satisfaction. Secondly, on how we establish peace in the region. Thirdly and finally, on how TRCs on our side of the house achieve better governance in the region. When it comes to the first argument, we prove this in three ways. The first idea is compensation and access to mental health facilities. It's very important to know for a fact that the incentives of the UN to participate in the region will likely remain the same on our side of the house. We see any kind of financial support from the UN to be reallocated towards establishing the necessary facilities and to provide mental health support for victims and individuals who are most vulnerable of the war and we also see direct financial compensation being given to such people. Secondly, we see scores from NGOs and donors because of more information that we get through accessing more testimonies, because we are able to record and report on more atrocities and crimes that are likely to happen, we accumulate records for such crimes and atrocities that happen, we get a better understanding and a better record on what actually happened, this is fundamentally important because it gets the region more attention from NGOs who will likely support the civil society. And with the fact that we get victim testimonies and the fact that we allow victims to access the necessary platform in the first place to share their stories and to share these experiences, this mobilizes individuals that are more sympathetic on our side of the house to support these individuals and to support the region and to donate to it and to volunteer in the region in a way that is supportive and in a way that benefits the most vulnerable. And also, the supportive NGOs will likely be more effective on our side of the house, no thank you, will likely be more effective on our side of the house because of the recommendations and records that are likely to be given be more effective on our side of the house"

              "text": "We think that perpetrators will come out and choose to take the amnesty because they fear to be prosecuted in the first place. They see this as an opportunity to alleviate some of the prosecution that might likely happen to them. We see incentives for them to participate in the TRC to take amnesties and to give out testimony so that they do escape prosecution. Second idea on a more accurate historical record, we have more witnesses on our side of the house that are testifying from civilians and victims because they do have the incentives on our side of the house to participate because of things like A, platform that is not available in the ICTY, not everybody can actually go, not all victims can go and testify in the ICTY, not every individual has access to such platforms. B, the opportunities to face the perpetrator and actually tell the story and actually have the perpetrator acknowledge the suffering that they have caused to them. C, access to compensation that is likely to only be granted in case of testifying and actually going out and speaking in the TRC. And finally, the fact that we actually build more momentum to testify because once individuals who were fit of prosecution choose to step up and testify in the first place, we see that people on the ground are likely to become more committed and to get a certain level of momentum towards giving out testimonies, they themselves, which will get us more valuable testimonies because these individuals or people on the ground are more quantity in testimony than the first place. This means that we establish a better joint historical record in the first place that is likely to be written which will help which will help reconciliating experts and will give us the necessary perspective of different victims and different perpetrators. The second idea is that we actually get less toxic nationalism and media war. Less toxic nationalism because we actually now have better education because we give people a better historical record on what actually happened. We focus more on heroic stories that actually show some initiatives of soldiers, for example, who are supportive to minorities or who are supportive to victims in the region. And we also get better testimonies that give us a better collective image on what actually happened. But what is fundamentally one of the biggest failures of the ICTY is the fact that they failed to manage the media war. On their side of the house, they have narratives that say that Slobodan Milizavich is a hero. On their side of the house they have narratives that say that these individuals are actually not the perpetrators but are actually the victim. Each country within the region is saying no we're victims, they're victimizing themselves but they're not willing to accept the fact that they were perpetrators at a certain point. Second argument is on the fact on how we establish better peace in the region. Because of the joint historical record that we get on our side of the house, by focusing on journalism and public hearing, on our side of the house, soldiers will only kill and commit crimes, and do things that are detrimental if they're incredibly pushed to do so. On our side of the house, we have less soldiers who have the mindset of going out and simply obliterating individuals against them because they do understand that to a certain extent they too are perpetrators and not only the victims in the case. This means that we get more possibility of peace talks, especially because of the social pressure that is likely to manifest on our side of the house as we're seeing a shift in democracy in the region after the war. Over 200 political parties were established after the war and with the less toxic nationalism that's produced on our side of the house, we bring more possibility for diplomatic and peace talks, war is used as we are proud to propose."

              "text": "First, on why we better achieve justice for victims. And second, on the achievement of regional stability. Before argumentation, I want to note a few things on praying we do not agree with. We think there are three major differences between the ICTY and the hypothetical TRC we must note. First, on the existence of punishment. The ICTY's main goal was to persecute the most important leaders who spearheaded the war. On the flip, the TRC's goal was to move on. They almost always granted amnesty to war criminals, meaning this TRC was also systematically unable to persecute individuals. Secondly, on who has authority in each of these institutions. The ICTI was created and is controlled by the UN to ensure fairness. It was established outside the region by a third party. The TRC on the other hand is created more locally, often by the new government. In this specific scenario, it would be difficult to choose where to place the TRC, but the point is it would be done inside Yugoslavia. Thirdly, on the budget, the ICTI had a massive budget incomparable of that to the TRC, reaching ten times the budget of most TRCs. That being said, I want to make a few engagements with the PM and disprove their claims. On the first thing, they talked in their characterization as how this is going to work miraculously, where you're going to place different TRCs in eight different countries and we're going to have one main TRC that's going to work. However, I don't agree with this because they never, I'm confused by this on two levels. Firstly, this is not going to work, right? There's no incentive for a Serbian to go to a Croatian TRC and confess. You're seen as a traitor by all your friends and family. You have to get on a plane, travel miles to Croatia just to apologize. But secondly, and most importantly, the perpetrators are literally in other countries, right? I don't see how this is going to work. This needs to be explained better. The second response I have, their first argument is about better victim satisfaction. I have two problems with this argument. Firstly, they never answer why people will come and testify in the first place. Their only response is that they want to escape persecution. But the fact is that when people do not come and confess in TRCs, they often get away with it with no punishment. Look at South Africa, look at other cases of TRCs. We think there's literally no incentive for people to come to TRCs. But the second problem they miss is that why people are going to accept their apologies in the first place. We're talking about victims who have been raped, who have had their families killed. We think it is impossible for someone to just accept an apology when they go to a TRC. They need to prove this from DTF. Moving on to the first argument then, on how the thesis of this argument is that the ICTY"

The first mechanism is that the leaders got retribution and punishment. Under the TRC, the victims got a tokenistic apology from soldiers. This was inadequate in curing the deep pain these victims experienced. There are two reasons why the apologies done in the TRC were seen as tokenistic. First, because the only people who went to the TRC were those who, for entirely selfish reasons, wanted to get amnesty. They didn't come to apologize because they felt sorry. They came so they could justify their actions and show that it was politically motivated, as PM conceded. Those who apologized for selfish reasons did not make genuine apologies. But second, even if the perpetrator were to give an apology from the bottom of their heart, victims were likely to perceive the apology as tokenistic, as you envision the perpetrators to be inhumane. To these survivors, justice and resolution were unachievable by an insincere apology. It is cruel and wrong to say that a sorry could pay for the suffering these people had faced. In the comparative, under the ICQI, leaders were effectively imprisoned. I'll take it later. This meant that the leaders, the ones who were responsible for all actions committed, were punished. Soldiers and local military generals were merely puppets of the leaders, cogs in an ever-turning car machine. We punished the real villain. We did it right. We placed the blame where it rightly belongs, and we brought justice for the infighting. I'll take it later. The second mechanism is that ICTY brought justice even to those who could not speak out."

The people that come to court hearings are the brave ones, but hundreds and thousands have to scream in silence. For those people, the ICTY can uniquely achieve closure. Under the ICTY, we covered everyone by punishing the leaders who ordered the horrors. This means that when Milosevic got jailed, when people heard this on the news, all victims of his horrors could place the blame on him. They could point the finger at him. They all felt some catharsis and reprieve, even if the specific individual who committed some crime upon them was in jail. The ICTY gave everyone, including the most vulnerable, a sense of justice. The conclusion of my argument is simple. We protect victims, we give them catharsis, we give them justice. But before moving on to the second argument, I'll take your QI."

              "text": "The second argument from Japan is on peace. The thesis of this argument is that the persecution of the most dangerous leaders is necessary for safety and peace, which was uniquely achievable under the ICTY. The premise of this argumentation is that under the TRC, wartime leaders stayed in politics. This fundamental function of the TRC, which centered around not punishing, means that leaders went unscapped and could stay in politics. Why then would the proposition's world where leaders stay in politics have inflamed conflict and hampered development? Two mechanisms. First, wartime leaders and their ideologies would lead them to engage in massively harmful actions. These ruthless leaders who committed war crimes are going to continue this foreign ideology. This is because these leaders have to maintain a strong man leader object to maintain where they must be must be seen as a consistent leader and one that will continue to fight. This is amplified especially in chaotic times like war. Leaders are therefore unable to change course or moderate. These leaders, the masterminds behind these mass massacres, continue to rule and continue to destroy. But secondly, even if these leaders moderate, the existence of these leaders in politics in of itself would have been harmful. There are three reasons why this is true. Firstly, nations in the Yugoslav region obviously feel antipathy and antagonism towards opposing nation's leaders. Secondly, major Western institutions like NATO and EU is highly unlikely to admit post-Yugoslav nations as they are seen as unchanged. This means that nations are unable to access a lot of the monetary and military benefits these institutions offer. Third, and finally, many economic powerhouses in the West, like America, are likely to never reinstate their social economic ties with these nations. The fact that an authoritarian dictator like Milosevic continued to wield power was enough, but the leaders' firm anti-West stance further exacerbated this. This all means that when these leaders maintain power, countries are less likely to negotiate trade deals, maintain regional cooperation, create economic ties, and improve post-EUCO class stability. So the question is, why was the ICTY able to solve this? The mechanism by which we achieve solvency is extremely simple. We have jailed tens of these genocidal leaders. The fact of the matter is that people want change. The citizens' will is to create change. Therefore, new leaders will cater to this will. They created a new age of leadership, one that was more democratic and one that was more moderate. The empirical evidence is clear on this matter. Croatia's new leader democratized Croatia and stabilized regional conflicts. Serbia worked to democratize the nation and integrate with Europe. Slovenia and Croatia have returned to the EU. Serbia and Montenegro are candidate countries of the EU. This leads to the conclusion of my speech. ICTY allowed for peace to be achieved in the region. This is why we are able to compete here in Serbia today. Extremely proud of those."

Because on our side of the house, as we've told you before, we're creating a regional TRC in which it's getting the reports from national TRCs and then it's pushing for a mega narrative that's collected from all the national TRCs.

When someone's going to participate, the others're going to participate but second of all societal pressure is going to push them into participating it's a domino effect when someone's going to participate the others are going to participate in in the fear of getting prosecuted in the fear of societal pressure but second of all we would argue that the victims participation is way more important than the perpetrators because the victims are going to participate and they're going to testify it helps them in reconciliation helps them in their in their healing passage. But second of all, these testimonies could be used for prosecution of individuals who did not apply for amnesty, who weren't granted amnesty. So I'm going to take it from here."

              "text": "Yes, they can, but on our side of the house, these TRC commissioners are not going to be people from within the government. These commissioners are experts in reconciliation, experts in diplomacy. We might use help from other TRCs. We might, like Desmond Tutu in South Africa. So we're looking into experts in diplomacy, experts in reconciliation, and civil society leaders. So they're most likely not going to give amnesty unless this person really deserves amnesty in which there is a criteria. And even in the slightest possibility of these individuals getting amnesty when they do not deserve it, if they're going to get amnesty, they're going to testify. So their testimony is way more important than your arbitrary prosecution. Moving to the second idea about peace. They told us that wartime leaders are going to continue. Well, we did not see this. The ICTY couldn't prosecute Milošević until he was thrown from his power. So the same applies for us. On our side of the house, the only thing that's different is that we're pushing for more societal pressure in order to achieve change. But second of all, on peace, they did not show us how we achieved peace on their side of the house. On their side of the house, peace is not achieved. We're seeing military tensions between countries. We're seeing Kosovo and Serbia still now having their conflicts, so they did not achieve peace. What they achieved is a fragile peace that is not important. And moving on to my argument, my third argument is about creating better governance. First of all, civil society is going to be hard on our side of the house and our side of the house only, because the NGOs and the commissioners are getting more power. NGOs are participating more when they have more knowledge about what happened. But second of all, commissioners are getting more power in our... these commissioners are civil society leaders, they are religious leaders like Desmond Tutu and like many others. So these individuals, when they are getting more power, we are improving the civil society, which achieves more democracy. If they are going to argue democracy, we would argue that democracy is better on our side of the house. The second point is delegitimizing mid-rank generals on their side of the house. Toxic mid-rank generals are going to stay in power because they are not prosecuted by the ITTY on our side of the house. They are either going to apply for amnesty or going to be prosecuted. Either way, they are going to be delegitimized and they're going to be thrown out of the government. So we achieved this in the worst-case scenario. And moving on to why do we create better relations, international relations? Less toxic nationalism. On this side of the house, there are narratives such as the only massacre that happened, the only genocide that happened in the Balkans is against Serbia. These narratives do not allow for international relations and these narratives are exclusive to their side of the house. On our side of the house, we achieve less toxic nationalism through better historical records in which individual victims are participating in it. It's being written by reconciliation experts. Moreover, we also get better testimonies and records because if I know that an ICTY is going to be established, I'm going to preserve the records which allows me to get better records. So that's why we get better records. So on who achieves justice, we achieve justice that's better for victims. On who achieves better collective historical record, we achieve it, and on who creates better governance and better civil society on our side of the house, we empower all of these. So proud to propose."

              "text": "Firstly, I have three main notes I want to make at the top that largely deals with a lot of their claims. Firstly, that proposition has massive burdens to fulfill in this debate that still go unfulfilled at this point in this debate. They have to prove to us that individuals are actively going to come to the TRC and the deputy's one-second response to this POI cannot stand in this debate. Proposition wants you to believe two main reasons why people are actively going to come to the TRC. They firstly tell you that these individuals want amnesty and fear persecution, then secondly on societal pressure. About the first one, I'm going to deal with this in two main ways. One, that people are not persecuted under the TRC. Second, that these leaders especially have very little incentive to put themselves in. Firstly, people are not persecuted under the TRC. There are so many people who do not come to the TRC that the TRC and the national court system lacks the manpower to persecute everybody, which is why tens of thousands of individuals whose amnesty proposals got denied in South Africa never got persecuted and walk free to this day. This means that people do not have to fear persecution and proposition because people are unable to get persecuted. But secondly, I also want to note that leaders have very little incentive to turn themselves in, especially because these institutions can massively be coerced by themselves. The fact that there is a Serbian sect of the TRC and that it is the only organization to which Serbian individuals have to be accountable for means that the Serbian leaders no longer have to feel accountable. They have so much power in this institution. The second problem analysis you get is to say that there is societal pressure. This is just wrong because the prerequisite of societal pressure existing is for some people at the beginning to be pressured in the first place. We proved to you that nobody feels this pressure."

              "text": "The implication of the first clarification then is that the proposition has to fulfill this burden of people actively coming to the TRC. The second clarification is that the fact that proposition wants to clean this idea of a multinational TRC that extends beyond borders is the entire downfall of their case. From Contaro's speech we give you three main reasons why this is likely to fail to which the only response we get from proposition is to say, well, the incentive to create peace and to be good for victims exists in all of these countries. Two problems with this. Number one, each country has different ways by which they accomplish this. This is why the ICTY was especially functional. But also secondly, the ICTY was uniquely forced when in comparison the TRC is voluntary. Nations and these wartime leaders who still retain power after the war ended have very little incentive to actively cooperate with the TRC, which is an institution that is coming out to get them. I also want to note that this idea of a multinational TRC, and especially the response to the POI I give them, is massively detrimental to their case, because I ask them if the Serbian sect of the TRC can grant amnesty. They say yes. The problem with this is that there's massive bias that remains inside the TRC. This is why, for example, when you look at the South African TRC, zero cases of war crimes committed by black individuals was ever persecuted because the leaders who they claim are experts, people like Desmond Tutu, were incredibly biased against white people, which means that TRC was only functional in one way, justice, not multinational justice."

Yes, but we punish the right individuals. On victims, our argumentation tells you that the TRC and the victims get tokenistic apologies on proposition. We also tell you that many of our individuals are too vulnerable and a lot of individuals are unable to speak out, which means comparatively, uniquely, when we bring justice from the top, we can target everybody, we can bring justice for everybody.

              "text": "Let's look at their argumentation you get from PM. They give you a couple of things. The first thing Proposition wants you to believe is that the UN is going to spend a lot of money in these reasons, and this is going to help things like mental health efforts. Two things. One, in the history of the United Nations and the history of the TRC, the UN has never established significant the history of the TRC, the UN has never established significant monetary support alongside the TRC. It has only been always through the TRC because the TRC is obviously out of their control. But secondly, even if you don't state that, specifically in this situation, in this post-Yugoslav society, it is unlikely that the UN does this because the TRC is dysfunctional. All of our other mechanisms are prerequisited upon this unless they can improve the functionality of the TRC. The UN has no incentive to drain their resources into this. The second prop claim to get is on NGO support. We agree, NGOs, amazing institutions, brilliant. The problem is that this is a comparative debate. There is zero analysis as to why NGOs are in any way unique. NGOs exist in the world as well. Thirdly, proposition will have you believe that they create a better historical record, but the ICTY is just as well able to gather information. But let's take their best case. Let's say they're talking about different kinds of information. Maybe they're talking about more victim-centric information. The problem with this analysis is that we prefer a world in which victims are unaware of what happened to their relatives, because we believe that this allows for better rationalization. It is better to have information hidden from you as it allows you to rationalize and deal with the trauma. Rather than finding out that your son was abused and tortured, you craft this idea in your head that he died an honorable death in the battlefield. Rather than finding out that your mother was raped and beaten to death, you believe she died peacefully in your father's arms. Imagination is the antithesis of depression. I finally want to talk about this case that you get from the intro, that these individuals can just forgive and move on because of the wonderful institution that is the TRC. The problem with this case is that forgiveness cannot happen. An apology cannot redeem a person who raped you, who abused you, and who basically messed with your entire life. Maybe a few people will forgive their perpetrators, but for the vast majority of individuals who are not going to look a murderer in your eye, once they say sorry you just go, oh all is forgiven, let me move on with my life. This victim argumentation is massively important because this argumentation is the only argumentation that holds any ground in this debate. The ICTY and TRC are just fundamentally not strong enough to create massive change in society. They're unable to do things that create massive scales of peace or massive scales of conflict. We think that the only large impact in this debate and the only impact that is massively important in this debate is on victims."

Secondly, they tell you about mid-rank generals. But once again, there are two problems with this. One, that you get no analysis as to why mid-rank generals even come to the TRC. And second, that they're unable to prove the comparative to you, that mid-rank generals are not prosecuted under the TRC, that the TRC does not prosecute individuals. Thirdly, proposition tells you a case about finger pointing and how we uniquely bring this idea that we point fingers at each other saying the other person is wrong. The problem with this is that finger pointing is not against ethnicities in our world but rather to wartime leaders. The ICT right specifically focused persecution on leaders and did not label one ethnicity as the bad guy which means finger pointing did not happen in our world. But I also want to flip this argumentation because because the finger-pointing that the leaders did rather reduced ethnic division. This is to say that once you're able to blame the leaders for the conflict and see that they are the fundamental reason why conflicts happen, and that they are the demons that manipulated others to orchestrate feelings, that is when you can vent your anger. The conclusion of this argument, and the conclusion of this debate, is that Team Japan takes this debate in two main ways. First, we protect victims. This is the most important class and this is debate 20. But second, we win on propositions metric on peace. We do not think the ICTY is perfect, but the TRC is a dysfunctional mess of prejudiced individuals that does nothing to solve the post-Yugoslav crisis, to absolve the traumatized individuals, or at the very least to ease their pain, the ICTY was absolutely necessary."

First, on the idea of acknowledgement of oppression, they needed to concede to why acknowledgement of oppression is significantly fundamental when it comes to moving on from these oppressions, when it comes to these victims actually feeling the satisfaction not just seeing these oppressors behind bars. When we're talking about perpetrators continuously denying responsibility of the crimes that they committed and delegitimizing the impact on the victims and sometimes outright denying the occurrence of the crime in general, the comparative then panel is, under side opposition, we get the idea that they have the legitimacy to deny, they have the legitimacy to get in and out of jail and still gain power when we're not seeing actual confessions and other people willingly exposing other commanders. When we gave you the analysis on toxic nationalism and how we decrease that, there was very specific analysis when we were talking about the dynamics in which individuals, when they recognize the existence of the TRC, they now want to protect themselves through exposing other criminals, criminals above them they have been trying to fight for when we're talking about victims um they won't necessarily care enough if the same oppressor simply denied the oppression that happened and still claimed innocence even if he is behind bars they needed to prove why the actual action of them being in jail was enough for all of these people to just nod their head and simply move on from the case and actually be satisfied under our said the house first, we either get confessions in our best case scenario and in our risky scenario, we get a lot of people willingly exposing individuals because they can get away with a lot of things that they were forced to do, as well as the idea of wanting to move on as citizens who are also very affected by the war. But second, on the idea of closure, when we're looking at a mother who saw her son leave and never come back, she will wait 15, 20 years for him to come back, never knowing if he died or not. This is something that keeps them up day and night. This is stress that they cannot deal with, that they do not have mental institutions for them to go and seek help from. Under arson, the house, even if it is very detrimental for these individuals mentally to know about all of these things, in the status quo, I believe that it is very good for these individuals to know about the truth first off on the idea of closure but second very important when we're talking about knowing what happened knowing what others committed to the people you love you can now hold them accountable if I am living in a false reality in which the same oppressor I simply do not know what he committed to the people I love I will not have the incentive to push for justice because I do not know that he raped my mother. I do not know that he kidnapped my son. These are all things that we get under oath in the House."

And I would flip this and tell you that it is if, like, I think that the fact that you use some sort of resources under TRC and ICPY is metric, and given that the local individuals, for instance Bosnians, don't have much money when compared to the UN, they are more likely to harm the old times of harm that they want to talk about on their side of the house. But secondly, I would argue that this ICPY being resource intensive is actually a good thing. Because this means that the UN is actually going to use more resources on doing things like investigation, and doing things like using resources to actually catch criminals, for example. Which is why they simply cannot throw away the buzzwords of resource-intensive and assume it will fly. We would tell you that this is actually a good thing."

Not only is this symmetric, we in fact do it better on our side of the house. Why? Because the biggest difference between ICTOI and TRC is that TRC is locally driven by the people when compared to ICTY which is driven and actually created by the UN and therefore if the western countries actually invest in those kind of ICTY in the first place, they have the maximum incentive to actually want the ICTY to succeed to begin with which is the exact reason why you are more likely to have things like NGOs and UN actually located in the region to begin with, which is why I think their strategy at this point in time is not standing."

ICTY under that, I think individuals do not literally get to choose whether to opt in or not. Milosevic in fact didn't opt in into ICTY, but he was still prosecuted because he was a war criminal. And in fact, what requires opt-in is the TRC on their side of the house. Which is why if they want to talk about opt-in, it is worse on their side of the house. Firstly, but before that I'll take a point."

All of their benefits that they want to talk about on things like recourse or more stories and information and perpetrators acknowledging the crime were contingent on PRC working in the very first place. We tell you two things. First of all, unfeasibility. We want to tell you that the categorical difference between PRC in South Africa and this hypothetical PRC that might happen in Yugoslavia is that when TRC came into place in South Africa, the government was already against the discrimination there. In the comparison, for Yugoslavia, even after the war ended, Milosevic, the war criminal, was still in power until ICTY detained them. I think this answers the question from them, on ICTY. They say, oh it didn't work because Milosevic already died, right? No, because Milosevic was only able to be removed out of the office when precisely because the ICTY actually prosecuted them and detained them, which is why I think we do the implementation better on our side of the house. It simply cannot work. But even if the implementation does work, we tell you that simply it's actually bad strategically for their side of the house, since can tell you that for the Serbians, like literally if you can go to a Serbian court, you have no incentive to actually go to the Bosnian court, right? And therefore insofar as biases exist, I think you are much able or much more likely to actually get amnesties. And insofar as a lot of perpetrators are outside of the country, it is simply not going to work on their side of the house. Secondly, let's break the premise of the government's case because they say perpetrators of the country, it is simply not going to work on their side of the house. Secondly, let's break the premise of the government's case because they say perpetrators"

The first mechanism they throw is that they want amnesty and I think Stacey tells you the reality that most of the crimes are actually under investigated in the first place. But secondly, often the leaders have a massive incentive to hide it and hide the past information which has meant that you cannot get the information on their side of the house. But third of all, I think the reason why you simply don't get prosecuted on either side of the house, even if you don't simply apologize, is because I think the burden is beyond reasonable doubt, and when there's so many evidence and so many information, you simply cannot, like, simply definitely prove that this person committed a crime 10 years ago, which is the exact reason why this person probably, I agree or not, is not not going to say sorry on their side of the house. Then they say social pressure, but this is contingent on this first mechanism. But secondly, even if there are social pressures, people cannot identify who is perpetrators or not. So I think this social narrative is not what we're saying, so thank you. But even if apologies do exist, we tell you that this isn't sincere. And even if it is sincere, victims simply cannot perceive this to be sincere, which is why their lack of response to our first argumentation hits them at its harshest."

The first thing they say is that victims don't want retribution, they want acknowledgement that the rapist admitted that they admit the crime. Just notice how unintuitive that case actually is because according to their logic, I kill your mother and I show you the recording of me killing a mother and I apologize and then the victims aren't going to move on. That's simply so unintuitive right? I think what they want is like a catharsis, the fact that you are able to actually punish them and put them under bars and actually let them go into the same struggling that they have went through which is why I think this is a comparative debate. Second thing they say is that, oh, this, like, justice is simply slow, and that an under-ICTY is so slow. There's two responses. Firstly, this is untrue. The process by which we achieve justice in the ICTY is cathartic in and of itself. The fact is, the fact that Milosevic got sent in the detention center, and the fact that the victim stood up and explained what happened, the fact that a detailed investigation is being conducted in the first place is in and of itself cathartic for the victims even if Milosevic is not going to be sent into prison. But secondly, even if you don't buy that judge, it's a best metric because the TRC can only be placed after the war is over as it is to address the aftermath and to move on. The ICTY started before the war ended. Furthermore, leaders were put into detention centers while waiting for trial, which is why I think, like, ICTY can start before the war ends, which is why I think this is simply better. Finally, they say that, oh, you have more information. Seiji already tells you that more information is actually a bad thing, because I think imagination of you imagining that this, your mother died peacefully, is able to actually give you solace. Finally they say oh this is symmetric right but it's actually not like obviously it's better on their set of them on our set of the house you need to be out compared like a little bit more comparative here just saying that I think you might have some flaws in it is not able to actually win them the debate. But even so even if you finally I want to do some bit of weighing here even Even if they take on some levels of victims, the one mechanism that is simply not responded to at this point in time is this idea that a lot of the victims simply live under trauma, that they are incapable of actually going up into the court. But on our side of the house, when ICQI literally prosecutes one single leader, for example, who is responsible for a lot of the atrocities, that is at the point at which we are able to actually give these kind of like, catharsis to the most vulnerable victims on our side of the house."

              "text": "With that said then, let's dissect this debate in two main flashes. First, on victims. Proposition throws out a lot of material to you. Let's cover each one. They say four things. They firstly tell you that institutions like non-governmental organizations or the United Nations are actively going to invest more resources into this area. Our one and simple response to this is that this is largely symmetric, if not better, in our world. That the incentives for the UN and NGOs to invest in these worlds, in these areas, exist at the very least in both worlds, and therefore NGOs and their existence in these areas are symmetric. Secondly, they claim on, they have the claim on how they get a better historical record. Our response to this is very simple, that a better historical record is contingent on opt-in and support, and that this is not only going to not be possible due to the clarification I gave you earlier, but also the fact that they create this institution across borders and create a multinational TRC actively hampers their ability to create a historical record. Because think about it, gut check this, right? Actively antagonistic leaders of eight nations who were at war for a decade are not going to come together and say, this is what history was. We can agree on what the horrors that were committed during the Yugoslav war. Agreement is not going to happen. This multinational framing harms their case. The third thing you get from proposition is this idea on how they have more information. We prove to you that more information is a bad thing to no response from prop. The fourth claim is that the ICQI is slow, to which we say, well, the process by which we achieve justice, even if it were to be slow, which we also contest, is also massively cathartic. Finally, on apology versus leaders, we've given you multiple mechanisms, but I also just want to kind of gut check this, right? I don't think that a rapist saying, I'm sorry, is going to actively redeem a rape victim, but the person who commanded that person going and being sent to jail, being thrown into a jail cell for the rest of their life, that at the very least brings some amount of more catharsis. But finally, we went on the most important types of victims because victims degree on the spectrum. People who cannot speak up, people who cannot gain justice in propositions world, people who are unable to say this is what happened to me, I need help, this is the type of perpetrator I'm looking for. Those people, those people are the most harmed on proposition and those people can actively get justice uniquely in our world where we have top-down justice systems where we target the leaders. These individuals are the most vulnerable in this debate, these individuals get no justice in proposition. This alone is debate winning. But finally, the second clash on peace is obviously going to our bench because they concede to us in this debate that leaders being in power is bad. And we prove to you from an unengaged argumentation why these leaders can uniquely be ousted in our vote. I think that this argumentation alone can take this debate to crouch to stand on the opposition bench where we actually care about the victims?"

This is true because A, the justice system is criminally overburdened and overstaffed. Judges and justices have too many cases on their docket. They want to get through these cases quickly so that an accused person isn't in jail forever and their lawyer doesn't get mad. B, public defenders are often juggling between dozens of cases on a daily basis, and not to mention they're quite underfunded and intercept. But moreover, prosecutors, DAs, ADAs have electoral and timeframe incentives to tally as many verdicts as possible. They're often in competition for a reelection or appointment when it comes to prosecutors and district authorities. They often have a limited number of years that they can serve in their time frame and their electoral frame, which means they want to squeeze cases in. The last reason why trials are often rushed and overburdened on their side of the house is that the police often face mounting public pressure to get criminals off the streets. These people generally care about their safety. They care about the community that they live in and the children that they care about, which leads to police forces pursuing a promising piece of evidence in the world of"

The second reason why trials are rushed on their side of the house, and I'm willing to take a POI after this, is that evidence is often unavailable, tampered with, or inadmissible. There's a range of situations where a not guilty verdict is reached, not because the person is genuinely innocent. In some sets of cases, the police might mislabel a piece of evidence, for instance, or fail to meet a court timeline to bring up a piece of evidence in discovery. In other cases, a key piece of evidence might be missing. There's not enough time for the police or the public to procure it, such as a dead body, for instance. But in other cases, the witnesses don't want to come forward, or it's the case that they might be a victim of witness intimidation, and they don't want to come forward in this particular time frame. The implication of all of the above framing is that there's a large margin and a large set of morally ambiguous cases where a not guilty verdict is reached out of convenience and moral ambiguity. We fix this. Why is this the case? First of all, police and prosecutors in our set of house can learn from their mistakes. They can meet deadlines that haven't been met in previous trial, and they can reframe their case since they now have time to look at strategy. Second of all, time allows for more evidence to be collected. There's a range of situations in which this is true. Witnesses"

But before I go on to part two, I'm willing to take a PY. If new witnesses come forward or new evidence is discovered or brought before the jury, then we can simply request a retrial on the basis that new evidence has come to light.

This is especially horrible since in these cases where jurors feel a pressure to reach a verdict, they want to go home, they want to go back to their job since juror compensation is low, they want to go back to their family and actually scroll on social media since they're often sequestered in isolated places. In these cases where pressure is high to reach a verdict, juries often resort to their gut instincts, their emotions, their perceptions, their inherent biases, and their racial biases. The fact that a 17-year-old Black youth on their side of the house is probably guilty because of the gut feeling and the fact that this juror wants to go home. We fix this on our side of the house because these are individuals who aren't fully convinced on this person's guilt. These are morally righteous individuals who have some racial tendencies and some racial biases, but out of convenience will cast a guilty ballot on their side of the house. These are individuals who are given a third option on our side of the house who do not need to resort to these emotional and racial biases. The weighing of this argument is simple. Number one, in principle, we should care about legal and moral precision. The criminal justice system is a violent arm of the state that holds a monopoly over violence over us. They can lock us into jail. They can take away our possessions and sequester us from our family and friends. It is the state's responsibility to determine guilt and non-guilt precisely because of the violation and because of the moral tyranny the state holds over us.

This is why this argument is important. Second argument then on the innocent. Even in cases where people are genuinely innocent, these people are deemed guilty in the court of public opinion. This is true for a number of reasons. Number one, in the process of being convicted, the trial is thus unpublished, the mugshot of a criminal is out there, and people often internalize the fact that this person is someone who is guilty. This is often worse than media sensationalization, where the media wants to portray this criminal as hardened and battle-hardened. Second of all, the average person understands that if someone is not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, they often cast a non-guilty. There's a very high bar for guilt, which is why people, for safety reasons and self-protection reasons, err on the side of caution and assume that this individual is a guilty person. We've missed this structurally because individuals who are certain over their guilt can be free from an employer who assumes guilt, can be free from a neighbor, for instance, who doesn't want a relationship with them, because these are individuals who are genuinely innocent, who are exonerated from the court of public opinion. In both sides of the house, innocent people face ambiguity, but on our side, many people are truly exonerated when there's this third option for morally ambiguous cases. This means that on our side of the house, these individuals who are genuinely innocent can get a job, can get a relationship, and that doesn't occur in the world of opposition.

              "text": "I want to immediately clarify at the top of this debate, in terms of threshold and their misunderstanding of the criminal justice system's incentives. Because in status quo, the threshold for criminal conviction is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is because, as they say, we recognize the punishment is so secure and recognize the lifetime stigma that comes about with an individual getting a guilty verdict which is why the justice system in status quo believes in innocent until proven guilty. On proposition even though a person may not go to jail they still lower the threshold for an individual to get a verdict that is anything except for a not guilty verdict by providing this third option. We think that what this third option does is maintain all the stigma of a guilty verdict without any of the ability to hold this or for this individual to get some sort of redress. That is the harm here. On counterfactual, I want to make it clear that calling for a mistrial exists on our side of the house. So if there has been a tainting of evidence, a problem with the jury, you can throw evidence out and reconsider evidence and redo the trial. This is because by the time you come to a verdict, you have to assume that all evidence has been considered. On proposition, even if there is no change to the evidence itself, they are still fine with retrying a case. On our side of the house, if new evidence is brought up, you can always bring that case up again with new witnesses. And this isn't just limited to prosecutors as they would have you claim. There are bunches of instances in mass majority of instances where this is done by defendants look at the innocence project for example that seeks to do this three quick points"

We think that the presence of the double jeopardy principle is a good thing because it is that that prevents abuse by the state. It is that that prevents an individual who has been deemed not guilty from constantly being put back into trial where there is no new evidence brought up to create some sort of doubt. Second response is as to their argument on the two instances of a trial. First, we consider resource limitation in the instance where they say in non-guilty verdicts there's trial rushed, but you don't get rid of that overburdening of the system on their side of the house. We will prove through argumentation that it gets much, much worse. All their problems with missing evidence can be accounted for in a mistrial, but we think that they concede ambiguity here. We will thus prove in argumentation that it is better when ambiguous for an individual to get a not guilty verdict than it is for them to get a not proven verdict. Second, in terms of the second group of instances where people are considered guilty by default, second, the response is that this simply isn't untrue. This goes against the incentives of the justice system, which is to ensure that people have a very high bar for being considered guilty. But if we're able to prove that biases get worse on proposition, we're able to get rid of all of the analysis. The second argument very clearly clashes with my second, so I'll deal with it there and do the weighing there. Before my argumentation go.

              "text": "of the house. I want to make it clear that jurors have preconceived notions of dependence even if you lack sufficient evidence. This is because of subconscious bias regarding an individual's race or religion, media bias that wants to do things like fear-monger, the fact that people overestimate their own abilities to intuit a person's guilt. On our side of the house, juries cannot act upon these biases for three reasons. One, they have to rationalize their decision when they present it to the court in terms of coming to a conclusion. Second, jury selection is done by lawyers in order to ensure that there is a prevention of bias within jurors. Three, there are checking mechanisms to ensure that any form of egregious bias within a court is taken out. For example, you're able to get rid of a juror if they exhibit some sort of bias, which means there is no ability to deem an individual guilty on our side of the house if they lack evidence, and it is more than likely that they are going to be considered not guilty. On their side of the house, what they do is introduce a third option. What does this mean? In an instance where there is a lack of evidence, you allow juries to use their own intuition to justify gaps and bump up an individual's verdict from not guilty to not proven and they are able to do this because they are able to rationalize this by saying we don't have the evidence but it is likely that this person is guilty. I feel that this person is guilty. Therefore, we're going to bump them up from not guilty to not proven. Prosecutors also have an incentive to do this on their side of the house because bumping up the verdict from not guilty to not proven betters their own reputation. So they are more likely to appeal to these biases, such as racial biases and ethnic biases. The conclusion of this argument is that more people are likely to be racially profiled and receive a not proven verdict where they would otherwise get a not guilty verdict. This is bad because in most cases if you lack evidence it more than likely means the person is innocent. If witnesses are unsure if it was the same person, if you cannot find evidence like bloody footprints, it is more than likely considered that that person is innocent. This is an instance where there is a state failure. The state has a duty to collect all the evidence it can and prosecute this person. It is unjustified to punish the accused on the basis that the state is unable to do its job. But we think this hurts the underprivileged the most because there is likely to be a double standard. A white person with a not proven verdict is likely to be seen as innocent, but as a black person with a not proven verdict is more likely to be seen as guilty, preventing them from doing things like accessing job opportunities. On our side of the house, when you have a not guilty verdict for both a black and white person, it is much harder for those racial biases to seep out in employment. But the second thing is just to force more minorities into jail. If you can constantly retry this, think about what this means for poor people who can't afford legal representation over the long term. What this means is that you're more likely to force them into things like plea deals because they have to go through more and more trials and over time they won't be able to afford it, putting more black people in jail and fueling the prison industrial complex. The conclusion of this argument is that this policy just enables racism and leads to a less fair justice system."

They can see that in almost every country, district attorneys in charge of prosecution are elected, which means that at the end of an electoral cycle, they want to get re-elected. What this does on their side of the house is create an incentive to retry only the not proven cases of those that will yield the greatest public attention. A Tamil man in Sri Lanka, for example, is much more likely to be tried by a district attorney than a Sinhala man is. What this does is allow the state to constantly hold the not proven verdict over someone's head this is the same harm as double jeopardy because of the coercive effect of this threat in terms of the mental health that this person knows that there's always a chance that they could be pulled back into court the inconvenience of constantly having to go back to court the bias that you create in terms of their community all exists what is the conclusion of this argument you create an incentive to put more people under the threat of a retrial and thus create greater harms to people who are accused of crimes, more likely than not racial minorities. I want to make it clear that giving a person a not proven verdict is not an absolvance of their crime or an absolvance of their guilt in the court of public opinion. More likely than not, this is more likely to ensure that an individual who lacked the evidence is going to be put in a situation where the public sees them as worse than they actually are. On our side of the house, you have a stamp on your name that says that you are not guilty, which means that the bias that you talk about is likely to be less so because you are less able to override that than you are able to put your own personal biases on the idea of not proven.

Second of all, I'll talk to you about the constructive issues in terms of how justice is applied and whether that's precise. And then third of all, I'll talk to you about the deals. On the first issue, the Flambeau's core response to much of our case is that if new trial and things like that exist, they can always bring up a new trial in their world. And thus, they try to mitigate our harms in terms of new evidence emerging. The first thing to know is this is vaguely tense with other things they say in their own case. So they themselves concede that double jeopardy is a standard that exists in most Western or most liberal court systems. And they say it's good, which presumably suggests there's a significant margin of cases in which there is some barrier in order to be able to retry that case. I also just don't think they deal with a lot of the reasons that we gave you from first in terms of why this legal standard is very common. The fact that most legal systems evolved during periods of time where the government was perceived to be corrupt or illegitimate, where there wasn't sufficient public will in order to have a higher standard of justice. And that meant that most legal systems disproportionately favored the defendants getting off not guilty in a way that suggests that retrials are difficult. This also applies in terms of things like the resource incentives of prosecutors or of legal systems to not retry these cases. And that is less strong in a world where there is a norm of these retrials being an option in every single case. The first, the other, and the last thing to note is that even in a situation where they can still have retrials, it's far less likely that this evidence emerges to begin with. We suggested in first that the fact that there is a not proven guilt verdict means that you have, means that you have some ambiguity, which means that police and other forces are likely to continue looking into new evidence emerging. They suggest there are reputational incentives to continue looking for this evidence. But the point is that under their own framing, you are conclusively convinced that this person is definitely innocent. So there's no reason why you continue to look in those areas, given that there is a direct trade-off between the places and resources that could be spent in other areas, for example. And even people within local communities, under their characterization, which is that you are deeply convinced that an innocent person is in fact innocent, means that you're unlikely to keep thinking about that case. It's unlikely to be prominent in the media. And as a result, less evidence emerges in their world. The last thing to say is that there's a clear margin in terms of how retrials apply in either world. So appeals are not a sufficient mechanism for them to use here because it requires the defendant to push against a legal system, which often requires things like resources and money in order to launch an appeal. Whereas in our world, it is something that prosecutors can engage in automatically. So there is a margin there. The last thing that they say in terms of stance is that there are going to be lots of retrials and financially disprivileged people won't be able to afford it. I think our stance dealt with this in terms of why the judge is going to mediate which cases of retrials go through. This is similar to existing mechanisms where judges have to go into trial first. There probably is a standard. There has to be things like new evidence or new norms that mean that a trial is necessary. But lastly, I'll just note that lots of our case exists regardless and needed more response in terms of why it is that biased juries and ambiguous cases over prosecute people. So talking then about their first claim in Toronto's case, they say before where a verdict would have been innocent, now it will be not proven due to some underlying incentives in juries to be indecisive. And as a product of that, these people will face more social stigma. The first thing to note is that I think that there's a bit of, this argument lacks a bit of coherency in terms of what the psychological issues with juries are, because we give you contrasting material in terms of why juries are often risk averse to things like violent crime occurring in their own communities, which means you are more biased towards promoting a guilty verdict in those cases. But second of all, this argument is clearly hinged on them proving that there is a significant margin in terms of the social stigma that exists between a not proven and an innocent verdict. The core thing to note here is that a not proven verdict in a case where, terms of its social perception is not really that different in terms of the way that not guilty verdicts are perceived right now. Which is to say in the current world, given the level of ambiguity that both teams exist, agree to exist in this world, a not guilty verdict is just not that meaningful. Because people know that there is such a high standard of reasonable doubt in trials that someone who receives a not guilty verdict could in fact actually be guilty. The fact that the media has already reported on these cases taking place, even if the person doesn't eventually get prosecuted, the fact that people in those communities see the trial going on and know that a person, even regardless of the eventual verdict being not guilty, that there is some ambiguity on that crime existing. The key thing to note is that people are risk averse in most cases. Even in a situation where the justice system has said that someone is not guilty, they would rather in a case of employment, hire someone who has never been through that trial process to begin with. And it is usually quite easy to find that information either in a retrospective sense, where communities were small, and you knew about all the trials going on around you, or in a modern sense, where there's more access to information for things like social media and the internet in a way which means you know that people went through those trials. So the margin in terms of social stigma is very small here because the current result of not guilty is not meaningful in the minds of most employers and stuff like that. We bring you two contrasting pieces of content which I'll deal with after the Q&A. What is comparatively worse for your reputation? A non-guilty stamp on your record or the idea that you were definitely guilty but there just wasn't enough evidence to convict you? So I just don't think this is comparative to our second argument. What we suggested is that there is some pool of people who are going to get a not guilty or an unproven verdict. In your world, everyone within that pool is branded with the same social stigma of ambiguity existing under a not guilty verdict. In our world, the people who are not proven are subject to some social stigma which is similar to that. That we can see. But what is distinct is that there is a pool of people who receive a not guilty verdict in our world, which is actually made meaningful by the fact that you've been conclusively proved innocent, rather than just the jury kind of not knowing what was happening, and you could have actually been guilty in that case. Talking about our constructive case then, we said, first of all, there are guilty people who do not face justice in their world due to the emergence of new evidence. And second of all, even absent their stuff on retrials, the fact that social norms evolve. So for instance, a few decades ago, it might've been the case that sexual assaulters were considerably under prosecuted by the justice system because of jury's biases. But in a world where you can push that as a reason for retrial after a not proven verdict, it's far more likely that a more progressive jury is likely to favor that. This also applies in situations where political or organized crime contexts evolve over time. So in the immediate aftermath of crime or conflict, people are probably unwilling to testify because there are things like a direct threat of retaliation. But when these situations evolve and that group loses dominance, it means that more people are likely to testify under the retrial, which means they're able to hold people to account in the long run. Secondly, and this was the part that was least contingent on the model fiddler, that in cases of marginalized people, prejudiced people tend to defer towards guilty verdicts because they're risk-averse and don't want people they perceive as dangerous to exist in the community. All opposition says here is that there are checks on biases, but these were insufficient because it was difficult to find out what is inside people's psyche. And the core characterization was that jurors, for example, were not actively racist or malicious, but they were, they were willing to consider rationality initially, but our bias instincts are often strongest in cases where we don't know what to do and are pressured by the clock. This is why the highest degree of job discrimination happens between candidates that are competitive or why the police tends to commit more brutality in fast-paced, intense moments compared to relaxed ones where things are more clear. Because it is stress and indecision that activates our underlying racial biases, cases where we don't know what to do. But even on a psychological level, you are less likely to process things rationally in a situation where you feel rushed. And that means that in all of these cases, there is pre-existing bias that map onto this, where in our world, they could have just said what they thought, which is the trial was ambiguous and being satisfied with that decision. The weighing here is important. We think precise justice internal to the legal system is far more important than social effects for two reasons. Firstly, the state has unique moral obligations towards citizens to distribute punishment fairly. The state has immense power over people through the police, through courts, and through a complex network of prisons and cages, and subjecting people to these structures unjustly is worse than whatever exogenous social factors happen in society, because the same power differential does not exist. Second of all, state punishment is more concrete and permanent than social stigma. If you are unemployed on the small margins of social stigma that opposition accesses, you can do things like go to different jurisdictions where you're less clear or participate in social programs. Whereas if you are psychologically damaged by a prison, that is irreversible. Imprecise justice is permanent injustice. We are very proud to oppose."

Thanks. you I think you guys in in this debate to identify the two groups that the two sides are trying to talk about because they're quite distinct. Proposition seems to be talking about guilty people that otherwise would have received an innocent verdict and who you would not be able to retry, receiving a not proven verdict which extends that trial in such a way that you're able to gather new evidence and retry them at a later date. The kinds of people that we are talking about are people that are innocent of the crimes that they have been convicted of. But because there is inconclusive evidence where they otherwise would have received an innocent verdict on the basis of inconclusive evidence, you allow juries to step in and rationalize making a decision despite the lack of evidence on the basis that they are merely giving this person a not proven trial and not convicting them of the crime and therefore they can rely on their own intuition to do so. The way in between these two groups is clear. Even if both sides benefits"

Firstly, massive improvements in technology have meant that we have access to more material evidence than ever. DNA that people inevitably leave behind at the crime scene. Eyewitness reporting, which has become more accurate over time as we have gotten psychologists to be able to vet people. Evidence to things like CCTV and closed circuit cameras that is more accessible, particularly in urban cities where people are constantly being monitored inadvertently as a result of this but fourthly the incentives of law enforcement generally they want to put people behind bars and prevent criminals from re-entering society which means that in the short time that is available to them there's a massive incentive to gather as much evidence as possible hence why the police force does things like go out and talk to witnesses or contacts the media to be able to do things like distribute flyers with a person's name and face on it. I would add to this, given that trials are retrospective, all evidence is technically available, it's just that it has to be discovered at some point in time. And finally,"

Hence, the reason for why proposition wants this not proven verdict, which is to extend the trial, only applies in a minority of cases. Comparatively, there are many instances where people who are innocent of crimes are convicted of a crime that they did not commit there might be some evidence such as eyewitness testimony which is incredibly unreliable but there is also other evidence which goes and contradicts the fact that this person is at the scene of the crime or that they committed the crime note that this is the vast majority of crimes given their own incentives about how law enforcement wants to do things like over police particular communities for these people they are left the most vulnerable when a not proven verdict is allowed because of the analysis that we made in our first speech, which is that you"

              "text": "empower juries to disregard evidence and rely on their own intuition. So on vain, we already want this clash. This makes me into direct responses. The first thing that I want to respond to in this speech is what the conditions are for retrials to be made possible on our side of the house. Firstly, I want to point out in their first speech, they concede that when new evidence is brought to light, you are obligated as the state to conduct a read trial because at the point in time when you came to the prior conviction, you were not making that decision on the basis of all the evidence that was available. Clearly, this is not the kind of big big ambiguous spectrum that proposition wants to talk about. There's a clear binary between having a piece of evidence and not having that piece of evidence, as is true with DNA evidence that in many instances exonerates people of crimes that they were convicted of. So clearly, there's an ability to identify when new evidence needs to be brought to light. But aside from that, there are three structural reasons why in many instances, re-trials will be made possible if new evidence is brought to light. Firstly, if it is true that there are guilty people who have received innocent verdicts and are walking away scot-free, the justice system and the state has an incentive to guarantee that a retrial occurs because these people are more likely to re-offend in the future, given that they have managed to get away with it once before and they're life would be part of things like organized crime. So clearly in instances where there's insufficient evidence and people receive an innocent verdict, there's an incentive to retrial. In instances where people are innocent of the crime, but they are convicted guilty, your defendants can in many instances appeal for a retrial, such as through things like the Innocence Project, which I would point out comes at no monetary cost to the people who are involved in those trials, given that it is a volunteer organization. So clearly there are opportunities for people to appeal. In many instances even the most amateur lawyers have the ability to do this. The third thing that I want to point out is that if new evidence exists there is massive public scrutiny on the state to guarantee that people are given a fair trial given that without doing this the state puts itself at massive legal liability for unjust imprisonment on the basis that new evidence has come to light but that the state is failing to regard this evidence and give people a retrial therefore unjustly holding them under convictions that have been made redundant so there's legal exposure that the state wants to limit hence why they will allow retrials this massively outframes a lot of propositions case because their claim about legal ambiguity is entirely symmetric in a world in which retrials are possible but But I want to respond to it anyway. They say that because there's legal ambiguity on their side of the house, it is necessary that retrials are always made an option. I have two responses to this argument. The first is that there is still an ability to account for this legal ambiguity, even when the possibility of retrials is not made available, because the state is still able to control things like what particular point in time in which it chooses to launch a case against an organized crime syndicate, for example. So you often, over years and a long period of time, accumulate enough sufficient evidence to be able to do things like prosecute organized crime bosses because you know that it is necessary that once you get into a trial, you receive a guilty verdict for that particular charge. So I think the incentive to prematurely pursue trials is already limited. Comparatively, on their side of the house, law enforcement is far more likely to launch premature trials because they know that they have an inexhaustible ability to continue to try people on the basis that they can simply push the jury to give a not proven verdict. So trials become less efficient on their side of the house. I want to directly compare their material then to our material, given that I've already outframed it and proved"

              "text": "by ours is the majority burden. We told you that in a world in which many innocent people are often convicted of crimes where there is some evidence that they might have died, but a majority of evidence that suggests it isn't, juries must rely on the available evidence in order to come to conclusions. Because the counterfactual is one in which they rely on the available evidence in order to come to conclusions because the counterfactual is one in which they rely on things like subconscious biases and their intuitions what are these subconscious biases firstly racial and gender profiling we believe that men are more violent or that minorities are more violent because the media also chooses to sensationalize and fear monger through things like the overreporting of crime statistics but thirdly many jurors in a world in which a not proven verdict is made available to them are likely to defer to their own authority as armchair psychologists because they think that the court has given them the ability to disregard the fact that there's insufficient evidence and rely on their own intuition in order to come to particular decisions. So you are far more likely to see a world in which people do things like rely on the reactions that people have in court as a way to justify their particular decision. They say that people are risk averse, but it is precisely for that reason that you will rely more on your intuition. To give a not proven verdict where you otherwise think a minority criminal who otherwise would have gone completely free on an innocent verdict is now at least vested with the stigma of receiving a guilty verdict. Comparatively, on our side of the house, people have far less discretion. Judges have to justify their decisions in a world in which they make the convictions, and there's the ability to guarantee that jurors who disregard evidence are cause for retrial on our side of the house as well. Finally, on their side of the house, they burst in the incentives of prosecutors because they are more likely to shorten trials. Prosecutors can rationalize a large volume of not proven verdicts as a net win, given that clearing the docket is the priority in a world in which the criminal justice system is overburdened. This is uniquely harmful, because you get shorter trials on their side of the house, where the prosecution itself doesn't have an incentive to explore the full extent of the evidence, because they know at a later point in time, if the DSO chooses to do so, you can always retry these cases. Victims of crimes are uniquely vulnerable in instances of criminal trials because they rely on the state to effectively prosecute criminals. In a world in which you create worse incentives for prosecutors to shorten trials and pursue not proven verdicts, you are less likely to get justice for victims. For all these reasons, oppose it. Thank you for that speech. We welcome the third speaker of the problem. Hello, am I audible? Great. I'll take verbal POIs. Starting in three, two, one."

              "text": "Opposition hinges their entire positive benefit in this debate on a simple link that they never prove. And that link is why in the status quo, a not guilty verdict where you are assumed to be grouped in as an innocent person with anybody who has ever been let go due to a procedural failure, due to an error in technology or to a bad prosecutorial strategy, why that status is so much better than being labeled as not proven. That's all their positive benefits. If we deal with that link, we win this round. Two themes then in this round, firstly on the precision of legal methods and secondly on social stigma. So on social stigma or on legal precision, I think there's a quibble on the model here where we say double jeopardy means retrials are unlikely or impossible in many contexts. Now they say, well, you can get retrials on RCD. So I want to note that when it's convenient for them, they admit that there are pretty big barriers to retrials in the status quo, right? At the end of the last opposition speech, they say prosecutors won't try in trials because they know they can retry these trials anytime, which seems to concede that there's a difference on both sides of the house as to how easy it is to get a retrial. And we think this is a really important concession that they make, because in order for retrials to be possible and that they have to be effective, you need the people who make trials possible to consider retrials as a likely opportunity. What does that mean? Well, as we tell you right out of first and down bench, you need people to retain evidence in police evidence lockers and maintain it. You need people to continue investigations, maintain records of Wistis testimony, retain records of like original investigations. You need people who are on the force with this knowledge, and if they retire, passing that knowledge on in the case of a retrial. And so we think in many cases, even if it's technically possible on their side to get a retrial, if you try to do a retrial a few years down the line, you're just not going to have the basis to do it anymore because they're so rare and so uncommon. But the second thing to note under this model issue is massive parts of our case, unlike what they say, are not in any way dependent on us winning this point, right? We say maybe you get retrials for new evidence, and that does make some of our case symmetric. But what is not symmetric? One, you can't have a retrial because new technology developed, right? And this is a pretty big margin, right? On their side, they have to defend not reopening trials with access to new DNA analysis, with access to fiber analysis of different ropes and fragments. Secondly, we say you can't open a retrial because your prosecutor used a bad strategy or because they hired a very expensive lawyer that intimidated whoever the public prosecutor was. And so we think there is some margin here on precision of proving verdicts. So we think we do succeed in establishing a benefit on getting people who are guilty sentenced to the jail they need and making people feel safe."

We say there is also a case where in the status quo, due to the ambiguity of the trial system, people are sentencing others guilty in situations where they would rather do it non-proven. I note that this directly engages with a big part of their case about when they say that racist people are going to move people from not guilty to not proven on our side. We say because juries in many cases are racist or exist in racist communities, because they might be morally disgusted with a defendant, even if they don't believe they committed the crime, because they just want to go home and make a clear verdict or because they're in a jury room and being peer pressured by the loudest voice in the room. There are many instances where in cases of ambiguity, they might rule on the side of guilty. But on our side, the burden or the barrier to do this is much, much higher. Because when you have the option of representing your ambiguity with a not proven verdict, you're much harder to pressure. Why is that? Well, A, if you're being pressured by your community to bring in an offender, maybe they're racist and the defendant is Black. Maybe they are really concerned about the crime and they want to see somebody get punished for it. If you have a not proven verdict, you have a shield, right? You say the government gave me this option to say if the case wasn't made well, it wasn't made well. I had to do this. There's ambiguity. But you cannot defend an innocent verdict in the same way. The second thing to note here is that even internally on the inside, when people feel a great deal of doubt, their biases might allow them to act out in a binary situation if they have to choose between total innocence and total guilt. But if they are confused and we give them an opposite to represent confusion, we think it's pretty simple that in many cases they're simply going to choose to represent that confusion. And that's a really big impact in this round, right? Because there are many, many cases that crimes, despite what they'll have you believe, are ambiguous. And in these cases, we ensure that people who should not go to jail, who should not face 20-year life sentences or something, do not go to jail on our side. And I want to engage with their weighing here. So they say, we are talking about a group that is given retrials, not proven cases, and they're talking about a group of innocent people who moved to not proven. So I want to engage with this big point now as I move into a theme about social stigma. They say the reason that they should win on this theme is that guilt is conclusive in"

The second thing to note is their mechs under this point are quite bad. They say, firstly, technology allows us to establish crime in all cases, right? This is obviously not true in a retrospective motion. It's not true in the status quo. There are not cameras in every street corner. The second thing they say is law enforcement want convictions. Yes, but as characterized right out of first, law enforcement is overburdened. They don't have the time to sentence every case. They're going to have to rush some cases, misfile paperwork, and they're not going to get all those convictions. But there's also a general response here, which is just that if you think about the crimes that are committed, right, murders in a secluded forest, robberies that occur where a witness doesn't see anything, right, carjackings, these things don't necessarily occur around technology. There's no like reason they give why there's evidence left behind in every single case. And we think just the inherent nature of how crime can occur at any time, anywhere, by anybody is a likely mechanism for why there's ambiguity. Before I move on, I'll take a PY. Our claim was that in most instances where people are actually guilty, there is likely to be sufficient evidence. On the other hand, there are many instances where there is some evidence to prove that somebody might possibly be guilty of a crime, but there is countervailing evidence in instances where you give juries the discretion to do so. I'll respond to this. So I think I just responded to why there's always evidence of somebody's guilty of a crime. And I said, why that's not true. The second thing to note here is a point on weighing. And I think this is a central theme in this debate, right? They have rested a lot of their positive benefits on expecting you to believe that moving someone from a not guilty verdict to a not proven verdict, maybe in the case of minorities, maybe just generally is a really bad thing. And we just don't think that's true. We framed two in second and first, and this isn't"

Why is the slightest suspicion more that you're guilty with a not proven verdict? Why does that change anything in your life? Are employers really less likely to hire you based on this tiny margin? Are people really less likely not to talk to you based on this tiny margin? No. But on our side, when we get rid of all that ambiguity for a specific group of people, these people are able to fully re-engage in normal life. They're able to experience the benefits of innocence as if they had never committed that crime. So we think we outweigh them here on a social stigma point because we actually produce effects for the most vulnerable actors who are in many cases victims of police bias who have now been conclusively proven to be innocent. Now I just want to provide a big piece of weighing between this idea of legal precision, of getting guilty people in jail and innocent out of jail versus their idea of social stigma which is what their case rests on why should you care about our impacts more than theirs well the first weighing mechanism we give you is the state is inflicting violence on people and is a responsibility to not use violence improperly the state is not directly responsible for how people respond to its sentences it is directly responsible for the sentences it levies. Secondly, the harms of failures of justice are massive. Letting murderers walk the streets and reoffend is a disaster. Putting people in jail for 20 or 25 years for something they didn't do is a disaster. No social or reputational harm can outweigh carceral violence. And then thirdly, we think that to some extent people have a civic duty to prioritize legal precision. People value laws, they value their right to a trial, and that means if they have to experience a trial or be accused themselves, that's a price they have to pay for these rights that we value highly. And so we think you should always lay legal precision over social stigma in this round. For those reasons, proud to propose."

First, states have incentives to reduce the amount of recidivism that goes on in society and reduce the probability that crime occurs in the future. The very analysis they gave us that a lot of people are risk averse and are scared of violence by criminals are reasons as to why the state wants to do this if they think someone is guilty. Second, the DA and prosecutors want to look good in order due to things like electoral incentives because you want to be the next DA that's elected in. Prop 1 concedes this. I would note that allowing people who the public and jurors think are guilty to go free probably reflects bad on that record.

What this debate is crying for is a better characterization about the types of juries we are talking about, given that both sides haven't come to a consensus on it. Let's dissect the types of juries that Proposition wanted to talk about. First, juries that are extremely risk-averse. You don't want to send criminals out in the community because they may harm your family. I would note that if these are the juries that Proposition characterizes as a majority, in these juries, you are still not going to get the not proven result because to these individuals, if they vote not proven, it means the person who they deem to be guilty will still be out there in society and has the ability to re-offend. So for these types of juries, they are probably going to default to the binary of guilty or not guilty. But second, juries that make the decisions on the basis of convenience. Like I don't care if this man goes to jail for 70 years, I want to get on Instagram. I just want to note that these scenarios are highly unlikely. One, due to the moral conscience people have. You know that at the end of the day, if you imprison someone, it's their entire livelihood. It's their family that's going to go to waste why people who are morally empathetic and just have certain subconscious biases like vincent says are going to resort to this just to go through their social media is unclear to me second even as a juror or a judge which they completely know by the way you still want to avoid things like massive backlash and criticism like judges don't want to have the impression that they keep on giving incorrect decisions within court for the sake of things such as convenience, given that it affects things such as promotions. Jurors don't want massive backlash from the public in the aftermath"

              "text": "of cases. So then what are the majority of jurors and judges and juries we're talking about in this debate? These are probably people who care about fair criminal justice outcomes. However, there are subconscious biases that are pre-engaged into these individuals. So for example, you may not be racist, but the fact that the media keeps reporting that black people are more violent than white people makes you develop those subconscious biases on both sides of the house. So these are likely to be the majority of juries we are talking about let's then dissect this debate to the two outcomes that could occur first people who are actually innocent on either side of the house i would note that there are structural reasons as to why if there is insufficient evidence to hold someone guilty they won't be held guilty this is due to three reasons first states and the incentive to hold someone guilty they won't be held guilty this is due to three reasons first states and their incentive to hold things such as these standards of evidence because if people who don't meet that requirement are going to keep on getting imprisoned that is massively harmful for the state the way it looks on individuals given that opposition then character themselves characterized that states want to maintain the criminal justice system in order for electoral incentives. Second, jury consensus. Even if there are a few members of the jury who think it's within their discretion to imprison these individuals even when there is insufficient evidence, jury consensus where not even one individual can vote guilty is something that enables individuals to come to a correct decision. Finally, there are checks and balances on juries. Like the most racist individuals are probably not going to be within juries, given that lawyers can go through the selection process before a trial. I would note then that because people have a basic moral conscience, if they are unable to come to terms with whether or whether not individuals are guilty and there is insufficient evidence they would rule innocent however these subconscious biases that exist that we characterize to you from first or second enable these individuals to come to another decision which is not proven and proposition themselves hinges their case on this being the majority of scenarios very quickly i want to weigh why this is the majority of scenarios, because the probability that these biases exist in society is something proposition concedes to, but the probability that the smallest technicality goes wrong, like police misdating evidence, is highly unlikely, given the checks and balances we have on the police system, given that these people don't want to make those mistakes in order to avoid being fired. The only response they have here is ah but even if you're proven innocent on your side of the house people are going to still still think you're guilty so it's a very marginal huh if you are given the decision not proven you are damned because that is a confirmation of guilt without you going to prison it is basically you telling society that these people indeed are guilty, we just didn't have any enough evidence to subject them to the prison system. So I would note that the decision is far more definitive on proposition and given that the majority of people who are innocent get this decision, it's harmful. Because when you are completely exonerated, you can still have things like ties with your family who are less likely to doubt you because they have close bonds with you. Importantly, you can still have things like ties with your family who are less likely to doubt you because they have close bonds with you. Importantly, you still have a better chance of hiring because companies can justify it on the basis of your merit given that you have been proven innocent. On the inverse and where I want to finish weighing this clash, let's assume juries are as perverse as proposition makes them out to be. That is a reason as to why when people are actually guilty, juries will default to the decision of not proven because you do not see the white man going to jail if you can give him a decision that confirms moral ambiguity but doesn't restrict his freedoms. For all these reasons, oppose."

Within criminal courts in the status quo operate on a binary. Either the defendant being trialed is guilty or they aren't. The problem is that when it comes to criminality, it isn't as clear as black and white because more often than not, there isn't necessarily CCTV footage in all instances which shows a person in the act when the crime was taking place. We think more often than not, in the wake of a crime, there's also insufficient evidence to concretely prove that someone is guilty of the crime. Given that there are many grey areas, we think it's easy for it to be exploited. Because when there's insufficient evidence, you have either one of two instances. The first, either judges or juries feel that the defendant isn't guilty because they might look a certain way or talk a certain way, meaning they let them escape, or they are far too punitive and default to their own subjective biases and decide that the person is guilty, locking them up in prison to waste away. We think therefore, given that inaccuracies exist in how the criminal justice system delivers punishment, because we force a decision within the binary system, we think it doesn't necessarily reflect the details of the case.

Because in the instances where there's insufficient evidence, but reasonable belief that someone may be guilty of a crime, we can retrial this individual, but we have the additional benefit of more time. Why is this pertinent? Because we think in the duration of the first trial and the second trial, the prosecution is able to gather more evidence for them to decisively prove that this individual is guilty. For instance, whether or not we can prove or find new DNA that pinpoints the crime to the perpetrator could be pivotal. We're able to convince more witnesses to come testify in the second trial who could be pivotal in the outcomes of the case. But the final part is extremely important. We think we're able to afford the most accurate adjudication of justice. We're not saying that individuals have to be convicted in the second trial. But we think that even after the additional time provided, and if you do in fact reach the same verdict, at the very least, the judge or the jury has absolved themselves of making an inaccurate decision simply because in the second trial, we had more evidence to weigh on. We think in the instances where we did in fact reach a guilty verdict, at the very least, we didn't allow another criminal to be released into society and potentially harm more individuals in the future. Before I move on to the very least, we didn't allow another criminal to be released into society and potentially harm more individuals in the future. Before I move on to the second argument, I'll be happy to take a point. Let me be clear. You cannot support the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. The presumption on U.S. and the House is you're guilty except for the fact that we haven't found the evidence to prove you yet. So even if that may be the case, we think that when you have more evidence in the second trial,"

We think the premise of this argument is far more realistic in dealing with the status quo, which is that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, but under opposition, its unique flaws are exacerbated simply because you only have one shot to determine whether or not an individual is guilty or not. There are two parts then underneath this argument. The first, why do we think that there are simply structural flaws when it comes to the perception of guilt that uniquely exists under a binary system? We identify three biases that judges or juries uniquely fall into the trap of. Firstly, racial biases, because when a Black or white person is typically charged for the same crime, we think a Black person is far more likely to be locked up simply because they look to be more predisposed to committing a crime. But secondly, things like socioeconomic status. So rich individuals are perceived to be more compliant to laws just because they might dress a certain way. Or thirdly, a show of emotion during these trials. So people who show vulnerability by crying during the court case are seen to be far more remorseful of their actions when sometimes there's just an arbitrary emotional reaction that might not necessarily prove whether"

              "end": 541.6,
              "text": "someone or not is remorseful of their actions. Within the problem lies when there's a binary system and as a result, you make judges and juries default to these biases. Consequently, people utilize their adjudication to reach false convictions. In the US, for instance, cases which are found to be false after conviction disproportionately affect those who are poor and Black. We think when the evidentiary standard isn't beyond reasonable doubt, that is when sometimes we might believe that an individual is guilty and lock them away. Or because of our other biases, you perceive them as less guilty of a crime because they look far less predisposed to crime. All these instances fall in the middle where we are adjudicating whether or not someone is guilty of a crime. But secondly, and more importantly, within prosecution teams on the side of op, go for attainable justice rather than proportional moral justice. What exactly does attainable justice look like? Within the prosecution has to decide based on the evidence they have in terms of the severity of their charge. So for instance, when it comes to first degree murder, you need to prove intent compared to second degree murder, which is just the act. Within the instances where it uniquely fails, opposition can't hold people on trial for the same crime because of a double jeopardy clause that exists within the legal system. That is, you cannot trial a person for the same crime that they were previously said to be not guilty for. Meaning that if you've been found not guilty for first-degree murder, you cannot be trialed for that or anything under that. We think a problem exists because when you have insufficient evidence, you're unable to hold the person accountable in the future, even though you do believe that they're guilty. We think this is simply messed up for reparative justice because opposition sends a message that a punishment is better than none. But the only reason why we're able to not get is because of technicalities, and it's only under the side of proposition where we're able to rectify the flaws in the system we're so proud to propose. I would like to thank the speaker for that"

You'd be not proven. This engages with their characterization that innocence until proven guilty still exists because people don't view you as innocent on their side. It's just that you're guilty, but not just proven yet. This means that their grazel analysis doesn't stand because on our side, you will be innocent because the reasonable doubt burden has been met for guilt, which means on our side, you are seen as innocent. On their side, you aren't seen as innocent. Two, this engages with their new DNA argumentation, right? Retrials note on our side of the house, if you are the prosecution, still exist.

These are known as emotions for a new trial, and they're at least better than being able to do this on default on their side. We agree that double jeopardy is probably something that exists on our side of the house or either side of the house, but know that double jeopardy only exists to the extent which you're trying to retrial someone with the same evidence, with the same circumstance that already existed before. So this is completely out of the debate as a whole. But no, even if they are able to prove that this is only able to exist on the rest of the House, we would just posit to you that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. We think it's completely fine for the state to take longer processes in order for you to find better evidence to be able to get the DNA tested or whatnot before you jump straight into a trial. We think that's just a comparatively better thing for these states to do in the first place so that they aren't able to infringe on people's rights as"

              "text": "a whole. Two, what do we think non-proven is going to look like in court? This is a few things, and this engages with their tool in the toolbox analysis. One, a significant number of cases will be non-proven. This is because if you're a jury, you don't want to deal with the responsibility of handling down a criminal sentence if they're innocent or letting a potential criminal back into society. This is the middle ground that allows them to avoid that responsibility on their side. Two, juries have personal interests to finish the liberation sooner, right? These are people who have been isolated from society for months, not being able to watch TV, not able to go to work, not being able to see their friends so that they remain objective and they just want to go home. This allows them to dodge a lot of the blame that exists on their side of the house because this makes both sides happy. Three, judges are likely to hand down non-proven verdicts as well because they don't want their previous verdicts to be overturned by a higher court because this decreases their own court's legitimacy. A non-proven verdict gets rid of this because it's not black and white anymore, right? A guilty verdict in a higher court doesn't necessarily mean that you're wrong, but rather the lawyer was able to prove it this time. Lastly, if non-proven is an option, the bar for innocence becomes very, very high. This is because if the prosecution calls an eyewitness that already cast some doubt on a defendant's innocence, that's already good enough for them to win. Lastly, how do we think society is going to perceive this? One, we think that non-proven people will struggle from stigmatization. This is because society wants to err on the side of caution and not hire a potential criminal when you can hire just another worker. But two, because they're not definitively innocent, right? There's less social political capital to pass policies that guarantee workplace discrimination or other social discrimination protection for these people as a whole. So a lot of the harm that they talk about will still exist on their side of the house anyway."

              "text": "Well, that said, one, why does this show is a presum the presumption of innocence first why is this presumption of innocence important the first reason is because the state has a lot more power than you do right they have more resources they have the connections they have the police we think the bar high bar of innocence unless proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt acts as a counteracting force to the asymmetry of power that occurs between the state and the average individuals on their side we think the asymmetry of power that occurs between the state and the average individuals. On their side, we think that asymmetry of power between the state and the average individual is magnified when the state can forever try you because one, they have the resources to do so while you might not, but two, innocence is much harder to prove for the defendant as a whole. Second layer then, we think the criminal justice system should presume innocence until proven guilty because of the presumption of goodwill. This is why we have privacy laws, for example, because we presume that people are not hiding something and they have the right to feel safe over the amount of criminal activity we're going to catch. This is because this is just not the prosecution for the prosecutor, but it means that there's a massive infringement on your natural rights if you're proven guilty. You cannot freely move. You cannot speak. This is why we think the bar has to be very high instead of low for proving guilt because the consequences for the people who are proven guilty is very, very severe on their side. Third, let's take it to their best and say that they get the impact of letting people who actually committed a crime have non-proven verdicts instead of innocent ones. This principle is still more important. This is because the legitimacy and the integrity of the system outweighs the outcome of individual trials for the two reasons that we give you above. This is why we give the worst criminals, even though everyone knows they're guilty, a fair trial. But two, this is like a slippery slope, right? This is because when the state can say we can compromise on the presumption of innocence by heightening the bar for the defendant, this is when you also allow the state to use the criminal justice system to achieve its own ends and interests on their side. Secondly, why do they make the criminal justice system worse for those who need it?"

No, we don't think that's true and I'm going to prove to you why in the second argument. And also, moreover, we think this isn't true because you let them get away with giving a not guilty verdict much easier instead of making them discuss and think about whether or not this person is actually guilty on your side. Second, why would we make the criminal justice system worse for those who need it? We have a few layers under this. One, plea bargains get worse for the poor and racial minorities. This deals with the best case scenario on their side when individuals do not, even if individuals get like bad, like get innocent, no, sorry, not proven"

              "text": "endless prosecutions they can forward rhetoric like after you're not proven they'll just try you again and again until they get you we think one this is harmful for individuals who just cannot suffer the brunt of multiple trials because they cannot afford it right for example because they have to work jobs they have to see their family, etc. It means that going to trial for months and months, being suspended from your job, not being able to see your family, which is things that people just generally don't want to do. On our side, plea bargains are bad, but if you know that you're only fighting one trial and you know that you are innocent, you're willing to take that cost to fight it to the extent that you know that your life isn't going to get ruined. Two, this is bad for racial minorities who know that they are innocent, but fear that the jury is going to be prejudiced against them and hand them a non-proven verdict, because it is so easy to do so in comparison to a guilty verdict. Therefore, more innocent people will be willing to sign plea bargains, which forces them to go to prison. The impact of this argument is that innocent people go into prison, which makes them much more stigmatized for society for life. They can't get jobs in the future. They can't get things like public housing, because they have to admit that they were a criminal in the past. Secondly, the prosecution will have an advantage against poor individuals if a retrial happens. There are a few reasons why. One, the prosecution can prepare better for what you're going to say in the future because they've heard their arguments already. Contrary to your public defender who, one, might switch between trials and two, have like 50 trials at hand. Therefore, you give the prosecution an unfair advantage in future trials, which increases the likelihood you will get a guilty verdict. Thirdly, we think if you care about getting the right verdict, we think this gets worse on their side. This is because rich attorneys can get guilty clients off easier on their side by aiming for non-proven verdicts instead of not guilty verdicts. This is like arguing a chain of custody defense instead of actual witnesses to testify for your alibi. For example, if your CEO accused of rape on their side, your attorney is more likely to argue that the rape kit didn't get to the testing center in time instead of proving that you weren't there. We think that rich people are not affected by the stigma that's associated for a couple of reasons. One, they can pay for another trial easier. Two, they can hire PR teams. The impact of this is twofold. One, the dangerous individuals that we believe ought not go back to society because they cause harm do not get the punishment that they get. But two, they can cause harm again, right, which we think is very, very bad based off their own principle and based off their own criteria. For all those reasons, we're very, very proud to stand on up."

              "text": "good outcomes. It's unclear what that means to get more justice on their side. But furthermore, it's also a massive problem-solution mismatch. It's unclear whether the solution towards needing to get more evidence is we're going to punish more individuals and exert stigma. They never proved why this is the legitimate policy. Anyways, two questions to ask. One, on the effectiveness of courts, and secondly, on the impact on individuals. First, on courts. One, on getting justice. The first thing we heard is that it is binary. We're going to prove to you why in both instances of how this gray area manifests on their side, it's worse. Because I think it's reasonable to say that the framing of this debate is in the middle ground, right? It's not the extremely innocent, not the extremely guilty. Their side makes it worse for these individuals on both ends. Because if you're an innocent person in this gray area, you now exert a stigma on people who are absolutely innocent. That violates the principle of innocent towards proven guilty. What you're trying to do on their side is prove that you're assumed to be guilty on their side. That's uniquely bad because it makes innocent individuals astigmatized. That isn't a harm they never responded to. But secondly, even individuals who are guilty are better off on their side. That's uniquely bad because it means innocent individuals are stigmatized. That isn't a harm they never responded to. But secondly, even individuals who are guilty are better off on their side. Because now, for example, if you committed a crime, instead of getting punished, for example, you know, going to jail, which is more likely to happen on our side, on their side, the bar of proof is much lower. So on their side, you are more likely to get away with it on their end, because now you're able to prove yourself as not guilty. You don't have to prove yourself as, you know, absolutely innocent on their end. So their side means people who are actually, you know, did crimes also also more likely to get away. That flips their analysis on saying, you know, we need to protect society because on their end, when you create this gray area, a certain amount of people who aren't innocent are punished. Now, on the argument of biases, we already flipped this very easily, right? Because we told you on their side, it is the individuals who are racial minorities who are already being punished and being harmed. So the demographic in this gray area is more likely to be those who are extremely wealthy. This is the framing we gave you very clearly, which you heard no response to. That already means on their side, the beneficiaries of the policy are those who are wealthy, who are able to use resources to give them even more options, depending on themselves. But we're going to take them at their best. Why is lowering the bar for proof even worse? Because we told you it enables massive state abuse. Because within the gray areas, all the racial biases they talked about are much more likely to manifest because it's very easy for you as a jury to say, you know, you're not guilty, you know, you're not, you're like, you're innocent and you're not innocent, but you're also not guilty, right? It's a very low bar to actually reach. Therefore, racial biases manifest in worse ways on their side. Furthermore, their side makes it much worse in general, right? Because if you are actually guilty, the bar is also lowered for you. So in their example of, you know, Derek Chauvin, he is still going to get a lower bar to get away with it because now he just has to prove he's not guilty. He doesn't have to prove he's absolutely innocent. So on their side, when you lower the bar, those biases manifest in much worse ways because there are more options for you to actually abuse. Now, at their very best, we're going to give you principal argumentation. Let's say on our side, we let some individuals who are guilty out. Why is it still better? Because on their side, you need to punish a large demographic of people who are innocent. That is necessarily bad because the most important principle of the criminal justice system is you are innocent until proven guilty. They violate that when you lower the bar and you punish"

But furthermore, we also proved you that racial biases means you're more likely to be innocent if you're a minority. And if you're wealthier, you're more likely to be seen as guilty. Therefore, on their side, you also disproportionately punish those individuals. So with that principle, we prove that my innocent individual shouldn't be punished. They need to respond with this because Prop 2 neglects this heavily. Now, secondly, on additional justice, right, and this is the main shift from Prop 2, because they say we need more evidence. That's a big problem they outlined, right? Already the impact is quite small here, because that already shrinks a lot of their impacting from first. But furthermore, we told you in the status quo, if you get more evidence, you can retrial, right? So it's unclear whether policy is absolutely necessary, because on our side, if you get significantly more evidence, you have the option to retrial. That already means their entire case has evaporated. But furthermore, even in their best case, let's say they get constant more retrials, they get more retrials in general. Why is this worse on their end? Because we acknowledge that, because first of all, the upshot is relatively small, and that like it's unclear whether these retrials lead to good consequences, because they don't prove where you're going to get much more evidence. We told you evidence in general is quite difficult to acquire after the math. So their impact is already very small. But furthermore, the biggest harm under this that was once again, unresponded to is how it affects those who are actually poor, because they simply just say like the prosecutors won't have an incentive to retry individuals who are minorities. We told you these individuals have less resources to actually enter retrials because it costs a lot of money to get a good lawyer. So on their end, these individuals are uniquely punished because you simply cannot afford to keep up with constant retrials. And wealthy individuals therefore are much better off because you can afford good lawyers, you can afford the marathon. On their end, you harm these individuals specifically. So once again, another mechanism on their side that specifically harms the poor. That's morally illegitimate. So we proved to you why courts are more effective on our end, and their upshot is extremely small. Now let's talk about individuals. Before I go on, I'll take a POI if there is one. Yeah, once individuals are convicted of not guilty to insufficient evidence, you can't retrial them at all. Engage in the actual nuance where a limited time frame restricted your ability to collect sufficient evidence in those instances. We already told you on our side, if you get much more evidence, you can retrial, right? But once again, it's unclear what you just assert the time frame is very short without any analysis. It's unclear where you get absolutely no time. Courts have been quite slow in the status quo. It takes like years to queue up to actually get to court. So I think you get sufficient time. How are you going to get magically much more evidence on your side when you get a couple more months? Literally no analysis. Now, let's talk about individuals. One, on the perception of guilt. They say racial biases, these different stigmas occur. We proved to you why this is all much worse on their side, because once again, you lower the bar of discrimination. You make it much easier for individuals who are judges and juries to prosecute racial minorities and harm them and create stigma. They never respond to the stigma argument. Right. Because it's unclear what changed on their side."

Wealthier individuals are able to get away with this. And once again, we didn't get a proper engagement to this argumentation. Because if you're wealthy, you have access to resources. People give you the benefit of the doubt. They think that because you're very wealthy and a good person, you wouldn't do horrible things. So for that reason, the wealthy are never punished.

So even in the very best case, they want to punish individuals in this not proven category. Their side makes it much worse because you only punish those who are racial minorities. That is a big problem. Secondly, on the argument of reparations, they simply assert that they get reparations, but they never actually prove this argumentation, right? It is unclear to me why saying that you're not proven gives you a lot of relief as a victim, whereas saying that you're not guilty doesn't really result in that. So they're unable to prove that the not proven status gives you massive relief as an individual victim. But we're going to flip this on why our side is better. Because on our end, we punish a lot of the criminals who on their side would get away because they have the not proven status and the bar is lower. That is crucially important. because even if, for example, less individuals are persecuted on our side, like they are guilty, but some people do get away. The individuals who are punished are fairly punished under the system and proper reparations are restored. If you committed sexual assault on our side, a big bulk of these individuals will be properly punished. And that is crucially important, whether it's as a signaling effect to get people to talk about these issues, but also in general in terms of getting proper justice. On their end, the bulk of these individuals actually escape in terms of like to get the not proven status and you never properly punish them. So on our side, we get much more effective reparations because the benefit on their side to individual victims is very small. On our side, even if it's less victims who are benefited, the benefit is much larger because you get proper punishment. So for that reason, we're able to prove your reparations are also better. At the conclusion of this debate, we're able to prove two unique mechanisms. We proved you on their side, you only benefit the rich and you harm the poor even more. And they don't fulfill the purpose of a court at the very basic level to not be proved to be proven to not be assumed to be guilty when you actually are innocent. For all these reasons, very, very proud to oppose."

Let's call it finally for what it is. They wanted the suppression of justice and the prevention of alternatives for those who didn't have any. Because the mistake with Kim China's case was choosing to run a negative one to respond to a prop case that didn't exist. They still don't understand that the not proven verdict isn't one that permanently condemns them to stigmatization the same way that guilty ones do. Because note, you may still be more easily put under the verdict that you are not proven than you are the one that is guilty, but the reasons as to why this is better are a few fold. No, clearly we told you from first and second to very little response because they wanted to rely on their unproven premise that still most of these people will be characterized as permanently guilty. First, if these people are like to have insufficient evidence to put them as guilty, but still have some degree of evidence to immediately not declare them as guilty, it's probably a gray area that most people are then going to either resort towards guilty or then not guilty. The key difference we told you about why it wasn't going to be guilty was that the degree to which you had insufficient evidence means most people want to err on the side of caution for all the analysis they already provided. The second thing they want to talk about here is that most people are going to abuse the system. I want to point out that all of the malevolent incentives they characterize are symmetric. If you are a person with a lot of power and you want to escape justice, you'll presumably do that anyway. But the difference here was about the far worse outcomes brought because you create the permanence of a binary verdict. When you set it in stone, because when you find out that you aren't guilty, but then you discover that you actually are you can't go to seek this justice again the opposite is also true if you are proven guilty because of certain biases you are never able to then retry this again other than the counterfactual we provided where you have better justice because you had more information to do so let's clarify the burden in this debate it was not here to prosecute all bad faith actors perfectly it was a reimagination of the world where this existed, meaning that most of their characterizations for why this debate was going to happen in status quo, why people had different views about how this policy would work, meant that most of them did not exist and that is why they have to lose the round."

              "text": "There are three issues I want to talk about in this speech. First, on maximizing justice. Second, on why this is good for victims in particular. And third, about stigmas and stereotypes that receive very little response. First on maximizing justice, we get two major claims from the opposition. The first is that their claim is that initial presumption is not innocent, but you think it's guilty. And the importance of this is what I'm doing here is challenging the entire characterization that their first issue is reliant upon and disproving it. First, the fact that they weren't convicted guilty clearly means a lack of sufficient evidence, so it can't be proven that these people were going to be guilty anyways. But the second thing is that the argument of the slippery slope doesn't work because of the historical reasons for assumed innocence. If you believe in the status quo, the justice system developed a way to prove these people that were going to be innocent, unapproved, and guilty because we recognize there were certain circumstances where victims ought to be protected. They don't give very much analysis for why this same incentive isn't true. If you do want to protect people from the state power, from being over-abused, as they characterize from first, then presumably this same incentive to declare this in the code under the law would still exist. So if people historically wanted to have assumed innocence, this would still happen regardless because you aren't able to declare them permanently guilty from the get-go and this already outframes most of their reasons. But the third about their label of not proven isn't likely to be very permanent because you're still able to retrial again. The difference is even if you're likely to be not proven guilty or you're still going to be proven not guilty, you're still able to retrial again which is able to reduce all the stigmas they talk about. The second thing is their claim is that you easily allow judges or juries to default to this which results in an overall gridlock and lack of justice. First, I want to point out that the debate must assume some integrity because if their characterization is that all judges are lazy and they want to go home is true, they can also declare a non-guilty verdict under our side and therefore also get it the easy way done. This can't be true. First, from a self-preservation perspective, this makes no sense because you are hired to solve these things on both sides. But second, I think in the reimagined world, the opposite is likely to be true. If you choose to abuse this system for your own malevolent self-incentives, there are mechanisms within the system to note that you just easily chose this verdict because we developed a framework to characterize what is sufficient evidence, what isn't sufficient evidence. So you probably have more code and oversight mechanisms. On an individual level, the claim that people will retrial forever won't work too, because if each consecutive trial, if it goes through four trials, the chain of retrials means that judges can have the information and confidence to make a necessary decision, which is why we guarantee it's going to eventually arrive at justice, which most of Second Op's claims are then contingent upon. And also note that Second Op concedes that most people don't have the resources to do this. From a self-preservation perspective, it doesn't make sense as well. With this, what was our positive case that received very little response? First, on the ability to being retrial was key. The only engagement we got was that this isn't very valuable because new information doesn't happen anyways. First, this is fatal for their case because their entire mechanism for wanting retrials is you get new evidence. So if you don't get any new evidence under their side, then all of their setup is void and proves to you why our comparative was still easier. What was the unique nuance we got from first that received very little response? One, the reason why you could collect new information is because procedural law mandates these timeframes. So if opposition wants to be super flexible of the timing, they have to abolish a substantial framework of procedural law. So within that timeframe, you are able to collect new information. Additionally, from what you're able to do in status quo, the reimagined world where you're not proven means you also have mechanisms to help you seek recourse in obtaining more information because you recognize the urgency in you obtaining this evidence. So therefore, there are claims that it's very hard to collect, doesn't work for DRM. Don't let them get away with trying to outframe double jeopardy. We told you from second very clearly, the exception to allow retrial in status quo only applies for new DNA evidence, but you cannot collect more new evidence for a new trial, so prosecution could not work. And therefore, this is among the evidence already collected within the first time frame, so you can't get anything new. The difference here was that when you have your trial for things like first degree murder you can't have second degree murder if the first one was initially put out which is a massive obstruction of justice that they never respond to before that i'll take a point so even if finding new evidence is only exclusive to your side we told you that witnesses are less likely to find new evidence on rape cases because victims are scared of the trauma or on our cases against their powerful people these witnesses think that they won't like that these people will get away with it again so why are you likely to get that evidence on your side i think that happens far worse on your side because if you're likely to come to a permanent verdict and say that if you are now proven not guilty and that's likely to be the majority of circumstances because cases like rape and cases like sexual assault have a very high evidentiary standard means that the more times it happens on your side and you're declared not guilty, people have no faith in the justice system and are less likely to report for things like rape and sexual assault. So it happens far worse when you don't have the ability to retrial again. The ability to retrial was key because in status quo, most of it was obstructed. What was the second issue then? First off, tell you that the rich easily abuse the system. One, this is largely symmetric for all the reasons they outline. What's the deadlock breaker? The first was that if the rich can push for not guilty verdicts, then presumably under our side, when they're able to do this, they're still able to retrial again. But even in the worst case, when the rich do push for this, when you are able to retrial, the difference as to why it's likely to work in the favor of the poor, is because you are able to push for this to be one that's going to be not proven, allows you to trial again, where otherwise the comparative would you would need to be one that's going to be not proven, allows you to trial again, where otherwise the comparative would you would need to be pushing for a good verdict that says"

They don't prove to you how likely new evidence is going to pop up, right? Like I agree it is possible that new evidence might pop up, but they don't prove to you how likely it is going to pop up. This is a problem because there are just structural reasons why evidence isn't likely just to pop up arbitrarily, right? Like evidence decays over time, right?

Second, on privileged people, why they're able to get away with crimes. Thirdly, on the wider corrupt conception of justice. First, let's talk about the vulnerable. Our claim under this clause was simple. Prosecutors will use non-guilty verdicts to intimidate more vulnerable people into taking plea bargains. This is worse than a status quo. Why? Because Evan correctly points out the bluff that prosecutors use in a status quo is that the court might find you guilty. But this is a less persuasive bluff than saying the court will find you not proven. Because finding you guilty is very difficult, right? You need to prove that they are guilty beyond reasonable doubt. So if you as a poor person are objectively, and you know, for a fact that you didn't do it, the bluff just won't work very well for the simple reason that you know, that the prosecutor won't be able to meet this high bar on ourselves. The bar is much lower. And so far as the bar, isn't me not proving guilt and therefore I can be innocent, but instead the bar becomes prosecutor just needs to give some evidence to give them some suggestion that I might be guilty. Why is this bad? This is intimidating for two reasons. One, it is the threat of continuous retrials, right? If the prosecution gets to a non-guilty, non-proven verdict, that's when they can try you again and again and again. If you are poor, this is terrible. Why? Because the prosecution can prepare more for the next trial, but your public defender is probably going to switch and your public defender doesn't have the time to prepare for your next trial. And you can't afford having multiple trials if you're poor because you need to work for your family. Second, even if retrial never happens, it's the stigma, right? Because there is going to be a stigma associated with people who are not proven. Society will view them as guilty people who got off on a technicality instead of innocent people. What were their responses? Their first response was an assertion. They assert that you won't stigmatize the non-proven verdict. The problem, though, is that they are asserting fear that they don't have. They have the fear to assert that they have the non-proven verdict. They don't have the fear to assert how society will react to people handing down the non-guilty verdict, a non-proven verdict. We told you in our first speech that society is likely to stigmatize people even when the court gives them a non-proven verdict for two reasons. One, the risk of you being actually guilty is bigger than the risk of you being innocent. So if a corporation hires you and you actually turn out to be guilty, then the corporation's reputation goes down the hill. However, if the corporation doesn't hire you and you turn out not to be guilty, they could have just hired someone else who could have done the same job equally as well as you. So there's an incentive to discriminate. Two, you can't justify political protections for these people for the simple reason that you don't have the political capital to justify these protections. And so far, these people aren't innocent and deserve equal treatment, but these people are a bit more guilty than the average innocent person. The second response is, ah, but prosecutors don't decide, judges decide, so prosecution can't use this. No, the whole point is a bluff, right? The prosecutor is able to block the jury in this thinking. Look, the judge is likely to decide this way, therefore you take a plea bargain. Know that this is important for a few reasons. One, this is more important in all their victims' analysis. Because if you want to talk about giving reparations to victims, the contingency is you need to lock up the right criminal. On their side, you won't lock up the right criminal because the state will force poor people into taking plea bargains because poor people will be scared. They'll be intimidated that the state only needs to meet a very low bar of not proven. Second, if their response in third is we're assuming that judges and jury are malicious. No, we're not assuming that judges and jury are evil. All we're saying is that they're self-interested. They have an incentive to hand down a lot of non-proven verdicts because they don't want to have responsibility because the jury just wants to go home after a long day. Here's the thing. Because we proved that there is going to be a lot of non-proven verdicts, not every single one of those non-proven verdicts will be retried, right? Only a very small percentage of non-proven verdicts will be retried. In those small instances, maybe you get better justice on Thursday House. But in the vast majority of instances, you won't get a retrial because evidence just won't appear out of nowhere. The problem, though, is that all of those people who never got a retrial and were stuck with a non-proven verdict for the rest of their life are stabilized to the extent that society still believes that they're a criminal. It's just that they got off on a technicality. On Therese the House, when the voting to approve is innocent until proven guilty, that's when more of those poor people would have had innocent verdicts because the guilty verdict is so much higher than the non-proven verdict. Moreover, the current retrial system benefits the poor and benefits the vulnerable. Why? Because it's easier for you as a defense to retrial if you are convicted. It's harder for you as a prosecution to retrial."

We're arguing is that they have the greater ability to get off on their house. The first thing I want to say is that their mechanism for retrial doesn't work with privileged people. Why? Because prosecutors don't want to retry privileged people because their chance of losing is very, very high. Why? Because these privileged people have insane lawyers who can out-prep you, right? However, they have an incentive to retrial poor people because their chance of winning a retrial against a poor person who is a public defender is a lot higher. So they won't try privileged people. The other thing we told you is that stigmatization doesn't apply to privileged people because they have PR firms, because they don't get fired insofar as they own the company that they work at. What then is the impact of this argument? The impact of this argument is that privileged people who committed crimes have an easier way out. The burden for them isn't to prove that you're not guilty. The burden is just to delegitimize the evidence of the prosecution to a good enough extent that you're able to be let off on a technicality. That is when you have more chain of custody defenses instead of defenses that are actually more legitimate, like the idea that you had an alibi or whatever. This also beats your analysis on victims because the victims who have privileged perpetrators will never see the light of justice. And so far, it's easier for the privileged people to get off because their wealthy lawyers can just get them into non-proven verdicts."

So these individuals will be held accountable one day actually engaged. No, no, no, no. Read the motion. You have the option to retrial. Not a retrial is inevitable. The info side says an option. The problem is that you don't prove how many spontaneous, serodimputous pieces of Edelman's will pop up. But what we prove to you is that if a retrial happens, you're going to retrial the poor guy with a public defender, not the rich guy with an insane attorney from Skadden, right? Third, let's talk about the wider perpetuation of justice, right? Here's the thing. We explain that the presumption of innocence until proven guilty gets knocked out on Thirsey House. Because as you correctly point out in first, it's not a binary anymore. It isn't if you don't meet this high bar of guilt, you are innocent. It is you don't need to meet this bar of guilt. You just need to meet the slightly lower bar of being guilty, but being gotten off on a technicality. If their response is gray zones, gray zones is their problem because in the status quo, the gray zone isn't roll a dice and determine if they're innocent or guilty. The gray zone is they're innocent because they haven't gotten the burden of reasonable doubt, right? Gray zone means by definition, you don't have reasonable doubt. On this house, they get rid of the presumption of innocence to a large extent. The presumption of innocence is important because the majority of people are not the super rich. The state has the monopoly of violence over the vast majority of societies in the status quo. You need to give those people a counteracting mechanism. The counteracting mechanism is a high burden of guilt that they lower on their side of the house. Very proud to oppose. I would like to thank the speaker for that speech and call upon"

But even against their best case, in a very small amount of instances, maybe they get a unique retrial for some reason. But we told you this is bad because in the majority of instances, this retrialing mechanism, which is a lower bar to access on their side, means those who are poor and without resources will be forced into plea bargains because you simply cannot afford to go on multiple trials when you are a poor individual. That's a system that only benefits the rich because the rich are able to afford those trials and therefore the state doesn't have an incentive to continue prosecuting. So on their side, even if the system works, in most cases, the harm is much larger because it'll be used as a tool for coercion. This was an analysis Bowser reinforced.

When you lower the bar of proof in terms of what would be harmful to an individual, because as we have proven to you structurally, if you were seen as not guilty, in many instances, there will be negative stigma against you. It benefits the rich and harms the poor. Many layers that we gave you that were never properly engaged with. One, we told you all the biases they have are much easier to exercise because the bar to harm an individual who is of a minority group is much lower, never engaged with. Secondly, we gave you structural incentives to why individuals who are juries and judges won't make proper decisions. The only response to this was their professionals, but we gave you structural reasons saying their professional is not argumentation, right? We told you that in general, it's less responsibility for you as an individual and it harms your reputation less. That means the tool won't be used properly.

But note them wanting to argue that they also have retrial means they have literally no trade-off in this debate. All of their harms apply to them.

Because it isn't hard to imagine, panel, that perpetrators who clearly committed a crime just did not have sufficient time for the prosecution to meet beyond reasonable doubt yet. But if we gave them sufficient time, is it possible? Because on their side, we can agree that maybe it's true. Not every time we're able to get new evidence. But there is a possibility, and in some instances, the 10%, where if we could, we would have put one person more that should have gone to jail in jail. And we would have prevented one person that would have been falsely convicted from preventing them going there. Them arguing that the verdict might be the same never took out our case because we never said that the retrial from a not proven verdict had to change at all. All we proved is that an extra trial meant accuracy and meant that we never made false convictions. Why was time important? Their only contention was, oh, but how do you get evidence? Not that their only mechanism and their only engagement relies on them also getting evidence. They say, we will just retrial when new evidence comes. Therefore, they concede evidence can be found and can come in the four months, for example, where you're given more time to get search warrants, convince witnesses that were previously too scared to come up in the first place. That isn't hard to conceptualize. But we clarified very clear from second panel that their case does not even work in the legal world. Because the only way retrials work right now is when you have DNA evidence. Any other scenario, you don't warrant them a retrial, which means their comparative has to be no retrial at all, which means you need to concede to all of the harm that we told you from second in the clarification, but they were unwilling to actually take that actual engagement. Note that permanent outcomes means we must improve accuracy.

We think that's an extension of the precedent set in the banning of the neo-Nazi party in Germany and of states around the world in banning hate speech.

The first is that we combat the threat to minorities. The second is that this harms the development of solutions to the problems which lead to right-wing populists coming about at all. And the third, in Ed's speech, is how this is a fundamental affront to democracy. Before I move on to my first argument about how we actually combat the threat to minorities, what are the principal parameters within which this debate takes place? Two things. The first is that democracy necessitates a balance of rights, because the rights of individuals sometimes contradict each other. My right to wave my wand in the air contradicts Kenza's right not to get poked in the eye. We believe that protecting the most vulnerable from physical harm weighs up more than the ability of certain individuals to have freedom of speech. I'm going to be dealing with that principally in my speech. The second principal parameter, which this debate takes place within, is that democracy can only happen if it's truth-led. When you are anti-truth, you forfeit your right to the protections of free speech. Ed's going to be talking to you about that principally in his speech."

              "text": "Before I move on to my first argument about how we combat the threat to minorities, what exactly is this one characteristic that is so exclusive to right-wing populism? Wouldn't you end up banning a lot of other ideologies that have similar characteristics? OK, we told you that courts are good at deciding whether things and individuals fall into certain categories. We gave you literally five characteristics that define right-wing populist movements. If courts decide that an individual or a group is part of that movement, then they'll ban those movements, then they'll institute these kinds of free speech protections. Not sure what they're getting at there. On to my first argument, which is about how we combat the threat to minority groups. Because right-wing populism thrives on riling people up and channeling their anger. That's because right-wing populists are overwhelmingly problem and not solution-oriented. Why? Because the reason that they're so popular is that they're able to appeal to diverse coalitions of individuals, often with very little in common. Someone living in a trailer park in northern Florida has basically nothing in common with a soccer mum living in the Midwest, but they're united by being broadly disaffected with the status quo. The policy demands of these people, economically and socially, are very different. So, in order to maintain this coalition, right-wing populists do two things. Firstly, they promise very shallow things. They have very unspecific policies or unsubstantiated catch-all magic wand policies. Secondly, they focus on the problems that their followers face as opposed to the solutions which divide them. In an attempt to flatten the causes of these problems into something which can nominally easily be solved, they often blame minority groups for all of these issues. That means drug dealers in the Philippines, Mexicans in the US, Moroccans in the Netherlands are blamed for all of the problems which the followers of populists face. The reason that blaming minorities leads to increased violence is threefold. The first is that they take the anger that individuals have and they direct it at a minority for a political advantage. This anger goes beyond normal anger because the issues that these individuals are facing every single day suddenly becomes tied to minorities. Secondly, they change permission mechanisms because they make these views mainstream. That means people think it's okay to be or act racistly because views have been legitimized by others, whether in rallies or in votes. Thirdly, when these populist parties get in power, because they can't implement legitimate policies without alienating a segment of their voter base, instead they're forced to use discriminatory policies to distract from their failure to solve problems. So Trump is forced to try and implement a Muslim ban to distract from the fact that he can't actually solve the problems that his voters are facing without alienating other parts of his voter base. What are the impacts of this? You create a society where minorities live in fear. Fear of being attacked, fear of being spat on on their way to school, fear of not being able to get a job because they're discriminated against in interviews. In extreme cases, their freedom of movement is restricted when they're too afraid to leave their homes. Look, we don't think it's surprising that in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, hate crimes went up 40%, that during the US presidential election, hate crimes against religious and ethnic minorities went up 41%. That's not surprising. And our policy solves this by reducing the ability of"

The DPP in Denmark was able to pull the Danish Liberal Party right to the point when a party that previously was pro-immigration and asylum seekers ran on a platform of explicitly limiting the number of asylum seekers able to come into that country. The second way that they distort the politics and they harm the development of solutions is because of a lack of nuance in the language that these politicians use. Populist candidates use charisma and shocking language to get free airtime and to show themselves to be saying what the people are thinking. Other parties, in order to compete, are forced to also use shock tactics. So one nation in Australia was able to change the debate on immigration to the point when the yellow peril was a phrase that was actually commonly used. We think you can't have a proper political debate when the language that you're using is un-nuanced, when you're conflating asylum seekers and refugees and immigrants in a way that only populist parties force politics to do. On our side of the house, we're able to escape the noise of populism, we're able to rise above the din, and we're able to have a conversation between centrist politicians which leads to actual, nuanced, legitimate solutions to these problems. In Canada, they were able to have a nuanced conversation about immigration free from the noise of populists, which means they were able to impose an immigration policy that is actually fair and that actually helps the individuals on the ground. Because Team England is the side which protects minorities and actually helps solve the issues which lead populist parties to come about in the first place, I beg you to propose."

A lot of this speech happens within social media, so these are people who agree with you, etc. There's a reason why when many African Americans listen to Trump's tweet, the way they respond is not of fear or threat, but they respond by retweeting anti-Trump messages and having them shared and affirmed by people who share their beliefs.

Their second argument was about discourse. The fundamental premise here is that right-wing populism is harmful. They never provided us an alternative to the problems we see today. My first substantive will now show you why right-wing populist speech is legitimate and should not be restricted. The premise of my first argument, why is free speech valuable? Our identities don't exist in a vacuum. They only gain meaning through expression and interaction with other beliefs. Hence, free speech is a fundamental right that we should not discard for mere convenience. Why is right-wing popular speech particularly vital? Since the 1990s, there has been a radical convergence towards neoliberal centrism in politics. Until recently, most major parties were pro-free trade and globalization. Democrats under Clinton converged with Republicans on free trade, while Labour in the UK co-opted many aspects of Tatarism under Blair. Why is this consensus harmful? One, because a democracy without choice is not a democracy. When there's no party that comes close to representing your interests, then democracy has failed you. What right-wing populism does is to embrace and endorse viewpoints which are perfectly defensible, like the government having a foremost duty to its citizens. So when they tell us it's white noise, we think it's a legitimate standpoint. Two, because it disenfranchises the millions of workers in the Rust Belt whose livelihoods have been imperiled by free trade and immigration. They are neglected by a democratic party preoccupied with identity politics and a republican party that stands for an unbridled free market. These are problems that exist now. They have no solution. Those left behind by free trade are left voiceless."

My thesis is that propositions policy is a vast expansion of the state's regulatory power over free speech. Given all the ambiguities involved, this is a huge target for abuse. Just listen to the five criteria they presented. What is nativism? What is an attack on the establishment? If I critique the New York Times, is that considered under their policy? This means that all their anti-truths and hate speech are incredibly fake. And this is particularly true because fake news, as we want to talk about in the POI, heavily involves judgments of character, like claims that Bill Clinton is a womanizer, or causal judgments that the police shot a black man because of racism. The truth of these claims cannot be objectively proven. Furthermore, whether something passes the threshold of hate speech is highly dependent on context and intent. They can't just throw this away with a mechanism in their policy. For instance, Jeremy Corbyn has said that immigrants undermine labour standards, but presumably he wouldn't be prosecuted under proposition. Therefore, the content of such speech is subjective. But beyond that, the prosecution is subjective as well. In most of criminal law, governments don't prosecute every case because there are too many of them. This means they pick and choose. This is itself political because the legal process only begins once the case is brought to court. However, prosecutors have very strong personal incentives to act in the interest of their partisan masters because they want to gain a promotion and curry favour. This means that often the kinds of speech that are curtailed are those that hurt the government's partisan interests. This means that they allow governments to artificially entrench power because the prosecution will only choose to attack those news and those forms of hate speech that disfavors them. It also means that on their side, journalists are either forced to self-censor because they don't want to be dragged to court, or they're forced to review confidential speech and confidential sources when they have to defend themselves in court. Therefore, we believe that silence is oppression. We oppose."

              "text": "I'm going to bring you an argument as to how right-wing populism constitutes a fundamental affront to democracy and the rights of everyone else in a democracy who does not vote for these people. But before that, five pieces of rebuttal. The first thing they say is that minorities don't actually feel afraid. And the only evidence they give for this in their first speech is, oh, you have some African-American women retweeting anti-Trump tweets. Two responses. First, they do not engage with the three lines we bring you in our first speech as how it is actually horrific to have someone who is in their political incentives to stand up and say that you are a less valuable human being than someone else. But I challenge side opposition to tell the women who are raped by Duterte's army because he legitimizes that, or, for example, the women who face race-based abuse in the United States as a direct response of Trump's riots, the Mexicans who are beaten up after Trump rallies, that they shouldn't be afraid in any meaningful sense of the word. Second thing they bring us is that these are voicing concerns that would otherwise be avoided. Four responses here. First, they concede in their very generic characterization of freedom of speech, that and when they stand up and say we support things like hate speech, that there are circumstances under which we are happy to tell people that they cannot vote for a particular individual. That is, if we can prove to you that the harms to the wider society, i.e. the democratic norms of that society and specific minority groups are undermined. That is why they themselves do not believe that people should be able to vote for the neo-Nazi party. And in doing so, they concede that democracy has to operate within a range. Second of all, they give us no analysis to why specifically addressing the concerns of these people is unique to right-wing populists and rather just right-wing movements. We were pointing to, for example, the Republican Party in the US, the Conservatives in the United Kingdom, groups that attack the very kinds of policies that they stand for on their side of the house, things like having tighter immigration controls, but do so without saying that Mexicans are rapists. Third, this falls down because they fundamentally have to prove to you that the benefits accrued to these people are actually achieved. We gave you structural analysis in our first speech that has not been responded to as to how the shallowness of your coalition necessarily means you do not help the people in the Rust Belt. You do not help the people who fundamentally give you their democratic mandate. Third point of rebuttal. They say these are legitimate policies. Again, two response. First, we would challenge the factual legitimacy of lots of the policies that individuals like Duterte or Trump have passed because the vast majority of them are not restricting trade or placing limits on the power of big businesses or giving more welfare to the working man. They are instead avoided because they recognise there is inherent conflict between supporting Obamacare for those that want it and also not supporting Obamacare for those in your mandate who do not want it. The kinds of policies you actually get passed are the ban on trans individuals in the army, the ban on Muslims from particular countries, because those are the ones that it's easiest to unite your base behind. Second of all, again, this is predicated on these policies actually being fulfilled and people actually wanting that. We point to the example of the fact that only 28% of United States citizens now support Donald Trump as evidence of the fact that no matter what he says about these policies, he's probably not implementing them. Fourth and finally of all, they throw out this really generic argument about how this policy could possibly be abused because of the vague criteria we implement. We tell you that the courts make exactly this kind of calculation the whole time. And you know how we know that's effective? Because they stand by exactly the same mechanism when they talk about things like slander, when they talk about things like hate speech, when they talk about things like incitement to violence. If you can disseminate specific criteria and attach them to those instances of racial abuse, presumably we can also attach them to the five criteria we brought you in our first speech. Before I move on to my argument about how right-wing populism is fundamentally a front to everyone's rights, yes. Would you also prosecute every single person who calls those in the Rust Belt a moral, horrible neo-Nazi? Come on, this obviously operates on a scale, right? So on the smaller end of things, if an individual person is racist and inciting other people to go and physically harm someone else, then possibly. If that person does so with 100,000 Twitter followers and the direct response of that policy is that hate crime increases 41% in the week after they are elected? Yes. Okay, my argument, right-wing populism and the affronts democracy."

              "text": "We think right-wing populism undermines the integrity of democracy and is therefore a threat to the democratic rights of all. Two strands. First, it poisons real democratic debate. There are a couple of pieces of context we need to understand for this argument to make sense. First, right-wing populists abuse the truth and shift their stances. That is because they have broad but shallow coalitions brought together by conflicting vague promises, i.e. they promise simultaneity to slash Obamacare, but also to provide welfare to those in need. We point you to the example of Duterte as someone who literally has a team of 20 people hired to act as internet trolls and spread misinformation on the internet. Second of all, they dress up their opponents as conspiratorial elites and fundamentally use that as a tool to not engage with them. They demonise their portrayal of their opponents and as a consequence, when you try and challenge someone like Duterte or Trump or Gert Wilders on their prejudices, the response you get is, see, see, this is exactly what the liberal media is doing time and time again. Third thing on this, they rely on propagating fear and prejudice. Again, because they cannot unite their coalition through legitimate policy, because the people they draw together are drawn under vague and conflicting terms, they are reliant on common fears and prejudices. The takeaway from this argument is that the key tenant, the key appeal of lots of these individuals is inherently irrational. That is to say they rely on the propagation of a fear that probably should not exist. All of these fundamentally undermine the debate necessary to productive, competitive electoral politics. Why? First, because when you twist and muddy the truth of a debate, you challenge the reality in response to which that debate existed in the first place. When fake news and alternative facts are placed on the same pedestal as actual factual realities, you cannot have a functional discussion about certain issues. You cannot have a functional discussion about undocumented workers in the United States when it is a fact that Mexicans are rapists in the same way that it is a fact that Nieto is the president of Mexico. Second of all, likewise, you also cannot have a debate between two reasonable sides that engage with each other and provide for the voter fundamentally a response, that is, which of these two options is probably better for your interests, when one of those sides systematically fails to engage with the other. Both are the consequence of the fact that they use literally who those other people are as a way of attacking them rather than attacking their policies. When, second of all, they have terrorized the people that support them and struck fear into their hearts to the extent that they will not hear logical reason. Second strand of this argument is that these individuals attack the very framework of democracy. Part of their anti-establishment narrative on which they rely is to attack institutions like courts, like electoral processes. That is why we see individuals like Gert Wilders in the Netherlands and Donald Trump not only threatening to punish the courts if they get into power, but refusing to accept election results. Insofar as democracy relies on the balance of power that is supported both by the fact that you give a massive mandate to the individual that you give your vote to, but also by the fact that there are some checks and balances by an independent body to stop that person abusing that power, democracy is fundamentally perverted when justices and the courts are fundamentally too afraid to do their job. The takeaway of this whole argument is twofold. First, if you weigh this debate based on democratic integrity and the rights of individuals, the very presence of right-wing populists makes it harder for people on the ground to come to terms with who they are voting for, why they are supporting that person, and ultimately what they should draw out of that."

Yes, we think they are taking away the fundamental right for these individuals to have a party stand for them. And we think that is a right we should protect. They said, ah, but there's fake news and there's misinformation and people aren't debating on truth and facts. I think generally people are becoming more aware of partisan biases. I think democracy actually solves for fake news because fake news just as credits its source. Think about it.

Furthermore, we think that on our side, we pointed out very clearly how sometimes what they call unplattable are things that we need to respect. They completely dropped my first speaker's two tears of how sometimes unplattable language is essential to expressing thoughts. How in Team Affirmative, they police thoughts in a way that discriminates against the not well-off. Being born into an elite aristocracy is not a privilege we all share. Some people, for some people, it is understandable that it is important for them to be able to express their thoughts in this language. And we think that is an important thing we should respect. Furthermore, we talked about the color and intensity of thought. How sometimes things we call unpalatable are a waste and the only way for these individuals to express their true political choice. So, the solutions that these politicians stand for may not be perfect, but we think that the point is that these solutions are far closer to what people actually want. Even if they're not perfect, you'd rather have an imperfect solution that at least is congruent with what people want rather than a perfect solution that does not be in line with what they want at all. And to be clear, Trump has done things. He has withdrawn from the TPP. He has gotten many automobile factories back, creating jobs in America. We think these are important things we should have. And if trans-popularity is forced, that's precisely the point. If a politician doesn't deliver, he'll become less popular. So democracy corrects for this. Before I move on, yes."

We think it is not irrational when these individuals engage in this politics. There was never a golden age of politics when we were all rational and debated on purely facts. Politics has always been about character, always been about who people are. And we think that if people on the ground, voters, decide that that is what is most important for them, that is something that we should respect. Furthermore, they said, but you attack institutions.

In France, Marine Le Pen kicked her father out of the National Front because she was very strongly in favour of Holocaust denial. We want this effect to continue. However, the main reason why these leaders can engage in moderation is because they are currently trusted by their supporters as legitimate ideological leaders. When these leaders say that something is wrong, their supporters trust it. But if the state itself starts to crack down on these forms of unsavoury speech, these leaders lose their moderating ability because it now looks like the state has forced them to make concessions. Any attempt to moderate now looks like it has been engineered by the liberal elite. So, if they want to talk about making political speech better, I think it is harmed on their side.

No, this does not directly engage with the principle that we give you about the balance of rights for individuals to be safe from fear. If you create an atmosphere of fear and an ignorance of the truth, you're ultimately far more likely to persecute vulnerable minorities. The response that they give as well, lack of representation is violence. Ladies and gentlemen, no, violence is violence. And given that they've done nothing to contend the fact that we've seen increased rates of attacks on vulnerable minorities in the aftermath of the aftermath of the US election, or the aftermath of Poland, the Law and Justice Party being put in power, or the example that we know all too well, that of Brexit, and individuals that no longer feel safe in their homes, on their streets or communities because of rises and attacks and persecutions on you just because you're wearing a hijab. But secondly, they say, well, these people need to have a choice. We question how meaningful that choice actually is if this politics is skewed away from key issues. Because what we told you is that populist parties overwhelmingly cannot have specific policies because they have to please a broad coalition of voters. It's very hard for you to have policies that both say we all provide welfare for the people at the bottom, i.e. Obamacare, but we also want to repeal those very acts that protect people. That means you don't get tangible policies to protect people, but only assertions. But finally here, they say, well, we've got to give the people what they want. Ultimately, that is not the obligation of a democracy. We think that we should have parameters within the discussion occurs, that we do not allow anti-Semitism just because it's what some people want. That is called a tyranny of the majority that overwhelmingly harms the most vulnerable members of our society. But finally, they say, well, these politicians will likely moderate themselves once they're put into power. See the example of Le Pen. No, crucially, this is reliant on giving them a platform that allows them to get votes in the first place. When the very worst circumstances make it into power. Given the author gives you analysis as to why, once they are in power, they're likely to put forward policies that harm those very minorities. We're not willing to allow them to moderate.

We give you concrete reasons as to why these populist politicians are reliant on harms to minorities in order to get into power. Firstly, we tell you that they overwhelmingly scapegoat these people to hold a coalition because they look to simple answers for complex questions. The only response that sign-ups can give is, well, some African-Americans are not upset. They just retweet their opposition. No, crucially, that is an assertion that the vast majority of African-Americans behave in that way. But secondly, we think there are many vulnerable individuals who would actually be quite insulted by your characterization of these people willingly just brushing aside these accusations of their lack of humanity. But secondly, more crucially, a permission mechanism is created and they do nothing to engage with this analysis. Because if the orange man at the front of the room can stand up and say well it's okay for me to grab whatever by whatever or it's okay for me to decide that mexicans are all rapists then people who are not predisposed to violence under the status quo are far more likely to engage in those very acts of violence that's what we see what were ordinary americans now deciding to punch black Lives Matter protesters in the face. We think that is a fundamental harm that arises from populism itself. But thirdly and finally, they get into power and they have the ability to implement policies. And this is a direct clash with their material about, well, we need to give these people some kind of choice and some kind of representation. If emboldening these individuals by giving them a populist platform from which to spew their views you actually harm the debate and harm the rights of these individuals it cannot be legitimate but next year they say well this is the and I quote elitist vernacular and the logic here is that less educated people are unable to have debates about immigration unless someone stands up at the front of the room and shouts get the immigrants out fundamentally we think that is a patronizing characterization of how these individuals are able to engage in debates. But secondly, we think it's what is far more likely is that you shut out nuanced discussions. Because if you think about things like the U.S. primaries, individuals like Cruz or Pence wanted to have discussions about the policies and the ailments that globalization has caused for these people. Instead, we end up having conversations about the length of Donald Trump's fingers. Ultimately, we think that is far worse for the people that you want to protect under your side of the house. Because remember, we can provide real alternatives. So when they say, and I quote, not giving these individuals representation is an act of violence if other politicians as they likely will step into the fray and represent these people instead when populists cannot fill that vacuum and pollute the discussion we're far more likely to protect these individuals let's look"

But secondly, on your side of the house, what Gert Wilders can do is intentionally try and get defamation suits brought against him and use the fact that those suits have been brought to him in order to gain more popular support. If we shut down his Twitter page, he is unable to get those channels of discourse that ultimately mean he is more likely to get votes and more likely to be put into power. But finally here, they say politics is about character and it's okay for people to make decisions on this basis. Instead, you create a chilling effect on discourse, which harms those individuals. Ultimately, we think it is okay with limiting the amount of discourse that individuals like Breitbart or organisations that actively try to incite violence or limit the rights of minority groups through populist measures, if that means that we are far more able to secure the rights of vulnerable individuals. At the end of this debate, you have to remember we had two criteria. The first of which this was justified for the protection of minority groups. And secondly, that it was effective in challenging the disproportionate control that populists are able to wield over the most vulnerable. For all of these reasons, so proud to propose."

              "text": "First, who are the victims? We say from the beginning of this debate that minorities are victims. But so are those who have been left behind in the dust of unfettered capitalism. So are those who have been sidelined by the political elite that see them as irrational bigots that ought not to be listened to. These are people that currently don't even have a political party to cater for their class discrimination. These are people who don't have the courts to defend their supposed constitutional rights because they're seen as stubborn people that cannot engage in discourse, as they say on the outside of the House. These are victims that live in fear because they're caricatured by the liberal elite as immoral, deplorable bigots. They're labelled as someone who's stubborn, irrational, uneducated by team proposition, by their own leaders within these countries. That is the atmosphere that they currently live in, and they are victims that we need to protect in this debate. We thought they were important in this debate. We heard absolutely no response as to why they protect them as well. The response in third was that, but they can still run for office, but we just won't let them campaign or talk about what they want to do in office. That's honestly nonsensical. So how do their rights compare the rights of minorities? Now, we understand that minorities are important in this debate. What we do think is that minorities have access to a lot more protection than this specific group of individuals who have been casted away by unfettered capitalism and globalisation. Why is this the case? One, because minorities can be empowered if they respond with indignation and not fear. We talked about how the domino effect on social media means that you genuinely have the capacity to feel strong and safe within your communities. And is this perfect? No. But we think that on the comparative, it's a lot more likely that you have an entire democratic party willing to defend you that you're much more better off on your side of the house. But second of all, the herd is asymmetric, which is to say that many of these individuals have been equally as slandered and threatened on the streets by the liberal elite coming from your side of the house. If this is a response out of fear, then I think that's something that's legitimate as well. So the important point to take away from this is that current minorities who already have the Democratic Party to defend them have access to many other forms of protection. Are they perfect? Absolutely not. But for these individuals who currently have been sidelined by the entire political elite, this is the only way they can have their voices heard. That is the comparative we're willing to defend. Eventually, they shrunk their case. Because their first speaker said the speech was really bad. But they said, oh no, no, no, it's only speech that results in hate crime. Here's the problem. We said from the beginning of this debate that we're happy to prosecute for the physical crime of hurt in itself. The problem with that case is that they were never able to prove structural reasons why all forms of right-wing populist speech will always and necessarily result in hate crimes coming from the outside of the House. There might be a certain correlation, but no definite causation coming from the outside of the House. There might be a certain correlation, but no definite causation coming from the outside of the House. So yes, we agree, this debate is about a balance of rights. There are boundaries to what's acceptable in democracy. But this is the boundary we need to accept. For too long, we have remained in our neoliberal consensus, and we ought to expand the boundary of opinions that these people have access to. Second point of contention. Before that, yes. Why, when we stop people from running on a populist platform, will they not choose to appeal to these forgotten individuals on a purely right-leaning platform? No, because the only way you can truly and genuinely represent these people's beliefs is to use the same populist rhetorics that actually represent how disgusted they are with the current rate of globalisation and unfettered capitalism. They say that the current system of right-wing populism has a disparate coalition, but they say in the same speech that there's economic dislocation which binds them all together. Here's the thing, no one is saying we're only going to have a single policy, right? Many of these politicians can practise being a right-wing populist politician and craft better policies in the long term. But the important point here is that if so many people are affected by economic dislocation, regardless of whether you eventually get a policy, I think it's important that these voices are at least heard in Parliament through these politicians to begin with. No, thank you. Furthermore, we said that racist speech was still valuable in a democracy. Firstly, because not everyone has access to the same education you had. Most of us in this room, probably in a debate speech, once said something that was insensitive when we talked about women's rights on minorities. We were fortunate enough to have a debate coach tell us that that was wrong and to never say that again. Unfortunately, for many people living in the Rust Belt, they did not have access to that kind of education. I think it's wrong for you to punish people for their vocabulary and tone. But second of all, it's an important signalling effect. We think that saying that we should have a massive overhaul of the immigration system compared to all immigrants should get out now are two very different opinions because the latter shows how much disgust and how much intensity you believe in those opinions. And that quality is important for us to present as well. That's why when they wanted to have a substantive about the sanctity of institutions, I think it's good that we criticise institutions. When these institutions are dominated by the elite, we ought to criticize them as well. But here's the fundamental problem with their case. They assume that these beliefs are superimposed by politicians, that otherwise these people would not have had these ideas. This is incredibly false. Those racist beliefs that they talked about are understandable aspects of human nature that are in response to economic hardship, right? People see this all around them. Let's not kid ourselves and pretend like the Philippines isn't dominated by a significant number of Chinese businessmen, right? Let's not pretend that there's no genuine relationship between migrant inflows and wage decrease for these individuals. These are things that politicians tell you. These are things that people observe in their daily basis and make those connections for themselves. So at the point in which their only policy is to remove politicians parroting these ideas, they don't actually solve the root cause of this problem. In contrast, they force people into WhatsApp groups, into Facebook groups, into the same echo chambers that they think are so horrible without the same defamation lawsuits that they think can be used to regulate these opinions. That is why when they were never able to engage with the analysis of ordinary Americans, ordinary people on the ground, and what their policy would do to them, their side has lost this debate because they never presented us a meaningful solution and mechanism to their problems they've identified. But lastly, why all opinions are under threat? The only response you get to this is, but you still have defamation lawsuits, so that's really bad. Here's the thing. Obviously, defamation lawsuits are a lot more restricted within the status quo. The kind of criteria are a lot more restricted compared to five words or five ideas you give us, or the generic idea of right-wing populism. And furthermore, it's not even a criminal case which is prosecuted, which your policy does. But the important thing to take away from this is that necessarily all of this is subjective and context specific. Jeremy Corbyn might very well say that the inflow of immigrants might reduce labour status for every single person. He in fact did say that. But is he a right-wing populist? No."

What exactly is the line between a right-wing person who is not that racist and a right-wing populist who is a bit more racist but represents different views? Where exactly do they draw the line? I would suggest that if their main harm is minorities, on their side, they have to err on the side of caution. They have to take away a huge swath of views that legitimately represent what these individuals stand for. And to be clear, in Team Affirmative's world, it is not only about people running for office. It is about your ability to express your deeply held beliefs, to express your discontent with a political elite that has neglected you, to show that you are disgusted that they have left you behind. So it is not about just running for office. Don't let the other speaker misrepresent our case. In the world of Team Affirmative, they stand for expression, but not too much, just so you can't cause violence. But then we told them, that's a pretty draconian world. Many people call other things many other people's names. There are many acts that cause violence in the world today. On the other side, they have subjective criteria in the world of Team Affirmative that allow governments to abuse it. They say, ah, but you have laws on your side too, so it's a bit different. No, I would suggest the difference is that on our side, we are willing to err on the side of free speech, whereas on your side, you told us very clearly that in Team England's world, they are going to err on the side of caution because minorities are the priority in this debate. We think that on their side, they exercise a chilling effect on discourse. But you know what? If their problem is about minorities, I think they are harmed in the world of Team England. Because in my substantive, I told you very clearly about the moderating effect. Now, they just give a one-line assertion back in third speaker that, oh, it's when they come into power. No. I told you about the structural incentives that these individuals have to moderate and how you disempower the people who take away the racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric that you don't like. So in the world of team affirmative, that happens even more. So let us escape the world of team affirmative and go to the world of team opposition. The world of team opposition was very clear on our stance. We believe that these individuals need a voice. They need someone to stand up for them and they need someone to be there to represent their views. We understood that sometimes unplattable language is the only way for these individuals to express their views because it expresses the colour, the tone, the intensity and the beliefs they have. Analysis we gave you from first, not responded to in all three speakers and it'd be a bit too late if they tried to respond in reply. In the world of opposition, we understood that we are prosecuting violent acts, and therefore that is not part of the debate. We understood that the true victims here are the individuals who have been left behind. I want all of you to ask yourselves, why do you debate? I think all of us debate because we believe in what we do. We believe in the power of words. We believe in the power of words. We believe in the power of discourse. We believe in the power of speech. But this is a power that we should not just keep to ourselves. This is a power that we should give to people who we do not agree with. People who have been left behind and for whom speech is the one way they can reclaim their dignity. We understood on Team Opposition that silence is oppression. We are very proud to oppose."

On legitimacy, the proposition thrust went like this. We said that there existed a balance, and if the existence of one group led to the fundamental abuse of another, that was unacceptable. But they said, oh, but these people don't actually feel fear because, you know, they retweet things the whole time. We said, is that a joke? No, no, guys, you're right. Women don't feel fear when they are terrified of being raped by an army that Duterte says is legitimate. Muslim men and women in the United States don't feel fear when they see on their screens night after night people and families just like theirs being beaten in the streets in the aftermath of Trump's election. But they came back and said, ah, we can prosecute for these crimes. We pointed out not only that we already prosecute for these crimes and racial hatred still happens, but second of all, that is after the fact. If a group leads to abuse, irrespective of whether you then prosecute that abuse, that group is illegitimate. But they then said, ah, you constrict the fundamental rights of individuals to access democracy. We had three responses here. We said, first, that is factually inaccurate. If you look at the early debates between Cruz and Rubio, they are talking about exactly the issues you discussed. They're talking about tighter immigration controls. They're talking about how we distribute welfare to the most vulnerable. But second of all, we took them at their best. We said, okay, why don't you have individuals stepping in to replace these people? Because Macron's party is only one year old, and why would you not step into the void? And they said, ah, crucially, the language that these people use is what means they are the only people that can do it. We asked them in a POI, why do Mexicans have to be characterized as rapists for us to have a discussion about immigration? Now, the fact that they could not reply to that, and they could not tell you fundamentally why that language of abuse and that language of intimidation is so essential, is part and parcel of the reason they lost today's debate. The third thing we put into this was we said, this is contingent insofar as there's no point having, your representation is not functional if that representation does not bring anything for you. And that's the point at which the fact that they did not engage with our first speaker's analysis about broad but shallow coalitions that operate under a veneer of legitimacy that trick people into thinking that they're being represented but are not is so problematic. But we said, okay, you want to talk about democracy and rights? Let's talk about the fundamental abuse of the rights of everyone else in a democracy to make fair and free democratic choices and how that is undermined. And if you check your notes, I think you'll find they did not respond to four minutes of analysis from our second speaker. Problematic, to say the least."

In our first speech, in our second argument, we told you that it is harder to address the issues that they claim to care about because you spread people so thin across this coalition. And we told you that factually, this is not happening. Policies are being passed like the Muslim ban, policies are being passed like banning trans people from the army. And the fact that 28%, only 28% of the United States public continues to support Trump is indicative of the fact that he does not have the tools to empower people and give them what they want. They did not respond to this argument at any stage, but they ran their own principle about representation. We asked you a fundamental question. Is representation meaningful if that person doesn't want to do what you want them to do? And for all the arguments they threw out in their second speech and then dropped about shilling effects, about less creditable news sources. By the way, what is a less creditable news source than Breitbart? They could not engage with the core tenet of this debate. That was how do we provide for people issues that they actually need? And the last thing they threw out right at the end in their third speech is, ah, these people will be encouraged to moderate. Because yeah, you're right. Trump has really moderated himself since he got into power. He stopped saying all these horrific things. He stopped banning Muslims from countries. He stopped cracking down on people. He stopped cutting welfare to fundamentally the most vulnerable. You're right. Duterte hasn't encouraged his army to go out and rape women. Oh, wait. That is the status quo, that is the reality they had to defend this debate, and that is why they lost."
