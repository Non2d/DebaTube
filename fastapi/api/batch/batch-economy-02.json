              "text": "Economic reparations are the prerequisite for all other benefits. Political and civil rights are a leaf in the relentless wind of reality. Our burden on proposition is not to deliver a utopia, but we do think that states would have benefited local populations, and the balance of probabilities created a stronger foundation for them to build and develop into the 21st century. What do we stand for? As these states gained independence, they would prioritize limited political resources into implementing economic changes, such as land redistribution and cash transfer payments. This speech will prove three things. Firstly, economic reparations are likely to be applied best under our side. Second, they bring the most and greatest immediate benefit. And finally, economic reparations are prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights. Firstly, why economic reparations are more likely to be successfully applied than civil and political rights. And this is crucial because it explains why it's only under proposition that a policy that is likely to be implemented successfully and note that this argument preemptively will respond for all of opposition's benefits because they're all contingent on political and civil rights being carried out successfully there are three parts to this argument firstly economic reparations are initially more achievable in a post-colonial state recognize that the revolutionary leaders which this debate occurs upon are not purely altruistic but they balance genuine desire to help their nation with selfish desire for power. Despots like Mugabe, who have no desire to help their nations, fall out of this debate because of their unwillingness to implement either side's policies in a meaningful manner. So given that, civil and political rights require a far greater training offer of because you necessarily set up systems to on your own demise. Conversely, economic reforms enable leaders to pursue a desire to better their own nation without compromising their own motives to power. That's why leaders like Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana went on to create one-party states to prevent losing their own rule. So what this has established is that leaders both have the incentive and capacity to fail to implement opposition's political rights, whereas they'll be more willing to implement our economic rights. The second part of this argument is to say that even if opposition proves that political rights were initially successful, it's unlikely that they'll be sustained into the future for three reasons. Firstly, because political and civil rights require additional buy-in into seemingly Western systems of democracy. These populations who have had no encounter with these democracies before necessitate that distrust. Democracy only works effectively if it is engaged with and without the trust it will fail. But secondly because civil and political rights are highly inter-reliant such that the failure of one right necessitates the downfall of all others. For example the right to vote is inconsequential if you lack information because of pipe state control. But thirdly because political rights require additional and continued maintenance, such that the states have the capacity to provide political rights and name without actually doing so, through mechanisms like gerrymandering, voter suppression and miscounting ballots, all of which are easy to hide versus whilst observing land distribution is relatively obvious under our side. So what we know so far, the political rights at the point of implementation do not guarantee the benefits that opposition will claim, in the same way how Eritrea was one of the first African nations to have free elections, but was not successful in sustaining them."

              "text": "The final part of this argument is to note that, by comparison, economic reparations are likely to succeed after initial application for three reasons. Firstly, because economic reparations provide immediate benefits, even when citizens do not have ideal access to them. Even if you believe that economic reparations are imperfect, recognise that half the access to these policies is still good. If you receive a cash transfer but no land redistribution, it still benefits you and that is still better than no reparations at all. Compare that to opposition where the imperfect application of one right harms all the other rights which they try and gain. The second thing to say here is that economic benefits are more easily sustained during a context of political instability in post-colonial Africa. We know that empirically, many African states experienced political turmoil during those periods. Political and civil rights could not have been maintained whilst the economic benefits we provide before that are given and they are able to remain. But the third thing to say is that unlike opposition, which gets weaker with time, as more people lose faith in democracy, economic reparations compound. That's because economic reparations allow you for continuing development, like educating your children or working in the land that you're given. This allows the benefits we claim to grow over time in comparison to opposition, who will likely have those democracies rapidly backslide. So at the end of this argument, from the under proposition, where policy is likely to be implemented successfully, and which is what all of opposition benefits will be contingent on in this debate. I'm now going to move on to my second argument. But before that, I'm happy to take a point of information. How are your operations more sustainable if you don't have property rights? So I've just explained that we are likely to be able to have these sorts of things because they compound over time. If you give someone money, for for example you're able to invest that in yourself you're"

Side proposition solved the immediate problem of poverty and starvation, which is the greatest impact in this debate. The impacts of political rights are long term and speculative because they require future action, whilst economic reparations do not and are guaranteed. We look to examples of huge famines in Ethiopia, where 1.2 million people died, and democratic rights did nothing to help them. And note that even if opposition tries to claim that they eventually get economic reparations, you must still vote side proposition, because of the immediacy of our benefit. Because every day where governments deny economic reparations, thousands more have died. And opposition at this point has an enormous burden in this debate. Tell us how they're going to help the people suffering right now. Why, even in their best case, it is worth having to wait decades to save lives rather than grant immediate economic reparations, which only we can do under our side."

              "text": "Finally, why the prioritization of economic reparation is a necessary prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights. The thesis of this argument is to suggest that economic reparations are prerequisite for accessing anything that this argument is to suggest that economic reparations are prerequisite for accessing anything that this opposition wants to claim. So even in opposition's best case, if you believe that those rights are important, you must vote side proposition. That's for two reasons. Firstly, you have to recognise that individuals need to be economically secure to be politically engaged, because you need time to conduct protests, because the right to vote in name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper, because the right to vote in name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper because the right to freedom of the press means nothing if someone is too illiterate because their parents could not afford them to send them to school secondly this is because this would lead to a less power asymmetry between ethnic groups economically actually increasing civil and political rights effectively because that inequality is lessened and therefore safety increases under our side all that is to say that if you want to unlock any civil and political benefits that opposition wants to claim, it is necessary to first achieve a baseline of wealth that only we can access on side proposition. That is what this opposition has to contend with in this debate. By comparison, you're more able to push for civil and political rights when you're in a better economic situation for two key reasons. The first thing to say is because you have more power, you are able to pressure unwilling governments because of the fact that you hold economic power. That is through the mechanisms like lobbying and platforming politicians by giving them funds to conduct things that could only happen under our side where you have that economic power. That level of government reliance on individuals is how you achieve a voice under our side. But the second thing to say is that for the reasons before, individuals can only mobilize and push for rights when they have that initial economic basis that we provide. Because rather than thinking about how you're going to put the food on the table at night, you can think about who you're going to vote for. You can think about how you're going to enact change. Obviously, we're not saying that these individuals will have all the economic power, but the question you have to ask yourself in this debate is who has comparatively more economic power, which flows into political power for the reasons that we've given. At the end of the speech, economic reparations are a prerequisite for all other benefits. Political and civil rights are a leaf in the relentless wind of reality. That's what this opposition has to contend with. Vote proposition. Thank you very much for that speech."

Meaning you'll have the means as a person of Africa to go to court and demand actors in society to respect your rights but thirdly we also think that institutionalization of those rights will be pushed forward this means that governments on our side prioritize building institutions that protect your rights this means you're insured more public defenders more judges more inspector that can for example come check abuses on your workplace on proposition countries have different goals those things are crucially left behind, and they're then different on two grounds. One, although they might give you land, you can't be unlawfully detained. You can't be unlawfully stripped of the land that you were given.

This cannot be done when rights are literally being denied to you. When you have like no rights, someone can always make choices instead of you. Someone can always control your life. Someone can always decide when and what you're allowed to say. Even if the actor making decisions is completely benevolent, you're never seen as a free and worthy individual. Notice that then on proposition, even if you have material freedoms, you're never free because freedom of non-interference has to come before material rights otherwise regardless of whether you have ten dollars on proposition or like if you cannot control how you spend it if you cannot unionize to get more than ten dollars if you cannot decide whether something is more important to you than getting those ten dollars you this right is equally like less important because it doesn't allow you to access all of the rights that you would actually need it just assumes that you want those ten dollars it doesn't really matter what you are accounted for this means that proposition inherently keeps people of africa dehumanized because they're always seen as incapable individuals of making decisions for themselves like they were during colonialism when they were literally enslaved they had no control over the land they had no control to war confrontations etc this means that specifically in this context people of africa deserve and need to be given their dignity back they were stripped off of it by oppressive european leaders were the only ones giving it back to them on the second argument i'll be engaging with more props material notice that from proposition like on opposition political and political rights and rule of law are crucial for a state accountability and proposition doesn't really have that increasing accountability happens on"

              "text": "two levels on our side. One to political rights. Notice that this is especially important to keep government politically accountable because they don't always add benevolently, and you don't always have the best intention in mind. Notice that this debate is happening in context of post-colonial society. There is a lack of trust between ethnic groups. The one in power was probably privileged during colonialism and other powers, other ethnic groups are largely going to mistrust this. This incentivizes the people that are in power to act in a not benevolent way because they want to keep those powers which proposition already characterizes. So but even if you act benevolently and have incentive to do so you're not necessarily always acting in the best interest of the people because you don't necessarily know what the people on the ground want and need so it's crucial to keep the government in check political rights are then political rights that do do this by directly allowing people to participate in the political life of the country this means you can go out and vote for the representative that best represents you. This means you have freedom of speech, you can criticize the government, but it doesn't give you the needs that you need. You also can go out and protest, you can show the satisfaction with all the things that the government is doing wrong. This means that only on our side, you show the government what you want, you can hold it accountable when it doesn't do that. But secondly, also to to the rule of law in societies where there are already big disparities between the rich and poor the rich who want to benefit further and they want to entrench their power into the system or to get more wealth and more land this is crucially important for the countries to focus on the rule of law rural thought gives the basis for rights being protected meaning that laws are applied as equally as possible for everyone this means that someone cannot just come on your land and take it away from you because it is your right to property. And even if they do so, even if they seize your land, your injustices have to be fixed because you can go to court and complain about it. We have three impacts of all of this analysis that I just told you. One, government policies are more likely to be representative of what the people need and want because they're able to express their needs to political rights so even if proposition gives them some good things we're able to give them more good things because we give them what they want secondly everyone can demand the same benefits from the state so because your rights are codified on our side you can demand your rights being fulfilled to the same extent as the rights of other individuals even in proposition wealth gets distributed to a few individuals in the country on our side all individuals have the right to demand it but thirdly proposition doesn't necessarily get good land reparations and economic reparations, because it don't pay your day civil and political rights. Firstly, we think the government will not redistribute land and economic reparations evenly, because one I already showed you how there's a lack of trust. You're probably likely to prioritize the people that are going to keep you in power. But secondly, you're probably also going to reward the army that literally helped you get in power and help you to the liberation movement, staying in power. This means that the poor people in the country, for all the people are getting the land people will be like taking away the land from the more powerful actors on proposition because this happened in zimbabwe for example when a retired army general that had a lot of power violently took over the alamain park consisting of 5 000 hectares of land previously that was redistributed to the people on our side of the house those people would have the power to go to courts and say that their rights are being validated and get back the land. This is impossible proposition. This is why it's far more important to firstly give the people civil and political rights than maybe focus on economic land reparations, Proud to oppose. you All right, thank you very much for that speech."

They make one big claim here, which is to say that rights are things inherent to their dignity. But note that underlying every piece of rhetoric they give you is simply an assertion that what people need is agency. We would tell you crucially that economic rights are linked to agency in just the same way. That is to say, it is restricting your agency when you cannot buy food to feed yourself. It is restriction of your agency when you don't have enough money to send your child to school. All of those things limit your ability to exist like a normal person in society. There's an unfair characterization to say that economic rights don't in the same way restrict people's ability to exist in normal society. What do you know then?

First, it is important to note that neither side can change the behaviors of the most dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side, no matter which direction you can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side, no matter which direction you can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like Mugabe in the types of policy directions they take. It doesn't matter which thing he prioritized, it was always going to be most dictatorial, you're never going to hold him accountable. So what you need to deal with then are those in the middle, those with a level of altruism. What do they tell you? First, that you have a right to protest and a right to freedom of speech, and that mechanism through which you hold them accountable first we reject that you were able to achieve these rights in and of themselves that is to say note how much rhetoric and time they spend on proving how this can like improve the lives of these individuals but no time proving how these institutions actually enable these people who have these rights we would tell you through every piece of material at toby the fact that individuals see this as an attack on their power because now these individuals can go out and treat and protest them is why they are likely to never give these individuals what they need and what they deserve but secondly and crucially even if you can claim freedom of speech or right to assembly we tell you that you're if you like need to focus on working 16 hour days in order to get food on the table if you don't have the ability to protest because you can't read or because you're just like in a rural area that is not interacted with the state you're not able to be successful in that way finally then on the claim about fairness they tell you that a minority gains a sense of power three key responses firstly as I mentioned before it is important framing that a dictatorial state states neither side can change this but those in which you can we ask you to be imaginative. That is, obviously, firstly, and it's the piece of framing we gave you earlier, it's less than an attack on an individual's power when you're likely to give them economic rights, sort of less likely that you just give it to your ethnic minority then. But secondly, you need to think of the long term, which is to say, if it is true that some dictators are likely to prioritize some individuals within society and push up their minorities, it is crucial to know that our side only needs one good person with some level of altruism willing to do a good policy. They need to deal with the fact that they need multiple dictators or multiple governments in succession to preserve things like constitutions, to preserve things like democratic rights, be unwilling to repeal everything that has been done previously. So if they want to make this debate about which side gets the greatest best people in power in terms of like fairness and things like that they have to deal with the side that is just more likely under their world that is the status quo because they have to deal with multiple individuals coming into power and being willing to repeal things like that but even if it is symmetrical even if it is unfair why do we still win this debate first because giving a minority economic rights is still a benefit at the point at which it keeps society running. That is to say, if you give a minority of individuals, an ethnic minority, for example, the ability to vote, that doesn't necessarily impact the ability of other people to exist in society. But if you give people money, it keeps the economy running in an important way. But second, we will tell you that economic rights to these individuals makes their lives better, but doesn't empower them to actively make the lives of others worse. Which is to say, when you give people the right to vote and only give that to a specific group of people, they are able to push for policy which actively discriminates against a certain group. Which means in their worlds, what they have to deal with is where a dictator may be unfair, may only give the right to vote to a certain number of group of people, and they're able to weaponize that to cause the most harm. What do you know then at the end of this practical clash? Firstly, that we actively better these individuals' lives. We make them more able to feed themselves. We make them better able to feed their families. We make them able to enjoy life more. That is crucial in that way. Any rhetorical example they give you where they haven't done the mechanization to prove why they actually get these changes before i get onto my one point of substantive i'll take a poi if there is one minorities on your side can always be unlawfully detained can always be taken from their land and taken away from your family on our side we"

It looks like the rise of populist and racist leaders, those who bring about an us versus them mentality mentality which in and of itself brings instability and brings division. These leaders capitalise on existing economic disparity between groups to support their cause, that is, observing how a colonial regime has benefited some groups more than others and how post-colonial structures have failed to fix these problems. How do we stop this competition? First, observe that this competition stems from a watch to solidify economic prosperity for themselves and their communities. We pre-empt this competition from existing at all by granting economic rights to all, decreasing perceived inequality and hatred. But second, we just limit economic inequality. You can't foster hatred surrounding post-colonial systems if they give money to everybody. You can't manipulate democracy if you have the power that you have to manipulate because of your economic prosperity is lessened. Secondly, though, we tell you that economic rights foster strong narratives about independence. That is, colonial society acted like wealth extractors. In their departure, what emerged was a sentiment and a fight for independence, which had underpinned the demands to reduce poverty and famine that had ravaged the continent. Point to the independent movement which emerged in Mozambique. What does this mean? It is crucial that these states deliver on these economic promises to prove their legitimacy to these populations. Regardless of any benefit that practical benefit the side opposition can point to, populations can be easily galvanized into riots and violent revolutions against yet another failing system of government, yet another post-colonial structure which doesn't get them what they want.

However, we would like to point out that even in our first speech, we already told you three constructive reasons why this is unlikely to happen. Because firstly, as we told you, these people in power are afraid of others afraid of other ethnicities second of all because they want to stay in power and lastly because they have an incentive to give more and more resources to their own ethnicity so we told tell you that it's unlikely and even impossible to achieve this perception that the other ethnicity is going to is going to be equal to you with just giving them land why because you're not going to give them land equally they're not you're not going to prioritize their well-being as equally as prioritize the well-being of your own ethnicity we're talking about the people in power here so what is there going to happen here the perception of inferior race is even is it's going to stay so even if we take them at their best and say okay maybe they're going to get some land what's going to happen then because you don't have property rights by the way this was an insertion made in their first speech after we we asked them in a poi how do you sustain these rights look it's still a lot more likely that someone's going to come and take your land away this is especially relevant for minorities who are still going to be hated on their side of the house why are they going to be hated well because you never change the perception that they're not the inferior group in this in this country rather that they're all equal and how do you do that you do that by institution institutionalizing all rights you"

We tell you that all of these things that they tried to claim is completely dependent on the benevolence of their government. This is why we believe that this principle is much more important, even if we take them at their best and say, okay, maybe the government is going to be benevolent. Still, we tell you that these people need the access to self-determination. These people need to be able to decide what they want to do in their what they want to do for themselves they need to be finally be able to have the control because notice we're putting this into post-colonialistic context these are the people that have been for centuries told they're the inferior race we tell you that it's much more important to be humanized to be, to have your humanity codified, than having a piece of land. Okay, but then secondly then, upon accountability and upon how we're not able to achieve this, we tell you that the side proposition is being very paternalistic at the point of which they tell you that these poor people cannot change their own situation. We tell you that this is very uncomparative and it's also not put in the real world. Look, we tell you that poor people are very capable of changing their own country, they're capable of unionizing, we have a lot of examples of that, they're capable of putting major mass protests, they're capable to vote in the people that they themselves like, and with that they're capable to also change their country, they're capable of bettering their situation but before i move on to additional points i can take you even if you want to take your principle to a vacuum why isn't your right not to starve just as important as your right to freedom of speech because we tell you that this is not what this principle is about. We tell you that the principle is about you being able to be humanized, about you being the human, you being very equal as every other citizen. We tell you also additionally that the fact that you're starving is contingent on you proving this is going to be something that you will be tackling on your case. We tell you that this is very unlikely because once again, the sustainability of these rights on your side of the house was assertion you gave us no mechanization how exactly these these uh these rights are going to be sustained additionally we would like to prove you we would like to point out the comparison here what is more important even if you take them at their best and say these reparations are going to be happening look what at which point are you going to be just shot out in the street?

This means that the government is much less likely to take you and the thing you for whatever, which, for example, happened in the absence of this rights in Ghana in 1,958. This is a country that did not prioritize civil and political rights. They they have a preventive preventive detention bill which was used to essentially silence opposition and silence the critics that they didn't like. And in 1965, over 2000 people were in detention. We tell you that when the side opposition, this is much less likely to happen simply because you have things like that prevented in the institution, even if this is a weak democracy. Additionally, the second point here under the protection on an individual level, you have, you are protected from the intervention of other citizens, as we already told you, there's no insurance of property rights and in the absence of this, nothing official eventually prevents the neighbor or any other person who's more powerful for example, a person with a gun to get to your house to get your property, and just take it away from you. We tell you that it's very important that we institutionalize this. And this is especially important in the context of these reparations, because look, these reparations, as we tell you, in their best case scenario, is going to be helping only the middle class and the upper class. Why? The weakers are still going to be at loss simply because these weak people are still going to be the weakest and they have no protection from the state to ensure that they have these rights, to ensure that they still have the piece of land that the government gives to them. So we tell you that in best case scenario, if we ignore all of the analysis that we've given to you, that these things are not going to be carried out properly, we still win.

Look, the comparative here is that the change on site opposition happens because we can it can because we give them the ability to do so whereas on the side proposition the change is contingent on the benevolence of the government this is also how we can co-op the site propositions benefits simply because we give these people to ability to achieve these reparations because they can't protest because they have they can't have reforms because of things like that. So the impact here is then the existing power imbalances get much smaller. But lastly, on the point of minorities, this is especially detrimental. We already told you that these countries are not homogenous and that the dominant ethnic group still has the incentives to deprioritize the other ethnic minorities. Look, they'll be the most harassed, they'll be the most disrespected and the most discriminated. And look, reparations are only going to further this world gap. So what we do here, we give them the ability to go to court, to unionize, and we close this discrepancy gap.

That means on a baseline, you have to believe that we are starting with more immediate economic action, immediate economic action that goes to people. Second of all, in regards to prioritization, it is not fair for Slovenia to say that we get democratic rights and economic rights, but you can't even make a land court like in the first place we think because the fact this is a prioritized debate we are able to do things like assume that these leaders aren't going to immediately take the land right away because of the characterization Slovenia brings you third of all we think they're still like countries can't access these resources in the first place obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do not believe that's in fear some many countries do have vast natural resources in the first place. Obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do not believe that's unfair. Some many countries do have vast natural resources in the fourth place and last of all to the extent in which we're talking about nations in these like status quo the opposite has to deal with this. This is not a speculative debate on their behalf it is a debate looking into the past which means that is the ground on which this debate is won. Therefore what we do have to contend with is the actuality of the status quo of what these countries look like. Because according to global reports, three countries in Africa have functioning liberal democracy. That is a whopping statistic considering the accountability they tell you is likely to work. So on this question of accountability, we hear from Slovenia, you can codify rights, ensure the judiciary, and build institutions. Once again, as I'm going to tell you, most of these democracies are likely to be imperfect. This fiat does not assume they can make a beautiful status quo. That means these democracies are susceptible to things like lobbying. They are susceptible to people who are privileged, having massive control, and they are susceptible to falls, which is where all of our second speaker substantive takes into place. Second of all, we would tell you voting is not the only means of accountability, because obviously, to the extent in which these are semi-liberal states are making this way up in their own heads, they are likely to be to some extent receptive to the needs of their public. This means insane leaders like Mugabe are out. What we are dealing with is leaders who perhaps do want to appease their populations therefore when they tell you about things like we get no democracy and institutions that doesn't fall we get a degree of accountability so do they the point is that we are not willing to trade that off for people's food now moving on to the second question about how the principle works in this"

And that's incredibly important because it's not enough to say that these lofty and speculative ideals of democracy are meaningful to people, noting that all their analysis essentially proves that democracy is a good means of getting to an end goal in the first place, assuming it is on the point of agency. We would also tell you that all the analysis about your being in the past you've been stripped by european leaders really falls down when you consider how history functions because yeah rhodesia was normally a democracy many people in these african states are really untrusting of democracies in the first place with good reason that means all of our analysis that, oh, you know, we need democracy, it is a good system. Democracy is the first and only economic political system that exists. We think before democracy, pre-colonial states had systems of consensus, their own structures, people are far more likely to buy into.

Before I move on, I'll take a point of affirmation. On your side, this is all. You're constantly speculating what the people want and the people need. If the people on the country on your side are not going to actually get food, if the people on your side actually need more benefits first, we're actually decided and guaranteeing that African people can determine what they want for themselves. The point is that assumes that this will be implemented in the fullest way possible. Given the way we tell you that these rights are entirely codependent, at the point in which we prove at the very least that they are not implemented perfectly, that is automatically a loss for you. Because money in the hands of people, whether or not they are the poorest people, if those people are not starving, we win.

That is incredibly important. At the point in which you do not have food on the table, being able to vote doesn't matter when that voting system is dominated by elites when you feel like you have no rights in the first place. Large economic disparities are the reason democracy breaks down and when democracy breaks down, there is no tangible thing you can cling on to deliver benefits to these people.

But in any way, based on our second speaker's substantive, it is far better for us that we try and undermine these tensions in the first place.

This is what sort of proposition is doing, they're telling these people that they're not capable of making good decisions for themselves. We believe this is very paternalistic, we believe this is not the right way to go. This is why we tell you that at a point of way, this is like a point of human existence for you to feel in control and for you to feel as if you're worth equally as like your leaders, as like your government and as other people in like around you. And we tell you this is also the prerequisite for you to fully get the benefits of economic rights, because it doesn't mean anything to me that I have a lot of land or that I got cash from cash transfers at the point at which I will be killed at a protest and to try and to actually get more of these rights or at the point in which someone else will go on my land and actually try to steal it from me and i will i will actually end up without all of this land they tell us that we never responded to this prerequisite but this is the response that came even earlier they tell us no thank you that they added that the economic rights are prerequisite for like this civil and political rights we tell you maybe this is the case this is best case for them they never actually proved that but we tell you that even if it is a prerequisite for like this civil and political rights we tell you maybe this is the case this is best case for them they never actually prove that but we tell you that even if it is a prerequisite for you to exercise political and civil rights they never prove to us the likelihood of this actually happening right even if i have like flour in order which is a prerequisite for bread this does not necessarily mean that i'm going to make bread so they cannot prove that they get civil and political rights on their side of the house so we're able to win this clash on the principle and we believe we humanize people and we tell them they're capable on their side of the house they still control them and they still tell them they know better secondly then let's talk about which side actually gets like it improves the lives of people more we tell you that the outside of proposition failed to prove to us why do they get good economic policy right maybe they get it maybe they get it immediately never proved on why is government actually so benevolent that it will give like equal land to all of them. We tell you, firstly, there's likelihood of people actually being killed during the process of rent distribution as happened in Zimbabwe, for example. Secondly, we tell you the elites are lucky to get all of this land at the point in which you as the leader of the movement, at the point in which you as a government that has no checks and no democratic checks and balances. You have selfish incentive to stay in power and you want to give the money and the land to the people that you trust thirdly we tell you that they never responded to all of this then the the money is going to go to like the military generals at the point which these are the people that keep you in power as a government leader however on our side of the house the mechanism for you as a government leader to stay in power is for you to be re-elected so there's a necessity for you to listen to the people this is the mechanism in which you stay in power on proposition the mechanism for you to stay in power is to actually be oppressive government and to give less power to the people less land to the people less cash transfers to the people but also way less rights and actually like backtrack before moving on i can take a poi given the instability we've seen in the African continent as a legacy of post-colonization is far-reaching, do you think that in the case where both policies fail, is it easier for people to hold on to a constitution or a block of land? We believe on our side of the house, we have way more stability at the point where there's less chaos, at the point at which you're able to go to courts, at the point at which you're able to claim your right. On your side of the house, you might get, or might not get land, you might get the land, this is now I'm going to best case scenario of proposition, even if there's an ideal land distribution or cash transfers, there's a high possibility of someone taking it away from you, and you have no ability to claim it back, because you do not have court, you do not have the right to complain, you do not have all of that. Secondly, we also tell you best case scenario for prop, these rights can be revoked in the long term. We see this happening in Zimbabwe at the point in which they're taking the land back away from this. And this is why we're able to win this. But then lastly, we also tell you that these policies, they never proved to us why are these"

And you can use these mechanisms actually achieve something. So there's a leader of your government is the one that you elected and the one that actually fulfills your own wants and needs. On set of proposition, there's a random government that does not necessarily know best what the people want. Secondly, we tell you, you're more likely to unionize and have the ability to unionize at the point at which if you unionize and try to organize your coworkers, you won't be sent to jail on our side of the house because you have these rights written in the Constitution, because this is the first thing that happened after the colonialization. You can and you can actually more likely to do that and achieve all of these benefits on our side of the house. On your side of the house, you try to unionize and the government sent you to jail, as happened to a lot of activists in the Egypt, for example, when like people were activists were put on the terrorist list right even though they were simply peacefully protesting, or in the worst case scenario on their side of the house, where they want to put they never proved to us how do they get democratic rights on their side of the house, this is the long term impact that I'm talking about. So we are able to co-opt a lot of the benefits outside of proposition. However, they never proved to us, why are they able to get this right on their side of the house? We tell it is very, very unlikely at the point in which government has a lot more power on their side of the house because they not give political power to the people. And they're likely to then, at the point in which you protest and the government wants to keep power, it's likely to like shoot you at the protest, which is happening. People are dying at the point in which they protest in Nigeria. And this is what happens on their side. So the people are never able to achieve all of these better rights. But then lastly, let's talk about the worst case scenario for both sides of the house. Their worst case is actually maybe getting some like, is actually sliding back into an autocratic regime at a point at which people aren't able to hold you accountable as a government. So on their side of the house, they have a lot of violence and an autocratic regime at the point at which people aren't able to hold you accountable as a government so on their side of the house they have a lot of like they have a lot of violence and an oppressive regime however on our side of the house maybe our worst case is that maybe we do not get a lot of these economic benefits but at least we have some democratic rights so at least people are not being killed at the point in which they go on the streets because we're able to win even on our worst case scenario i'm so proud to propose All right, thank you very much for that speech and now we stay with the opposition for the"

              "text": "We uniquely give the people of Africa humanization, we tell them they can decide what they need, even if this is not perfect at the start, we're able to give them this right to be improved. Firstly, we're already clearly winning on the those rights are the most important thing, because they never managed to tackle our principle, they just tell you that our principle is not important. Our principle is crucial, because we tell you that we give the people of Africa the right to decide how they're going to control their life. So even if proposition proves to you that cash transfers are going to be perfect, all the people are going to get them, we're unsure as to why people on their side have the right to use this cash in the right way chose to get this cash instead of investing it to a local hospital and chose to actually not and are still why is this more important than you not being too able to be taken away this cash when you're unlawfully thrown in the detention center tortured from all whatever means the government's one the only response they have to all of our claims is that but the prerequisite for civil and political rights is economic reparations. This all falls if I prove to you, which was already proven to all of our speeches, that you cannot actually eradicate inequality. That is a prerequisite that they say for achieving better civil and political rights that it shows to you in second speech but drop in third entered then let's talk about the propositions back to Victory we tell you that the only propositions back to Victory is the likelihood analysis of what is actually going to stay true we tell you that they tell you like civil political rights we reappeared because governments are not willing to give out their power and because democracies are sustainable to lobbying times and times again we have shown to you that we're more likely to have accountability in a democratic regime when you're able to have means and checks of the power as compared to an autocratic regime on the side of a proposition. This means that on our side of the house, you have a lot of mechanisms to keep the government in check. Voting, criticizing the government, going out to protest, but also forming civil unions, labor union to go against your employee when he's denying you the right to go out and get a higher wage. This means that we can achieve far more things for the people, especially those fees that they want. Even if those things are weak at the start, we can see that they might be because there's a limited political capital. They exist and people are able to improve that and they're more likely then to keep those rights. Crucially, it doesn't exist on prop and here's why they lose the debate. One, because this means the satiety of analysis means that the land reparations are going to fail and their entire case falls because of this. The prerequisite analysis I mentioned earlier then relies on you being able to achieve economic and land reparations first. This does not happen because you're not distributing the land correctly, you're not giving it to the most vulnerable people the government wants to hold in power wants to keep in check and the arson is going to give the cash away from themselves they might be giving it to the lead they might be giving to the people that are close to them they might be giving it to the party but the most vulnerable people are never going to get it so i'm unsure as to why their prerequisite analysis actually improves on their side but secondly also about observation they never showed you by minorities in the country are actually going never showed you why minorities in the country are actually going to get land, why minorities in the country are actually going to be able to benefit from their policy. It's far more likely that minorities in the country benefit from our policies, because even if the constitution is weak, even if the democracy and democratic institutions are weak, minorities are able to go out and protest. It's not a prerequisite that you're not starting to go out and protest. People are literally a prerequisite that you're not starting to go out and protest. People are literally able to unionize in the worst conditions possible because they know that they want to improve their conditions. We already give you that analysis. And lastly, the harm that they do is crucial because the harm that they actually do is that the people are not going to be deciding on their side. This is very important. Because one, you are not actually giving the people what they want. I'm unsure as to why people would be prioritizing cash transfer in an institution where they don't have roads when they don't have like hospitals etc why would they not democratically vote for those things to be prioritized i think it's more crucial that people decide what they want but more importantly you're not able to equally demand from the government what you're able to achieve because even if on their side land gets given to like few people, if on our side, people decide for land reparations, all of the people are able to demand through courts land reparations existing. This means that we're able to not only give the people what they want, improve their situation far worse. And this is why you vote for opposition. Thank you very much for that speech."

And I'm starting with this, and it's important, because all of opposition's material are actually contingent on these rights actually being sustained. And note that this notably deals with their principle, because there is no self-determination if democracy does not work. There is no self-determination if people starve and they die. They start this off by saying a few red herrings. Their first line of attack is that they say that because you have the same power means that it has the same level of enforceability. This falls down in three ways. The first thing that we explain at first, it said that it's not just about the power, but it's about the will of the person to actually implement that policy correctly. And to the extent that you were directly giving away power, that is unlikely to be done in a way that's particularly good. We point to the example of Uganda, of Kwame Nkrumah, this opposition has not responded to. The second thing that we point out, because that's not just about instituting rights, but it's about people actively engaging with it. And to the extent that we point out that this system is one that is seen as particularly colonial, because it comes from this Western background, people are unlikely to have the sort of faith that this opposition would require to actually have an effective democracy. The third thing that we explain is that notice the extent you have to believe opposition's rights to fail is exceptionally low. Because we point out all down the bench that failing one right necessitates failing many others, whereas even if they can mitigate some of our benefits in terms of not getting land reparations, still getting cash transfers, that is clearly something that we're still on top of in this debate. All that is to say that the world of this opposition is not a functioning democracy. Because we point out it's easy to miscount votes, as we point out it's easy to gerrymander, we point out that there are all these reasons and all these ways that the people in power can skew it and they have the incentive to do so meaning that they do not get the democracy they want. The second line of attack is that they say what's constituted constitutional but that ignores the fact we give you all these why that constitution while it may exist is unlikely to be applied correctly the third line of attack is to keep talking about zimbabwe but we know from first this is out of the debate because mugabe would not implement either policy under either side successfully which is to say that it's symmetric which means that you cannot weigh that the final line of attack is say that we implemented poorly because they we lack land force we will know this is a prioritized debate perhaps we can have land force but we will prioritize the economic reparations. And that is what this opposition has to deal with. So with that in mind, they cannot claim any of their benefits on democracy."

Even even taking opposition is the best they have not answered why it is worth waiting decades for people to stop starving we point to the fact that 1.2 million people have starved in ethiopia and that is the reality and that is what this opposition has to defend which they have not the very benefit of humanization is not enough to overcome death itself because you cannot feel humanized if you are dead you cannot gain that benefit mentally if you're someone who's no longer living because you have starved at the end of that that is clearly the greatest way that we win this debate and this opposition has no response other to say that maybe in a few years maybe in a few decades we might be able to get change we get it right now we save those lives finally do economic reparations lead"

Secondly, why economic reform leads to greater political accountability. Before moving into arguments, two points of setup. Firstly, on our stance. Our goal is simple. We want to break down existing economic privileges and redistribute them to the people through two methods. A, we're happy to confiscate the wealth of the super-rich and redistribute this to the people on the ground. But B, we're happy to redistribute the sources of wealth, which essentially is land, which was controlled by ex-colonial powers as well as local elites who were prioritized in the colonial regime."

              "text": "The second point I've set up on what both worlds look like. Firstly, what are we willing to trade off on our side of the house? We're happy to give up on democratic reforms, for example, the right to vote, the right to protest, since our claim is that these will not be respected anyways on opposition world. But secondly, what do we imagine our world to look like? We think it is likely to look like a set of non-elected officials crafting and implementing policies. For example, we think this looks like in Indonesia, where prominent nationalists who fought for independence collectively made decisions with Skarno as the unelected president. Obviously, we're happy to concede that this body is not completely accountable, but we think there is a significant interest in uniting the country, as the period immediately after colonialism coincides with the peak of nationalism, where the people, prominent nationalists in particular, are bound against a common enemy that is the symbolism of colonialism. Given this setup, first argument then, why the breaking down of economic privileges are necessary for economic activation. The thesis under this is that economic and land reforms are necessary for people to live a fulfilled life and uniquely get that on side opposition. Why then does economic privileges actively shackle people to endless poverty? Two reasons and points in chat, please. Firstly, because landowners have massive leverage over individuals. This is to say people are forced to make unfair concessions to landowners because they're economically dependent on them. In truth, they need that land to farm, so they're naturally forced to listen to the plantation owners. This means two things. A, they live under harsh conditions where most of their profit are sucked away by landowners. But B, they're often forced to stay in a particular piece of land for a long amount of time due to their contracts, which deprives their mobility. The second reason is that it is empirically true that African countries are resource rich, but these resources are monopolized by elites. This looks like the United Africa Company under the British government monopolizing oil in Nigeria. The profits earned through the excavation of these resources are hoarded by Western elites, which comes at the massive opportunity cost of bringing that wealth to the people on the ground. These two mechanisms prove that poor people in Africa will structurally continue to stay poor in the future. What is the comparative then? Firstly, in the short term, wealth redistribution allows people to survive, allows people to have food on the table and pay their rent. But second of all, in the long term, greater economic opportunities accrue in two ways. One, individuals are able to access greater earnings. Now that farmers aren't sucked up most of their profit and can use that leftover money, but also have ownership of land, means they can produce more crops, make harvest more efficient, and able to start up new businesses. But two, the country is able to access increased economic opportunities in three ways. Firstly, the increased size of local market. People being wealthier means local companies in domestic markets are likely to thrive, creating more job opportunities. But secondly, increased supply of cheap labor. Insofar as individuals are not constrained to landlords anymore, this means they can now seek employment in alternative jobs in these cities, which provides attractive cheap labor to companies, and especially foreign multinational companies, which means there's more investment, especially from foreign countries. Thirdly, we take back control over lucrative natural resources. This looks like Botswana regaining their diamond industry, Nigeria regaining their oil industry, which gets a lot of profit. But the difference is the profit is now to the people of the country. All these proves that we enable people to become more economic affluent in the future. Obviously, this is debate winning, important in and of itself, since the vast majority of people living in African countries are devastating poor and we need to help that on our side of the house. But this argument also has another implication in the round as well, since we would argue that"

Your only incentive as to why this economic redistribution will be done well is that they want to fight against colonialism. If we already are in a post-colonial state, why isn't an overriding incentive to favor your more your closer ethnicity and to favor your cronies? I already gave you three independent mechanisms why it's likely that the individuals are allowed on the ground are able to access economic benefits. I think that's independent from the POI and what you're talking about on your side of the house. The second argument then why economic reform leads to greater political accountability. The thesis under this is that economic liberation leads to better accountability in the long term, in the most successful instance, democratization. Two reasons why this is the case. Firstly, economic development creates greater incentives and capacities on the part of the people to hold governments to account. This is because when people have achieved minimal economic rights, they're likely to start asking for higher levels of rights, like political rights, and have greater capacity to spend their time organizing rallies and gaining information"

These reasons prove why you're likely to get accountability on our side of the house. On the comparative, we would argue that political reform will not create accountable system for three reasons. Firstly, because democratic institutions are very weak. This is because, for example, there's a lack of systems that effectively supervises electoral conduct in many countries. This means elections under opposition have to rely on the good faith of potential candidates. But this is problematic because there's obviously incentive to cheat, like stuffing the ballot box or rigging the election, because not cheating means you significantly reduce the chance of you winning the election since you cannot gather other politicians not cheating. Thus, there becomes a race to the bottom. But secondly, the concentration of wealth results in the capture of politics by wealthy elites. For example, they can aggressively lobby politicians to protect and entrench their veterans' interests, or control media to influence how people think and make decisions. This means in the absence of economic liberalization, which you uniquely get, they're unlikely to ever get a functioning democracy. But thirdly, and importantly, even if elections are to an extent functional, we think democracy leads to ethnocentric politics. This is because the most reasonable platform for politicians in ethnically divided countries is to prioritize certain ethnicities to cement their support and guarantee their votes. I.e., if you're neutral, you're unlikely to get votes from any ethnicity. This means that the best form of politics opposition side gets is one that only caters to the majority and oppresses the minority in places like Kenya, where the Kikuyu people are always prioritized at the expense of other ethnic groups. This also increases tension on their side of the house. The conclusion of this argument is that at best, opposition side gets a dysfunctional system of accountability, comparatively may take a little longer on our side, but we get a proper accountability mech that lasts into the future. I've never been prouder to propose."

A, individuals deserve fair elections that are free from vote buying and intimidation because people deserve agency in the forces that govern them. They deserve to create coalitions and vote for blocs that can represent and negotiate their concerns in politics. B, we would give them the right to assemble, which allows them to formalize their stances and collectivize with those who share similar struggles to join their cause in lobbying. But crucially, greater political rights means they have stronger influence on the government, which dictates both national and local policies and enforces laws and protections for everyone. Before my substantives, a few rebuttals. First, they tell us that we're going to confiscate from the super- rich. Note, this is where more people are likely to be in fear of cracking down and conflict. When you take away from the rich, i.e. the lands of the Afrikaners, they will likely retaliate and take up arms left over from the liberation conflict. The meta here is that it would actually be harder to attain this land, therefore taking a longer time to distribute it to the public, meaning that people will stay poor for still a significantly long amount of time on prop. But secondly, I want to respond to their first claim that post-liberation Africa is poor. Our comparative solves this because we give lands to farmers and revive markets that create jobs. The response here is note that all of this is contingent on the assumption that farmers know what to do with this land, know how to sell this land, and know how to create sustainable markets. Prop had to discuss this through this process or their impact just doesn't happen. I would say that you're unlikely to get this because education is a right that is cemented by civil and political rights when we set up stable political and civil institutions that prop just doesn't have. So people are just left massively uneducated under their side because all they dealt with is conflict and is conflict and liberation. First substantive"

The framing here then is that for centuries, African populations were treated as second-class citizens in their land. We shouldn't repeat mistakes of the past by providing rights to help them construct a stronger identity. A few reasons. One, political rights are necessary to create common identity and curb ethnic violence. A, these rights, such as the freedom to assemble and fair elections, are shaped by people's preferences and are crucial for nation building. People need to and can only be represented by forming coalitions that represent them, e.g. as racial minorities or poor rural groups. In post-colonial South Africa, the white Afrikaner minority restricted the ballot for the African majority, depriving them of representation. The only way to prevent this is through free elections that aren't monopolized by the elite. But we create an inclusive national identity. political rights protect the freedom to practice religion and culture without interference. On our side, the Ndebele people can practice their beliefs without the Shona majority cracking down on them in Zimbabwe. more ethnic participation allows diverse representation of different identities in the academe. This enables policies like that in Botswana, where all 12 ethnic groups' cultures are celebrated in schools. In their world, minorities can't vote or create organizations, since their views are silenced by liberation leaders coming from the majority, i.e. Kenyatta being a kikuyu. See, we mediate conflict and violence. So post-liberation, these states don't have robust systems that quell violence. When citizens are deprived of the ability to decide leaders and feel unrepresented, they default to violence. We saw this in Kenya in 2007, where the rigged elections forced the Luo minority to engage in conflict because a leader was unfairly elected and didn't represent them. In our world, these people are given a peaceful avenue to recognize differences to be ballad. But note, in the absence of a representative parliament, it triggers secession, as we saw with South Sudan feeling unrepresented by the North. With political rights, majority groups have no incentive to include minorities, allowing them to build racist nationalist sentiment against other identities. This is why it's crucial to reinforce the rights of forming blocs and coalitions so that marginalized groups would be incentivized to cause further division. In our world, people wouldn't have resorted to extreme lengths because they have representation by ballot, access, and vote. Second reason, political rights"

States are more likely to equally distribute economic development when they have to cater to voting bases beyond their ethnicity. So if people vote for a leader and demand cash transfers and education programs, we are likely to have equitable economic distribution. But two. We ensure sustainable development through taxation, since taxation is only possible when people trust their leaders and governments. We ensure this by allowing the right to vote and allowing people to decide their leaders, as opposed to it being the unelected elite. This means that we get more education and health care that wholly benefit people. Note that this is different from providing economic rights to individuals. But B, on the comparative, economic rights don't lead to civil and political rights. This is why I deal with the second argument when they try to go up by saying it leads to political accountability. I'll prove why that's not true here. So note, there will always be a disparity between the elites and the masses because they will get more resources, either because they are more in number or because they have direct high city government. So even if resources were distributed fairly, you're unlikely to do things like challenge authority, especially when the state can easily take it away using the same power they used to give it to you. So in states like Zimbabwe, citizens know that the lands were seized and expropriated, and property rights were the things that states could easily revoke. This is why a more participatory approach to land distribution can only be done when civil and political rights are secured. We recognize that these are going to be long discussions, but these are done much better when political rights are enshrined first. I'll take the point. We write that political reform is far more difficult since elites have incentive to monopolize on political rights given they want more stability in the government. Yeah, under our side, we would rather enshrine political and civil rights where we strengthen the current government and the rights that people deserve, as opposed to having an unelected elite being the person in power without any checks and balances. Twofold impacts our first argument. One, we ensure post-liberation Africa gets short-term stability, which is crucial because you need short-term stability to get to long-term change. But two, we demonstrate that we get more sustainable economic development when we ensure that there is trust in the state and greater accountability in the process."

One, the struggle for liberation, no thank you, was unequal, with concentrated power towards certain groups as granted by the colonizers. So some ethnic groups were given more rights and more land compared to others. So A, ethnicities had different contributions towards the revolutionary struggle.

So unofficial from the Hausa tribe can prioritize their kin and not give land to the rightful owner from the Igusa tribe can prioritize their kin and not give land to the rightful owner from the Igbo tribe. So these conflicts over land cannot be solved by any pragmatic means or economic reasoning because the point of tension is a group's historical or cultural claim to this. This then further drives economic tensions. In our world, political rights are less prone to corruption as it is much easier to implement by giving access to ballots. Moreover, any unfair distribution is more likely to be scrutinized since all groups want universal access due to the fear of being disenfranchised next. But B, this process is likely to descend into violence. Why? One, the expropriated land and businesses are likely to have had existing Afrikaner owners with vested interests. Just like the Rhodesian Bush War, they would have likely had arms and funds left over from the conflict. This proves that on side prop, their world is more prone to mismanagement and failure.

And the new ones that I want to add here, that land ownership is contentious because there was no record of land in the first place.

But if you think about it, it's quite strange when their analysis themselves is your ability to have money can decide, can ensure that you influence politics.

One, there's a greater incentive to strengthen these institutions at the point at which you enshrine these rights. It's much easier since it's inalienable and universal, especially when a lot of liberation leaders had to ensure that the majority were behind them. Mandela had to ensure that the Black majority were enfranchised. So it's quite unclear as to why they wouldn't do that under their side. But secondly, lobbying doesn't matter when obviously the majority of the people in that country are still Africans, and therefore they're still likely to want to outvote the white African minority. But secondly, your legitimacy as, for instance, the ANC, is based on ensuring that you give benefits to those people and therefore it is unclear to what extent that lobbying still occurs under their side. What did they say then? They say that we create ethnic politics under our side. But the nuance here is quite simple. Insofar as you need to win votes and you need to ensure that you win as, get a wider base as possible, it's the fact that politics actually disincentivizes you from being nativistic and from being racist. The fact that you need to get votes out from your group but from different groups to be able to out-compete other politicians is a unique disincentive under our side to alienate people. Under their side, there is no incentive at all to try to be inclusive, to try to pander to different groups. And at their point, that is where you're more likely to incite violence when these people have no alternatives whatsoever, when these politicians are more likely to be inflammatory and aggressive. That is what happens then, and their side will likely lead to more violence. Their only response under our side was an attempt to say that the tipping point actually is when politicians don't fulfill their promises. I don't think this is the case, because the fact that other politicians will just say that they will be able to fix those things and be able to ensure that you get that economic welfare, which likely means our comparative where you get little to no representation for minorities is a tipping point for violence. Before I move on to the extension, I'll take a point. Your concession that politicians need to get votes off so they're going to cater towards ethnic groups is literally our case. We're telling you in the comparative they don't have to do this because they're going to be a revolutionary group and that we're happy to trade off elections. You have to agree to the comparative. Politicians win on margins. You need to cater to a wide base because if not, you're more likely to lose. Under your side, if they are an unaccountable elite, to what extent are they more willing to cater to minority groups? To what extent are they willing to redistribute that land to people not of their ethnic majority? Politicians, political rights, and accountability that is inherent to our side is the sole disincentive to ensure that ethnic cronyism happens under our side. The extension then is that this allows greater foreign investment into democratic states. And I think investment is more likely to flow into democratic states than authoritarian ones under their side for two reasons. One, investors look at key indices like the Freedom House Index as a metric of how politically stable the country is. Investors don't want to channel money into countries with high corruption as they're unlikely to yield a return of investment as officials can pocket more money under their side insofar as they're unaccountable. But the second thing to point out is the US, post-Cold War, wanted to prevent countries from opting into communism and spent billions funding democratic states. So they wanted to ensure that strong democratic rights were there. They're more likely to invest in countries that are more democratic and authoritarian than under their side. The reason why this is important is even if there's some degree of inequality under our side, and we would assume that it's true, that we amass more resources on net. Because in Proposition's best case, when you redistribute existing land and engage in cash transfers, the amount of wealth circulating is largely minimal because all the reasons they say themselves, that these people were unlikely to earn large wages. fact that the the colonizers extracted a lot of wealth through plunder extracted their natural resources meant the only way to ensure we increase the size of the pie overall is to ensure greater foreign investment under their side investors know that that the government can take away their land at any moment and therefore you weaken things like investor confidence much more we win on the political side of the thing of things but we also ensure"

              "text": "Firstly, then on our points about economic benefits. Now, I just want to, first of all, engage their point that they brought up in their deputy about how there will be foreign investments in these countries because there's democracy. I just want to question the feasibility of this, because it's extremely speculative, right? Presumably, these investors won't invest billions of dollars into the nation just because they're the democratic. This didn't happen, empirically speaking, and therefore, it's not very likely that that investment will exist. Their side has to actually mechanize why this is feasible. Now, our argument here was that economic benefits are likely to happen for many of the mechanisms that we gave. I'm going to engage to what they engaged to one by one. First of all, they say that, like, why would the government distribute fairly, right? But our engagement to this is that the people who are likely to be in power is the nationalists who overturned the government that used to rule in the past. So when there's no elections, they have incentive to not to anger the people, because the way in which they got the power initially to overturn the governments is by the popular power, right? Moreover, the way in which they get overthrown, their current state of power gets overthrown is through massive protests and such. Therefore, insofar as they have an active incentive to try not to anger the majority, they have the incentive to try to distribute this land fairly amongst all ethnicities. Therefore, this is a mechanism for why the government is likely to distribute fairly. And then secondly, they say something about how ethnic unaccountability and how the record of lands is not there. Two responses. Firstly, factually, I challenge this on set, right? We can just counterassert that there is record of land, given the fact that these are likely to be from like 200 years ago. It's still likely that things like land records still existed. And moreover, given that developed nations like England was the one who invaded these countries, it's very likely that they kept precise note of who was in rule of which area. But secondly, presumably, given the incentive that I said earlier about how governments have the incentive to allocate fairly, it's very likely that the government will allocate fairly. But then thirdly, they challenge the feasibility of this argument that elites would get really, really mad and you would have to fight them. I'm going to flip this argument and say that elites are more likely to be mad on their side of the house. Because the thing is, on both sides of the house, you're going to enrage the elites to a certain degree. Because they're both affected by their political monopoly being taken away and their economic capacity being taken away and being risk distributed, right? The comparative then becomes on which side is elites likely to be less mad. Now, elites are likely to be less mad on our side of the house because even if they lose some of their land, they're still likely to be an upper class, right? However, when you actually give the people the right to actually speak up, and if all side government says it's true, it's very likely that then their whole power will collapse, and therefore it's very likely that their whole land will be taken away. They'll suffer disproportionate impacts. Therefore, it's very likely that elites are more interested in presuming a monopoly over the political rights in land. Then the fourth thing. So even if we can't claim fair distributions, which is our worst case, by putting economic and land reparation at the priority, we have reasonable fiat to say that even if the extent of the impact we can claim is relatively marginal, we can still claim some kind of impact on land and economy, and therefore there will be some allocation of land and economy to the people on the ground. I'm going to take this argument a step further then. So I'm going to prove to you why even if you get unfair distribution, i i.e. only small portion of the land, why we can still claim all of our benefits and why that's ground winning. So we told you, and this is for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that we told you in first that multiplier effects happen. So if you have your own land, presumably you can grow crops, you can sell it, and you are likely to make decisions in a way that maximizes your utility and how it multiplies this money, which means that we can claim our impact on the economic benefits for the individuals on the ground. They minorly engage with this by saying that these people don't have education. But even if you don't have education, you have the ability to assess what maximizes your utility, right? For example, growing two crops increases your capacity to stay safe economically and such. Therefore, I don't think these are hard decisions. They can claim this without education. But secondly, this is like individuals are likely to like economic reforms produce linear outcomes and politics is very zero sum. So the problem with political reform is that it's all or none. So in other words, even if you're granted the right to vote, if the government doesn't have the incentive to listen to you and does things like election fraud, it's very unlikely that it creates any pragmatic change. On our side of the house, if you're given even just a small number of money, it can lead to bigger outcomes for the reason that we provided above. Therefore, it's very likely that if the comparative is that on their side, you get a small portion of political rights, and on our side, you get a small portion of economic rights, the comparative lies on our side. With that, why is this in and of itself debate winning in the sense that even if we lose out on all of the democratic benefits, we can win independently on economy? Because it's very likely that for the majority of individuals in this debate, which are extremely poor farmers in post-colonial Africa, they're literally struggling to find food on the table and they're unable to get education and the right to free speech is unlikely to be of much importance."

So your only mitigation that this causes civil violence when the elite rises up is that they're going to have some of their land left. But if I'm not mistaken, isn't all of the land of these elite unjustly acquired by these people? Even if it's unjustly acquired, we framed a model that they would be redistributed to the people to a portion of degree. So they're likely that they're still going to be able to own some kind of land and therefore we can still claim all very impacts so by the end of this I'm able to prove to you that economy can be claimed on our side even if it's a small portion which leads to a bigger impact and that's why we independently win I'm going to engage secondly on the theme of democracy two things firstly why the ethnic tension will get worse on their side secondly why we can get sustainability firstly then why the tension between ethnicity will likely get worse. So this is by far the least important delta in the debate, and so far as these ethnic minorities are likely to be caring more about financial liberations than whatever their ability to like free speech and etc. But essentially, all of PM's material was that division between ethnicities exists, and giving them political voice in elections will lead to more sustainable politics. I have three or four engagements. Firstly, this tension will exist symmetrically, right? Yong-ho already told you this. Even if you don't give them votes, supposedly there will be a huge fight over which ethnicity is the most powerful in politics. Therefore, this point is completely destroyed insofar as this tension is likely to exist symmetrically. But secondly, let me break down their premise, that coalition and voice will not matter in this debate. Because the crucial context of this debate is that this exists in a paradigm where there's a lack of political infrastructure, given that they just recently got independence. Therefore, it's very likely that there's likely not much accountability. This means that the current government, if their side is true in saying that they have bad incentives, is likely to manifest in the worst forms, like, for example, oppression of these coalitions and these voices. Therefore, it's not very likely that this matters in the debate. Thirdly, I'm going to flip their arguments in two ways. Firstly, the ethnic group that likely overthrew the colonial government is the ethnic party that supposedly got the support from a majority of other ethnic groups because they needed arms and they needed that power, right? Therefore, we can claim that these parties actually have the incentive to cater to other ethnic minorities as well. But secondly, you significantly increase the capacity for ethnicities to be disproportionately be affected in politics. Because insofar as there is election, it's much more likely that they will want to secure votes. And the easiest way for politicians to do so is ethnicity, right? This increases fighting on the grounds of ethnicities. They say something else that they want to cater to the majority, but that's really hard to do do the easiest way to garner support as a politician exactly given their framing that ethnic tension is likely exist in these nations is to cater to people's interest of their ethnicities and therefore this ethnic tension will likely get worse on their side of"

Firstly, if it's true that political rights won't be respected, it is unclear to opposition why redistribution won't be respected will suddenly be respected as well. It is unclear why proposition seems to assert that a lot of the harms and a lot of the loopholes and deletes, something that they'll pursue in political redistribution, but suddenly they won't do it in economic redistribution, especially since Prop 1 didn't just claim that they're going to redistribute wealth, they're also going to redistribute these sources of wealth, and that means the elites can't even recoup the wealth even if they lose it. But secondly, they said that there's a lack of political infrastructure. It's also unclear why, on their side, they suddenly have sufficient economic infrastructure to ensure equitable redistribution across all ethnic groups. Especially since what we explain down the bench is that a lot of minorities were barred from owning these lands. A lot of their records might not even be existent exactly because they were not allowed to own these things. If there were, it is the fact that they were decades and even centuries apart and are likely to be disputed within each other given that colonizers made arbitrary lines and divided communities up. It's unclear then why Proposition is able to assure that their policy will succeed. And this is important because a lot of their benefits literally rely on equitable distribution and it being successful. This is not to say that political representation is something that is successful on our side. What the opposition has to prove is that it will be marginally better and that we're able to lessen the majority of the extreme harms that we have explained."

              "text": "On to the clashes then. Chat, please. Firstly, which is the prerequisite? Economic or political rights? I want to raise two points. One, you need accountable democratic institutions to ensure a lot of proposition benefits, especially if the proposition model is a committee. Like what if that committee is sorry, especially since the reason of a common enemy existing as an incentive is not compelling at all, given that these colonizers are already gone. But secondly, they said it's revolutionary leaders and the only reason that they gave as to why they usually come from the minorities because they have a lot to fight for. But you also want to take note that even people from the majority were also oppressed, that's why they even joined the revolution to begin with. We gave you structural reasons as to why they tend to be in the majority groups. First is that they're the ones that can easily round up more people to join the revolution to begin with. We gave you structural reasons as to why they tend to be in the majority groups. First is that they're the ones that can easily round up more people to join the revolution exactly because they came from the dominant group. But secondly, that they are richer and can fund the revolution. That is what happened in Zimbabwe. The conclusion to this is that on their side of the house, they literally have to contend that the redistribution will literally be handled by elites or people from the majoritarian groups. The problem is that they have no checks and balances, at least we do. The second thing I want to deal with is that the elite can skew elections. Firstly, if this is actively rigging, we have whistleblowers and journalists. If anything, it's on their side where rigging is more potent because we never tried establishing a bill of rights we never tried to ensure the protection of whistleblowers and journalists on our side of the house if they try to suppress journalists around like a politician tries to do that that's even if they don't get like found out it's already a red flag and it implicates themselves already. But secondly, on this point that people are beholden to landowners and that's why their vote will be skewed. One, how will they know who you vote for? Your vote is private in the voting booth. But secondly, that's why we need constitutions that will protect human rights. It is a false dichotomy that we have to defend owners not paying their workers well because that is literally things that are protected in constitutions which we are able to strengthen when we preclude political rights before economic representation to begin with so in conclusion i would posit that political rights do preclude economic benefits and it is untrue that a proposition can claim otherwise the second"

              "text": "issue then is in preventing conflict and maybeating differences. Before that, POI. So on your comparative on which one is a prerequisite, our claim was that you don't need accountable parties to claim our impact on the economy. Insofar as being given a small portion of land is enough for our whole impact to stand in a way to stand in this debate. How do you engage with that? If assuming the best case that they give you that land having the question if the state can take it away which they could especially if you can't vote if especially if you can rally and especially if you can't even assemble together the second issue then on preventing conflict and mediating differences before i proceed i want to point out the contradiction so p3 says that the elite don't like political rights, but P2 argues that they prefer political rights. So which really is it? We think it's one or the other. And this is important because this literally takes out a lot of the reputation that P3 launches or else it contradicts their partner. Three things I want to point out. If it's true that landowners and the elites are immensely powerful, I would like to ask how will they react? We suggest that it would be a violent way. The comparative on our side is that we incite violence less. Why? Because taxation does not remove their wealth massively or entirely. And this is important because on their side, you're literally removing their source of wealth. On our side, even if you tax it, since they still have the source of their wealth, they can recruit that wealth anyway. So there's more buy-in. But secondly, they said that the only point of democracies being majoritarian, one, smaller groups can form coalitions and blocs to get representatives. But additionally, ethnicities would be very wary when legislation about repression about other ethnicities are being passed on. And the reason as to why is because they're scared that they might be the next ethnicity that will be subjected to this type of policy. But secondly, in the most consequential legislation that usually happens on amendments, that usually happens in massive funding bills, you often need a super majority. So there's an incentive to actually appeal to groups, even smaller ones, if you want legislation to pass. And that's how the incentive for the majorities even care about smaller ethnic groups. Lastly, assuming the worst case, democracies offer a non-violent alternative, especially since it's inherent for people to have disagreements. Like let's assume that they're both ethnically different. That is not going to disappear on proposition side. Democracies allow an avenue that is not violent inherently, that you can vote for different representatives, that can join different political blocs and have disagreeing ideology. Even if you still lead the conflict, it becomes a last resort instead of a first resort. On their side, because they have funds to arms as proposition says, if that's the case, then it's literally more likely, especially since ethnic strife might still be existent on their side. On the last issue then, on the access to basic needs and development. One is on the access to basic needs. We have access is on the access to basic needs. We have access to welfare because we have transparent governments which means spending goes into public housing, education, and healthcare. On their side, you have to believe that everyone will be able to spend properly."

It's unclear to me how having a parcel of land would even matter if you don't have a water line going through it or a road that can transport your goods to begin with. But secondly, it is short-term because of the high risk of mismanagement, especially if we're talking about people who went from handling small-scale industries to massive resources. In Zimbabwe, the abrupt land expropriation caused severe food shortages. In Ghana and Zambia, the mining industry tanked because they were run by inexperienced people. This is important because once the resources are mismanaged, it's difficult to go back once you've starved people that has already happened. We conclude then that if you want to preserve not only the political and human rights of these people, but also economic development, but also in the future, we compel you to side with the opposition.

Firstly, on the incentive of elites, my question here is quite simple. Would you rather risk losing all of your money or give up a large amount but still live comfortably? I think it's the latter. Because even if you lose a lot of money as an elite, they are so powerful that this doesn't impact the standard of living for these individuals as much. The larger harm for them is losing all of their political rights, because that means all of the rest of their money was also going to get taken away. And that was why it was significantly harder for opposition to claim that change is going to happen on their side, because elites are less willing to give this up. Secondly, on accountability, we come analytically prior here because we structurally prove why we're more likely to get accountability because when things like governments getting overthrown happen, when military coups happen, it is far easier for people to hold governments accountable for taking away their land than taking away their political rights because whether or not a political right exists is very subjective."

That's not on our burden. Rather, we told you that even if people use this land in a terrible way, having economic benefits was the prerequisite to getting political rights. And this was the winning argument that we didn't get engagement from. This is for two reasons. One, that having good constitutions do not matter if people cannot go to that voting booth, if people cannot go to that rally in protest because they have to be working on their farm 24-7 because their landlords take away all of their money. But secondly, even if you can go to the voting booth on their side, there are invisible measures, there are invisible measures like election fraud, which are likely to happen on their side, as we see in the status quo in Africa. They needed to engage with this because insofar as they don't, we come analytically prior to them."

All they say is that land is likely to be taken away. Let's be charitable and say it's speculative at best as to who gets more of what, whether we get more political rights or they get more economic benefits. We still win this for two reasons. First, because of the sustainability wing that I gave you at the top that we're able to help and influence millions and increasingly more number of people on a scale. But second, on the money multiplier effect that we told you about down the bench, that political reform is all or nothing, where you have to make the government listen or the majority to opt into you to get any reforms. For economic reforms, we told you there were likely to be linear outcomes. So even if the amount of money you got at the start was small, even if governments redistributed this in an unfair way, you can find ways to make your life better with that. And we specifically told you that this was likely to have trickle-down benefits for the most vulnerable individuals, because they never proved why they're able to help those people on a structural matter we told you that when middle class individuals get money which is likely to happen for the characterization we gave you about who was likely to be the people in power which was Nationalist on our side those people had an incentive to do this which means that they were likely to make things like farms they were likely to start things like small businesses which hired the most vulnerable which made money circulate in our economy they needed to respond to our analysis for all those reasons propose thank you for that speech thanks everyone for the debate"

Firstly, we think post-colonial African states share a few characteristics, namely, one, strong grassroots movements formed during colonial rule to fight for independence. Two, their economic system was designed for colonizers to extract wealth from them, so poverty is rampant. And three, note that all post-colonial African states in the status quo pursued a mixed bag of political and economic strategies. So this debate must be about reimagining the world on which of the two we should have prioritized at the point of independence under the rule of a good faith government. Otherwise, neither team can deliver"

This will look like roughly three things. Firstly, establishing committees responsible for fairly redistributing wealth and property who prioritize distribution from those who unfairly took wealth under colonialism to the economically disenfranchised. Secondly, establishing quotas within the workplace and schools to ensure equitable access to employment and education. And thirdly, cash transfer programs to marginalized groups. Three, we think in reimagining the world, a post-colonial Africa, absent of civil and political rights, will not be a society that lacks all fundamental human rights. This is because local leaders in a newly independent state have directly suffered under colonialism, incentivizing them to ensure that the basic humanity which was eroded under colonial powers is now safeguarded. Therefore, fundamental human rights such as the freedom from slavery and torture exist, whereas civil and political rights such as expression, the political expression and assembly are not specifically codified by the law. Two arguments"

              "text": "in this speech. The first on how immediate economic relief is second to none in safeguarding the livelihoods and upliftment of African nations. There are three parts underneath this argument. First of all, I'd like to note that in the hierarchy of competing rights, economic upliftment must supersede political empowerment. This is because economic rights are instrumental to the right to life, because the biggest obstacle is in the state. It's starvation, disease, and intergenerational poverty. Finite resources mean that millions spent to build voting booths on op could have been used to feed the malnourished and earn acceptable income so their children could go to school instead of being forced into child labor. Perishing means there aren't any political expressions to be made, because when you survive, it becomes your utmost priority. The right to life is a gateway right that is fundamental to human dignity and comes prior to everything else. Why then is saving lives exclusively a prop? Because it's a time-sensitive issue. Lives are at stake. Democracy requires the state to carefully debate, pass, and implement public policies. So even if you get political rights, economic policies will only come way after. In the meantime, the lives we lose waiting for immediate relief are irreversible. But economic policies on the side of op will be far less efficient, as state resources are stretched thin for nationwide projects. On-prompt, direct cash transfers and land in the hands of the people gives them the agency to ameliorate their specific economic situation. Those who need medical care and shelter can get it directly instead of waiting on the state to develop things like public housing or hospitals. But secondly, we think our economic reparations uniquely empower the people in a few key ways. In many African states, natives were robbed of their land and consigned to barren parts of the country. In South Africa, the 1913 Natives Land Act was apartheid's original sin because it conscripted Black South Africans who formed 76% of the population and restricted them to land ownership in just a tenth of the country's land, systematically shutting them out of metropolitan cities. Only we reverse it by the restoration of land rights because ownership over land land improves integration between ethnic groups, because we prevent things like segregation, and we allow individuals to use their land as collateral for things like investment to build their wealth. We don't provide access to education and jobs for disenfranchised groups. It opens up access to income streams where otherwise they would be impoverished, allowing access to upward social mobility but lastly we think economic reparations in the wake of decolonization addresses Africa's crippling underdevelopment because their underdevelopment stems from foreign powers using them to extract natural resources and exploit cheap labor when consumers are impoverished there isn't a viable market and labor exploitation perpetuates the cycle of poverty because workers never gain adequate disposable income to attract meaningful FDI. Economic reparations means consumers will have purchasing power. Hence, foreign investors won't stop at just setting up low-cost supply chains. Rather, they'll set up businesses and invest in the growing economy. This sparks job creation and lessens the economic burden of the state when FDI contributes towards growth. But without economic reparations, we think opposition creates a unique vulnerability in africa as prolonged destitution means they're more prone to the outbreak of things like conflicts disease and death the lack of resources exacerbates existing social ills and is insufficient to create any meaningful impact before i move on to the second argument sure i'll take point. In a post-colonial impoverished, largely backward economy like Africa, who creates all these jobs, has enough money to create healthcare and education, and how?"

              "text": "So we think, first of all, if you're going to contest the lack of resources, that is a problem your side needs to deal with as well. Because note that the implementation of rights is also contingent on resources. If you solely want to make this debate the fact that post-colonial African nations are broke and they have absolutely zero resources, your side cannot claim your benefits as well. Moving on to the second argument as to how civil and political rights cannot be exercised meaningfully without new wealth. Three parts here. The first, wealth inherently allows participants of a democracy to gain the political system in two ways. One, through lobbying. The financial elite and the state will collude to create an ecosystem of power at the top where political and economic favors are constantly exchanged. Companies that receive state subsidies and contracts inevitably cement themselves as the dominant market force, and these newly crowned financial elite then fund political campaigns of the ruling parties to continue receiving these"

              "text": "political rights are strongly entrenched, like in the US, where lobbying actively undermines the public will. But two, we think meaningful access to free speech and association is impossible without money, because the financial elite who dominate mainstream media have excessive channels to exercise those rights, their platforms to shape public opinions in their favor and a greater influence in determining which parties and candidates get into power thus we leave you not challenged the concentration of wealth the financial elite heavy chokehold on power what keeps them in the driving seat of democracy is to keep others locked in an inescapable poverty trap by the deregulation of industries, low wages, and low redistribution of wealth, which is exactly what we see in Africa today. But the second part of this argument is how economic oppression is in the heart of African suffering, and political rights uniquely fail to alleviate it. Because the lack of economic enfranchisement means that while segregation may be abolished on paper, it's purely tokenistic, because Black South Africans stay trapped in slums because they simply do not have the resources to move elsewhere while white Afrikaners prosper across city lines. That is the world of modern apartheid that opposition stands for. We think therefore money is the prerequisite for the state to enshrine rights because when faced with limited resources in a nation's coffers, the state has no choice but to trade off certain rights. In those instances, the wealthiest actors who have the largest political say get their rights paradise. Finally, we put power back in the hands of people by giving them wealth, because disposable income empowers individuals to make their political opinions impactful. They're able to fund campaigns and signal their strength to governments because it cements their influence as an important voter block. Hunger rings louder than any political promise. On opposition, they hand the impoverished words, we uniquely grant them the ticket to survival. I'm so proud to propose."

If a government, for instance, is all the power and all the resources and determining how land is distributed. I think they have the ability to give a lot of these land to their friends. They have the ability to do things like cement the dominant, that their power in some way, for instance, like this happened in Singapore in singapore right okay first argument then how does proposition increase ethnic and political violence the first thing i note here is that most african countries and nations just have sign they just have like extremely diverse religious parties in general they're incredibly diverse post colonization why because i think the british and french often like actively brought different ethnic groups from their areas and they colonized in order to do things like mine certain precious minerals, for example, or do things like set up railways. Right. Therefore, they needed like large labor pools in that sense. But secondly, I think they wanted to divide and conquer policy so that different minorities could not just unite and rise up in protest against them. And I think that's why they drew borders arbitrarily. Now, here's the thing. Given that most African states are thus multi-ethnic, the failure to truly enshrine democratic rights means that there's going to be far more conflict"

Understand how this undercuts a lot of the proposition material, because to the extent that, let's say, reparations are somewhat helpful, the point of which there's some sort of conflict means that there's going to be significant economic harm as well on their side of the house. Now, note, why is it going to be hard because like look i think the failure literally means that you're literally taking away money from that say one tribe and giving that money away from the other tribe it looks like giving taking money from the virtues and giving it the tootsies for example the reason you have this incentive is because the right to let's say the because like right after you become independent you want to get resources right you want to help your loved ones in your in these oppressed tribes but also you don't have like greater tensions until like the negotiation processes actually get ugly let's be clear on what happens on the comparative firstly i think we get far more that we can like power sharing agreements on our side between the majority and minority tribes a lot more because democracy itself involves this process of negotiation to figure out the best way to represent people it It looks like the majority and minority tribes are getting different areas of land and redistribution of natural resources between these tribes because they have that common agreement to help ensure the democratic right to vote is within people. Why is this so much better than their side of the house? The first thing I note here is it involves better relations, no thank you, between parties and incentives for them to portray these relations with their populace. It looks like keeping each party in check with regards to abuses. That is to say, if one party abuses against their people, for instance, the other tribe can do more to show how they're better. In that sense, I think it also incentivizes each party to give reparations and economic goods to those people on the ground, because there's a ways to the top. Look at the implication here, panel. This literally coop see a lot of population benefits on that sense secondly even if like power sharing agreements you have shared like the unifying narrative of the government is like really important here right because this is when you look at like the unified this is literally when you like look at the unified history right one of your independence like how you have the right to democracy right the right to self-govern this is better because the narrative is far better because it forces tribes to focus on the common goals either way panel on proposition side there's backlash there's backlash from different stakeholders in post-colonial african states in the case of reallocation of resources from one ethnic type to another the fact that they're like long years of tribalism it means that it's far worse and far harsher because i think like you would refocus on who would come into power right as a result it's going to be less accountability on their side of the house you literally internalize racist narratives what are the impacts of this the first thing is this is a significant decrease in conflict on our side of the house because it involves fewer people notice how bad propositions world is oftentimes these communities get closer to each other and they can be impoverished the"

It looks like the destruction of their own houses, further impoverishing them. This strips away a lot of their economic benefits in the first place. Before I move on, sure. Your argument on preventing ethnic conflict is contingent on political participation. But if people are still suffering tangibly because their economic needs aren't fulfilled on your side of the house. They simply don't have the time nor the resources to engage in politics. The first thing I note here is that, look, we literally give you two reasons as to why people are incredibly likely to be participating here. Why? Because there are father figure narratives, for instance, there's the narrative of independence. I think on our side of the house, there is going to be political participation. I think that's symmetric. The difference is the fact that there's going to be more conflict on your side of the house. Right. But more crucially, never actually proved to us that you're going to get like fair redistribution in the first place. The summary of this argument here is that people fight a lot more on propositions world. The fighting worsens the issues on their side. Second argument, I think this outweighs the majority of the proposition case, because I want to prove here why democracy is just far better than drug operations. At its most basic level, I think the right to choose is a prerequisite to utility. Because note, at the point of a nation democracy, a lot of people have similar wants."

I think it's quite clear that money can be stripped away in the future. The ability to have a free and fair election and press is literally what guarantees stability on the other side. Why is this the case? Know that future unaccountable politicians can also be in place. Like they can put bad economic policies, for example, they can be inflation, they can be political instability that can make your plot of land literally worthless on their side of the house. The ability to vote is what ensures politicians fix these issues. Why is democracy so certain, on the other hand? It's because people have similar goals. They have similar policies when nation building. They stop government abuse on our side of the house. They can vote for basic infrastructure bills. The leaders on the opposition's world are not necessarily going to be that great with economic policy in the first place. And this just rebuts a lot of their case as well if leaders of such movements have like better experience and knowledge from canvassing and setting up ballot boxes because they're often indulging this in the first place they researched these methods i think they're far better on our side because on their side they don't necessarily have that good experience with economic redistribution in that sense we're better on our side of the house because you get far better policy, we help these African nations.

Moving on to observations and responses. Note that first on their mechanism, they wanted to just assert that they would have free and fair elections and in response to our harm that they did not prepare for, would just simply ban lobbying. Note firstly, this is just a literal frivolous response. You can't just assert banning lobbying, especially in the context of post-colonial African states where these are nascent democracies. And we've also outlined and highlighted that even in entrenched democracy and strong Western liberal ones, lobbying isn't actually banned. But even if we assume this were to be true, they never actually responded with this catch-all response towards the argumentation at all. Because we told you two unique things regardless if you ban political lobbying. Number one, in terms of even if you ban political lobbying, what is the enforcement mechanism insofar as they still haven't told us why the individuals on the ground are financially empowered to actually be act in order to actually be political agents within society to hold them accountable. But number two, social privilege still existed, which meant that the second analysis that came up from first proposition as to how the elite control media. The elite are the ones that control TV and airtime and interviews, only the wealthy and privileged and the words that they say hold weightage in society. So regardless, even if you believe you could ban lobbying, these social influences that you had still existed,"

It was about corporations implicitly giving a large sum of money to large political candidates and assuming implicitly there's a promise for certain outcomes and certain policies so their catch-all response in their own mechanism and their own setup does not actually work and they can't just assert that it will be done well because note that it first the Poy to first off proposition is entirely entirely disingenuous in terms of they want us to defend our broken system that for some reason if we are the same government and the same structure on our side it will be done badly on our side these malevolent actors will subvert the economic redistribution but on their side in the same actor that would run the same political rights they would do it perfectly and give it to each and every individual. Either this debate needs to exist cleanly where we both assume we have the fear to institute our policies initially, or their side needs to also argue for discrimination of individuals because you would likely not institute and give Black African Americans, sorry, not African Americans, Black South Africans the same level of political leverages as the white majority because that would quote-unquote anger them.

              "text": "case needs to concede to prop. But on to material responses. On the idea of conflict, not that we think it's highly simplistic why conflict exists as the backbone of the case. They said that you're angry at the minorities for taking money and redistributing it to individuals. Note that this exact same analysis applies to them because the majority that was privileged from colonialism under divide and conquer, certain ethnicities benefited more. Certain ethnicities were granted the right to education through English schools, for example. Some of them were allocated to more proliferating and more socially uplifting jobs, for example, in the agriculture sector, where some individuals were forced to work in the mines, which means that granting them equal, if not the same political rights, and in a case where they would be the overwhelming majority, would also make you pissed off at minorities and equate to the same kinds of outcomes. The only assertion as to why you would be able to correct this is power sharing agreements that incentivizes the race to the top, and therefore you co-opt all the propositions benefits in the first place. We told you in our second proposition speaker two things. In terms of number one, political participation is unlikely to exist insofar as the individuals are the most impoverished, which meant that it isn't the race to the top, but rather it's extremely easy to cater to the simplistic needs of individuals on the ground to keep them quiet. It looks like giving them financial aid from politicians and say, vote for me, giving them bags of rice, and therefore that is sufficient for them to vote for you in office, which means that they don't get a raise to their top because it's extremely easy to sway these individuals into voting into those systems. So it's likely the exact opposite insofar as you're able to exploit the individuals where you don't give them economic resuscitation in order to mobilize but second is more important than reparations all they say here is that the right to choose is important and the democracy fosters transparency before i move on to the point i'll move on to this i'll take a point she talked about how rich white people are the minority but they have the majority of political and economic power so isn't it more likely that the black majority will be able to vote these people out and potentially regain some amount of power, which doesn't happen on your side? The entire second argument from first proposition was explaining to you why money was important in deciding political outcomes in terms of the social influences, the social spheres, because the status quo based on their vote should not be the status quo that we see today. But the only reason of logic for why democracy is more important than reparations is the right to choose. We told you straight up from first proposition why the right to choose takes a backseat insofar as exercising the autonomy requires you to be in a certain level of financial privilege to access all of those sorts of things. Whether individuals even vote in the first place is questionable insofar as people care more about their financial survivability in the meantime. I think this takes out two of their argumentations, but it was also comparative, the only thing Proposition was willing to do. On to a third argumentation then, as to why economic empowerment is the backbone of a healthy democracy. Three parts. A, economic upliftment is exactly what elevates the social class of citizens to become the working class majority. Quotas for unemployment, land for businesses, and disposable income to increase employability are all the conditions PrEP creates to mobilize the impoverished to the working class. This translates to more participation within the education system when children no longer have to"

This is also non-contingent on whether the leader actually has good incentives or not. Which actors invest? Foreign companies and NGOs of the west are irreplaceable. Why? Because they are by miles the richest actor that can invest in other countries. Their history of acquiring resources through colonization, their presence of strong institutions help them incentivize foreign investment. We give them two unique benefits that they mitigate. First, we give businesses guaranteed rights to democratic checks and balances. Businesses from the West are used to certain legal practices and norms like guaranteed property rights, IP laws, and civil liberties, which means more familiarity. They let this be when you have people previously owned property forcibly seized and redistributed, especially white contacts that you know. This is bad for business confidence. Secondly, we think during the Cold War, there is heaps of backlash about everything that is even remotely socialist. The US is increasingly McCarthyist. They have an incentive as the torchbearers of democracy to actively invest in countries that show democratic potential. We instantly got that. They mitigate it. Now, before I get into even their best case in terms of FDI, I'll take a few. You wanted to co-opt all of our economic benefits, such as land redistribution. So then deal with your own harms of tribal individuals feeling robbed. Why are you exclusive and not able to suffer these same harms if you want the same policies just later on? I think I made that painfully clear. Later on, democracy works, you have more accountability, you are able to have peaceful negotiation. On their side, the powerful tribe can just seize the land of the less powerful tribe and there'll be no one to hold them accountable there'll be no systems of protest time is the factor here we do co-opt your benefits their best case panel is this they get investment but they get investment from the ussr because the ussr has a history of going towards socialist orientations and that like that's more likely on their side why is this dependence in the ussr bad because the ussr is inefficient as they have no competition in their economy making inefficient machinery also it lost the cold war it was in the ussr's incentive to prefer dictatorships over democracies because they are far more non-reliant on the changing mood of the populace and easier for them to control meaning they actively tried to create them and bribe leaders accordingly what"

If governments are inherently racist or democracies are never flourishing, then how do you ever get equitable distribution of land? First, both sides assume it's the same actor, it's the same government. So clearly, if it's a bad faith actor, then none of your rights will also be equitably distributed because the people at the top want to preserve their power for themselves. Second, assuming they were still allowed to be racist or any forms of bigotry, laws and rights are contingent upon enforcement. So just because it's written in the Constitution, we protect your right to property, we protect your right to free speech. If you are still racist, then they're likely to not have enforcement. But secondly, I think the way this works is most of the racism doesn't come directly from the get go because clearly at this point, all tribes have the common goal of exiling the oppressor. So once the colonizer has left, you don't have these forms of innately evil incentives. Most of these things only come because you're able to hijack the political system. So given that we've told you the hijacking of the political system comes from the way you're able to hoard wealth from first prop that went completely unresponded to, this does not stand. So even if we don't get complete benevolence, the way it works is because we don't have these innate incentives from the very get-go, means you're better able to hold them accountable over time. First issue, can we actually get our policy? So I want to note they have two main responses here. The first is that they claim in second op that economic issues are not the expertise of liberation leaders. I want you to review your notes and consider whether this is persuasive. Because clearly, if you want to build an entire democracy from ground up, you also needed assistance. So if you wanted technocrats and consultants to build your political institutions, clearly we could get the same people as well."

So clearly not all of them have no food on the table, but we're able to enable people to break a poverty cycle, which affects everyone on that on a good level. But second, I want you to know that votes are still likely to be highly unimpactful because you're delegating your political power to someone else and they make decisions on behalf of you the difference here is that money gives you autonomy for you to decide what's best for yourself political votes are way more uncertain in terms of outcome because you may vote for someone else but you still have other interests that are still ignored so for example if there are three ethnicities but only two of those ethnicities get their elected representatives in power that one ethnicity is still like to be ignored per their own analysis that they're likely to have differences within them the difference is that wealth is getting given towards those communities even if some communities have less are still oppressed under our side because of differences the difference is wealth can then protect yourself you can create self-sustaining communities. You can then trade with different things, which means that you remove your biases and say this is a person from another ethnicity because we're all engaging on economic grounds. The second thing I want to talk about here is the ability to exercise our rights. Prop simplifies the debate. From the start, we were charitable and took the trade-off. Yes, you would get votes. Yes, you get free speech. That was low-hanging fruit because instead of claiming you could get free speech and free association you have to prove why it was meaningful we told you why when you have all these people and also meant that the people the people in power are the ones that are most likely to be able to use these levers of the political institutions things like you'll never be able you're able to go to court but whether you can win the court case is something entirely different I want to note that their response here was saying people can vote in democracy to tackle any issue by taking them on your best possible grounds democracy needed bypassing bureaucracy you need to compete with other public policies such as criminal justice or education the final thing was then about fdi their claim was the fdi from the west comes here first fdi is more likely to happen on our side because the wealth is more equitably distributed the natural resources are able to have more disposable incomes for all consumers but second even if the west refused to enter we still have the briggs investment bank we have the bri from china who are still willing to invest even if you're not completely democratic but thirdly it ignores the initial premise that we proved to you from our third argument which went unresponded to which eventually people become more politically literate become people become more politically conscious when you're able to have this wealth in your hands. The conclusion of this is it's time we call it for what it is. The failure for land reforms was state-sanctioned violence we are very proud to propose."

I'm going to, even though they didn't mention this, I'm going to say, okay, let's assume the West actually does invest. We think this West actor is actually bad because we think that the West, when investing in a non-democratic country, firstly has no sort of political government that can actually engage with them democratically, which means they're more likely to be hostile and they're more likely to actually look to try and displace far. This looks like the US in the Middle East where they were forced to try and change up the political stability of the country. This of course creates political vacuums moreover. Thirdly, we tell you this can also create proxy wars between the US and the USSR, creating further political instability in the region.

I'm particularly talking about people who have the political will and capital to actually go on doing these land distribution methods. Firstly, when they say economic rights will somehow give access to healthcare, education, quotas and jobs, wow. The problem is there are no jobs to give quotas in, right? We tell you that this is an underutilized economy where this massive inflation, it's economically unstable.

Secondly, we told you we get foreign help that's exclusive to our side because multilateral institutions like the United Nations set up special agencies for Africa. They will only assist Africa if these nations choose to want to become democratic. They don't want to, especially in the time of the Cold War, these multilateral institutions are unlikely to help these countries set up autocratic institutions. And we don't think they will look to entrench these autocratic institutions even further as well, which is why you won't be able to create democracy in the future as well. Now, moreover, as my second speaker told you, it's easier to set up political institutions. You're more likely to mess up economic policy. But coming to what happens if these leaders actually manage to redistribute well, we tell you, even if these leaders successfully manage to redistribute well we tell you even if these leaders successfully manage to create these quotas create this brilliant land distribution everything in the one actually happens we still think this is a short-term issue we tell you that we give you an example of the great leap forward in china we tell you how these autocratic governments even in the temporary period they're able to create these short-term sort of economic gratification because of lack of like number one because of lack of checks and balances they you're entrenching greater power in these people right number two we tell you because of lack of like number one, because of lack of checks and balances, they are intention greater power in these people, right?

We think that in the long run, what tends to happen is that eventually last decisions and things like that overturn these economic benefits.

Why on earth would the people stand for this? Okay, firstly, there are different actors. We think that the oppressors, the colonizers, at least from the past, are not necessarily the same institutions. Like the United States is not necessarily the colonizing part of the African people actively hate. Moreover, even if these African people actually want to sort of prevent their governments from forming these relations from these particular countries like the United Kingdom or France, we still think that they at least have the option to do so by keeping these governments accountable. And because of the transparency of information, they can control what kind of foreign relations, what kind of powers they collaborate with. Moreover, at least we have multilateral institutions investing. We don't even have that. So even if it's not particular countries, we still get that FDI. One of our ethnic tensions, we tell you, is a lot worse among tribes. We tell you, leaders are forced to affiliate with certain tribes and prioritize their needs, which means when they talk about how the black majority is probably not going to have enough power, you're actually letting the white majority control the narrative, at least to some extent. Even if, okay, sure, it's not going to be great levels of accountability. On our side, these black people at least have a voice.

Post-colonial leaders chose to imitate their oppressors, and Africans have been paying the price ever since. The wording of the motion may be a mess but Africa didn't have to be.

First, the clarification issued by the motions committee states that opposition have to defend the world that did exist during the time, i.e. the status quo. To be absolutely clear, this is a world in which much of Africa lives in poverty, exploited by the West, and devastated by civil war. That is the world they must defend. Two, our burden is to defend a hypothetical world in which the majority of post-colonial African states reclaimed stolen land and money from colonial elites and redistributed it among the African population. There are three types of program. A, there were cash transfers to individual people of an amount roughly equivalent to $1,000 in today's money. B, land reallocation, particularly of foreign lands so that land ownership is allocated roughly equally across the population. And C, this looks like state reclamation of natural resource wealth, like oil wells and regular cash payments to the population of the profits from these. Three three we think that in most cases a leader of the independence movement would likely become a non-democratic ruler who would initially rule the country on a national level and initiate this policy supported by a network of local community governments four note that this motion covers an entire continent given this we think the burden on both sides is that the policy works for the majority but but not for all countries.

              "text": "first argument, where would these policies have been done well? Who is carrying out these policies? They are the immediate leaders of post-colonial African states. In almost all cases, these are the leaders of the revolutionary movements in these states, as they were the obvious and only candidates for colonial powers to hand over in reign soon. What assets would these leaders have been distributing? We think the state would have owned some land and assets to begin with, but they would likely have had to take most land off predominantly white colonialists who owned it or the minority of African land-owning elites who had gained it by collaborating with the colonizers. We think they should have taken this land back without recompense or with relatively tokenistic payments. It was stolen of the people of African states. We accept this might not have been easy and it might have even been violent in a few cases. We think however that in most cases it would have been successful for three key reasons. A. There would have been a lot more black Africans than white colonialists. By sheer quantity they clearly win. B, they now control the levers of the state, including the army, so they have much more power. But C, we are supporting a world where many African states chose to view this. This means that even if the first few cases where this policy was attempted were difficult and potentially bloody, white landowners in other African states who saw this would likely have realized their time was up. Given the colonial powers who had just left, neither wanted to see their citizens die, nor themselves get embroiled in conflict, they likely would have paid these white landowners to leave peacefully, as the British did when they left Kenya. Why would these leaders allocate resources fairly? Three reasons. A, they have been literally fighting for their nations, and have recent experience of being oppressed, but B, within their legitimacy at that point in history, is heavily hinged on their willingness to fight for the rights of their people, and c within a core part of the majority of these independence movements were African intellectuals who were arguing for the justice of this exact policy."

              "text": "Second argument, the principle. We think under our side there are three powerful principled obligations which the government of the time also prioritized and could only be fulfilled by redistributive policies the first principal obligation is that land and wealth are the correct form of reparation this land was stolen by white colonizers whose descendants profited from it often by enslaving the descendants of its original owners not only did the land have significant economic value, it also had unquantifiable cultural value to the people it was taken from. These are historic religious sites or bureau grounds. Given that, the criteria for reparations are clearly fulfilled. A, the stolen property itself, i.e., the land, is unambiguous and of immense value. B, the rightful owner is clear. And C, unless opposition wants to defend colonialism, the illegitimacy of the current owner's possession is also clear. Rather than redress this, opposition requires new states just to shed from the shackles of colonization to start absolutely protecting the rights of white colonialists. The second principal obligation is that land and wealth fits with the will of the people. But for colonialism, communities looks much more like those which our redistributive policy would facilitate. Smaller, much more communal, predominantly locally led. Importantly, a lot of independence movements held up this model when they pushed for the end of colonialism. People called for it, they fought for it, they desired it so deeply that men are willing to lay down their lives for it. The third obligation is that land and wealth preserves your right to life and ought to be the most important. Food and money keep you alive. This is what you need to access any of opposition's political rights. Look, we respect that OPP has some claim to be granting people rights, but they're obviously far less important than these because A, granting people a right to vote has no guarantee of improving their life, and B, freedom of speech and association are nebulous and often restricted even in democratic countries. These are of no importance when compared to returning their property, respecting their wishes, and protecting their lives. Before we move on to my third"

              "text": "money is so important first way money is used to solve immediate issues like food and medicine. This is a simple impact, but it's incredibly important. In our world, people are given money that they can spend on food and medicine. They are given land that they can live on, grow things from, or sell. This allows them to escape extreme poverty. The second way is because they have money to invest. Knowing that you have a regular monthly income from your stake and the local life, or that you have been able to make savings from your initial payment of cash allows you to invest in the future. A community can collectively buy farming equipment that makes it far more efficient to invest in a well. The third way is because we give people control over the land. Africa has the potential to grow enough food to feed itself three and a half times over. Despite this, they have suffered more famine than anywhere else in the world. That is because Western companies own their farmland over-planted to the point of soil degradation, and then sell the crops out of Africa to European buyers. On our side, people control their own land. This improves food security in two ways. A. They farm it in a less commercially aggressive way, thus reducing the chances of crop failure. B, they have control over the products that are grown. That means that even if there's a bad harvest or a drought, people are better able to adapt to help themselves. In a reduced harvest, you're able to keep the crops to grow and feed yourself, rather than be forced to sell them to Europe. And even in a truly dire year, you're better able to make the choice to switch to animal agriculture to save yourself yourself because the land is yours. On a wider level, within redistributive policies, reduce the risk of civil war. Civil wars typically occur when there's a combination of extreme poverty, limited opportunities, and the lack of trust in the state, and are even more likely to happen when there are multiple ethnic groups who in Africa were often set against each other by colonial powers. Those conditions are why there have been countless civil wars since the end of colonialism, and why there are 21 happening in Africa right now. That's what opposition's policies led to, poverty, weak democracies and conflict. Why would this be better with redistributive policy? We explain why poverty is alleviated, but giving people land gives them stake in their nation. It's much easier to abandon everything for a chance to be a soldier is a lot harder when you have a stake in a community but needless to say this is about as big as an impact gets civil wars wreak unfold damage to countries in the long run this running of the motion may be a mess but africa did not have to we're proud to propose"

However, note that this occurred despite the existence of political and civil rights, not because of it. Civil and political rights formed the last stronghold against the attempts at unbridled grabs for power. My speech will be divided into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to analyze why proposition is unlikely to succeed in their reparations. Secondly, why they're likely to create more economic harms. And thirdly, why we're able to create a more stable society. But before that, I want to make a strategic note. It is not sufficient for proposition to just argue the benefits of reparations. The motion has a flip side, which requires proposition to defend the absence of political and civil rights. In other words, a dictatorship. Because in order to win this debate, proposition has to prove why it is both legitimate and preferable to subject individuals to literal authoritarian rule."

              "text": "Okay, moving on to the first part of my speech on why we think that land redistributions will simply not work. Note that this directly attacks the Prime Minister's first argument on why they think land reparations will be done well. Note that even if the proposition has some fiat to enact their policies, that doesn't guarantee that external factors will make it literally impossible for their policies to succeed. We tell you there are three reasons as to why we are more likely to achieve civil and political rights than they are to achieve economic and land reparations firstly in terms of international support when we look at for instance assistance for civil and political rights we've already seen this happening where for instance in senegal other countries have provided independent observers to ensure elections were free and fair this is because generally on the international stage civil and political rights are right widely recognized But we say on the flip side, there's oftentimes a lot of backlash for land redistribution. Note that, for instance, the US has sanctioned Zimbabwe for the last 22 years, partly because of their forceful land redistribution policies. Note that this also offsets any economic benefits of such redistribution. The second reason as to why we're more likely to achieve our world is because of the concept of taking versus giving. Land reparations means you have to actively take away someone's assets, which will likely spark aggressive opposition. This is what we've seen in Ghana, where farmers literally hired private mercenaries to protect their own land. Comparatively, civil and political rights are merely given to people, and thus individuals don't have an incentive to fight for what has been taken from them. The third reason here is that there are already blueprints for enshrining civil and political rights. For instance, you can copy existing constitutions and other democratic frameworks. However, land redistribution in such large, ethnically divided and unstable, have never been done before, and so it's far more complex to do so. What this means is that it is very unlikely to get economic and land reparations, while it is more likely to get civil and political rights, even if both sides have the same amount of fiat, we have substantially more external factors"

Like, I don't really understand this point. OK, let's move on to the second part now on why we think that proposition creates more economic harms.

              "text": "Africa where black farmers couldn't get mortgages from banks so they still couldn't afford the necessary machinery to work the land we tell you secondly uh there's oftentimes fragmentation of land assuming that land will be distributed equally's oftentimes fragmentation of land. Assuming that land will be distributed equally, you have large plots of land that we split up into many smaller plots. This is seen in Ethiopia, where half of all the plots of land were less than a quarter of a hectare panel that is literally tiny. You cannot live off of that. Note that this threatens food security. These nations already face food shortages. So every time you waste scarce land that could have been used to grow crops, you bring the countries closer to the brink of starvation. This is also what contributed to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984 after their land redistribution. The second harm here is you're less likely to have foreign direct investment because foreign companies are reluctant to settle into authoritarian regimes where individuals have absolutely no rights because they're afraid of for instance the sanctions this means that job opportunities are lost in countries that already have high rates of unemployment the third harm here is that you have no development aid because countries are reluctant to give aid to dictatorships for instance after the United States made charges of corruption against the government of Kenya, they halted the development aid. This means communities lose out on hospitals that could have been built. They lose out on schools. They lose out on food, for instance. The last harm here is you're likely to have poor economic policy. And this is caused by the dictator's dilemma. Opposition might give people a bag of money. But if your country has hyperinflation because of economic mismanagement, that money is literally useless. Bad economic policy might happen on either side of the house. But the difference in our side of the house is that when you have political and civil rights, you can correct that. In a dictatorship-like propositions world, people who are critical of the government will never be able to express their critics, their beliefs. Look at Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe literally caused hyperinflation by just continuously printing money and plunging the entire country into economic crisis. What this argument shows you is that even on the metric of the economy, which is propositions grounds, we still take the debate. Note that this also tackles the principle argument, because we believe that the best form of reparation is to give back the country a stable economy after the disruption and chaos caused by colonialism. They cannot do that. We can."

We're here, we're going to show you why the lack of civil and political rights will exacerbate conflict and lead to more unnecessary death. Why do we think this is true? We tell you this is for two reasons. Firstly, citizens will turn to violence when they cannot voice their dissatisfaction peacefully. To illustrate, in the early 90s, the Nigerian government tried to make a deal with Shell about extracting oil from the Niger Delta. The local communities hated this plan, and a small conflict emerged. But because we had democratic structures that recognized the voices of the people, they were able to establish environmental regulations in propositions world you don't have these rights you would prevent citizens from being hurt entirely we tell you the small conflict would have escalated to far worse to become far more violent but secondly we tell you in propositions world authoritarian leaders are far more likely to stoke conflict to maintain control we saw this this happening in Kenya in 1992, when the president tried to purposely stoke ethnic conflict to ban opposition parties. Luckily, people were able to hold them accountable, and the president was later ousted from power. On the opposition side, they lacked that form of accountability. We tell you ethnic conflicts would have worsened, and many more would have died. Note that this also clashes with their third argument on reducing death and suffering. We tell you, even if initially our world is not a fully functioning democracy at first, enshrining civil and political rights is a prerequisite for that. It is the seeds that must be planted before the flower of democracy finally blooms. We tell you that in our world, we are able to create the basis for that. This is because, firstly, when you have the right to vote, you're more likely to be able to establish systems of elections. In many African countries, voter turnout has been comparable, if not higher than in the West. But secondly, we're able to have the establishment of opposition parties that can organize to pressure government reform. What this ultimately means is that we are the side that is able to maintain stability. We are the side that helps these people i'm so proud to oppose"

I just want to flag where I could start here, that every single example opposition has given you of failure, of poverty, of terrible conflict that has devastated people's lives and livelihoods happened under their side of the house. We were very clear in our answer, according to the clarification from the motions committee, side opposition's burden is to defend the world as it exists today. They have to defend the status quo. They have to defend what these countries chose to do. That's why when they talk to you about Ethiopia, that's why when they talk to you about Ghana, they have to stand behind the failures there. But then, would this have worked? Because side opposition want to challenge us here. They tried to tell us first of all that these leaders are going to carry out these policies badly and then they tried to say you're not going to be successful at taking things away from people. How do we respond to this? First of all on incentives, we believe that these leaders wanted to carry out these policies well. First of all opposition tried to tell us that these are going to be bad people. Or we think actually they're likely to be the same on either side, as Helen points out in first, and as we get no response to. Five reasons for this. We think first, they have huge name recognition across the nation. These people are coming off the back of the biggest political win imaginable, independence, so they have popular support. They tend to be very charismatic. That's why these people have risen to the top of the independence movement. They have the infrastructure of the independence movement around them and that's a ready-made party and they're the ones who are shaping the discussions of independence, so they have the advantage in rising to the top of any system they create. Whether it's democratic or not, we think these are always going to be pro-independence leaders and as we also explained to you, we think they are likely to have good incentives for three reasons. First, they want to do what's best for their people. people second because their legitimacy is hinged on providing people and third ideologically they are part of the independence movement they care about these policies but also on our side they probably have better incentives because when they see themselves purely as caretakers they aren't legitimized as school rulers when you tell these people that they still have to fight for democracy and that fight against colonialism isn't over we think they're far more likely to be more conscientious about the potential for democratic backsliding and about doing things well therefore we think it's very clear that these leaders are going to have good incentives why then are they going to be successful at taking"

They don't really respond to any of our actual analysis on why it is so good to have money, why it's so good to have stability, why this is so good for the economy. They simply give us a set of counterclaims on why they think this is bad. First, from international support. They say their side is better because you're able to have observers to ensure that these processes are free and fair. First of all, under our side we think it's so much easier because you don't need these observers. We're able to do it once and crucially on our side you can't take away those reparations. On their side democratic backsliding is very easy. Then they try to tell us that the United States is going to impose sanctions. As we point out in the POI, the US isn't going to sanction all these countries. It could only sanction Zimbabwe because there was only one Zimbabwe. But if the whole continent had stood together in pursuing these policies against colonialism, they would have been far more successful. Then they tried to talk to us about how it's bad to take away someone's assets. I think we've already dealt with that in the clash over whether this is going to work. Then they tried to tell us that the land is going to be underutilized their first mechanism for this is that you're not going to be giving people enough money in that slightly odd that this is the only argument they could think of against giving people money and black but how do we respond to this as we make it very clear in advance we think when you give direct cash transfers to individual people and yes we've done the maths this looks like a thousand dollars in today's money when you're reallocating farmland so that people are able to have a roughly equal share farmland and crucially when you have a stable source of income from natural resources which we tell you we split among the people of these countries we think frankly that is quite clearly going to be enough to build a living and it's far better than having absolutely nothing at all which is the comparative under their side and then they say well you're going to have fragmentation of this land no again they preemptively responded to this because we told you about how these groups coalesce into communities and how much better this is than having absolutely no food or money finally on fdi don't let the myth of us by fdi developing african states trick you panel the us's fbi in africa look like building a road in a straight line from a port to a mine. This was never helpful, but as I'm going to prove to you in my speech, even if we get marginally less on our side, what we do get is better FBI. But note also that they gave absolutely no response to our principle other than saying we have to prove that we're okay with a dictator. We think we've proved to you that these are A, going to be the same people on their side, B, they get their figures on their side anyway, and C, that these are probably going to be people who have good incentives.

              "text": "development under our side? First, economically. Africa broadly fits two main niches in the global economy. The first is cheap labour. In Oxford, Africans are able to be exploited because they're willing to work for extraordinarily low wages and have no bargaining power to improve their conditions, so Western MNCs are able to exploit them. This led to decades of low wage labor and appalling conditions because their only competitive advantage was the cheap price of labor and therefore improvements of quality of life came at the unacceptable risk of a company moving out of the country and people starving but this would have been different on our side because africans would have had an alternative source of income to fall back on their land and their livestock so they wouldn't have been able to speak the words into low wage labor and companies would still have invested in these states because they were keeping the resources there, but on our side it's on far more equitable terms. Secondly, natural resources. Africa is the richest continent on earth and has the natural resource wealth. But in opposition, all governments who are trying to protect political rights allowed neo-colonial companies to continue extracting that resource wealth and funneling money back to the west. But in our world they'd have taken this land back, they'd have extracted and sold the resources themselves, and they'd have used the proceeds to build state infrastructure, and crucially, to pay cash transfers, as we outlined. This both makes the state far richer, but also creates consumers who attract foreign investment that is not there to exploit their labour, but rather to sell them goods. Don't underestimate how many billions of dollars this would have funneled into the coffers of African states and the pockets of African people. They're not a long-term political development because opposition wants democratic rights for African states, that's their only argument. If we prove we get this better on our side we so clearly take this debate already. In a continent of 54 nations there have been two continuous democracies since decolonisation. Right now Africa contains one full democracy, seven flawed democracies, and 46 states that are considered fundamentally undemocratic. This is because a certain level of economic development is a prerequisite for any democracy to succeed. Two reasons why. First, there's a basic level of education needed for people to learn and understand about the democratic system they're expected to participate in. Second, because you need a level of engaged political class who can put in the time to build political parties and scrutinize government practices the absence of these conditions is the reason why under the status quo they defend every african state bar two has failed to successfully have long-term democracy but on proposition we think sure there would have at some point been education to the implementation of democracy but that transition on the outside would have been far more peaceful because it's helen's two people in more developed states have so much more to lose from war but it would also have been far more peaceful, because as Helen touched, new people in more developed states have so much more to lose from war, but it would also have been far more likely to be successful because these countries meet two criteria that we outlined. So on opposition's own metric of democratic rights, we think there would have been far more democracies in Africa today had these policies been implemented. But given that right now there are over eight of them across the entire continent, any more than that wins this debate independently for team effort. We're so proud to propose thank you you I think I briefly dropped there after the end of the speech. Can everybody hear me?"

Firstly, the moment in which the government is the only thing which guarantees you your income and guarantees your access to your land, that's when people are more reliant on the government, therefore they have more to lose. Secondly, people don't really have that much power of the government on the proposition side of the house. You don't have the ability to vote and you don't have the ability to protest. Even if people defy this and start protesting, on the proposition side of the house it's significantly easier for governments to prevent protests from ever getting any kind of steam. This is incredibly important because if a protest ever wants to achieve anything, it needs to reach a level of critical mass, which requires a huge amount of people to participate in it. So protests are constantly being put down by autocratic regimes. You're unable to, even if people have a good quality of living, ever achieve any kind of change. This is how the CCP maintains a grip over the people of China."

              "text": "Secondly, in terms of their principal claims, three things here. Firstly, I would like to note that this also hangs on the rest of their case being true. So, so far from proposition, you've gotten two arguments which are impacting of one argument. If we can disprove that argument, then we've won this debate. Secondly, on the idea of, I think this is weighing, where they say land is particularly important because there are certain historical places which have unquantifiable value. Firstly, I find it unlikely that a lot of the specifically historically important places are going to be redistributed. We get the impression from the first public speaker that this is about farmland specifically. Secondly, this is hugely problematic to their case. Surely that would only increase the amount of tensions that you have about the redistribution of land, make it harder to pass and increase the likelihood of wars or smaller scale conflicts uh uh lastly we think that is also like taking away individuals rights for instance the ability to exercise your religion the ability to exercise your language is also unquantifying the value to individuals and their culture so insofar as we are able to restore these rights better on our sub house we think we also restore things of unquantifiable value to individuals. Thirdly and lastly, the lack of political power and the ability to self-govern is also what was taken away from Africans. It wasn't like the British were just like, hey y'all, y'all can vote on anything, we're just going to peacefully take away your land. No, it was oppression in every possible regard. In fact, this was the biggest thing that the Western colonial nations took away from Africans. Why? Because this was the biggest thing that the Western colonial nations took away from Africans. Why? Because this was the root of all these symptoms of proposition sense. So taking away land and taking away welfare from these countries was a symptom of the fact that they were in a state of oppression. Since we are the side which is more likely to allow African nations to attain some level democratization, we should we should win on this principle"

But secondly, I think it is to an extent plausible just because the USA and the EU trade far more with each other than with African nations and trade with China far more than they trade with African nations. So in terms of the power disparity there, African nations with relatively little importance to the economies of Western nations. Secondly, in terms of local influential elite, elite is also already material from Egas Egas speech in the first argument we give you. They say, well, firstly, in the PM that they will just peacefully leave after you've attained some victories. Firstly, this is circular reasoning. It requires you to have attained those victories in the first place. But secondly, I find this incredibly unlikely just because like a proposition does the research here. They're literally just been war started about why colonisers were not wanting to give up their land when it comes to land redistribution. Like, why would you want to give up everything that you have just because you see other people getting it take away? If anything, we think white colonisers are more likely to want to firstly do exactly what we're talking about, which is abuse the system. I'll take a PY in a second, by the way. And secondly, if that's impossible, to fight for it, which is exactly the impact that we're talking about, about civil wars, about conflicts happening. Secondly, they say that Black Africans outnumber white Africans to a significant degree. Firstly, this is a point about political power. We are unsure why the numerical game matters more than the political game, especially since the local influential elite, firstly, have the full support of the Western colonizers who've just left behind them. And secondly, because they're the ones with by far the most capital. If you want to hire a private militia, then it's not going to be the coarse individuals in Africa, then it's going to be the local elite trying to protect their assets. Thirdly, and lastly, this is a new mech here, about zero sum. So for instance, if you want to vote, then your ability to vote doesn't detract from my ability to vote. However, if I give you land, then that must directly come up with the land that is given to me. So it's relatively easier to implement reforms around civil and political rights than specifically economic reforms, because the amount of land you can get the amount of wealth which relies on the con, which is in the country is zero."

In comparison, if you slowly erode democratic rights you are much less likely to realise that and so you are much less likely to lose the benefits that they claim. They say that if these are that important then redistributing this land is bad. But this is about choices planning. We would much rather have Africans have the land that is important to them than some random English or Dutch colonizers. Now, I recognize that this is a creep rap, but that is not an excuse for not engaging at all with the analysis that Helen gave. And note the way in here. We say that these principal obligations trump any other rights to democracy or to vote. Let me illustrate this to you. If you're an individual farmer, you care about feeding yourself and your family. If you're a community, you care about taking control of your natural resources and what was stolen from you. And if you are the state, you care about representing your people's wishes. Given that we prove why this is the principle all three of those levels care about, it's the one that should be prioritised. Before I show why we went on immediate benefits, I'll take your feel-eye. China is currently in the process of committing genocide in Singapore, but UNSL for being gay. If those are really the countries which opposition wants to champion, then you should really reconsider your stance in this debate. We really want to talk about homophobia here, where over half of the countries in the world where being gay is illegal are on the African continent and four African countries still have the death penalty for being gay.

However we're going to be charitable in our analysis and explain why even if they were able to get these rights, they are still worse than the alternative that we gave. They give you four reasons why we think we are not going to succeed. Firstly, the lack of international support. The beauty about these economic reparations is that we don't need international support because you only have to do this in a one-time transfer. Your side requires that continuous monitoring and goodwill from the state, which is so much harder. Secondly, on backlash, and the only example and analysis here is look at Zimbabwe. We tell you that Zimbabwe was unique because they were the only country that did this. We think when every country on the continent is trying to implement these policies, it is so much harder to have this sort of backlash and have these sorts of sanctions. But even if we do, Maya has explained, well, we don't think that is bad enough to make it not worth it. Thirdly, we get this idea that we're going to have backlash from the people who you're reclaiming this land from. We point out that these people are massively outnumbered. There were 23,000 Europeans in Kenya in 1945, compared to 5.2 million Kenyans. And it is simply implausible"

That is exactly what the British government did in Kenya. Fourthly, they say that economic and land reparations are complex. We don't necessarily think this is true. We take the land and we give it to community leaders as we set out in our model. And note that we don't need it to be perfect to get all the massive immediate benefits that we get. And I want to flag our mechanisms here, which they never even bother to pay lip service to, about why we're going to be successful. We tell you that we massively outnumber the colonisers, that they have the levers of state, that many countries are doing it, and the colonial powers are likely to support this. So given that all of their rebuttal hinges on them proving that we're unsuccessful, we can take out an enormous amount of their material. Secondly, they say that this isn't going to be enough to give people the help that they need and it's not going to be enough money. This was clearly a point they wrote before, it doesn't engage with our model that we are giving people immediate money and they stake in the resources around them. But know that they concede here the money is indeed helpful and is useful and the problem with that case is that they never contend with how to get it under their side of the house. We would much rather people have some land than no land at all, because they're able to coalesce and use this together in order to get benefits from it. Finally, on this idea that these people are going to turn violent and that their leaders are going to stoke ethnic conflict, their own example was of a conflict that happened in a democracy. Because when you are scared of another party taking power from you in an election, that is when you stoke ethnic conflict to stop people supporting them. We tell you we're going to allocate these resources well, and that we are able to give people money to solve their immediate issues and restore control over their land."

We point out why sanctions are implausible and their only response is to say that not all countries will do this so you don't have to sanction everyone. the motion assumes that Africa acts as a whole so at the very least we have to believe that a large substantial number of countries are going to do this and recognise that other countries are able to invest even if this was the case. We would much rather have better investment once people have control over this land so they're able to negotiate. Shell is no longer able to come in and bribe a corrupt government to take control of oil supplies when those oil supplies are owned by the people. We tell you we get much better economic success in the long term and political success in the long term and they never engage with those mechanisms that Maya gave you. We went on the short term, we went on the long term and we went on the principle. So the wording of this motion may be a mess but Africa didn't have to be so proud to propose."

              "text": "important things the second clash is whose policy is most likely to be effectively implemented here we gave you three three main reasons why proposition land redist true land redistribution will never work and we give you empirical evidence notes that the world is not black and uh black and white so the examples we get venue are attempts at implementing props policy yes it was in this in the status quo world but there is just one of those gray areas that did implement. The majority of countries did implement social and political rights. That is why we're a trend of progress, except the countries that implemented props policy. So their whole point about, oh, they can't bring examples doesn't work. So then what did we bring you under this clash? Three things. Firstly, they need international support. Props issue tells you, no, they don't. They can just redistribute land themselves. No panel, because sanction will be harming. You need aid to be able to bring about agriculture. You need fertilizers to not have all the insects kill your food you need you need a water irrigation system so that the droughts that are on their continent don't hamper this food security yes you need western support secondly they will tell you uh land preparations are zero sum because when i have planned team england can't have land on the other hand political rights are nothing. I'm speaking, they're speaking. My speech is not a zero sum thing. They never engage with this point. This means that this is one of the reasons that stand why land redistribution will never work. The third reason we gave you was that it's actively taking land from other people versus giving. There's empirical evidence to show that it's unlikely to be successful. For example, in South Africa, who started the Reconstruction and Development Program in 1994, the largest land redistribution program to date. Less than 10% of the redistribution target has been reached by the state. It doesn't work. Note that this alone means the whole proposition case false because they are never able to implement these land redistributions anyways. But look, maybe even if they do a little bit it is a skill they are not going to be able to redistribute all land at best small parts of their land the the impacts of redistributing very small part of land never way up to the violence that they create which i will explain in a second what then do they tell you no no they'll be able to do this because firstly, they're more African than colonists. Look, if it were by mere numbers, it doesn't work. Like in South Africa, there are many more black people than white, but still the white hold power. Only numbers are not a point in politics. It's about who has the resources, the money and the army. They don't have the army. The Western armies are still stronger. Thirdly, they tell you, no, no, no, we support a world where African states can learn from each other. Whoa, not all African states are the same. The fact that it worked in one state doesn't work under the colonizer of another state, right? They tell you that they can learn from each other, but the fact that it worked for an ex-French colony doesn't mean that worked for for an ex-french colony doesn't mean that it works for an ex-english colony the end of this flash it's clear proposition is very unlikely to ever be able to do land distributions in the first place however they need they need to deal with the bad things that happen even if they would be able to achieve land reparations namely the"

The stabilization program by the IMF in the Democratic Republic of Congo led to the inflation decline from 8% to 2.5%, which how you FDI is crucial. What do they tell you then? No, no, no, but we can reduce suffering because they can use like the thousand dollars of cash we give them right away to alleviate immediate suffering. Note that you finish the thousand dollars in two months after the Africans are a bit off as they were before. However, to sustain policy in the long run, you need institutions which create tax incomes that can sustainably provide for people. That is why on our side of the house, there is more involvement in secondary education, doubled more from the inabundance until now, because we create sustainable institutions that give people a true improvement on the long run, not just a thousand dollar cash influx. That's never enough. Second of all, we tell you that the money to invest in the future never work.

First of all, because when citizens have no peaceful means to express their dissatisfaction, they turn to violence. Secondly, authoritarian leaders stoke conflict to maintain control. Look at your notes. This was in LO. We've given examples. What does this mean? Civil and political rights would protect against conflict. Everything you buy about civil conflict being bad in the status quo would be worse. For example, in the Casamance conflict in Senegal, which was a low level conflict for the independence of the Casamance region, whose population is religiously and ethnically distinct from the rest of Senegal. The only thing that solved this conflict was that the Senegalese president was pressured by the people to sign a treaty with this region. This prevented mass conflict to escalate further.

So on the first question, note that what we proved to you from the very first speech onward is that even if we have fiat on both sides of the house, there are still external factors that make it more unlikely for proposition to achieve their aims. Because in propositions world, you have to constantly be taking away land from the rich, from the elite. In propositions world, you don't have a blueprint because every country is filled with complex ethnic tensions where it's very difficult to plan things like land redistribution. The comparative in our world is when it comes to enshrining civil and political rights, these rights are oftentimes negative rights. You don't need to directly give it to someone. Rather, the absence of the states just not infringing on your right is enough. The fact that you already have blueprints like other democratic institutions and other constitutions make it significantly easier. What does Proposition say to this? The first thing they tell us is that they can also have land reforms because leaders on both sides of the House will have good intentions. Panel, I'm sure Robert Mugabe probably had good intentions at the beginning. But the problem is oftentimes when you have no accountability mechanisms, when you cannot vote out leaders, when you cannot protest against leaders, that's when leaders get bad. So even if both sides of the House have good intentions, the problem is when they do mess up, we can hold them accountable. Proposition cannot. Then they say, ah, at least we'll have more black individuals. So somehow we will have more equitable land reform. But note that this doesn't matter. It was also the case in colonial rule that the black was the majority. The difference is your numbers only matter when you have civil and political rights. This was pointed out by our second speaker, because numbers only matter when it comes to things like voting. Numbers only matter when it comes to things like protesting. You're not able to do that in proposition side of the house. They have no power whatsoever. I also think it is interesting that the second proposition, for example, of Namibia, where 70% of land is owned by European descendants. Panamibia is one of the few countries that actually actively prioritized land reform. It was the president that actually had that main goal in mind. What we tell you is it is simply not likely to happen."

Let's say in their best case, you do have economic reform that finally works. You give each individual $1,000. Why is this still not good enough? We told you two things. Firstly, that even if you give individuals land, you cannot use it properly because oftentimes the land that you redistribute, you have to divide it to such small pieces that you just can't live off of that. But more importantly, you don't give people enough sustainable capital to actually use that land to continue to be able to have enough resources to farm off of it year after year. But secondly, we tell you that money doesn't matter if you have poor economic policy. If your country is suffering from hyperinflation, that bag of a thousand dollars doesn't do anything for these individuals. But thirdly, we told you independent of anything else, you're far more likely to have civil conflict in their world because individuals who do not have their voices heard are more likely to go to extreme ends.

We tell you that the large availability of labour, the purchasing power advantage of cheap currency, and the presence of natural resources, coupled with pressure from Western countries to find new locations for their factories, means that these companies would still likely have invested in these countries. The difference is, as we talked about in second, our workers could have demanded better conditions and better wages. Then they say that people are likely to become violent. I think in the first question I proved why this doesn't happen. But we tell you about the unique benefits, unique benefits that side opposition can see when they say there is a high standard of living in China and Saudi Arabia. We tell you four reasons why people don't starve when they have land, why it's such a good thing. We tell you about how we avoid the catastrophe of civil war. We tell you about how we get long term economic development, but also how we build on opposition's own metrics. Because we're the only side that needs two free requisites if you need for a stable functioning democracy panel, we win this debate on every count. We're so proud of those."

Additionally, poor farmers can apply for land and agricultural support, for example fertilizers and seeds. This will be done well because there is an immense desire for land redistribution from the population. What else will we then do? We want to have other redistributive policies such as the social aid system, cash transfer programs, and heavy taxation for beneficiaries from colonialism. We lobby for reparations from former colonial powers.

              "text": "With that, two arguments in the speech. Firstly, on the quality of life. The problem for the large majority of people in post-colonial states is that they lack a baseline of survival. They can't put bread on the table for your family. That is because they're exploited in large farms and work under slave-like conditions with very little pay. Opposition is unlikely to change this meaningfully for two reasons. One, because large landowners are likely to lobby the government to prevent any kind of legislation that would end exploitative labor. They can uniquely do this because of their economic importance. We expropriate them at their weakest right after independence. Second, because there are fluctuations in how much you can actually buy with your wage. That is, your money can decrease in its value, especially in a semi-stable economic system, whereas land you can always use. This means land is always better as a form of redress. How do we then help people? You can grow crops on the land that you receive. You're likely to do this very well for three reasons. One, because of the agricultural program, you receive seeds and fertilizers. Second, because you already worked as a farmer prior to you receiving that land most people were in agriculture and thirdly because generally not that hard i can grow crops in my own garden there's no reasons why african farmers wouldn't be able to do this we then tell you that you're they're likely to use the land even better than large farms because one you're likely to work harder when you reap the benefits of your own work and second because there's more sustainable agriculture because you depend on that land more than the large land owner does. But panel, even if baseline survival would be ensured on either side of the house, owning land gives you collateral. That is, you can take out loans and use them to invest in economic opportunities like starting your own business, sending your children to school. This gives you the option of meaningful economic participation and a higher quality of life. Why is this so important panel? Because we give enslaved people redress from centuries of exploitation where they can now meaningfully decide for themselves how they want to participate in economic activity. Second, because to access political rights, you need a good economic situation. I need spare time, spare capacity, and spare resources to make use of that, right? What does it matter if I have a right to education but my children need to work to get food on the table and I don't have the money to pay for tuition and buy them books and paper? I can't organize a protest if I need to work to feed my family, panel, where we want economic baseline baseline survival but even if you don't but but onto the"

              "text": "second argument on stability then three layers to this firstly we satisfy equality demands panel people have a massive desire for material and for material equality because they feel and see this every day there's a generational heart of your land being taken away it's often also symbolic to have a government take land away from your exploiter that killed your family and often the independence campaigns promised redistribution and largely ran on this. This means you need to meet this need for redistribution otherwise you end up with an unstable system because populists and radical forces can use the discontent and rile up people against the government. you generally get uprisings and strikes against the situation. This is incredibly bad in an already weak system. Second layer then, on why our government is likely better and more stable. Because our authoritarian leader has massive incentives to improve people's lives tangibly. People are okay with having less political rights only when their lives are actually becoming better because of that. Look at China, for example. Second, because often these people are former revolutionary leaders, they care about the country and the state they're in a lot. They're really invested, right? They literally risk their life for independence. But then thirdly, they're also quite educated and knowledgeable about this country and its issue. And fourthly, I think generally we can know that they're good leaders because they reconciled independence movement. Compare the central opposition, where you get an unstable democracy because they have little buy-in. That is firstly because there is distrust into the Western democratic system. Panel, I just want to make this very clear. This was the system that was used to create the inequality you are experiencing. The system that was in place when your cousins were taken away, your parents were murdered by the white settlers white missionaries put the system onto you i don't think there's a reason why african farmers would trust it then second because ethnic groups have lessened incentive to buy into the system that is because every group gains from overthrowing the new weak order we are likely getting coups and constant changes in who leads what panel there are precedents in algeria in 1999 when an islamist party tried to overthrow the government, or in Ghana when a military coup overthrew Khamenei Nukwa's government. This is uniquely harmful to democracies because they depend on wanting people to buy into it. You need to go to elections, you need to accept their results, you need to support protests of either side of the house. Third layer then, on why we get more actionability. Democracies are generally slow, especially if they're new, right? You have no established compromise mechanisms, you don't even know which parties are running for an election then. Second, because democracies in post-colonial states specifically are likely blocked by ethnic tensions. We need to compromise and there are potential deadlocks that occur when parties specifically cater to certain ethnicities when engaged in clientelism where policies are specifically designed only for one. Before I move on, why this argument is generally important, is there a PY? Okay, moving on. Why then is stability so important? Because we think in the best case for opposition, you're getting an unstable and dysfunctional government that cannot deliver basic necessities like building hospitals and infrastructure because it all requires government action that is blocked on opposition side of the house and a democracy that is in deadlock. But I think in their worst case, you have weak structures that are prone to coups and civil wars. Panel, you need to get your land back to get your country back. We say you get immaterial equality before you get immaterial rights. So proud to propose."

              "text": "Panel, we think a lot of what composition is perpetuating is contingent on two things. Firstly, it is contingent on the willingness of these leaders to redistribute land in the model that they have given to us. Firstly, we look at the model of Zimbabwe when Zimbabwe was another country that prioritized land reform. Land was not accessible to the average individual but was rather prioritized to be redistributed to party loyalists and those who participated within the struggle. And we think this was something that was common amongst most African states when we look at countries like Uganda and Zimbabwe. Why does this become important in proving that side propositions model doesn't work in this debate? That's on the first instance, on the willingness of the political leaders to partake in this form of redistribution. But on the second level, we don't think there's people who will buy into the fact of there being a cap being put on the amount of land that is being given back to them. Because we think on the principle of reparations, you do not choose the amount you wish to give back but you give back what is due if i as a fat as my ancestral family on 30 of the land i expect to be reparated 30 of the land we think in terms when we put a cap on this you're likely to run into a lot of conflicts and friction with people who do not agree with this model but secondly on that of brian we think ethnic groups especially won't buy in. When we look at minority groups have already been disenfranchised and receiving a lot of their land from majoritarian groups. And at a point that you put a cap, we think it becomes a scapegoat from majoritarian groups not to back the majority of the land that was stolen from them. Secondly, we think that a lot of people would be too poor to access a lot of these rights."

So firstly, on recontextualisation, we think the contention of this debate relies on where we think the international community can assist these post-colonial African states in attaining the best method, which would then guarantee the second one as well. What does political emancipation look like and what does economic emancipation look like? Firstly, political. We think this looks like drafting legitimate constitutions secondly providing a separation of powers between the judiciary and executive and thirdly setting up a judicial system that acts as checks and balances on justice in the current country on a civil and political level we think economic emancipation looks like the devolving of financial needs down to the leaders appointed of these countries to embark on economic survival on their own or setting up of a democratic structure why this is true we think it is the common trend that is perpetuated in multiple countries if we're really looking at what economic preparations look like not what side purposes they gave you we look at how the Zimbabwe"

And then they were told to do with it as they pleased, whether or not they would use it to buy back their land from the white settlers. So we find as we find it more preferable in pursuing a sound political system. The clearest context of these two roots we will use in this debate is that of the conscience of South Africa and Zimbabwe. The reason why is because geographically they are close in proximity and share a lot of the same geographical things. So they were ruled by the same people and thus their only real substantive reason for difference in political, economic and social progression is their difference in the route taken after gaining independence. We think one, South Africa asked for help in setting up administrative judicial structures and a demarcation between the executive and the judiciary, whilst the mob would prioritize economic emancipation in the form of reparations. This will act as a rebuttal to a lot of the substantive from first speaker. The impacts of this. Firstly, South Africa in the 28-year democracy has been able to recall lot of the substantive from first speaker the impacts of this firstly satan in the 28-year democracy has been able to recall two of his presidents to question their conduct with zuma effectively facing jail time and repercussions whilst in zimbabwe robert had a 37-year term in office because the constitution ultimately allowed it this being brings about a focus on economic emancipation and in turn this had a despot in its presidency while South Africa has curbed this with political structures. And secondly, South Africa in turn has experienced a degree of economic emancipation after pursuing political emancipation. We think this looks like there's been better housing at cheaper prices, a new industry that has begun to spring up in a political system where if people can call it out and they're being changed at a point in time, the people call out the inconsistencies within the political system. Whilst the Zimbabwean economy is shattered when we look at the 2000 land reform policies that came along that prioritized devolving land to loyalists and those who participated in the struggle, not actually reparating it back to the people who previously owned it. Why is this a problem? This is a problem that is particularly contingent on side proposition. At a point in time that they want to put caps on the amount of land that devolved back to people this would mean that there's no guarantee that one those who lost will attain it back and secondly those who may not necessarily actually had any um any claims on said that might gain claim to access on said that if they have a political and social quota in that country at that point in time we think this looks like loyalists to certain um dominant pirate parties and those who then support this movement this becomes important"

Firstly, I think we can reasonably assume that a cap will be high enough to get enough land. I think an authoritarian leader has an incentive to set the cap at a certain level where his policy is effective enough to actually achieve the change he wants. Why would he otherwise try it in the first place? Secondly, I also think we get a justice system just as they do. The difference then lies in how the democracy political system looks. The reason is because even as an authoritarian leader, I need to have an incentive and a way to enforce the policies, enforce the rule of law I want, and government and a way where I can sue people is a great way on how I can do that."

I think this is a fairly wrong claim because I think we've told you here enough. I think, one, there's a huge reason for the people to want this inequality and want this land redistribution. They would hate the fact that the Hollandizers came in in here stole the land and took it away from them they want this back i think land secondly is more tangible and political right this is something that gives them an immediate benefit i don't think they can claim on their side there's a bigger idea of getting theirs thirdly i would argue because equity and equity is affects how happy you are because i compare my happiness and high life satisfaction compared to other people if everyone is equal on our side and people want to be happy, we're more likely to get that. I think landowner politicians, even regardless, have incentives to also push that. On the one hand, they want brownie points, right? They want to make sure there's no uprisings that actually control them down. They want to have a symbolic policy that people can actually get behind, something that applies to all ethnic groups, not just clientelism. And secondly, because I think there's a big threat in them if they have landowners that are too powerful if you have a couple elites that are powerful there's in the people you have to serve to people you have to give like tax breaks and other things to people control you out of policy i don't think it's something you would want i think therefore on our side secondly the ideas they tell us or the cap system is wrong because not everyone gets a just representation i think this happens on a spectrum thus even if i don't perfectly get what i want or what i deserve even if it's not getting some it's better than getting none i think therefore this principle still stands but note they assume our policy does not work at all but don't ever prove our implementation on their side works i would argue implementation is harder for something that is intangible something that is not native to this community and it's harder to actually implement secondly on the quality of life of these people because I think you are Hannah tells you quite a few mechanisms here which go completely unrespond to the only ideas we get no thank you is this idea it's not perfectly redistributed but I think even on a marginal level even I tell you because they want to cater to every ethnic group they want to make sure this is a policy that they can reunite people under they're more likely to make this fair but even if they don't even if they give it to some people, I still think this works for a majority of people. I still think a majority of people now can flee exploitation of these landlords, can flee the loan wages, and therefore actually get possibility of some economic reparations.

A person in the Ivory Coast, a farmer, probably sells his cocoa beans in his farm back to the West. Comparatively on our side, local producers are more likely to produce for themselves. This crucially means we get more food on the table for people in this area. This is better. I want to tell you, because this argument is not enough responded by, this works really well and is super i want to tell you because this argument is not enough responded by this works really well it's super important i tell you we tell you that we get people who are on the worst side of this better because we give them colo give them a baseline of severity but even if you're better off we give them collateral this is super important because i think we judge our happiness individual happiness compared to other people this is better on our side and we feed people's mouths secondly i'd be a totally an idea of political systems i just want to point out here that's how the ideas of picking out two examples and trying to win the whole debate on this it's completely untrust we are talking about hunt we're talking about tons of different countries here i don't think it's fair but even if you use the metrics of south africa being the perfect example south africa the highest crime rates like last year like in the whole world at least in africa they had a huge unrest in 2021 and 350 people died in that i don't think there's an example where they proved that this world policy works in other way in the whole world, at least in Africa. There was a huge unrest in 2021, and 350 people died in that. I don't think there's an example where they proved that this policy works in other ways. The only idea we get here is that we have a loyalist. I want to point out this again would mean that we've given power to a small elite. This is not something a politician has incentive in, because a small elite would mean I'm dependent on a small group to actually keep me in power. To have multiple people spread it out, there's not an individual who can actually throw me out of my room. Spreading the eggs I have to feed to, meaning, for example, giving economic growth to everyone, giving land reform to everyone because it's something everyone can get behind, is so much better. Again, I want to point out here that Johanna gives you mechanisms on how, for example, political deadlock will happen, how, for example, policies will not actually be enacted or there's civil rights on their side.

              "text": "Let's get to my own substantive addition here, the long-term trajectory. The thesis is, in the best-case scenario of both sides, proposition gets fair redistribution, opposition gets their political rights, we also get political rights on proposition. Why will opposition not get land redistribution in the long term? The reason is because opposition gives all their people political rights. This also means they give the right to property. This means opposition can't anymore expropriate the land of people because property rights are protected. Leave them two options. One, they either have the prost policy of like having a willing seller, possibly a problem one, that not everyone is willing to sell their land. But even if they are, because they know this is a government plan, they hold the leverage of keeping prices extremely high and therefore not actually being affordable for the government. Secondly, they can expropriate land without a willing seller because the land government actively infringes on the right of a person. Compensation has to be extremely high to justify this. Problem is, post-colonial countries oftentimes are extremely poor, have small government budgets, they can't actually afford this. This is opposition's worst case. This means this won't have any form of land redistribution at all. In opposition's best case scenario, they get some land distribution, but it's on a small scale, doesn't affect everyone, few privileged people get this. It takes a big part of government budget and is really slow and takes a lot of time. Before I can tell you where Proposition gets political rights and redistribution, I'll take a POI. Voters and cash transfers can't be equitable without a justice system to safeguard these for you. I think I tell you this in my intro, be equitable without a justice system to safeguard these things? I think I tell you this in my intro. We also have a justice system. We also have a legal system. And the active incentive on why we have it is because it makes it easier to actually implement these policies, implement their policy, implement their rule. But even if you don't buy my mechanistical examples, look at Namibia, look at Egypt, look at different authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia in the world. They still have these kind of justice systems. I don't think there's a claim. I don't think there's a mechanism behind how they get this. Okay. Why do we get political rights and redistribution in long-term? What we create is a strong middle-class. Lots of people on our side own land suddenly, and now have a baseline of wealth. Additionally, they can use the land they have to pay for education, to start a business and actually grow. Analogy here is on their side, they'll have an Elon Musk. On our side, we'll have a million homeowners. This will lead to the democratisation in the long term because people with economic power will now demand political rights. This is especially the case because these people are more educated on our side and they are rich enough to actually care about other things than just care about other things and not just only their material well-being. But the middle class is so big and so vital for the economy that even the credible threat of them standing up, them stopping producing goods, is enough to bully and push the government and actually giving up. I think the authoritarian regimes at that point are unable to further be able to do this. How this could look is, for example, in a British monarchy, where, for example, you had the rich aristocracy, which you only cater to, but at the point of industrialization, you had merchants, you had engineers, you had a bigger middle class were wealthy and because of this the king had to create assemblies in later parliament to satisfy the demands of this growingly important class democracy was created because a few couldn't could be paid off with government contracts but because we had so many people now you had to necessitate and you had to give them powers even if this fails governments will have to improve their institutions and go kind of go in the demands of these people, bettering the lives of everyday people because of all of this, because we can claim the benefits. They can't claim ours. Vote side proposition."

After sharing gives you an actual analogous thing of what happens in Africa. A few things that we think are very important a we told you that when you look at things such as political reparations and what they look like such as like creating civil liberties it means that the countries like western liberal democracies at a point of these countries were becoming post-colonial there was a meeting that was set up e.g the lancaster hours agreement and also like the movement within south africa what happened is it was you had to prioritize whether or not you had to create proper financial structures and redistribute land or you had to create actual political systems where individuals could vote and use build up large democratic sites which would be used as accountability mechanisms. That isn't why the two examples that they have for their entire case don't wreck Egypt and Namibia is primarily because Namibia invested mostly in creating a proper function of democratic structures that could hold governments accountable and make sure that they couldn't merely just take advantage of citizens and points at which they want to keep their real up-and-touch and investigate. Before I talk about quality of life, I'll take that POI. Go. Why then did a majority of countries that tried civil political rights fail and slide back into authoritarianism on your side? Listen, you are very up on the fact that what actually happened in Africa. There's a few things that happened. We say, A, the countries that did prioritize the creation of political and civic rights, countries such as South Africa, managed to create systems that were efficient. That is to say, we managed to recall Jacob Zuma, managed to recall Thabo Mbeki, we managed to historically recall actual presidents. Two, it meant that these individuals have been capacitated to historically sue the state and effectively take out presidents.

That is to say they viewed themselves as those who deserved more than that basic and average citizen. Within society they were more likely to actually capture the state and use it for themselves at a point at which citizens did not have active democratic structures to call them out and to make sure that the system was inherently better. Note the only reason why white people were effectively able to take away the land of black people is because they did not have civic rights that protected them from that ever happening in the first place. When you just take those people and give them back those in that land in that very same situation, I think it is equally easy for the government that exists to use policies to directly take away that land, even if they redistributed at the very start of your policy in your best case scenario. So we think anyway you're likely to repeat the harms that you talk about. So the best response that you get then from opposition to our, from proposition to our entire case is that like economic policies themselves are unstable, we don't necessarily have structures and why the structures don't exist. I think in first picture it does a really good job in showing you what setting democratic structures actually look like political in post-colonial African states and systems where it was prioritized but it meant something to say it meant that you would sit down at the table with active people who were already involved such as the un and other bodies that already actively involved in democratic systems they would help with the initial foundation of state democratic system and make sure that they were fine and make sure that you could actually separate legislature and other forms of state power to make sure that they were sufficient in"

So let's start off by talking about implementation, right? Because their opposition's push is that implementation will be bad because that will be given to rich people and loyalists. Two reasons. Firstly, note that elites are a direct threat to leaders, right? So if you give people economic power, they can then use this power to defeat you and control you politically, right? Especially right after a revolution where leaders are presumably the weakest, it is a bad idea for them to give lots of land to powerful people, right? It is much easier to tax and control lower classes in the short term. Secondly, note that after a revolution, there is still this revolutionary move, right? The leader has seen what can happen when the people get angry and overthrow a government this is why they are likely to want to get brownie points with the entire population that means that giving land retribution therefore like ending basically colonization because only if you get your land back do you get your country back it is likely to be incredibly popular. Note that also this policy equally benefits all ethnicities. And thirdly, if you are relatively well off, then the potential personal gain from a revolution does not outweigh the risk of having the revolution fail. For all of these reasons, it is a very good idea for these leaders to implement this policy to like keep their power, which is why they will do this."

We would tell you that opposition simply asserts that they will be able to get a democracy. Never do they give you mechanisms, structure, reasons why they will be able to do this. We would give you two further reasons why it is much easier to get land redistribution than a functioning democracy. Firstly, land redistribution is a one-time policy. A functioning democracy needs continuous political buy-in and people to support it secondly right note that on our side of the house we have a capable administration that previously distributed land to the colonizers and can now do the reverse and like like give it to the local population versus on their side of the house they have no tradition of a western democracy how is it going to stand? But ultimately, Tarun's argument tells you why on the long term, we will be able to implement both, right? Because only we can do this. Because when you have a democracy that functions, if we take opposition at their best, then that democracy guarantees property rights, right? And you would have to give people compensation for like, and that would probably be too expensive for a developing country's government. On proposition, we tell you, the more economic power people have, the more they will push for these to be politically formalized.

Three reasons. Firstly, because people simply care more about material things, right? In order to redress past injustice, I have to cut my country back, I have to get my land back. This is internalized injustice that people want to redress. Secondly, on an individual metric, material things are simply more tangible for me and have a bigger impact on my quality of life. If I have money, I can pay a good education for my kids and give them a good life. However, one vote is unlikely to change the outcome of an election. Thirdly, material things are logically prior in Maslow's hierarchy of need, right? First, you need safety and your physiological needs met before you can reach self-actualization. I need money in order to pay tuition, in order to get access to my right to education. I need to be able to buy a newspaper in order for freedom of press to matter.

They will be happy to simply be better off to have some wealth, even if it isn't perfect, because presumably they understand that perfection isn't perfect. But secondly, because colonization was probably like 200 years or so, they probably don't even remember who exactly their land owned for. Now, what they tell us is, oh, but on our side of the house, people can sue for the land. Firstly, we would tell you that oftentimes there is a lack of official land records from this period.

The problem is that the comparative they set up from the very first speech is an unfair one. This isn't South Africa versus Zimbabwe, the literal only example where land redistribution has failed. This is a nuanced engagement that we would have needed from the opposition to win this debate. We win because we can engage with our best case and because we can engage with our worst case and still tell you why land redistribution wins you the case every single time. For opposition to have any benefit in this debate,"

I just can't care about going to vote if I don't have bread on the table for my family. You get this because of land redistribution panel uniquely that even if you buy that it doesn't work perfectly on our side of the house. I think we're more likely to give this to more people. They would only be able to access these political rights anyways. Proposition opposition doesn't have any benefit in their very best case, even when they get political rights."

But I think the problem is, Penno, that you will have to compare this to opposition's democracy going badly, right? And I tell you this in first about deadlocks having no actionability because the leaders just don't care. You're just in clashes with the ethnic parties the whole time. And because people want redistribution, have an active incentive to overthrow a government that doesn't give them that, right? They never engage with that, right? Because the problem here is in the worst case, this just means another civil war. This just means a weak government that is overthrown again and again and again. This is their worst case. They never engage with that. We think that we win by that alone."

We're better at the degree of fulfilling reparations. They never give you a mechanism why they get, like, we get enough, right? But in the second, they want to claim, well, this is inherently an unequal distribution. You only give this to loyalists. They ignore what Tarun and Oud talk to you for four minutes throughout both of their speeches right you would necessarily want to cater to everyone rather than creating a small elite right if I give Oud and Tahun all of my land it's much more likely than they can that they can overthrow me rather than when I give it to all of you in this room because individually you're less likely to overthrow me this is an incentive to do land redistribution well i'm not going to give it to all of my like only like the loyalists second i think the leader is afraid of being overthrown again if they don't do this well i think because people have such a massive desire which they never contest this is likely to be very very very well done right we see this in examples we see this in ghana for example right i think other ethnic groups will then hold them in check it's likely to be very well done. But even if that weren't true, they tell you well, but like the government is too weak. Panel at best is asymmetric, if the government is so weak, they never get a democracy on ours, their side of the house as well. I think much rather it's then easier to get land redistribution because it's only one time because ethnic parties have an active incentive to buy into that and to get it well done. What is the impact of this panel? I think we're way more likely to get good land redistribution than they are to get good democracy. But I think even if they win on good democracy, you necessarily have to have economic rights before political rights, because you're never able to access a democracy without having the baseline survivability."

I think these are extreme cases in which we get international accountability, similar to their side of the house. We have only ever seen this in Zimbabwe. Even then, we have gotten US backlash and clearly Mugabe isn't in power anymore. Panel, opposition loses this debate because they fail to engage with the comparative in this debate. That's a bad democracy against bad land distribution. It's good land redistribution against good democracy. We win in either case. So proud to propose. Okay, thank you, other speakers."

              "text": "So first argument on how this leads to immediate increasing prosperity. Why do economic rights matter to individuals? Firstly, day-to-day life improvement. If you had given these people land to their name, they would have been able to utilize this land for survival. For example, they would have been able to cultivate their land and feed their children. This matters especially in post-colonial Africa, when during the 60s, 45% of child deaths in Africa was due to malnutrition, while at the same time it held the biggest level of agricultural exports in the world. On the comparative, what happened under opposition was giving those people freedom of speech to ask for food without giving them the benefit immediately. Second reason why economic rights matter is independence. If you had given these people economic reparations, it would have enabled them to act independently by giving them options from ownership of land that would allow them to sell it or start trading or open up a business to cash transfer that would give them stable income and control of their future. On a principal level, we restore their autonomy because they are finally recognized as people who can make choices. This is something they were deprived of by colonialists. On the comparative, opposition as a form of compensation gave these people rights they could not utilize to maximize their choices for two reasons. Firstly, lack of democratic institutions. For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state. And secondly, lack of democratic institutions. For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state. And secondly, lack of democratic traditions. For people in power, it was difficult to understand their powers derived from the people. And for the people, this meant accepting the complex of democracy, like being on the losing side of elections and having to accept majority control. This is complex for them to understand so third reason why economic rights mother to individual is trusting the system because the outcome of having day-to-day improvements and independence is that these people would have started to see immediate change and tangible benefits to their lives on the comparative when rights didn't give them immediate benefits they ended up doing the system that didn't give them what's promised in the chart piece.

              "text": "so economic rights are the first priority. Why immediately after the colonization is a narrow window in time for the opportunity to get these rights. Two reasons. First, the momentum of the colonization. When the colonization happened, there was a situation of political power so with new institutions in the way it would have made sense for a distribution of economic power to have been part of that process as well. On the comparative what happened under opposition by postponing land reparations was establishing a new state that reflected the older colonial economic order. So when South Africa is now doing it during the colonization, but now it's targeting part of the elite instead. So initially it said it would happen in five years under Parisians, but now the target has changed to 35 years later. So the second reason why now is the right time to do it, why after the colonization is the right time to do this, is that elites were at their weakest. Because right after the colonization, they had time to do this is that elites were at their weakest because the right because right after the colonization they had part of economic wealth but they didn't yet have the opportunity to establish their control over the new government so opposition allowed the elites to establish political power without challenging economic power so pursuing economic operations to start would have meant less powerfully to oppose this process. So, for example, Ghana that prioritized political reform and only tried cross transfer programs 10 years after independence, at which point they had established political power and could make sure to get the majority of funds. Well, in that case, it would have been much easier to have a successful cash transfer program immediately when elites power was not so much a trench in"

              "text": "society now moving on to the second argument about state building where economic rights reparations likely to create a more stable state than civil and political rights before all that argument i will accept the poi you keep talking about how you will be achieving all these great impacts for vulnerable people in the post-colonial states but you never explain to us how you're going to be doing these things. How is the land going to be distributed and by whom? Who is going to be deciding who gets the cash in that colonial state? Who is going to be leading? Okay, so well there are land reparations have a defined process of happening. You have the new state that has been assigned the role of distributing the land to the people as fairly as possible. And since under our city we make it a priority, then all political capital, all the focus would be on how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest, to the most vulnerable. These things would be the how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest, to the most vulnerable. These things would be the criteria for starting this. And in fact, this was in our model from the get go about how this looks like nationalizing companies, for example, to distribute wealth to the masses. Now moving on to my second argument about state building. Why economic rights are likely to create more stable states than civil and political rights? Because to have stability in the system, you need to have people buying and support. So when politicians promise that people's lives will become better and actually they don't, the system loses credibility. So what happened is people were expecting change improvements in their day to day life, but when promise of meaningful rights never materialized, they lost faith in the system. On the comparative, if you had given these people a piece of land the system wouldn't have been perfect but they would at least have done to be improving was it important firstly this led to uprisings by the people who were disappointed by the system which political leaders responded with martial law and violent oppression for example in vongo mobutu had 33 300 000 civilians in that instance people neither had economic prosperity nor did they enjoy the rights they were promised to get. Secondly, when things go wrong, people needed someone to blame and because there were societies that were deeply ethnically divided, they started blaming each other, leading to incredibly bloody civil wars and even genocides. For example, in Rwanda, Tutsis controlled a lot more land than the Hutus and the fact that it was never redistributed led to conflict which escalated to genocide. On on the comparative when you have a small business you don't want economic activity to be interrupted by coffee so there is less chance of this happening so where are we likely to create more accountability because we it's because we decrease the symmetry of power between people and the government it's important because colonialism created ethnic divisions with local elites that benefited from their regimes because not just the colonial masses that pressured the people. For example in Rwanda, Belgium chose to rule over the Hutus and now we increase accountabilities from the Hutus to the Tutsis because now, because we give them land, they can actually have an influence in government because they're the ones that pay taxation, contribute to the state budget. So even if you buy the idea of democracy is better, you think the democracy is democracy is better you you think the democracy is good on the other side you have more accountability so for more accountability and better state building where you can vote so I'd like to thank the first speaker of the"

First rebuttal, you spoke about economic land reparations means saving land, nationalizing corporations, and distributing the land. First of all, who will decide who gets the land? How is that distributed and by whom? Without elections and without a proper democratic process, it is very likely for there to be unequal distribution to happen first of all due to corrupt leaders that take control and all the other issues that occur in these post-colonial states without actual proper governments the people need to have the right to vote plus civil rights in order to organize themselves in a group in groups and voice their opinions on this and be able to have proper discourse and have actual say in how that land is distributed and b after colonization states are very unstable and very vulnerable to corruption the prop tells you in response to our poi that they will have land distribution but land distribution can only be successful it's the only case where it's successful is in a structured state with structured stable work union or election or some kind of political system that is only developed through political rights on our side of the house so our side of the house actually does more land distribution over long term than their side does later on secondly economic rights you spoke about the day-to-day life improvements the biggest issue is that these guys give you the impact of economic rights but never explain to you how these impacts are achieved. How are these economic rights going to be given? Third, the right to vote is meaningless, they said. Well, we tell you that's exactly the opposite. Without voting, without having civil rights, people remain dehumanized and unheard. Vulnerable minorities like women and children will not have their voices heard on their side. How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need? You simply cannot without a proper political system. Fourth, you speak about space building. The promise of meaningful rights never materializes. People are given lands. You never give a reason why meaningful rights will never materialize on our side of the debate. Why will civil rights not be promised? You also never give the likelihood to which economic rights could be achieved. I'm intuitively led to understand your impacts, but I do not believe that they are likely to happen because you never"

              "text": "explain why land is more achievable to give to people than civil rights. Now let's move on to the first argument. Let's speak about the importance of civil and political rights in these societies. There are a few reasons why we believe that civil and political rights were the most important thing for African states to prioritize in their postcolonial periods? I'll be answering this in three different points. First of all, this is what citizens in colonial periods were most denied. Many colonial rulers, be it British, French, Spanish, or whoever, often operated in these countries by a certain control, without any limited or democratic input from citizens. Where citizens had a say, it was often limited to the most elite or those who supported the colonial regime. This was done in order for those colonial forces to maintain their power. However, this denied the majority of citizens their fundamental autonomy, the thing they craved the most, their capacity to vote for their representation, their capacity to simply express their political opinion, and as a result, it was the most important thing to take back after that colonial period is over. Of course, people care about their convict status too. We don't say that they don't. However, there is a reason why middle-class citizens agitate for change and dictatorship for one-party faiths. They desire the fundamental human dignity that comes with being able to express your free will in society and political system. Secondly, these rights are necessary for some of the most vulnerable groups. Women, sexual minorities, and ethnic minorities often face massive discrimination in post-colonial societies, often as a relic imposed from conservative Western rulers. Civil and political mechanisms were often the only way these groups could bring attention to their struggle, whether it be through free speech, protest, or otherwise. Three, these rights were crucial to prevent democratic backslide in post-colonial states. For many African nations, the post-colonial period represented their first attempts for decades or centuries at self-governance. Whilst many nations thrived, many nations faced challenges due to democratic cronyism. Only strong political rights provided the mechanism to check this democratic backlash and ensure fragile institutions do not completely crumble. Before I move on to my second argument, I'll take your POI now. If leaders are corrupt enough not to be able to do land redistribution, why wouldn't, for the example, rig the election, making any right to vote completely meaningless? Well, simply, I'll give you the example of Morocco. Morocco focused on land redistribution after colonial states, where the people in power were the elites in the society. They took all the land for themselves and did redistribute it properly. However, on our side of the debate, political rights are the first thing looked at. Therefore, the people elected are through the consensus and the votes of all the people around them, not simply by being elite or being a general in society. Therefore, they have their structured people that were put in place by their people. They were chosen by their people and have a much, much higher chance of being less corrupt due to being in a politically correct system. Now let's move on to argument number two. We speak about the practicalities of economic and land reparations."

              "text": "First of all, in many cases it will simply be done right and possible to achieve economic and land reparations. I'll be expanding about this in four different points. First of all, land reparations is probably the worst case for opposition. Take for example the case of South Africa. Given the significant overlap between post-pollinism and apartheid, advocating for any land redistribution is away from white landowners would not only have been unsuccessful due to the massive influence of white landowners such as farmers, but this might have been a very real chance of inciting significantly further violence as individuals felt their very livelihoods were threatened. B, taking even a less contentious example, even quotas or cash transfers in the majority of African societies would have been seen as contentious due to the perceived nature of them taking from one group and giving to another. C, this is not the case with civil and political rights, which are not zero-sum, which is exactly what they're proposing. That is, if you give rights to one group, you don't need to take it away from another group, whereas that is necessarily the case with any form of economic distribution, which of course leads to conflicts and tension in the country, which is especially bad for these fragile new countries that are still developing. The conclusion of this is that governments and civil society groups would have not only wasted their limited political capital, but may have actively risked further destabilization and violence in many fragile societies. And that is their only impact. Secondly, in the long term, we think that it's actually easier to achieve economic rights through stable political rights. For example, when you're able to freely form associations like unions you can advocate for worker protection or you're able to freely vote for a party that represents your actual interests you can vote for the best economic policies. And PropsWorld is one where at best best we have achieved some economic redistribution but not prioritized a long-term mechanism to continue to achieve economic benefits once those needs evolve in the future only our side does so and that's why i'm extremely proud"

Firstly, we think that the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to do this land distribution under our side of the house. Because these are the people that are more likely to assume power. The people that are leading the independence movements are the ones that usually are elected in the beginning of these democracies because these are the most known people and in the same way they would usually assume power under our side of the house as well so if these people are so corrupt then that is also the way that they corrupt these democracies that they're able to then change the constitutions so but what do we change here is the second response having these same people under our side of the house we have more accountability for these people, exactly because the states are now more dependent on the people, care more about the people, because they have something to offer, right? Because now that these people have land, now that these people are paying taxes, they're not just a burden to the state asking for shelter and food, but they're actually something that the state is dependent on on the comparative it is very easy to like dismiss their civil and political rights when they can just say that these people are not as important because we don't get our money from these people let's change the constitution it's much harder to have accountability when the state is not dependent on them but third thirdly, even if you buy that under our sort of the house, we have more corruption, right? We still get the benefits of having at least some kind of land distribution, at least some kind of more cash towards these people. So on the immediate level, these people are better off because they're less hungry, because they're able to use their money to invest in hungry, because they're able to use their money to invest in things, because they're able to have autonomy in their decisions. But secondly, because we have more stability in that place in general, exactly because of the fact that they're not leaving to have conflicts, that we have less, we even told you about why genocide is less likely to happen because of this stability, which is very important. So even if you buy that corruption, we still think that it is very important to have these economic reparations prioritised. But secondly, opposition is telling us that people lose their voices. But we think that, as I said in my introduction, it's not as important for people to lose their voices when we're talking about people that do not have like basic things to begin with we think that these people need to have these reparations need to have this land and need to be able to like have to have this immediate benefits right now but thirdly opposition is telling us that the reason why they want civil rights is because this is what people were mostly denied because they did not have a say like during colonialism which we think to an extent is true right like during colonialism former colonial powers did not give people the ability to have a say and to have political liberties but the reason why this was harmful is because they also didn't give them a way to take control of their resources to take like to be able to decide what is going to happen with their land which is taking away the the idea that these people have ownership over their land when they didn't let them decide what to do with their minds what to do with their agriculture this meant that these people now don't feel like their land is theirs so in order to be able to have civil and political rights, even in the long term, if you buy that this is something ideal, we need these people to feel like what they're deciding on is something that is theirs. And this will not happen if you don't give them the ownership, right? Because the ownership is what they have been missing for all of these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistribution are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another. these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistributions are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another. We think that firstly, it is harmful that the examples that they gave us are of things like South Africa, which have been delayed and delayed again and again, exactly because they let time pass, which now makes it harder to do this redistribution because it seems like you're taking away this from the elites and not from the colonial powers. But secondly, we think that this is exactly why land redistributions cannot happen later on. And we need to prioritize them in the beginning because this is when we have more turmoil going on in society. This is when we have a general thing of like changing the way that society exists and generally of trying to make reparations taking stuff away from the colonial powers especially when we have when we live in a society where a lot of decolonization happened in the same time period before moving on into my argument i'll take the point"

              "text": "okay so no point now my argument is about limiting neocolonialism. This argument is going to prove that prioritizing economic reparations is necessary to limit the instincts of the former colonial power. Even 60 years after decolonization, colonial powers are still benefiting from the extraction economies that they created, which is why France is dominating Cameroon's agriculture and selling in their own markets. This means that even though the colonization ended formal political control, it did not end economic control, since a lot of the assets remained in the harm of the former colonial power or their local collaborators. How does economic presence enable other forms of neocolonial influence in the area? Firstly, political influence. Having economic influence over the country like france owning the majority of senegal's banking telecommunications and supermarket industries means that they get more bargaining power intervention in the political situation because when a majority of the african states income comes through these taxes when they're all especially when their own people are that poor this means that if they see a benefit in cheap working hands for extraction they're more likely to pressure for the continuation of such conditions. But secondly, they can even have military influence because they can use the excuse of, I have my assets there, I need to be able to defend them, like France does with having troops in Mali, Chad, and Niger. This is important because these two ways of influence break the self-determination and sovereignty of these African states. How would prioritizing land reparations and past transfers fix this? Because returning wealth and capital from the colonial elites to the masses means that they would have the ability to use this capital to create domestic industries. Therefore, they could use their minds to build manufacturing rather than only extraction. This could create an economy that is more independent from the former colonial control. Notice that by doing this from the beginning, it would become easier to actually disengage from that economy versus on the comparative, because you have tied your development to these companies that extract, it's not easy to happen. When we're creating this independent economy, this means that when the other powers like the US and China want to have influences in China, in Africa, which they will because of the vast resources they don't get involved with the extraction model but they're more likely to have agreements as trading partners which would be better because they're established based on a new order as two sovereign states so they're more likely to be actually beneficial but secondly because the agreements will be beneficial to the majority of the people and not the top 1% because they are the ones that own the assets that now foreign powers want to use. So because we prove to you that it is actually better to have economic independence with our side of the house, please vote for PRO. Thank you."

They kept telling you that on their side, they have the most short-term benefit of having people being immediately fed. But we've already explained to you, panel, that these impacts don't make any sense without a proper mechanism. They still don't explain to you how land distribution, how cash quotas, how all of these economic reparations will actually happen on their side. How will this land be distributed? Who will be making these decisions? Who will have their cash removed in order to give it to someone else? All of this model, this model is not existent on the proposition side. They haven't explained to you the detailed outline of what is needed in order for their economic impacts to have any sense. No, thank you. Protected time. We also tell you that the comparative is that it is very difficult to hand out political and civil rights in a discriminatory way. For example, if you protect the right to protest, you are almost always likely to do this for all groups in society. And this is the point that they have not responded to. We already told them that there is a great point of contention and tension because of their economic policies. Because at the end of the day, if you're giving land to someone, you're taking it from someone else. And that creates tension in an already unstable country that has just been decolonized. And for you to not respond to these arguments makes you already lose that clash. They also tell you that, you know, the same people will have power on both sides of the house. And we completely disagree with this point, because we tell you that people that are likely to receive power on the proposition side without an electoral process are people who already have power who are not the vulnerable stakeholders of this debate who like women and children and minorities ethnic minorities sexual minorities who do not have the ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them back we tell you that through our side with an electoral process we have the ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them best. We tell you that through our side, with an electoral process, we have the ability to choose a leader that will do the best. So we tell you on the on the point of tangible changes, our side can support basic welfare programs that help the most vulnerable. But Proposition has to specifically defend things like active land distribution, quotas, cash transfer programs, which are not necessary to get people out of poverty. Proposition still has to explain how they can achieve those things. We explained to you why those aims would have been impossible in many countries in our first opposition speaker due to the fact that they are seen as a trade off for some groups, which is not the case for political rights. And even if economic rights are important, they are not more important than political rights, because the only way that you can achieve any form of utility is by being able to express your preferences in a political system, which only our sides provide. And at the end of the day, we provide the longest-term pathway to propositions benefits. With only proper political rights can groups form unions, lobby governments for economic policies, and so on. So I'll be moving on to my first"

              "text": "argument about the international exploitation. The premise of this argument is simple. Even as many colonial forces exited African states, many did so with unease, either believing their ousting was illegitimate or seeking to continue to reap the economic rewards of colonial exploitation. Thus, these powers looked for other ways to exert power or control, for example, through exploitative trade deals, resource projects, and so on. Our claim is that that would have been significantly easier for colonial powers to do this if African states did not prioritize political and civil rights in this period. Firstly, political and civil rights simply provide a mechanism to lobby domestic governments if citizens feel that international powers are exerting inappropriate influence. For example, to vote out a government that is in bed with a problematic Western company. Secondly, international powers can more easily justify intervening in African states when they perceive them to be quote-unquote broken or corrupt. This is less likely on our side when these states have a much healthier political system. The second proposition speaker told you that on their side, they'll have better trading relationships with countries like the US, countries like France, and that they'll be better partners. But we tell you that the reality is when you have a broken political system, these higher powers like the US and France can take advantage of that country and can exploit them further through exploitative trade deals. The impact of this argument is clear. We get less long-term international meddling in African states, allowing them to be more autonomous and not stuck in an exploitative relationship that is different to their past colonial rule. Moving on to my second argument, but before I do so I'll take your POI. When these countries like France have so much have so much investment in these colonial states, why would the government kick them out when it gets a lot of the money from their taxes okay international investment is based on so many factors it's based on resources it's based on borders it is hard to fully predict that if investment with that investment would have been stronger if those countries economies would have been stronger if i take your best case saying that your economic impacts will happen and as we've shown you powerful western countries may have further exploited african countries post-colonialism if they perceive them to be weak politically. Like with the example of South Africa, for example, when that political system was weak, that African state was subject to exploitative trade agreements through apartheid policies, for example. So when you have a weak political system, there is guarantee that you will be exploited by those same trading partners that you reap that you claim you reap benefits from our second argument about is about"

And to that, we have two very important responses. Firstly, we have pointed throughout the debate that corruption is symmetric, that if they are like if under their side of the house, politicians are corrupt, like if under our side of the house, politicians are corrupt. This means that also on their side of the house, the same politician is corrupt. The reason why your side is better is because, for example, if you're corrupt enough to make land distribution a little bit different, you will end up having a piece of land. Yes, maybe not the same with the elites, but end up having a piece of land yes maybe not the same with the elites but you will have a piece of land under your side of the house if you end up corrupting the election and it's rigged therefore your like rights to vote is meaningless because whatever it happened the very electorate process was corrupt under our side of the house you at least get some benefits but secondly and most importantly here let's take them at their very best and assume that somehow under our side of the house we have more corruption here's why more corruption still wins the debate because even if you're more corrupt under our side of the house and they give less rights like they give a lot less time to the people right they're giving them very very little little land or very, very little caste. We told you why even a very, very small piece of land is important to literally feed your child to the point that during the 60s, malnutrition was the cause of 45% of children dying in Africa. And on your side of the house, yes, you have, for example, less corrupt freedom of expression and you're able to have a more independent press but what's the point of that if the reason why you needed it in the first place was to demand the food that we're immediately giving them under our side of the house this is why in the end of the day even if we take them at the best what they never managed to respond is our argument about what these people what they need in the short term is the ability to eat is the ability to exercise the basic economic rights that they were deprived of and in reality this resulted to deaths of children that's a family that did not have access to a simple necessities as food but"

And to that, we have two different responses. Firstly, we think they're being a lot assertive here. We think that the major harm that was done during colonialism is that these people were not able to exercise the right of property, that in Nigeria, they were not able to take control of their oils, that in Congo, they were not able to take control of their diamonds. Not having a right to property means that you're not able to understand that you have a right towards the state. Meaning that even if you give these people the right to vote, these people don't have the sense of empowerment, don't have the sense that I have a right towards this property and this brings me this empowerment that I need. You're giving these people the right to vote in a world in which they don't even have like a right to property. But secondly, we also tell you that under their side of the house, civil rights do not end up materializing. This is because as we told you from the get-go, which they didn't respond to, you're giving them for example the right to vote in a way that the institutions themselves are not being established. This means that in their best-case scenario, these things end up materializing in the best case scenario, these things end up materializing in the very long term, taking away all the benefits that they bring about faith in the system. Because the point that the colonization has happened, and the first thing that you prioritize is this right, but the institutions are not there, these people do not see them as valuable. And in the long term, this results to them not being able to exercise them. And this is why a lot of states right now in Africa do not have a democracy, exactly because the people were not able to take advantage of these rights. But thirdly, they also tell us that rights are very important to minorities. Yes, we also think that for these minorities, what is really important is for them to eat, is to have food. And also, who are these minorities and the women that are so great and like they have gotten all these rights we think that they have been massively oppressed to the point that they did not have basic access to necessities and therefore if they were a lot were placed in a lot more difficult positions being forced in extreme conditions of work and hence being deprived of even more rights before i move on to my class about stability i'll take"

              "text": "So our first class is about corruption. They claim that corruption exists in both sides. This is not true. We tell you that economic distribution in certain states may have been susceptible to corruption or lobbying influence, especially where government institutions were more fragile. This looks like a group with more political power, such as former lobbying governments for a greater slice of the pie, or in the worst case scenario corrupt official investment parts of cash transfer this uh the comparison is is that is that is very difficult to hand out political and civil rights in a discriminatory way for example if you protect the right to protest you are most likely to do this for all groups in society they have clearly clearly and in real comparison, they keep comparing corruption on our side and corruption on their side. Investing some money doesn't have anything to do with corrupting an entire election. This is not sympathetic at all. Well, corruption on your side is most likely to happen because they are corrupting, taking land, having more cash, etc. But you are saying that it's the same as corrupting an entire election well this doesn't make any sense they say that in their world they have independence and citizens restore their autonomy do you think in a world where they don't have right to vote to speak to choose from themselves it's being independent having the land but no right to vote is exactly the opposite of independence their most our second main flash and their most important arguments later their our second clash and their most important argument was that post-colonial uh states suffered from extreme poverty and uh uh and that's in their world they have more people to defend and we have four responses to this although these claims are too vague and not true in in all cases as i imagine most people in post-colonial countries are all uh are all uh not fed well for responses to this is our side can support a basic welfare program that's how the most variable prop side has to be side has to specifically defend things like active land distribution quotas and cash transfer programs, which are not necessarily to get people out of poverty. Second, profs still has to explain how they achieve those things. We explain to you why those aims would have been impossible in many countries due to the fact that they are seen as straight up for some groups, which is not the case for political rights. Thirdly, even if economic rights are important, they are not more important than political rights. The only way you can access any form of utility is by being able to express your preferences in the political system, which only our side provides. And lastly, we provide the longest term pathway to profit benefits."

What happened is that these people were given a right to vote in the hope that they would manage to elect someone that would bring them food instead of literally giving them the right of property to cultivate and have food for themselves. Well, you are talking too vague because what I'm hearing is that these people, yeah, they are voting for people to protect them, to give them money to eat, to feed them. And we are not saying that all politicians aren't achieving that. Well, we are saying that by this right, not just to vote, right, express themselves and so on, they are protecting themselves and elected politicians are going to be able to develop the country. Well, later on, they are going to be able to develop the country well later on they are going to be able to also have more money and so on uh so they say the right to vote is meaningless and it's not important well we tell you that's the exact opposite without voting without having civil rights people will remain dehumanized and unheard vulnerable minorities like women and children will not have their voice heard on their side. How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need? Well, much better to choose who can do that than wait for someone who didn't choose to do that for you. Like, as you said, like people are choosing the person they want them to represent them. Well, in your side, they haven't even elected someone who is going to be a redistribution lamp. And as we are saying, you have provided no mechanism of who is going to... Is this person who is going to be a redistribution lamp is going to be elected by the population or is it going to be chosen by the elites who are going to benefit in them more than benefits the entire country? Well, they said that having economic influence will influence countries such as France. Are we going to have economic influence right after the colonial period by having land reparation is this your solution"

              "text": "responding to the main clashes in this debate and then I'll be doing some weighing. Firstly, on the clash of the likelihood of economic distribution being successful. They tell you that economic land reparations will be successful on their side, that they're going to save land, they're going to nationalize corporations, distribute the land, They're going to give people economic rights and help them on a day to day basis, give them the ability to be taxpayers and to be citizens that contribute to an active economy. But we tell you that in many cases, all of these impacts are very, very unlikely to happen and that it's downright impossible to successfully achieve economic and land reparations. We told you that land reparations are sometimes the worst case for many African states, because many quotas or cash transfers can be seen as contentious because of the perceived nature of. Because when you give voting rights to one group, you're not taking away the voting rights of another group, whereas it's necessarily the case with any form of economic redistribution. And we also tell you that in the long term, we think it's actually easier to achieve economic rights through stable political rights. For example, when you're able to freely form associations like unions, you can advocate for worker protections. When you're able to freely vote for a party that represents your interests, you can vote for the best economic policies. Proposition's world is one where at best we'd achieve some economic redistribution, but not prioritize a long-term mechanism to continue achieving economic benefits once those needs evolve in the future. I think the biggest thing that Proposition has not done in this debate has actually to characterize to you panel what their economic policies look like. What does it look like to have a cash transfer program? What does it look like to have land redistribution? They don't do that on their side and we tell you that only through unions, only through political systems, strong stable ones, can we have those economic policies in the long term. Now I'm going to be doing some weighing our arguments in this debate are the most important because firstly we help ensure the most prosperous long-term future for these nations only political rights can help governments in check and ensure that they do not backslide democratically which would undo all the gains made in getting rid of these colonial rulers secondly we tell you that we help protect the most vulnerable. While low-income individuals are indeed the most vulnerable, so many other groups are only protected by our side of the debate when they have the capacity to bring attention to the struggles that they are experiencing in the political system. We also tell you that we ensure the most political and economic rights on our on our side that is proposition side cannot meaningfully achieve political rights but our but our side can achieve economic rights in the long term once we have institutions in place to sustainably do so and finally we prioritize what the majority of citizens are likely to value the most which is a political system that helps them feel dignified and no longer dehumanized and for all these reasons i proudly stand for opposition thank you very much thank you and now for the final speech"

Starting with stability, notice that this is an independent clash and an independent benefit of the land given. This doesn't mean, and this doesn't mean for us to have a lot of land for each person but rather the fact that they now have some type of ownership. We have told you three main things. Firstly about pensions that we're less likely to have pensions when you have some ownership so you're less likely to have these deadly conflicts that we're telling you but secondly we're less likely to have these ethnic divisions that are deep under opposition, as we told you, that have even led to genocide. These mechanisms were not responded, but what we heard from opposition is that you can have conflict from land distribution because you're taking away someone's land and taking it to the other. This is why we told you about why this is important for it to happen in the beginning, where we are in a context of the changing situation, where we're changing regimes, where we're changing the international arena, especially when this decolonization happened around the same decade. This is why it needed to be prioritized in the beginning. And from their first, opposition has said that they would want to land the distribution at some point. They just think it should come from the people. If they agree that it should come at some point because of this reason that we told you it is only going to work if it happens prioritized in the beginning secondly in this clash we told you about how it is harder to take away these like ownership exactly because it's more tangible versus on the comparative it's much easier to change bad stuff to like even restrict a bit of freedom of press because it takes more time for you to realize this and why because of this means that it's more easy for our types of rights to actually succeed on happening this wasn't responded so it means that we are more likely to have this benefit which brings us to the impact of having less tensions and not having more people being able to feed themselves. But thirdly, on neocolonialism, they're saying that we don't respond when we have an entire argument on this that they only apparently responded to, and when we brought back in the POI our mechanism on why governments are less likely to listen to the people when they have these colonial powers, having all of this economic rights and control, and why this would change when you actually redistribute this economic control from the beginning and allow the people and the masses to have these rights to be able to make more decisions on their account so the impact of this clash is that we have more stability which allows for more economic development that is independent of former colonial powers and because of this class alone we can win this debate."

But firstly, we have told you again and again on why corruption still exists under the leadership of the house. But even they can have worse harm, right? Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution to actually distort like economic civil rights and be able to have worse harm, right? Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution to actually distort like economic civil rights and be able to have a dictatorship, when Kenyatta, the elected president, prohibits rivals from running, this doesn't allow for the rights to actually live at all. Whereas for us, if that means that they're limiting and giving less land to people, at least they get some land, at least they're able to be fed even a little. So we also told you why least they're able to be fed even a little so we also told you why they're more likely to be contained because of this accountability that was unresponded so this also helps us win this debate because even if we have more corruption at least under us it's less likely to affect the people for all of this please vote for prop thank you i'd like to thank the proposition reply speaker and like to thank everyone for a great debate."

              "text": "A few arguments come into the problem. The first is on why we benefit the economy, the second is on culture, and the third argument in the second speech is an argument around the environment. Before that, what's our stance? One, we aren't banning tourism, that's absurd. We're rather limiting the numbers in the industry. We believe that any industry can have economic benefit, but it is the duty of the state to regulate against unchecked growth in order to ensure that the possible harms don't outweigh the possible benefits. For clarity, we want tourism to not overshadow the carrying capacity that currently exists. What then does our model look like? Five things. A. It looks like establishing quarters, particularly during peak season. So for example, limiting the number of individuals that can access something like a tourist visa. It looks like how Greece's admins has put a cap to 20,000 individuals per day, down from historically with their number of 40,000. This significant reduction is going to be determined by states alongside relevant experts in the field. B. We're looking to impose restrictions on tourist-centered accommodation. So this looks like how Berlin has put a regulation on short-term rentals requiring a permit to be signed when you are apportioning the apartment in residential areas at a time. C. We're looking to also support the implementation of additional premiums for specific areas. So this looks like how Venice has an increased five-year fine for visiting Venice on day trips if individuals want to live in there. D. We're also willing to support all other reasonable initiatives to limit the number of tourists within these major destinations and also prevent the inflation impact that currently exists. Lastly, this cap would be determined from country to country basis, but it would be a cap determined on the basis of reducing the country's dependency on tourism. That's what the most important thing in this debate is. Second part of the strategy. We're willing to trade off the constant influx of money for tourism because of three reasons. One, government's responsibility to support local populations first and foremost because of social contracts. Hyper-tourism uniquely has a blanket form to its individuals, and most instances the money from tourism doesn't actually go to locals and we're the ones who put the silver back into it. But two, tourists are still able to visit on our side, we're not completely undergoing the economic benefit that exists, we're just maintaining a lack of sustainability. Third, access to tourism creates a dependency that forces governments to have pervasive interests. So the idea that the government of Brazil is now likely to not have an incentive to face your vendors because they have a reliance on slum tourism is something that they can never trade off on their side. Arguing then as to how we benefit the economy. Before I preach, I want to take a P.O.I. Arguing then as to why we benefit the economy. Before I preach the argument, let's take a P.O.I. Arguing that as to why we benefit the economy. The framing here is very simple. Unchanged tourism has led to harms to the domestic economy because oftentimes there is a prioritization around the needs and comforts of wealthy tourists over the poor population. Why then do we have more economy? Firstly, the allure of tourism is certainly that politicians often don't take the necessary means to regulating it until there's a critical tipping point, so private interest overshadows the domestic population's well-being. Air gain across the world has led to increased demand for short-term rentals, increasing the general cost of living in city centres, which leads to a real human cost, at the point at which pensioners and local individuals can't out-compete with tourists in terms of like on a many reasons. That means then, it should likely do harm to these individuals and increase the prices of food in that area. The minimum wage in Spain is a little over a thousand euros a week, but on average tourists in Madrid spend about a thousand euros. This leads to an enemy out-of-place and very veganization impact out of volume. Secondly, there's a seasonality around the world. So tourism centers are in peak seasons where markets pop up and there's accommodation that's putting tourists out. The seasonality is harmful because when tourism is allowed to grow unchecked, you create a dependency on the tourism. That means then that out of season there's no real economic benefit. This is especially important because even in the best case when they do provide jobs, those jobs are still on steam. Particularly pernicious in the instances when the government needs incentivised mass training. Because those are the types of things like hospitality training that are short-term in nature and they're very volatile. Third, the massive gains from tourism on their side just leak out of the country. Because MNCs are the largest corporations that have the ability to create large results on tourist destinations. 70% of all of the money tourists spend in Thailand ends up leaving their country. Because international allies don't benefit the local economy, local vendors often get bought out by MNCs looking to gentrify. The reason as to why MNCs and leakage are inherent to scale and are a hand to mass tourism is because they enable MNCs to gain more economies of scale, to keep prices low, and fundamentally is a greater likelihood of that happening on their side. But even if leakage exists on either side, it is far worse on their side, because more and more people come into these local communities, making those economic issues far worse. Especially important in all points is going to make any argument about developing world economies that are worse for the opinion that they're likely to be talking about. On our side, however, destinations in particular don't get overwhelmed. There's less inflation pressure on the poor and the middle class comparatively. One, locals are always going to outnumber tourists but they need to be able to live in cities that can have economic economy to help the broader economy grow. Two, on our side, states can invest into more long-term, durable economic opportunities because when tourism decreases, it's likely other industries can grow because there's more utility that's provided. Even if gentrification occurs on our side, it is still likely to be better because that gentrification is going to happen organically and not to be needed to have a lot of tourists. So you don't have MLCs pushing for rapid development and things like high-rise buildings. It's going to happen head-to-head to global. On their side eventually, the appeal of the novelties is going to be let off. The country is going to be let off. No other means is sublimating that value. Tourists are going to move on and the trade is going to be over, like we've seen in the Spanish islands. So that means then that you don't have the capacity for the country to build again. The impact of this argument is twofold. Firstly, we see this home existence in wealthy countries, and I think now regulation is an especially important empowerment for developing nations that are looking to become tourist hotspots. Cape Town, a city in South Africa, has the most ABM visa in the world because of pro-business government who want MNCs to buy up and construct new tourist accommodations, leading to a vast disfaces. Tourists just don't care because they don't have an attachment to their country, And even when they are aware of this, they prioritize their own comforts over the comforts of others. But second, there is a real human host to all of the things we are talking about. It is the mother who was laid off from her resort because that resort isn't making money. It is the young couple that cannot afford to start a family and build a home because homes are too expensive because of gentrification. That is the type of world that exists on the other side. Second argument then around culture, before I give this short. For nations like seashells, they have to do tours because no alternate economy has worked. What alternate economies would they comparatively shift to in your world? We gave you two structural reasons as to why these economies are likely to diversify and they're likely to have under industries grow. You need to actually engage with those. Argument number three. We improve cultural participation and social communication, and you like it and let industries grow, you need to actually engage with those. Arguing with the government will be important. We improve cultural participation and social communication, especially in the developing world, because there's an increasing demand for tourism there. It's taking the characteristics of the exploitative nature as opposed to being appreciative of that culture. There's a disrespect for culturally and spiritually significant areas. So for example in Peru, they had to limit the tourist numbers that existed in order to better ensure that those harms don't exist too much. In Greece, they had to literally arrest individuals because they were defacing things like the Coliseum and historically significant architecture. These are not isolated instances, but they're structurally true because tourists just don't have the same appreciation and they just don't have the same attachment. They're individuals who want to look cool and get an Instagram post of them. Currently, all across Europe, major tourist clubs are seeing an increased protest from individuals because individuals don't like these things. Spanish individuals are spitting in tourist drinks and telling them to leave their country. This is because institutions are set up to cater for tourist individuals, not necessarily the locals of their country. So complaints about drunk, water-drunk, or loud tourists just don't matter to the institutions. We solve these issues because comparatively, on our side, we have smaller numbers of tourists, that means then it's easier to regulate those individuals as opposed to in your side. This argument is especially important because if we better maintain the culture of the nation, it's likely individuals who do actually care about those things are going to visit that country. So we maintain tourism over a longer period of time. If they're going to argue about tourism in one of the five years, then our case is simply prior to theirs. What proposition? Because we make tourism work for locals again. Not international payment, not international businesses, not amenities, but for people who live to deal with high prices in large areas and their homes and homes."

Improving infrastructure and facilities.

              "text": "first argument on the economic development. And note that this argumentation will directly clash with their argument. The thesis of this argument is that tourism boosts the economy and creates jobs. There are two layers to this argument. Firstly, how does tourism stimulate the economy? There are four notes on how much money tourists spend which proves the stimulation that tourists bring. One, tourists uniquely want to spend money. This is because tourists inherently have a strong inclination to spend money during their travels, times of excitement and relaxation where they are prepared to indulge in various activities and experiences. 2. Tourists often come from countries with stronger currencies, meaning that their money has a greater purchasing power in destinations with weaker currencies. This difference enables them to afford more luxuries and experiences than they could at home, which leads to increased spending during their travels. 3. Travelling itself is inherently expensive. When tourists visit another country, their expenditures extend far beyond just airfare and accommodation and extend to public transportation, dining, souvenirs, entertainment and various services such as guided tours or taxis. Each of these expenditures contributes a substantial influx of money into the local economy. 4. And lastly, it creates spending on unique services. For instance, locals have homes and sublets so they don't use hotels as much. Locals cook home food so they don't regularly go to restaurants. Locals barely use taxis as they have cars and public transport. Locals don't consume souvenirs. Therefore, the implication is that the types of spending that tourists do is extremely unique and valuable. Before we move on to the second layer, I'll take a quick one. Speaker, you literally just said that individuals can use public transport, and then you say that they can use cars. Which one is it? Because they're both contradictory. We don't think it's contradictory, and it's very unclear what the implication of that, even if there is a contradiction."

              "text": "Second layer of this argument, how the proposition's comparative harms the economy. There are six main impacts. One, job loss. Intuitively speaking, this economic failure will lead to massive job loss for people in the service sector and tourism sectors, unlike they claim. These are jobs that are very accessible to low skilled workers. These are workers with very few transferable skills, no education, and no experience, which means it's incredibly hard to find a new industry to house all of these unemployed workers. Furthermore, when an entire city is suddenly unemployed, it also means more crime happens. It means there are no longer support networks for the unemployed. Job loss is a massive impact here. Two, Promotion of service work. The types of jobs created by the tourism industry are often more favorable compared to alternatives in many developing countries, while manufacturing jobs, which many developing countries rely on, oftentimes involve roles are far less physically taxing. These service sector jobs are much more desirable because these positions offer a better work environment and greater job satisfaction. Three, Loss in government resources. The immediate effect is a substantial loss in tax revenue, which typically comes from both tourism-related jobs and the expenditures of tourists themselves. Governments also oftentimes have to take a lot of debt to cover welfare expenses for the unemployed and incur additional debt to sustain social services and economic stability. For many nations, tourism constitutes a considerable segment of their economy, thus replacing this lost economic activity as a task that leads to prolonged periods of financial instability and economic decline. But fourthly, there will be less foreign direct investment, or FDI, meaning less corporations come in. Firstly, the immediate short-term losses from a curtailed tourism sector make it less profitable and riskier for investors to allocate capital to the affected country due to the anticipated return on investment diminishing as the tourism industry revenue stream dries up. Secondly, the signaling effect of such a drastic policy shift creates broader concerns about the country's investment climate. By effectively declaring war on its largest industry after years and years of promotion and support, the government signals unpredictability and potential hostility towards other sectors. This erodes investor confidence as we fear that similar abrupt and detrimental policy changes might impact their ventures in other industries, ultimately leading to a reduction in FDI. Fifth, losing foreign currency. Tourists bring in foreign currency that supports the local economy and exchange rate. Therefore, without this, the country faces a deficit, weakening its currency. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive, causing inflation and reducing purchasing power. This can lead to a cycle of declining investor confidence and further economic problems, causing this vicious cycle. Sixth, and finally, this also leads to bankruptcy. Tourism businesses often invest heavily in real estate, infrastructure, and services, expecting steady revenue. Therefore, when tourism stops, they can go bankrupt, leading to job losses and long-term debt struggles. These bankruptcies affect banks, causing significant losses and tighter credit, which slows economic growth. Therefore, the implication of all of these six mechanisms is simple. This economy is massively impoverished when tourism is significantly limited. Significant restriction on tourism is significant restriction on the economy. For all these reasons, I'm very proud to oppose."

The first thing is that all regions of the city have the biggest tourist destinations. What you're doing is competing for centrality. That's nightlife, that's access to amenities, that's the things that individuals and tourists are directly in opposition for because they want to experience those amenities and the centrality of the city, which means there's a direct competition that they can't engage with on their side. But secondly, note the inherent difficulty on policing large crowds and the disincentive there is to do so, because tourists are going to like your area less when they feel like it's a police state, when they feel like they're being actively cracked down on, which means unless you have small crowds that you can regulate using smaller security services, you aren't able to regulate the larger crowds on their side because it detracts from that ambience. But lastly, on the behaviour of individuals. We note firstly that tourism creates an environment where people feel like social norms are suspended. We're in a place to have fun, we're going to do that at all costs. But secondly, on the capacity to spend, they talked about currency disparities. That's directly worsen on their side because people are able to absorb larger fines and are psychologically inclined to do so because they come in with the intention of spending money. That then frames a direct incentive to pivot away from over-tourism that exists under status quo, but also shows you why our mechanism is uniquely beneficial"

Here we just think they don't engage with what exists under status quo, where tourism creates a direct incentive to lock yourself into particular markets. And here is where we talk about the fact that tourism is effectively seen by governments as a free source of money. It's like something that's based on the natural features and requires minimal investment when it comes to the development of regions. Note then that policies that rely on developing areas within your nations are disbeneficial to states in two regards. Firstly, they require more active investment because of that development, but secondly, there's a sacrifice that needs to be done. So if you have to run, for instance, protectionist measures to protect a nascent industry, that's something that's going to cost you trade deals, that's something that requires political inertia in order to happen. That then creates an incentive or a structure where states are able to lean on tourism over more because it doesn't require political sacrifices in order to get off the ground."

That's something that's directly disbeneficial, and's something that can be fixed easily because we have the GDP reserve to just not rely on tourism. In developing nations you create the direct incentive to lean on tourism as a mechanism and you allow for regulation not to take place. Those are two different harms that you create and you need to engage with them respectively. On the idea then that you create harms to the environment. The framing here is that we have an increase in environmental tourism under status quo. These are regions that carry appeal because of their aesthetics. These are regions that are also uniquely fragile because ecosystems are dependent on balance. Note how this is harmed in three ways on their side. The first way is the increase demand for accommodation and luxury. This means the construction of tourist regions. What that means is tourism expands in popularity and companies work on increasingly more extravagant and resource-intensive projects in an attempt to corner the markets. This looks like the Guaypoh Islands in Dubai that required a massive amount of sand to be pulled in order to build them and destroy reef infrastructure in the process. That means that those ecosystems are irreparably damaged and can't be maintained. But secondly, note that tourist presence creates pollution and environmental harm. That's firstly in terms of resource use. So there's massive resource-intensive hotels that are going to divert resources away from locals. Dubai literally couldn't fight its wildfires because it didn't have the water that water was being diverted to the hotels in the region. But secondly, on waste products. Note that tourism are uniquely dependent on single-use plastics because they want to vent in the region for a long time. You're eating out more, you're going to create more waste products in that regard. Based on all of that then, they fail to benefit the individuals who live within particular nations and we get that benefit, never been prior to a proposed."

They have two burdens to fulfill in the comparative that go unfulfilled at this point in this debate. Firstly, they still have to prove to you that alternatives to some extent do exist. That the asserting POI response that, oh, alternatives probably do exist, cannot prove to you that that is true. In the Maldives, the reason why the nation is relying upon tourism is because no other industry adequately can replace the economic impact that that has. In Seychelles, the reason why the economy is 40% dependent on tourism is because nothing can replace that GDP impact. Therefore, they still have to prove to you alternatives do exist. But secondly, they then have to prove to you that these alternatives are in any way better because their homes are not in any way unique to tourism. Look at, for example, their claim about diversification or higher cost of living. That claim is basically going to be symmetric in every other alternative you can bring. Let's say you shift to manufacturing. Let's say you have car companies come in and build infrastructure in your country and hire people in your country. These car companies are going to bring in hundreds of foreign workers with them who are similarly going to push the economy into overdrive and are similarly going to increase the cost of living. The problem is not unique to tourism. But I also want to look at each of the mechanizations. The first mechanization is on cost of living. I have two levels of response against this at the top. One, that we frame from our second piece on frame that is unengaged by their speaker to say that, well, oftentimes the tourist areas are very far apart, or at the very least in different areas from where the locals live. And governments do have incentive to structure economies, to structure societies this way, which is why in Amsterdam there's a tourist district and then there's a locality district where the cost of living is a lot lower. But secondly, I don't believe that the cost of living going up is just unique to the cost of living going up. But rather, things like eats, things like salaries and infrastructure go up with it, which means we can match the pace of inflation with the salaries. But finally, I want to weigh our argumentation on things like vulnerable jobs and the general economy as a whole above this cost of living claim in four crucial ways. Number one, that having a job and being employed is the prerequisite for you even caring about cost of living. If you have no income, the damage of cost of living is highest for you. Secondly, that high cost of living has some amount of solvency. You are helpless in getting an income out of strats as an unemployed individual, but there are many ways to do things like cut expenses or just move to another area. Thirdly, high cost of living largely only applies to more rich individuals. The price increases in this debate impacts luxury goods and not everyday goods. It's restaurants, not grocery stores, that are impacted. It's hotels in the city structure, not rent in the outskirts. It's the cost of living that disproportionately only impacts tourists or those who are rich. The unemployment disproportionately impacts the poor. That is the impact we all care about. But fourthly, that the state has some amount of more moral obligation to these individuals than they do to them. Because the state is actively at fault for the reliance of these workers that they have on the tourist industry. Not only did they allow for it, but they did not create good alternatives, and for years actively encouraged tourism and tourist jobs. And now they're stabbing them in the back."

              "text": "Secondly, let's talk about their seasonality claim. Two responses. Number one, this is structurally untreatable. Off-season vacationing is incredibly common. It's cheaper, it's less crowded, a lot of people do that. But on the flip, furthermore, we're willing to strongly encourage such policy where we encourage off-season touristing. From our frame, we tell you this is a viable alternative. The second response I want to make is that the seasonal analogy claim is highly uncomparative because at worst we have a season of prosperity and a season of stagnation and therefore they have constant stagnation. Their third claim is that these massive gains leak out through multinational corporations. We've provided to you various mechanizations from our argument. We have six of them, none of which are heavily reliant upon MNCs being willing to trickle down the economy. For example, our second mechanism, our second impact was on the shift to service industries. This means that even if these corporations suck up all of the money, the fact that the economy shifts in that direction in and of itself is a benefit and in that way trickle-down still does happen. Let's talk about our argumentation. Our argumentation gave you six reasons, six impacts why this economic benefit to tourism brings is uniquely and massively important. The proposition fails to heavily engage to any of these mechanizations. I think that this alone is debatable, but especially on vulnerable jobs. I think that one does this debate. Let's talk about culture then. The claim of culture is basically tourist disrespect culture. I have two layers of engagement to this. Number one, that cultural importance for locals or indigenous people can still be protected in our world. We can literally do things like subsidize these areas. For example, the U.S. natural reserves do give communal ownership to indigenous peoples to allow them access to that. But secondly, that touristy cultural sites and important cultural sites are oftentimes massively different. For example, in India, people are obsessed with beautiful mosques, but the actual mosques that are regularly visited are ones that are further away, far less used, and far less touristy. The second level of response is to say, well, all of this due and disrespect for cultural sites can heavily be mitigated by forms of regulation. This is not just policing coming in. This is also, for example, people who are visiting the site alongside you, telling you you should actually take off your shoes when you walk into a Japanese temple. Now, proposition gives you various reasons why this is probably true. They say things like competition or how you cannot police this or individual behavior. There's two levels of engagement here. Firstly, on the level of incentive, I think states have massive incentive to do this. Yeah, sure, being seen as a police state is probably not that much of a good thing, but being seen as a dysfunctional state is far worse of a harm. Also, you have some amount of incentive to cater to your voters who hold you accountable, which means you do have to care about your citizen population. The second level of response, on the level of capacity, it's actually fairly easy to regulate this. Just find people more, or just get more people, just get more police, or in the case of slum tourism, just ban things like gambling. I don't think it's that hard, I think we've proven capacity."

              "text": "I want to run an extending argument in my last minute then, on liberalization. There are three reasons why liberalization happens when tourism is massive. Number one, a large influx of tourists puts a big and immediate pressure to relax urgent policies that are oppressive and conservative. Because when governments continue to get massive revenue from the tourist industry, they have to maintain this positive image and avoid international backlash. Look at Qatar. Secondly, active tourism necessitates easing of restrictive laws and implementation of consistent policies as authorities face challenges in selectively enforcing regulations on tourists. Initially, authorities may try to say, well, tourists, you don't have to follow these laws, but at some point, the influx of tourists is going to be too much, governments will have to make liberal black-ed policies. Thirdly, on normalization, when tourists openly engage in behaviors that are restricted or stigmatized, such as same-sex relationships or liberal dress codes, it gradually normalizes these behaviors, and all of this leads to softened local prejudices and inclusive policies. This looks like, for example, Saudi Arabia's introduction of tourist visas being accompanied by social reforms like women being allowed to travel without male gardens. This looks like Bangkok, which is a renowned destination for LGBTQ tourists, where it could have never have evolved in this way if it weren't for tourism. This is important not only because it benefits the larger society in forms of freedoms but also for the most vulnerable minorities, LGBTQ individuals, women who suffer in conservative societies. Liberalization is massively important for the tourists, for the economy, for the vulnerable"

              "text": "Firstly, on the context between developing nations versus developed nations. Let's assume that this case takes place in the world of the opposition, where we specifically look at developing nations. Why exactly do we think that this is bad? We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the opposition, where we specifically look at development in Singapore. Why exactly do we think that this is bad? We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the shocks that they are likely going to be facing on their side. Two reasons why that's the case. The first is because the majority of the benefit that they get on their side is likely going to be seasonal. That is to say that you only get a minimal income in the season in which tourism is most likely going to be affected. In the cases in which they want to derive the off-season benefit. We don't think that the majority of people visit the majority of these countries in off-seasons, mainly because of the fact that the conditions that allow them to go there aren't necessarily there. So they cannot enjoy natural beauty because of extreme weather. They cannot enjoy the things that they currently claim are going to be true in that regard. But second, in the case of natural disasters, things like COVID and all of those things, they have to accept the fact that the majority of the economy under their world is likely going to be stopping. This means that a majority of the income that you will be having in that regard is going to be taken away. But furthermore, that means more economic adversity for these countries. You say shells and the mountains suffered during COVID, mainly because the fact that their main source of income wasn't protected. That means on their side, they're most likely going to have far worse incentives and far worse impacts for these countries in the first place. On the comparative, why exactly are we there? On our side, we can have multiple avenues of growth that we can utilize for economic stability, things like retail stores and things like having to train individuals in order to ensure economic growth."

But here's the thing, they need to prove a whole lot more in order to ensure that this is going to be true. Because let's just dissect the logic. If they say that tourists have so much money that they're willing to be spending on these very same countries, they're most likely going to be spending it on that regulation, and they're still going to be getting away with the majority of the problems that exist within those countries. So if it is that they're littering, they're going to be paying those fines what they're. They don't actually provide a mechanism towards which they can actually regulate the majority of these problems that exist within their world in the first place."

              "text": "First class then, on the economy. Here, I want to deal with the three key points that they give us. They firstly tell us that tourists spend a lot of money and that benefits the majority of these countries. Secondly, they tell us on their side that on our side we're going to have a lot of like job losses. But lastly, they tell us that you can have like government resources and like diminishing inishing on our core. First point, on the idea that tourists spend much more money on theirs. Two reasons why this is bad. First, because foreign currency tends to harm the locals and their ability to actually participate in the economy. That is to say that the nature of foreign currency is often inflammatory in nature. That is to say that they inflate prices and like increase and decrease competition. That's to say there's a higher bonding power that is given specifically to tourists that is taken away from locals. So that's to say that an Airbnb for a tourist might have been a home for a local and that means that they don't actually get that benefit under their will. But certainly a majority of tourists don't invest specifically into public transport and public services as they claim. This is because of the fact that in tourism, you've had multiple alternatives that have been given in order to ensure profit. That's why Airbnbs have been available as opposed to hotels specifically. This means that on their side, they don't actually get that benefit going specifically to the government, but rather to companies that exist in order to exacerbate tourism under their vault. That kind of incentive quite literally takes away the economic benefit they might have been getting in the first place. The second thing that they tell us is that we're most likely going to have a lot of job loss on our own. Why exactly do we still have the capacity to have jobs on our own? There are two distinct reasons, and this also deals with the capacity to have alternative avenues of income. Why? Because there is a large scale of natural resources that can exist and can be utilized for specific benefits. So for example, the Seychelles invested in fisheries when they realized that tourism wasn't working out for them. That meant that you can unlock a labor capacity that doesn't actually provide or doesn't actually depend on tourism in the first place. Second, on Earth, you have a massive labour pool that can be unlocked through vocational training. This is important because almost every developing nation has prioritised this because of the fact that they realise that this massive labour pool is something that is likely going to be much more effective under our law. No, thank you. Second, I'm going to ask you a question on why exactly they themselves don't have jobs. One, because of the fact that diminishing returns decrease the capacity for you to have a job in the first place. That is to say that companies, specifically tourist agencies, tend to outsource jobs to alternative needs and to alternative individuals apart from locals. This is because of the fact that they have the opportunity to cut costs, but furthermore, they have the opportunity to exploit individuals under their own. But secondly, there's a whole lot more competition under their own. That is to say that the tourism sector, if it is that they claim, is such low skill, that means that you're most probably going to have a lot of individuals competing for those very same industries. 60 million people live in South Africa, yet only 5,000 of them are employed by Airbnb. That very same gap leads to more people being unemployed under their world. They have to deal with this problem specifically."

So cities like Hanoi, quite literally had about 50 McDonald's and 50 Starbucks in every single corner that you turn. So majority of the benefits don't go to local industries, but rather go to huge MNCs that exist like they want. But second, FDI comes specifically through things like trade of resources. You get that when you look at various other industries, as opposed to tourism, who already gave you the fact that you have a large number of resources that exist under our wall that can be unlocked. So that very same benefit isn't exclusive to their wall. Before I move into the second class then, sure, I'll take it."

What? The majority of these countries literally used tourism as a front for their own abuses. Qatar literally used slavery as a means to hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022. They cannot claim that this is a benefit that is normal, mainly because of the fact that this is something that allows for these governments to continue exploiting individuals. Post the FIFA World Cup, Qatar remained the same, similar with Russia in 2018. But second, if these governments are so oppressive, they can survive without those tourists in the first place. They don't provide a unique mechanism as to why exactly tourism means that these countries automatically change the majority of the incentives. If they're oppressive, they don't care about alternative actors. That's why sanctions in majority cases didn't work in those countries. By the end of this debate, two things are true. The first is that over-tourism and the benefits of over-tourism are things that they haven't proven and that they won't specifically.

We tell you that the LGBTQ couples being able to get accepted in the public, or the increase in solo female travelers prompted in India as a result of this kind of like tourism and over tourism and the pressure towards the government uniquely exists in all sides of the house because liberalization is only going to happen when the government is pressured by the international like people that have liberal values. Why is this likely to be a hidden point? Obviously this is because they do need to bite the bullet on their side of the house and say that the defense and significant limitation and see that the substantial decrease in the number of visitors will exist. Which means that this substantial number of people pressuring the government to act is incredibly important because there is also a higher countervailing incentive to want to keep these traditional ideas. Older generations would always want to justify that homosexuality. It's the same. People would always want to say that marriage should only be decided by men. This is why when 40 million people actually swerve into the government only when the government is dependent on the tourism industry, only when the government needs those tourists and industry to actually gain those kind of things to begin with, that is at the point in which liberalization will actually want to happen which is why at this point in time they're losing already. The weighing of this argument is really simple because the severity of the harm of this argument is extreme. Because note, things like environmental degradation and things like, let's say, like, I don't know, economy, I think, for example, environment presumably exists to an extent on either side of the house when we talk about degradation.

Firstly, I want to look at the strategy of the proposition team in this debate, because what they're saying is that tourism sucks in the abstract, but for the most tourism-reliant countries, like say, Shell or Maldives, Maldives for example, I think this industry did play an important role to begin with, and I think their side of the house saying how these amenities are exploitative to begin with does not distract from the fact that Maldives, like 80% of the countries, are in fact dependent on the economy of the tourism industry and that they need those industries for them to operate to begin with. Secondly, let's talk about the context of this debate. They think that the tourism in this debate most likely takes place in developed countries. They give you three structural reasons for this. Firstly, this is not true, especially in Turkey, Ireland and Seychelles, Macau, Jamaica, all intuitively does have a tourism industry. Second of all, the structural reason why our claim is more true is that those kind of tourism industry oftentimes don't require industrialization to begin with. Those things like historical monuments, or things like the nature that you have that actually appeal against tourism, like tourists to begin with, those things are things that are uniquely have without the industrialization to begin with, which is why I think developing countries are going to be the context of this debate as well. Their attempt to out-frame their developing country and say that developed countries is the context of this debate is also terribly unstrategic for them insofar as diversification and things like that already exist in the United States of America. But even if the context of developed countries is more likely, our claim stands true and we are willing to weigh this argument over theirs insofar as this is the most likely delta in the debate insofar as Maldives and those countries are inherently reliant on those tourism industries. Therefore, the biggest burden that they needed to prove in this debate is why these vulnerable nations have the capacity to transition into a diversified economy. But here's when it gets very damaging for them because they prove in the absence of the tourism industry that other industries will arise, but they do not prove why the diversification is likely to happen. This is important, because a lot of the developing countries have other industries, but those industries are one of cultural economy."

              "text": "So we cannot magically solve the problem. The point is, in the comparative, in the absence of tourism, countries like Maldives, countries like South Shelf are going to suffer the most. First class on job losses. This stands both in the context of developing countries and developed countries. The first thing they see is that we need to actually do things like vocational training. Obviously, yes, but this can only be done on our side of the house, when we can actually have a substantial income and actually have a substantial influx of money. When we can tell you three mechanisms as to why those countries and those tourists are likely to spend money when foreign currencies are actually to come. That is at the point in which we can actually do vocational training more on our side of the house. The government has an incentive to do this because they want voters and they want appealed voters to begin with. The second thing they see is that it doesn't trickle down to the bottom of the people and the local individuals to respond to fear. Firstly, no, it does trickle down. It happens. I think our first argument already proves this. But secondly, I think this is uncomparative to begin with because all of the foreign direct investment problems that they have identified symmetrically exist in either side of the house. It's unclear to me whether they were listening to Seiji's speech. And I think Seiji gives you four main mechanisms as to why this job loss is the most important argument in the debate, especially when compared to their argument on the Boston thing like cost of living, which is why I think this still is our path to victory. Finally, let's talk about the economic development. Our claim in this debate was really simple, that this economic failure will lead to massive job loss for people in the service sector and tourism sector. Numerically, the number of people decreasing from 40 million to 10 million, this means that given that the number of customers drastically falls, big companies have to lower the salaries of their workers and they have to lay off individuals who are working at the bottom of their corporate ladder. That is the people that they need to defend and anticipate. The first thing they see is that other countries will develop and other industries will develop and diversify. Firstly, let's say again, USAID is out of the debate, but secondly, they don't have methods to compete with other developed countries for things like industrialization hasn't still happened, but secondly, I think tourism is much more unique because I think historical monuments and things like that does not require you to have machines. The second thing they say is that, oh, this is short-term and it's really uncreditable to begin with. I have like two responses to begin with. Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons, for example, for two reasons. I have two responses to begin with. Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons for two reasons. One, because I think there are different allures and attractions in different seasons to begin with. But secondly, when it's like let's say Hawaii for example, I think people would want to go to let's say winter because if relatively less people go to winter, you can actually go to different places at the same time, which is why I think their claim is not standing. But even if it is short-term, it is unpredictable. I think one thing that they have yet to prove in this debate is the comparative, because yes, it might be unpredictable, but they never proved why their comparative industry is better, which is why I think just because saying that these individuals were harmed in the COVID-19 crisis is not going to be enough for them. The way in here is simple. The reason why I think this beach out their claim against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is not going to be enough for them. The reign here is simple. The reason why I think this beat out there clean up against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is not a harm, right? If we say that things like salaries are going to rise as a result of it, I think they are able to actually cope against the cost of living, which is why I think the most vulnerable context of this debate, countries like Moldova, countries like Seychelles are going to win us the debate. For all those reasons, teams of countries exist to debate."

The two claims I want to note is firstly, that the money leaks out through MNCs. To some extent, this is true. We have to accept that. The problem with this is twofold. One, that we've given you mechanization to prove to you that trickle-down in some way does exist. And secondly, that this is an uncomparative claim, that any other MNC that comes into the country in their world, in any other industry, is still going to lead to the leaking out of the economy. Let's also talk about their claim on the over-reliance. Yes, we are to some extent over-reliant, but this is again an intensely uncomparative claim when their comparative is to shift the economy into another industry and to just be as over-reliant on that. And yes, tourism industry was massively harmed by COVID, but so was every other industry."

              "text": "With that said then, I want to talk about two far more important sub-clashes. First, on jobs. Are there jobs in our world? They say two reasons why this is untrue. From our first speaker, we flip all of this. We tell you that things like service industries, training, vocational training, state support can only exist in our world where the tourist industry is in some way successful. Therefore, there are jobs in our world. On the comparative then, are jobs going to exist in proposition? We say no, and the response to just do vocational training isn't a valid alternative when the poorest individuals who are only employed in our world are absolutely messed up because they can't access vocational training in their world. And secondly, it's unclear what money they're doing this vocational training with when Seychelles is incredibly poor. This means that this argumentation, which I weighed for four mechanisms from my speech alone, can run as this debate. This is more important than any other claim. Let's also talk about this claim on displacement. We outframed and outweighed this argumentation for a second. I don't think it stands and the web didn't bother extending. Finally, and thirdly, on seasonality, we proved to you that this is not only untrue but also comparatively better in our world, but it's also wrong here why this is so especially bad. Like ski resorts earn all of their money in the winter and have enough money there to carry them through the next year. This means that seasonality is not an inherent harm, they have to prove to you it's harmful."

We told you why countries use tourism as a front to pretend as if they're liberalising and then do things like use slavery, the Kafkala system, to build up the systems that enabled that tourism in the first place. And we also told you why these countries are uniquely not dependent or leaning on the public perceptions of individuals in the West to survive. So if Saudi Arabia is perceived to be a police state, generally we don't think the opinions of Western tourists are things that largely shifted in that regard, but we think secondly that those opinions were easily manipulated. That's engagement we gave you, that's engagement that's unresponded to. And so their alternate path to victory is out of this debate"

              "text": "quickly off the top of the speech. Three things then. Firstly, on context. Secondly, on the economy. And lastly, on the preservation of culture. Contextually speaking, we already told you why developed nations are important in this debate. They aren't dependent on tourism, and so the limitation when it comes to the populace generally is something that is marginal. And note then that the focus of people in the nation is something that is uniquely overshadowed by headline economic figures in the state. So the mayor of Paris, for instance, accepts broadly that things at the Olympics are going to happen, while not listening to the outcries of the populations that have to deal with those Western tourists on a day-to-day basis. But also, their point on this being empirically untrue just disregards the way the world functions. We told you why the tourists who have the money are more likely to flood into countries they're more capable or comfortable in, but we also told you why this is something that's uniquely impacted within these states. And so all of our analysis on the majority context in this round is something that still stands. But secondly, don't their assumption that tourism just ceases to exist, demand still exists, that the demand side is still pretty high on our side and we're just regulating the influx of tourists within a nation, we have yet to prove why this is so disastrous when it comes to the individuals themselves. So at this point then, understand that the majority context is one on our side and the individual clashes will take out the externalities. On the first conversation, on the economy and the harming of people in those nations, we told you two things. The first thing is that you compete with tourists for resources. And note that this is something that's supported by every bit of analysis they give you on tourist spending power. These people are inherently short-termists, they're able to spend your monthly wage in a week and that's what they come there to do. What is their response? The extent of their response is just tourists have different places that they're competing with individuals with. So it's not a direct competition, but largely the harms occur in different places. We gave you two responses. Firstly, on centrality, that is, you as a tourist want to be in the centre of a city where the economic activity is, where it's bustling, where the nightlife is accessible. The same center that individuals who have jobs want to be accessing as well. That creates direct competition that can't be regulated out. But secondly, note the impact of the increasing cost of land on our side. Because that doesn't just isolate one area, it isolates the majority of instances where that land is going to increase in cost. When Airbnb buys out a massive amount of properties, there's less properties for you to have your supermarket on, increasing your cost and ability to provide for locals. But secondly, they told you the creation of jobs is something that occurs. But we told you that you uniquely lock out alternative economies from developing. You lack development of other economies because of the lack of incentives they have. They don't have the necessity to generate alternative economies and they're going to ignore those economies as a result. Thailand ignores its manufacturing, nascent manufacturing center because of the tourist income it generates. And as a result then, we also told you that tourism is uniquely unstable because it's the first thing to go when a shock like COVID-19 happens. So sure, things are able to decrease when it comes to bad economic circumstances, but tourism is uniquely unstable in that regard. Two deadlock breakers. One, interest develops or decreases in the long term. So like Spanish islands, for instance, had less attention on them, and that's something that means the money is less long-term. But secondly, the investment in rebuilding the farms you create, like rebuilding shores from those like construction, is something that's bad. So that money doesn't even get funneled down. Secondly, on cultural preservation, we told you there are regulations that are panacea, and you can't regulate tourist behaviour as effectively. Note then that we win on this debate for the people who live in these countries that we've been proud to propose."

The first note is that we would wean countries off tourism. This would not happen immediately. This would be a gradual process. If someone wants to go to a major tourist destination, they apply for a permit a year in advance. These permits are limited in number. 50% of them are done based on a random lottery system. The other 50% are done based on auctions with the money going straight to the government to spend on things like conservation and job transitions. People are obviously willing to pay a lot of money because destinations are very much in demand. These are enforced by accommodation checking your destination permit, like how they ask for passport to check in. There will be heavy fines, revocation of licence and so on. This will be well enforced. People who miss out on this permit, no thank you, at peak times can apply for permits in non-peak times, spreading out tourism over the year. Every government already identifies who tourists are when they are allocating visas. For the sake of the debate, this is not people who are conducting businesses, visiting family or studying in a country that has different visa classes."

The environment and culture of major tourist destinations is exploited to a point of breaking. One, because many tourists are irresponsible or have malicious intentions. They might be on a stag trip with the lads. They might be taking the experience for granted. This is like littering. This is like graffiti that looks like ignoring local laws and regulations. This is much less likely on our side because they're either very lucky or have spent a lot of money. No, thank you. They're more interested in their destination and therefore they are more likely to respect their destination. Even on their side when tourists are well-intentioned, they still cause harms because of their presence. There's things like environmental degradation from walking over a path too often, poor sanitation, pollution from flights and cruises. This simply happens because a large number of people are in a place that is not designed for them. Some of the world's best surfing beaches have been made unsurfable because of the construction of ocean-side property that impact wave breaks. Now, also, tourists must live somewhere, eat somewhere, do something with their days. This means we have to build airports, hotels and so on. These are built on forested land or local communities, not on empty land. This impacts the environment and locals. Now, onto how tourism"

              "text": "impacts local culture. No, thank you. So culture is exploited as well as the environment because tourists fill places like churches, which means that locals who actually want to worship there cannot fit in. You know, they have to get tickets and so on. Even if they can access it, they have a private ability to enjoy them spiritually because they're covered in graffiti, they're full of people, as I told you. Even if they can access it, there is pressure to bastardise local culture, turning it into a commercial, unsellable product for tourists. For example, in Hawaii, luau celebrations have traditionally been reserved for very important occasions, like the birth of a child, like victory in a war. But now, multiple are thrown per night as an exotically branded party, aimed at tourists with sexualised waitresses. This is extremely degrading for a local whose culture is being turned into a product. This happens everywhere. Japanese kimonos being turned into a vessel to get extra tips. Traditional healing practices like massage being fetishised and serving as an entrance into sex tourism. This is incredibly harmful. Why should you weigh this? Firstly, on the environment and built culture, you must remember that people go to incredibly beautiful places, places that are incredibly important to humanity, the Great Barrier Reef, the Vatican, and so on. We have an obligation to future generations to protect these incredibly important places by not completely degrading them. Opposition harms them significantly. No, thank you. On culture, these are places with historic and important and ongoing culture, particularly to Indigenous people. Opposition is essentially resurrecting colonialisation as they allow large numbers of foreigners to come in and exploit culture and land for a fun summer abroad. I'll take a point for a move on my next substantive. If you are promising to take vandalism and graffiti, you might have to place regulations that could be used at some point. Firstly, there are far too many tourists to place regulation. We see in the status quo that vandalism already happens because there are simply too many tourists to effectively replace. Since we have less tourists, the police resources are stretched less thin. We get better management of graffiti. And secondly, even if you known by that, there is still harm by tourists physically being there, even if they're well-intentioned, as I told you, you still get those harms."

I'm going to explain why that's not the case, why it's actually harmful. So, firstly, on the actual scale of benefits that tourism brings to a local country. Many foreign tourists prefer to stay at Western-style hotels, you know, go to Western-style resorts and theme parks, no thank you, because they feel safe there, because they feel accommodated there, you know, they trust the food and so on. These institutions are run by large multinational companies like the Crown Prize of West Anglia, which is run by IHG, an international company, and these companies are based offshore offshore they're headquartered offshore they uh you know know how to exploit tax loopholes therefore in general the largest amount of money does not go to the local country no thank you the comparative is our auction system where the money goes straight to the local government there's likely to be a very large benefit so we get a good amount of money on our side secondly on housing crisis so as more workers are required to fill jobs in tourist areas they move into these big cities and they push locals out. Also, as tourists with more money are able to move into these areas, they pay more for things like Airbnbs, which pushes locals out. It becomes virtually impossible to find a place to live as an ordinary person living in these cities. They're forced out of the city, they're forced into homelessness in places like Barcelona, Byron Bay and Brighton. Next, inflation. Wealthy tourists with lots of money to spend and desire to spend it are willing to pay far more than locals for basic things like medicine, food and groceries and so on. This causes local businesses to push up the prices to match which makes it much harder to live and it outstrips the growth in wages caused by increased"

              "text": "go to businesses because of advertising. They're only there for a week, they've never been to the place, and they're likely never going to go back to, for instance, a restaurant. So the incentive is for this restaurant to advertise really well and not spend so much money on services and the actual quality of food, since tourists have already been there. This means locals get worse services overall, since they're not designed for repeat customers, they're designed for one-off customers. Now, on to the biggest economic harm, which is economic dependency. I'll take the point first, though. If you're honest that locals are worse off because of inflation, this is not true, because local services are given separately, and tourists are given separate packages that they need to purchase, vice is how you're sensitive about that. Again, broadly, this isn't true. Tourists obviously have to share things like the metro system to get around. When we were in Paris, we used the local metro system. There simply aren't alternatives to tourists. But also to the extent that the government is likely to spend more money on these services at the cost of things designed for locals, since tourists, as I told you, can pay more. So the government's incentive is to cater for them, not for locals. Now, onto the key economic impact, which is economic dependency. This is what happens when 30% of your economy is reliant on tourism. So, firstly, your economy is far more vulnerable to shocks outside of your control that impact the number of tourists significantly. This is things like terrorist attacks, things like global pandemics, things like changing international relations, even just... No, thank you. The changing social pressures of where to go, what is popular on Instagram. This means that you can't control the number of tourists you get, this is a large economic shock. This is also true every single year, it's the seasonality of tourism. You know, people go in the summer, people go when they have holidays, which means that for half of the year, workers and businesses have no income stream, a very little income stream, which means that they are unemployed or it's far harder to manage. Now, why is it particularly nefarious? Because tourism kills other industries. Because it is so lucrative for six months of the year, local capital flows significantly into tourism and talent at the cost of other industries in the region. So it's even more dependent. Next, inflation really hurts other industries because at the point at which, you know, the resources you need to run your business, at the point at which paper becomes more expensive because your currency is implanted, it's harder to run other businesses. And finally, environmental damage and congestion affect your productivity."

One, we get money from auctioning these permits and we still have money from tourism in the off-season, which means that we have the money to diversify. Next, the government is forced to diversify. They can't milk the short-term cash cow of tourism. There is political pressure to find other businesses to go into since people still want jobs. And finally, there are other industries in all countries that can receive this amendment. We're not going to say what they are, but for instance, things like fishing, agriculture, sea trade routes, manufacturing, whatever, there are huge other industries that can go into. Particularly in Western countries like Paris, like Rome, where obviously there are other investments that can happen. We support diversification. We are less reliant on tourism. So proud to propose."

              "text": "Perfect. Maybe a place like London might be fine the moment that you have a limit on tourists. But what happens to countries like Seychelles? What happens to countries like Sri Lanka? Because realistically, we have a couple of garment factories but nothing much else. To these countries, tourism is not a choice, it is a necessity. It is something that keeps these countries afloat. From the person on the street selling seashell necklaces to the mid-level manager that runs a hotel, it's the lifeblood of these countries. They do not provide us with an alternative. Diversification is just asserted into this debate. Therefore, we think we are the only side that cares about the most vulnerable. A couple of things in characterization, set up, before I move on to my responses and finally my substantive. Firstly, I want to characterize that deterioration of these tourist sites is something that is inevitable, whether that be to climate change, where, for example, Venice is sinking, not because of tourists, but because of a rise in ocean levels, but also because these tourist sites are a place where rebuilding and repairing is something that always occurs. Take, for example, the Great Wall of China, where although it's considered to be a part of the Qing dynasty, it was actually mostly built in the Ming dynasty because it keeps getting rebuilt. Understanding this, we think that the process of rebuilding and keeping these sites maintained and up-to-date is something that happens better on our site when they are better funded, cared for, and given the attention that they deserve. But secondly, I want to point out that their characterization is very unrealistic because both sides have self-regulation incentives. Because if Machu Picchu is destroyed to the point where no one can come there, then obviously no one's going to want to visit Peru and they lose out on the cash cow that they obviously had. Meaning that on our side, governments won't be stupid. They're going to impose regulations to make sure that these places can be preserved to some degree. On to set up then, a couple of things. Firstly, I want to point out that this is a debate about volume, and they need to prove to us why exactly limiting the number of tourists significantly is not only good for the economy, but is the tipping point for all these things that they claim to essentially save these sites. But on top of this, this debate is about a range of places. As much as it is about places like Athens or London, it is also a debate about places like Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Costa Rica, seashells,"

They need to lay out a plan for these countries, how they're suddenly going to diversify, why all the people won't be left starving. They haven't done that. We think that these are terrible. But secondly, what's our counter-model in this debate? We can impose countless numbers of regulations, that be crowd-organizational control measures through ticketing or imposing time limits, that be incentivizing good behavior through social media and awareness campaigns, that be safety measures to protect degradation and damage, like, for example, better support structures in Machu Picchu, protective stone coverings in the Coliseum and rebuilding these areas. We'd also have regulations in the cities to prevent for the worst excesses to locals, where, for example, Madrid has certain streets reserved only for locals, or maybe on price caps on Airbnbs and such. A couple of things in response before my argument."

We think that tourists are being educated and improved, particularly because of social media, where people are increasingly aware of the detestable stag culture that needs to be avoided. But on top of this, we can support things like fines and regulation. Their only response in the POI to this is to say that surely regulation won't work because the police is stretched too thin. Why can we not ramp up the police then? Why can we not pay for better surveillance services? Why can we not beef up the ability to protect these areas? Regulation can work. Secondly, they say that you commercialise these places and this is inherently degrading. I want to flip this argument very quickly because if these places are fetishised and isolated, the solution is greater globalisation. Make people go to India to understand that the saree is a part of daily life and not some weird fetish object. Make people look at these sculptures, see the people living there and understand it. Tourism solves the fetish object. Make people look at this culture, see the people living there and understand it. Tourism solves the fetishization. It does not cause it. But on an even if level, I'm going to take it at the absolute best. Even if it's commercialized to some degree, that's absolutely fine. Even if like the elephant who's a sacred part of Sri Lankan culture is sold in the form of like key tags and postcards, if it means that a person can feed his family for that day, what's the harm in that? On net, it's a great thing. But the last point of response then. They say that they can diversify. I'd like to point out that if diversification was possible, these places would have done so anyway. Because it makes economic sense and your voters are going to want that. Why exactly is it likely on their side? It is not sure. Okay then, on to arguments."

Firstly, on why we are better for economic development, and secondly, on why we better preserve these sites. Firstly, on why we are better for economic development. Premise. Prior to the advent of tourism-based economies, these destinations were extremely impoverished, and tourism was brought out as a necessity. Why? Firstly, because they have no meaningful comparative advantage. Maybe they lack mineral-rich rent, maybe they lack resources, maybe they lack human capital. If a city is to survive in the middle of a desert or an ocean, they need to find a way to generate value aside from traditional economic means. Tourism was that option for them. These are the people who this debate is most applicable to. But secondly, these are the areas that were left behind because of colonialism, because of historical injustices, which means that they were left with like weak currencies and such and needed to find a way to build their economies back up. These are places like Sri Lanka that then use this to make sure that tourism works as an alternative in these countries. Why do we then get more money for these places? One, because tourists have more disposable income. They enter in large numbers and hoards and the cash goes into the pockets of local communities and businesses. These communities and businesses sell them goods and services at higher margins than they can to locals. Where, for example, in Kandilama, a traditional sarong priced at 20,000, who I as a a local would never buy a white person coming in would probably buy because their currency is far more stronger than ours and when converted to dollars isn't even the like price of a subway fare for them but two the money circulates and goes beyond just the destination the residents of sibu may have again disposable income and tourism first kicked off but then this money is used to provide temporary stimulus loans to liloan and bonbon and those residents can be livelihoods, put food on the table, and send their kids to school. This then creates an incentive for more local businesses, especially those unrelated to the tourism industry, for example, say, a restaurant in the region, to set up because more people have more disposable income to make use of those services. Why then, given that we have more money for governments, does this benefit translate to a national level? Because increased tax revenue from the increased income of local communities means that we have more tax revenue to pay for the people, but also we have access to foreign currency, and this is good, because access to foreign currency and the transition to local currency means that you have more foreign reserves in your bank, in your government's bank, which means that you're more stable and you attract more investment, but also you're able to set up state enterprises and things like touristic as tourism sites, national parks and cultural centers that directly earn money from tourists. Government spread this money. The initial investment would be used to grow tourism further and the secondary incentive will also be to spread the benefits further where diversification now is possible because you have the funds to do so and politically governments are going to want to do this as well because diversification is likely something that is popular. Why is this exclusive? Because these benefits only manifest through large injections of money into the economy as opposed to small ones. Because on their side, even if they get like a couple injections far and few apart, they still don't have the amount of foreign currency required to establish your local currency as a strong one in order to attract investors and such. Moving on then to my second argument on why we're better for the preservation of these sites. Premise. The upkeep and maintenance of these tourist sites within these destinations requires high costs, within that governments lack the incentives to invest into this, where they lose their golden goose status. There are a couple of reasons why. Because the upkeep, there's a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, we think that the upkeep of these places is going to be expensive regardless of the number of tourists, where these attractions are designed to be attractive and opulent, and maintaining them is going to be expensive because of their cultural heritage, where there's seasonality, where you need to make sure that these places are up-to-date, even when it's in the off-season, where natural deforestation and random accidents and such can happen, and where a number of these sites cannot be modernized and need to have their cultural element preserved into it. This means that the maintenance of these places takes cash that they do not have. Why do we exclusively have that cash then? Because on our side, tourists come in large numbers and bring in the money that you need. You make the kind of revenue that you so essentially desire in order to make sure that these places are maintained. But on top of this, there's a cultural volume of shared ownership where, for example, the only reason that Notre Dame was sent so much aid to be built overall was because all people across the globe felt it was like a collective heritage versus on their side, it becomes France and France's problem only. These incentives are exclusive to opposition, because on their side, politicians can no longer justify spending money to preserve these areas, because there's no economic point. It's always going to be better to invest in tangible things, like say, welfare, education and healthcare, meaning that these essential sites are the first to get slashed on their side, versus on our side, when there's a guaranteed economic benefit, when more people visit these sites, and there's a large number of tourists coming in, and cash is pumping the economy, we are better off and we are funded more, for those reasons, I suppose."

Are we really to believe that the Coliseum, they're not trying to protect it from graffiti? Obviously they probably were, and it just ended up failing on their side. The same reason they give you, if they say, if you could diversify you probably would already. If you could protect your sacred sites, you probably would try to already. You'd probably accrue that harm as well. Secondly, it's just so much easier to regulate when there are less people to regulate. People are able to slip through the cracks when there is like a bustling amount of people. When there are less of them there, it is far easier to regulate those people. But thirdly, I just dispute that you guys can do this regulation at all. You never explain why it requires less fiat than our side. I'd say it probably does require more fiat on your side for two reasons. Firstly, your first figure explains you're economically dependent on that industry. When you're economically dependent on it, you're far less able to regulate it. You do not believe that regulating it in the first place means they do not have the fiat to be able to do that. Because you're economically independent on it, you cannot do the regulations because that would harm your economy, get heaps of political blowback. And secondly, you affect less people on our side. There are less tourists coming through, less people working in that industry. So we have far more political capital to be able to regulate it. I would dispute that they are able to do more regulations than us."

Firstly, it's exclusive on our side, the auction system, so you pay a lot for this. People like to pay to go to private beaches. When you're paying for Paris to be exclusive, you pay far, far, far more money. That means it goes directly to the government. Their best mechanism on this is it goes to the hotels that are owned by Western companies, and maybe they don't have too much profit. They pay their workers some money. That goes to someone else. Some trickle-down economics, we give it directly to the government. Far more certain benefit on our side. The speculative chains of logic there are so unclear as how they get it and under-explained. Second reason is to explain is that the marginal returns of each tourist you're adding just get lower over time. That each tourist you add probably has less money to spend is less likely to spend money we keep the tourists that won't want to go the most will spend the most amount of money and we make exclusive for them they are likely to pay more on our side that explains how we get more money than they do next thing to explain is you're economically dependent on this industry therefore it is bad for us to cut it note that we're doing this on phasing out on a period of time so there's no instant harm that they point to that falls out of the debate pretty quickly."

That explains that given 70%, at least 70% of every country basically is not dependent on tourism, you have the ability to diversify. You can go into those 70% things and just build them up. The industries already exist. But note there are new industries developing, things like AI that you can go into, be able to do that. You could have said 100 years ago that Hong Kong was in a nice place that had nice temperatures and would be a nice tropical island and be like, oh, that would always be a tourist destination. Why would it be anywhere else? Could have said the same thing for Singapore. They became other places. They can diversify even if you are like a Pacific island or in Southeast Asia. Second response is, where are the vast majority of tourist destinations? When you think of it as places like New York, it's places like California, it's places like Paris, places like London, those places can obviously diversify. They will be better off. And thirdly, is that we spend more money on skills retraining through the money that we get through the auction system, so we're more able to diversify on our side. Maybe they say, why haven't we diversified anyway? Because the Western companies push you to try not to diversify, because they're reaping all this money out of you. We have the fear on our side to do it. We don't have to bypass through that system so we are able to get you not economically dependent and be better off.

Second response is you sell less goods on your side because you get things like Dutch disease, the price of the currency rises which deletes all the other forms of the economy, you sell less exports, means you get less foreign currency from that, it is not a benefit. But thirdly, it's unclear if you get foreign currency on your side because lots of people do things like trading the currency when they're in America and then fly overseas, so you never get the American currency because they trade it before they leave, because they want to know that they can definitely get it. They think they can get it at cheaper prices when they trade it in America for like serving currency, so they don't go and do it when they go overseas, they trade it back at home. Fourthly, is the vast majority of tourist places are in Western countries and they already have their own currency, right? They already have the Euro, they already have the US dollar, they already have the US dollar, they already have the Australian dollar. Why do they need the currency reserves? Entirely unclear from this team. They had to prove that the vast majority of places were in the non-Western world and that also you traded the currency specifically there and that that wasn't even a trade-off of getting other industries. So many things in logic that you fail to prove. Fifth thing is that we do things like building skills, which means people can go overseas, get remittances and send it back to their family we get more currencies that way because we spend more money diversifying economy putting up skills putting up things like nurses so that we get excess means that you can go overseas and then send back money on foreign currency that explains how we win and flip most their economy harms in the debate I would take a POI London and New York have diversified while remaining busting tourist sites without giving tourism up."

First thing they try and go is, well, local services are given separately to the people local, to the people that are international. A couple of responses. Firstly, governments don't have infinite money. Just because there are tourists does not mean they can now also give money to local services. The way that France spent billions of dollars on cleaning up the Seine, which voters argued was a direct opportunity cost of doing things like funding hospitals and protested over, there are opportunity costs of spending money on tourists that you do not get to spend on your local people. But secondly, note that when it's incredibly crowded, things like buses, it is hard to scale up. It's hard to build new train lines in a city that has existed for a thousand years and build where they are. When you've moved a bunch of hotels, how do you build more train lines there? They can't scale it up. It means that the trains just get incredibly crowded. Note this has two impacts. First, it feels incredibly bad for people to just have a bunch of tourists in their train so they can't get to work. But secondly, note the productivity limits it lowers. Things from people are less productive when it takes them longer to get to work. Third thing we push is that you have things like housing. You push people out of the city, which puts them further away. It makes it harder to give them services. And if you are, they are less effective because they just take longer. They say you can do things like housing, you push people out of the city, which puts them further away, makes it harder to give them services, and even if you are, they are less effective because they just take longer. They say you can do things like cultural learning,"

The next thing to explain is why we are better off, this is my substantive advice, actions. This will explain how people do things more like sex work, hard drugs and crimes for fun than they would do when we limit the amount of tourists. Four reasons for this. Firstly, we have a net less tourists, so even if this doesn't change people's propensity to do this, just having less of them means they're less likely to do things. Note that cocaine production peaked in the world when the Euros were happening because there was lots of people going to one place where they thought they would all have cocaine and that meant that there were more hard drugs being done there. Secondly, it's far easier to regulate on our side because firstly, it's smaller and secondly, your economy is less dependent on those vice industries so you're better off. Thirdly, lots of the tourism that's done for vice industries like sex work is often impulse things that people do. They go, oh I want to fly there next week because I really want to do some drugs or something. That is less likely to happen when you have an auction system and when you have to sign up for permits. It's harder to do those impulse things that lead to vice drugs. But fourthly, note that we have a more diverse set of jobs. People are not pushed into having to do things like sex work when they did not want to and had no other industry to rely on. They push people into that so those services are less provided. The impacts of this are pretty clear. Women stop getting abused. Economies become more stable because they're not dependent on things like crime. It disturbs locals' lives on their side. It amplifies every impact we're giving this debate. For these reasons, incredibly proud to propose."

You can still pivot to the other 70% of your economy and diversify on that side. I'll chat about why you can't. But again, you do agree that this is a big part of your economy and your jobs as well. So this is the one thing everyone agrees on. There are a lot of jobs that tourism rides on. We'll explain why those get worse on the asset of the house. First question then. On regulation. They say that regulation won't work because there are too many tourists. But like, why? The challenge in first opposition is that tourism gives you the money to hire more cops, gets no response. If there are too many tourists, hire more police officers. I have no idea why it is literally impossible to regulate just because there are more tourists. Then they say economic dependence on tourism is why you will not regulate, because apparently regulation will turn away tourists. Right. Because people are going to stop going to Rome just because you can't graffiti the Colosseum. This is an absurd argument. Just because we regulate against the worst harms possible does not mean that tourists evaporate from these sites. So their claim that there is no political will to regulate is just untrue. The third and final thing they say is that sex tourism on the house is going to be better because sex tourism is impulsive and they stop this from occurring. A, they just make it go to non-major sites of tourism so I have no idea why this changes. Instead of going to Bali in Indonesia, you go to a smaller village in Indonesia and do the same exact thing. If anything, the scrutiny on Bali is higher on us than the house which is why you see the Balinese authorities starting to regulate against this on our comparison. The second response I want to point out is that there are some evil people who will plan a year in advance and go do it anyway. I really don't understand what the margin here is. Sex tourism cannot be the biggest thing in the round. The 99% of tourists who don't engage in sex tourism, the money that they bring to economies probably ought to matter a lot more. With that, we proved that regulation is possible to a very large extent."

But I want to note, insofar we prove regulation, a big chunk of the negative case goes away as well. On to the second question then, about economics. I want to start by chatting about whether there's a problem in relying on tourism to start with. The claim that they make is that tourism being a big part of your economy stops diversification. And the mechanization that we get is second proposition saying one sentence, that Western hotel companies stop diversification. How? Maybe you can't build a factory in front of a Crowne Plaza in Belgrade on our side either, but why does the Crowne Plaza care if you build a factory on the suburbs of Belgrade? Why does the Crowne Plaza care? About every single inch of land in Serbia, we imagine that they don't prove why industrialization or diversification is literally impossible on our side of the house. Clearly, there are areas in Serbia, clearly there are areas in India that we can happily industrialize as well. So their opportunity cost was one that just existed in their heads. I have no idea why India getting some white people to come there means that India now won't have factories on our side of the house. Just think about how ludicrously absurd this claim is. Then they say that Hong Kong and Singapore economically developed. But I think this shows up our analysis and proves the mechanism that I just talked about, which is that you can have a lot of tourists in the country and also develop and industrialize your own financial sectors. You can also set up your own factories because that is what Hong Kong and Singapore did to start that. So I think those examples cut deeper into their case than it does to us if anything they prove our case for us. The next thing I want to respond to is the very Western-centric responses to our argument about forex reserves. They say four things, all of which only apply to the developed world. They say that forex reserves don't matter. To the Australian economy, maybe not, because creditors rate the Australian economy very highly. You know who it does matter to? Countries like Pakistan, countries like Sri Lanka that need massive forex ratings before anyone is going to put their money there. FDI will not come into our countries if we don't have the forex reserves to guarantee that to these investors that they can pull their money out, that their money won't be stuck in this economy because without those forex reserves, you will not have the confidence to get the FDI to set up those factories that they so desperately want on their side of the house. Maybe on the absolute best case, Australia doesn't benefit. But you know who else benefits? China, Sri Lanka, India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina. What about the rest of the developing world that they never wanted to talk about? Then they say, that should just happen, and that this is a bad thing. But I would note, there are a lot of developing countries around the world run trade deficits because they need to import a lot of goods. On our side, importing becomes a lot easier when the currency is managed better as a result of tourists coming there and giving you forex reserves. They say that this will not happen because people will trade currencies in America and then fly to Sri Lanka. But guys, the problem is not every single currency is an international currency. You can't convert in America US dollars to Sri Lanka rupees. You have to come to Sri Lanka and do it in the fast pace which is why we think the forex reserves of Sri Lanka will be boosted up on us and the host. India can convert Australian dollars, but guys, the rest of the world is not globalized to the extent that your economy is. The last thing to point out is that the vast majority of tourism is in the West. Intuitively, is this true? Probably not. There are a bunch of places in the developing world that do attract a massive amount of tourists. There are a bunch of people in the developing world who engage in tourism in each other's countries. Look at the millions of tourists from China that visit India, that visit South Korea, that visit Sri Lanka, that we think is going to be significantly beneficial on our side of the house. The implication to all of this is that the responsive strategy only works in places like Australia. Maybe the Australian economy will be fine, it will be fine either way because it's the Australian economy. The places that mattered more were the places like Maldives, were places like India that could actually get money on our competitive and that they got rid of on their side. The implication to this was people had more jobs on our side of the house. When the hotel employed you and gave you a paycheck that you could feed your family with, this was important because they could not just say that they set up alternative industries without telling us what those alternative industries were. Fishing is not good enough. They set back development by decades because they take away the one comparative advantage countries like Maldives had in the first place. On our side, we would not sacrifice the certain benefit and industry that we already have for the speculative benefit of fishing being good enough on their comparison. Lastly, on culture. They say that culture is fetishized on our side of the house. Why is it not going to be fetishized when they still let some tourists in as second proposition wants to conceive to begin with? Then they say that locals are locked out of their services. But I want to flip this argument. It is because there are significant amounts of tourists in your cities that the Rome government has A, the capacity because tourists give you the cash and B, the incentive to improve things like the metro system because tourists will not come into a city that has a dysfunctional metro, right? So it is only on our side of the house that these places have the capacity and the incentive to improve things for local populations. A better metro, desalination plants, if they are concerned that there's not enough water, all of these things were exclusive to our side. The implication was tourists brought money, this matter to the rest of the world, if not Australia."

The private companies don't care whether your industry is reliant on tourism. I'm going to tell you why that's not true and why their side actively, with over-tourism, stops governments from diversifying. First, it's because they suffer from things like the status quo bias, which is the exact thing that they're suffering from right now. They assume that because these countries have so much tourism that this is the only thing they can do. Second, it's because governments were inherently short-termists because they had electoral incentives and they weren't perfect actors. That meant they traded off what was a quick boost to the economy to things that would legitimately help them in the future, like investment, into things like skills. Third, it was because they had a bias from the past. They point out themselves that sometimes these countries were ones who have faced colonial pasts and that meant that tourism had helped them get out of these situations. That led them to believe that this was their shining light and pushed them away from investing into other industries. Lastly, it's because people in these countries see low-level jobs in hotels and tour guides and never attempt to upskill. They are actively pushed into these industries instead of using government capital to push them out of it. Next, that's defeated their point. That's proven at the end of that that governments would put more money into things like investment, into things like skills, if their side wasn't encouraging things like overtourism, which directly stopped them from doing this. Second thing to defeat them is what they say about countries have literally no other options, that they have only nice beaches and this is the only thing that they have. First, I think this is incredibly uncharitable. Not only to us, but also to places like the Seychelles which have great reserves and incredible natural resources that aren't used because of things like colonisation which push them back from using them. I'll tell you why they're able to diversify. First, it's because these places are highly attractive for things like investment and foreign direct investment. That was incredibly good for these countries. They're blocked for all the reasons I told you about how there was inherent tie-up in the tourism industry. If you told me a few decades ago that a place like Taiwan, which has really nice beaches and is relatively small, would only be a tourist hotspot, obviously now that seems ridiculous. They pushed into other industries. They pushed into other things like skill building."

Know that people get locked out on their side because they go into things like quick jobs rather than trying to upskill and trying to pursue other industries. Yes. To be clear, you think that the Indian government won't bother to look at setting up a government factory because of the status quo bias that exists just because some hotels exist in India? Okay, look, you wanted to talk about places that aren't like India, which exclusively rely on tourism. I know that India is a place that doesn't rely on tourism, quite obviously, and has incredible other industries. I'm not sure how this helps you in the debate. At the end of that, we were the ones who encouraged governments to invest in other things, they never got to do that we encouraged governments to diversify that was incredibly good, because tourism was a bad industry to have economically their only response is to say that every industry suffers things like shocks we tell you that tourism is uniquely unstable, because it's uniquely seasonal because it's a suspect to shocks like COVID, which killed entire industries and sent entire countries into poverty, but that it was also finite, that beaches' water quality would go down over time, that these could not last forever, that climate change would change your seas, and then that if you focused on tourism, you would have literally no way in the future of providing money from your country. At the end of that, we were the ones who encouraged governments to diversify. We were the only ones who did that. On their side, they remained stagnant. They remained in these situations where people had no other employment opportunities but to work in things like hotels. If they wanted to relegate people to that, they could, on our side, we actually changed things by pushing governments to change what they do. The last thing they bring you is that, the last such attempt to say this is to say that the lack of foreign reserves means that you never diversify. First, obviously tourism and the physical exchange of money was never going to be the defining factor in whether you had foreign reserves or not. Obviously other industries, if you pushed into them, would also give you things like foreign reserves. Private companies could also do this. I don't think that was ever going to help them in this debate. The physical exchange of money was no longer what was the most defining factor in foreign currencies now, in foreign reserves. And we just told you that that probably wasn't going to be that helpful to that country. Most countries don't actually directly focus on having strong"

Their only response is to say that this helps people learn more about their cultures because they go to these places. First, this is obviously untrue because you had an incentive to play into stereotypes that westerners wanted, to play into stereotypes which would make people spend more. These were the kind of things that film propagated but were not necessarily true to your culture. But second, it's because Westerners and people from bigger countries played into things like colonial power dynamics. They had the money and the purchasing power. You had to prostrate yourself. You had to make your culture more palatable for them. That was so harmful to these people because it was a massive impact to literally lose your whole culture, to lose your sense of life, to be like someone living in Hawaii and have to give luau to people every day. That was something that deeply harmed your sense of life. To be like someone living in Hawaii and have to give luau's to people every day, that was something that deeply harmed your sense of self. We told you also that you have things like destruction to monuments. Their only response is to say that they preserve cultures through rebuilding processes. This obviously wasn't enough. If you lose your individual culture, if you lose the history of these places, that is obviously a harm in itself. If you rebuilt the library of Alexandria for me, that would not be enough. Things are good in their original form. They have huge importance to things like indigenous communities. They have huge importance to your sense of self. Last thing to say, then, is on culture and the brief response they give you on sex tourism, that it gets worse on their side. The first thing I'd note is that if you believed any of our points on diversification, then this is obviously untrue. On their side, people are pushed into these industries. They don't have a sense of choice. They don't have agency in choosing where they go. On our side, if you weren't just pushing into tourism, if you were actively incentivized to do things like build your skills, to do things like stay in education, you were far more likely to be able to directly seek other jobs. At the end of that, on our side, you were far more likely to keep your culture. You were far more likely to keep the monuments which had deep cultural importance to you. You were far more likely to have places to live and your economy was far less likely to be dependent on something which was so harmful to you, which rubbed you of your culture, which rubbed you of being able to live your life in a normal way.

First on the economics and second on culture. First, whether regulations will work. We pointed out three things here. The first is governments have an incentive to regulate because governments care about people coming in here when their entire revenue stream is dependent on the fact that they need over tourism to exist within these regions for their economies to sustain itself. In instances where it does fail, it means that they cannot get the revenue that they have on our side, which is why they have an incentive to regulate. What is the implication of this? That is, governments will cut down on things like cocaine production, for example, as the second proposition wants to say. In instances if it means that people become uncomfortable, that they don't want to go to these regions in the first place, because there's just so much of crime in these regions or there's so much of uncertainty of what will happen to their lives. So the implication of this is that governments have an incentive to regulate. The second thing that we pointed out is that capacity. If they can literally implement and fear an auction system on the outside of the house, I'm sure we can fear some level of regulation existing on the outside of the house as well. But the third thing we pointed out is that the capacity to regulate also significantly gets better over time, right? And there were two reasons that we suggested for this. The first reason is because they just have more"

Housing prices are going to exist anyway because there's like a trend of overpopulation or like climate change is going to occur anyway, like in Serbia you're running out of water because it is the heat that is happening out of nowhere. These things are going to happen anyway. The ability for governments to fund these things only exists if you have the money to do that. But the second thing that we pointed out is that the pressure on governments to regulate against these things also significantly increases, right? Like when you're moved out of your house and you don't have enough houses, that is when people can prejudice the governments to regulate as well. So regulation, even if as it exists, is not like perfect, it will get better over time because of the additional pressure that keeps increasing on garments. What is the implication of this? This takes out the vast majority of the cases they have. Their first argument on graffiti and like people doing bad things. Their third argument on like people consuming cocaine. They will have a positive case at the end of this if they do not prove that regulation does not work. We've proven sufficiently that we can fear some regulation and it keeps getting better over time. We win this debate already. But let's answer two questions additionally, just so that we clear the wind, right? The first is on economics. The first thing I want to point out is deal with their argument on diversification and the second thing I want to prove in this argument is that even if diversification does not happen on our side of the house, where the tourism industry is the best industries that these countries have and need to stay in this taking us on our absolute worst case in a world in which diversification cannot happen the first thing why can diversification still happen on our side and like the argument on diversification I want to point out a couple of missing links from the proposition here the first is that they never pointed out why diversification is important in the first place. Why is this industry so, so different to the tourism industry? Their damage control in the third proposition is that, well, this is seasonal. I want to point out two things. The first is fluctuations in demand happens in every other industry as well. I don't understand why this is uniquely volatile when it comes to tourism. But again, we are talking about major tourist destinations. Like, the Eiffel Tower is always overcrowded, guys. It is not overcrowded in particular seasons of the year, which is why their seasonal harm does not make sense as well. This is true of every other tourist site that is going to exist on that side as well. So I don't understand the necessity to diversify in the first place. The second missing link in the argument is that they never proved why they can diversify in the first place. We pointed out several countries that just don't have the capacity to diversify. Firstly, because they don't have any other industry like the Maldives. But secondly, because they don't have the money to diversify"

In the past, their entire economy was dependent on the tourism industry, but over time, they have entered the financial sector because they're able to use this money. So over-tourism is essential in the short term for these countries for them to be able to diversify in the long term, as they suggest. But the fact they want to point out is that they never proved why this is exclusive on our side, because we pointed out governments do have an incentive, right? And the reason for this is diminishing marginal utility. At some point in time, it just becomes so much so that there is no additional benefit that you get from, like, tourism, to the point where governments are forced to shift to other industries, because their labor sector is just packed with tourism, that there are still people who are unemployed, that they need to find jobs for them, and that is the point at which they divert to other industries and they start building those industries as well, and people will pressurise the governments to do this. The fourth missing link is that why is this beneficial in the first place, which leads me on to the second part of this clash, right? That is, why even if diversification does not happen on our side of the house, why the tourism is the best industry that these people have, and there are two exclusive reasons that we gave to you, in first opposition, by the way, that they never responded to."

What is the importance of this? Two things. Firstly, this is a certain benefit when it comes to the tourism industry for countries that don't have an additional competitive advantage. Secondly, is that the long-term industrialisation is not something that is mutually exclusive, but on our side of the house, the harm of tourism is guaranteed on"

Whereas on their side, they will break down the forest to build factories, which is because it does not bring any benefit on their side. The second thing I want to point out is that the stereotypes argument does not make sense. If it means people have food on the ground and food to put on the table, it does not matter because of stereotypes. Those are going to exist on either side of the house.

              "text": "They have no positive case at the end of this debate. Two paths to victory on opposition. First, on economic development, where we've been quite clearly. Second, on the lives of residents improving on our side. Our second argument that receives barely any response about why we better protect cultural heritage sites on our side. Firstly, on economic development, I think the engagement in this clash through both sides fall to an extent. It gets quite messy. So I think what's important here is to break this down into groups. There are different kinds of countries in different circumstances. The first type of countries that we think matters are countries with not a lot else going for it, countries that are dependent on tourism. Why was it that our case was winning by a wide margin in these set of countries? Because we pointed out that this was the most profitable method of earning cash. Earning cash in foreign currencies by the way. They say that phishing exists. They say that surely something else needs to exist that you can maybe turn your people to once tourism goes away. But this is an uncharitable response. Because our claim from first was that these countries depend on tourism because this was the best thing for them to do this was the one thing that has a comparative advantage over the rest of the world at and it was that thing that we guaranteed and secured for these countries on our side maybe the Maldives can fish but you know what India also fishes and India is probably slightly better at it the Maldives is much better than everyone else at tourism and that is the thing that we were unwilling to take away from these countries we pointed out that for these countries, getting forex mattered a lot. They gave you four responses as to why the Australian economy doesn't need forex. We gave you responses as to why the rest of the world does. Third proposition drops this entirely. The implication to this is that we get cash, that cash then translates into investments from abroad, because FDI becomes more likely when your currency is more stable, because again, we get more forex reserves on our side of the house. So if our best-case implication was industrialization mattered, we actually gave you the means and mechanism to get to industrialization because we made FDI more likely on our competitive start. The way here is that the long-term on our side better achieves the best case on their side, which is they want industrialization, we just get to it in a far more secure way on our comparative. The next set of countries that I think matters are countries that have the capacity for other things beyond what is going to start with. But they never tell you why exactly these countries can't industrialize. Because all they say in second proposition is, aha, big evil Western company stops this. We point out that this is absurd in my speech. The crown plaza isn't going to stop industrialization of the suburbs of Belgrade, right? They don't respond to this in their proposition. They don't respond. When we point out that return on inflation in Skadaria in Belgrade does not mean that you can't set up a factory in literally any other plot of land in Serbia to start with. So they don't actually prove why industrialization is literally impossible literally everywhere else beyond these major tourist sites in these countries. Their proposition says that India doesn't count. We agree. India isn't going to be stopping industrialization as a result of just having some hotels, and that is the response that be their case as opposed to our case. So the implication here is that the countries that could industrialize will do it anyway. The countries that can't industrialize get cash on our city halls that feeds people's families. That cash is the cash that got to industrialization in the long term in the Maldives, in Sri Lanka, on our side. They need to engage rather than talking about Australia's economy. On the second question, why is it that lives of residents are better? A, regulation. They don't engage charitably. We can regulate against a lot of these harms and the incentives to local governments to care about local voters, which we point out in the first opposition is undisponded to. Second, even if you don't buy regulation, my response in the second proposition, that third proposition, drops, which is that governments get the capacity to improve things on our side of the house through this cash. You build a better subway, so with that in mind, with the metro, we could expand the metro with the cash that tourists brought. Finally, our argument about preservation. We told you that forests matter to you and the government on our side of the house. When the forest gets you cash, on their side, cutting down the forest, tearing down these cultural sites of preservation makes more sense. Ours was the only site that they made these sites economically valuable. Approved."

First thing I'm going to talk about where this debate takes place, because I think that's where the bulk of uncharitableness comes from the opposition. Next thing I'll talk about is why this is good for the citizens in the country that are there. And then lastly, on the economy. So firstly, on where this debate takes place, we tell you it's places like Western countries, they tell you it's places like the Seychelles. Why should you weigh our characterizations more likely than theirs? Two reasons. Firstly, I would ask you to name a major tourist destination. Lots of you would probably think Paris, New York. I think it's more intuitive that you think of those places because they just do happen to have more people going there than the ones that they name. They try and push you that, oh, the Maldives is a major tourist destination. I'm unclear that it is. I'm unclear that Paris is. It's probably a way that it's more likely. But secondly, we explained to you that Western tourists are more biased towards going to Western destinations for two reasons in our speech. The first one is that they're just biased towards their own places because they're culturally similar but secondly it's geographically similar if you're in europe you're more likely to go to european countries you ought to go to countries that are further away since your way that is more likely because you were there that means that the bulk of characterization we give you about western countries we protect their sites and they'll still be fine economically but even if it does go to other countries we still win the debate there they never engage on our grounds in this debate so we and we"

Second response is we need to give you, there are a bunch of things like malicious tourists doing things like graffiti in Colosseum. The third thing we tell you is that there are things like access to services. You get pushed out of public transport. That just makes your life awful. We also explain second proposition, that lowers economic productivity, gets their harm. Fourth thing we tell you is that there are things like the housing crisis. We push people out of cities that they have cultural connection to, which make it harder to live in worse places. And often people's rents go up, they lose lots of money. That is economically depressing for those people, even if you rise their wages. Housing prices go up so much that that is harmful for them. Fifth thing we explain is that they're culturally exploitive. They try to say they can do regulations. Maybe they can. We already gave the reasons why they totally didn't have the fear to do. But if they could, why were they not doing it anyway? Unfair on that. Next thing they try to do is go, well, the side proposition is probably winning by a margin on this, let's try and weigh it out of the debate. What are the two metrics they give you at third opposition? First, climate change happens anyway, so why should we care about the environment? Is climate change going to happen anyway? Probably untrue that it is. But it also, lots of the harms we give you are direct environmental harms, like sewage leaks. Second thing they tell you is, overpopulation happens anyway. Doesn't mean you have to add"

If you believe this is a Wayne metric, it doesn't get them anywhere in the debate. We tell you our benefits are more true because first, they're benefits that they get in the short term. Sam explains in his speech that the wave breaks in Costa Rica no longer exist because you build up hotels so that people stop going there and there are a bunch of hotels that no one visits. And therefore, people don't do the tourism so they only get short-term benefits on their side. We have more sustainable economic benefits. But secondly, our harm is more certain. And thirdly, we have a wide variety of impacts. I'll give you five different ones that only trade one small part of the economy they don't win on. Let's go on their economy material, noting that by the end of this I think it's short-termist and probably not even something that they can win on. They tell you that there is a certain benefit of adding the middle class. It's unclear the speculative logic change we explained at the start. This goes to the government. We explained it's more direct on our side. And not even if it is true, it's seasonal, so you don't get claims benefit all the time, half the time these people are unemployed. We lower the delta by capping people in summer so it's similar to people in winter, so people more have jobs. But they tell you they can't do things like diversify. But note that 3.0 says Hong Kong did diversify. They used to do things like doing lots of tourism. They could. Next thing they say is they would anyway. Alice explains that government's a short-term bias. Governments do make bad decisions. To buy their argument you have to believe a government never makes a bad decision. Untrue. Lastly, on currency, I'm clear you need this much more currency because we still have some tourism on their side. They act like it's a banned tourism debate. They're unable to clean its benefits. We still have enough currency. Power up to propose."

We say, firstly, by restricting numbers to entry. We do this in just the same way Lord Howie Island in Australia restricts the islands to 400 people per night as of 2019. But secondly, through pre-bookings and specific tourist restrictions, right? We say we allow certain individuals at each point in time to enter major tourist destinations and make travel-specific visas to that very major tourist destination. But on the second layer, we say we aggressively promote other tourist destinations. We say we do this through the increased advertisements of smaller tourist destinations, but secondly, through promoting virtual tourism. We say in the same way Thievelu did this when the island was under imminent threats of sinkage. We say this is something that is important. But why then do we think this is the best and the only form of regulation? We say historically, due to the direct conflict that exists between the very purpose of tourism, which is to invade the natural space and be its parasite, and the core function of regulation, which is to limit invasion in one way or another, be it banning snorkeling in Guantanamo, be it the jail time for noise in Venice, or be it the banning of Airbnbs and hotel construction in Barcelona. We say that the governments have been unable to regulate without taking away from the adventure of tourism in itself. We say significant limitation, however, is unique in its ability to simply reduce the number of people that can invade this particular space. We say that's something that's important. So first, let's talk on principle. But before we do that, let's talk about a little bit of some pretext here."

              "text": "We say that there's a long-standing history of tourism that has scarred and violently struck at the souls of locals within major tourist destinations. We say that this has served as the impetus for new untapped levels of hate and vitriol towards mass tourism by these locals. We say that the hate is closely tied to the idea of having too many tourists, and it conjures up feelings of unsafety and anger. We say in Spain, locals have been gathering up at tourist sites to throw stones at those particular locals, at those particular tourists. We say in Bali, we've seen violent protests and violent protests erupting at the end of the day, right? What then becomes the premise here? We say that the mass existence of tourists in the land of locals is a triggering and a frightening scene. We say government's responsibility in this instance should be to significantly reduce in order to put those people's minds at ease. What's the claim therein? We say the claim of this principle therein is two-pronged. One, we say that there is government obligation towards responsiveness, right? But secondly, we say that there is proactiveness of the government in response to the civil uproar that is occurring. What's the wash here? Why do we think there are no pragmatic benefits that are likely to materialize on their side? Because we say the tourism industry in itself is going to face severe damage in future because of this vigil. We see that people are already scared to travel to these areas, particularly because of the anger that's already there. So we think at the moment in which you don't resolve this, we don't see a world in which the pragmatic benefits they are going to argue for are going to materialize in the long term. So what do we want you to note critically? Note that we value the paternalistic utilitarian role of government in the instance where the populace can rationalize this decision. But in a world, however, where the people are greatly emotionally traumatized, where the people are hurting, where the people are bleeding, we think that government has to value putting the minds of those particular people at ease. They have to value then helping those particular people, right? What then becomes the proof of outcome here here we say in the instances that we don't follow this principle we think we then see followers of like mass citizen discontent right we see a lot of civil disarray because a lot of people are generally angry about the ideas and everything that's been going on i think that's something that is terrible but principally on its own right why is it important to follow this principle? Because you feel trust in your state, you say you feel the discontent and you fulfill that discontent of citizens who've been always feeling like the government has been not acting towards these things, right? Principally, those people feel safe and they feel like, you know, the state has fulfilled their obligation to the people. And we say that in itself is something that is very important that we ought to preserve."

              "text": "But the second argument is on why significant limiting in itself in improving the standard of living. But before I take that, let me take a few more. If there's already so much fear for tourists traveling to these locations, why are we not going to see a gradual drop-off in the number of tourists? Why do we need to impose these strict government restrictions? So, I think we've already spent a long time explaining why that's something that's necessary. I don't think that's necessarily relevant. But when we talk about the significant limiting in improving the standard of living, what's the premises here? We say that over-tourism has harmed the standard of living for locals. We say that the locals have been priced out of the market, and this is manifested in multiple ways. One, we say it's manifested in the skyrocketing of prices for basic necessities. Notice how locals are forced to live on less than the bare minimum. They have lack of access to cheap food, clothing for your children. E.g., we saw this in the Bahamas, where there's a 47.5% increase in prices in every tourist season for them. And these prices are only getting worse and worse. Why is this so? Because one, there's an influx of tourists that jack up the demand and cause demand-pull inflation. But secondly, because tourists are generally perceived as financial stable people. And so companies generally have an incentive to increase prices so as to capitalize on the profits of as much as possible, right? But secondly, we say that locals are subject to forced displacement. We say that the rental prices and the housing costs are pushed up significantly, making it difficult for locals to often live in those areas. In New York, an urban tourist-heavy city, they average up to 80% more in housing costs making it difficult for locals to often live in those areas. In New York, an urban tourist-heavy city, they average up to 80% more in housing costs compared to other neighboring cities such as Jersey City. This happens because the demand for housing by tourists is often pushing out those particular... forcing a lot of landowners to maximize their profit by changing their business models from orienting towards the local market to orienting towards the tourist market to orienting towards the tourist market and pushing out those particular locals. We think secondly, we think locals are getting bought out of their houses. They prey on the despise of these particular locals for that money and use that land to then develop more tourist attractions that way they can benefit off of profit."

First of all, because there are many visitors in the region making use of services, that already means a lot of money comes into the region. But second of all, tourists are willing and able to spend more money than the local population. Tourists generally tend to be more wealthy, save up for vacation, and spend their money impulsively. This has two positive effects then on the local economy. A, it simply means there is a lot more demand for labor. The local population on our side is able to pay for rent and food by working in restaurants where tourists eat, hotels where they sleep, and museums that they visit. But B, apart from there being more jobs, these jobs are relatively well paid. Tourists tend to spend lots of money that for higher prices can be asked than for locals. This is why in markets and for taxis you tend to be charged more when you are a tourist. And that also means that local business owners get more money and are able to pay their employees well."

Hotels, souvenir shops and bars are all unable to make profit without a constant stream of customers. But two, in these destinations, it is incredibly hard to start up an entirely new industry directly dealing with their POI. Why is this? Four reasons. First of all, most people are taught to work in service and hospitality jobs. It is incredibly hard to in one go retrain the majority of the population, let alone have experts do the higher up work. But B, it requires an insane amount of capital and time. To specialize in a new industry on a large scale and become actual competition in the market, you need to build entire factories, offices, find customers on a large scale. This is undoable. C, a lot of retains don't have the natural resources to specialize in alternative industries. So for example, the Netherlands is specialized in agriculture because we have very fertile land. The Middle East is specialized in oil because they have a lot of oil fields. And many of these tourist destinations don't have any of these natural resources. Think the Maldives, think Venice, right? And lastly, capital and space are zero-sum. So the city center only has a limited amount of accessible space. So if there is a building, you can either make it an office in a hotel. Historically, they have been making hotels of this, therefore there is no base to go from, there is no other industry to invest in. All of this also means that investors will never invest capital into these regions, but will always prefer the neighboring regions that doesn't have all of these problems. So then what is the impact?

So why is there only regional development? Because of tourism. This is because of the incentive of the government. Because as we've proven, tourism creates a lot of economic revenue. And governments are dependent on tourism for their tax income. This looks like issuing visas. This looks like taxes on profit and product taxes. Therefore they have to keep on developing the region. Proposition takes the incentive for the government to care away because the region is no longer an area that brings in money. What do we think then that regional development looks like? This looks like building infrastructure such as high speed rails, better quality and cleaner roads, and the installation of ATM. This is necessary to keep tourists coming. Roads with holes, dirty streets, and a lack of streetlights deter tourists. On proposition, the government can let dirt roads be dirt roads and keep dark alleys without streetlights. Note then that the infrastructure benefits locals. We see this, for example, in Spain, where a railroad between Barcelona and Montserrat was developed to connect tourist destinations, but the 12 villages located in the 15 kilometers in between these tourist destinations now can also easily take the train. Note that this also deals with their case, where they say that prices tend to become a lot more expensive. On our side, it's easier to live outside of the city. But second of all, you get more developed products and services. Tourists will demand a certain quality of products that they are used to, that otherwise would not be imported into the area. This looks like medicine, right? This looks like higher quality goods. The local community now gets access to these higher quality products and services. So what does this then mean to the debate? Infrastructure has a huge positive impact on the lives of the local population. It means it's easier to live further away from the city and travel to work by public transport. Think, for example, the train in Spain. It means your streets are less likely to be covered in trash. It gives people access to medicine and conveniences, but forcing them to move or spend money on going elsewhere to get basic services done. Pano, in our side, the 50 million people that are living in Bangkok aren't left in the dark, but they can keep sustaining their lives. For all these reasons, I am so proud to oppose."

We say that in the instance that individuals are actually employed within these industries, we talk about the low wages that these individuals earn within these industries. This is to say that even if these individuals are particularly employed, they still can't afford basic staples within those cities. But secondly, we think there's a structural flaw in the argumentation and they tell us that there's comparatively different pricing. This is to say that groceries are cheaper than hotels. We think this is something that's untrue within major tourist destinations. Why? Because we think that even those hotels themselves buy those groceries that they're going to be using for the tourists that particularly live within those Airbnbs and hotels. So we think that there's still an incentive for those prices to still hike. But thirdly, we said that these tourists don't just go to hotels. We think those tourists also eat and buy those groceries that are existing within the streets of those cities. So we still think there's no such thing as the comparative pricing that exists. But secondly, we said that even if those individuals are actually employed, we think that in the vast majority of instances, because tourism is a seasonal employment type of like industry, we say that most of those individuals get laid off when the tourists don't particularly go there. We say that when most tourists come within the holiday seasons, we think for the greater part of the year, individuals are unemployed enemies. This is to say that even if individuals significantly drop in the number of individuals that go to those tourist destinations during like the seasons where people go in large numbers, we still think that the impact of individuals being laid off is still mitigated on their side.

It's still an underdeveloped state within itself because of how much capital is actually driven back into maintaining the harms of over-tourism within the island. We've seen this happen within cities like Bali in Indonesia, where a lot of the pollution that you get from cruise ships is actually affecting the water supplies within those cities. This necessitates government to spend a huge portion of the amount of income that they get from tourism in actually purifying the water that individuals are supposed to get within those states, which means that there is a marginal benefit that you get from tourism and we're going to integrate with you in our extension as to why we think that particularly becomes problematic.

We say that the act of tourism itself is something that constitutes a harm to the environment that it's actually partaking in. We say that when scuba divers go into the waters of the Guadalupe Islands, we think using things such as attractants and cages actually harms the species that exist within those waters. We think there's an extended harm, therefore, when you have the variety of people, a large number of people actively dumping cages into the waters of Guaranupe. We've seen this happen when there's a large mass of people that walk within the Great Wall of China, which has necessitated two-thirds of it to be unfit for tourism because of the structural damage that they've incurred. Why do we think this is true? We say that the more that you have all about tourism and the high influx of people that actually damage this infrastructure, it makes it increasingly difficult for these governments to maintain them. And we think this is something that becomes harmful for three reasons. Therefore, we think, firstly, the damage to these sites in most instances is irreversible. This is to say that two-thirds of the Great Wall of Chima are still closed down today. We think the same happens with the Guadalupe Islands where they got closed in the early years of 2023, two dates they haven't been reopened. The harm, therefore, is that if they value the employment that you get from tourism, we think when you have over-tourism, you are likely to get a complete closure of those infrastructure in the instance that there's an extensive damage on the infrastructure a complete closure of those infrastructure in the instance that there is an overt damage or like there is an extensive damage on the infrastructure that they have within that particular site. What that means is that you are unable in the long term to continue to have that employment that they value on their site so much. I think this is something that they need to consider because I think in the long term these tourist sites are unable to provide the type of employment and infrastructural support that they want. But secondly, we say that there's an extended harm even on the environment itself. We say that the cruise ships that land in the beaches of Venice particularly harm the damage, like the water supply that you get within those particular cities. We say in cities like Bali, within Indonesia, when you have a lot of cruise ships actually polluting the waters, what that means is that individuals that exist within that city don't have access to clean water. What is this to say? We think this is an extended harm that only happens when you have over-tourism. Why? Because we think that when you have less cruise ships going to those particular cities, you are likely to have manager performs of pollution within the waters that exist within Venice. We think that's the comparative there so what it means that you have less spending on like we have less spending on like actually accounting for the harms of tourism but rather spending into the infrastructure that you actually have within those cities we think this is something that you then get within that what is this to say he said that the extended harm on that environment itself is something that constitutes a harm to the how to how individuals are able to end that life within those cities. We say that when individuals can get access to clean water, we think the government should prioritize those individuals having that access as opposed to having like pleasantries from tourism. We think this is something that they needed to prioritize. But that you say that there's even an extended harm within the sense of security within these cities. This is to say that an increase in the large populations in cities such as Paris and Barcelona has led to a spike in crime rates within those cities. We think individuals or the locals don't feel safe because there's always large crowds parading within the streets that have led to instances of high crime within those cities, right? What is this to say? We think that government therefore is also necessitated to increase their spending on ensuring security for tourists that go to those cities, but also for the locals that exist within those cities. And we think that's an extended harm that side opposition needs to take care of within their side of the page. We think this is something that they need to engage. But then before I get to how significant limitations solve these problems, I'll take you. For this point, work, you have to explain why the alternative measures don't work with people both."

We don't see how individuals can go to off-season when they still have the opportunity to go in-season, right, where they go on holidays. We don't see how you're able to achieve that without limiting individuals from going to those tourist destinations during the seasons, right? But second, we say in your regulation, you actually remove the essence of tourism itself. We don't think you can be a scuba diver when you are not allowed to enter the waters of cages and shoot like the species that you want to explore from a distance. We think tourism itself loses its essence in that instance. We think this is something that you need to consider. But why do significant limitations actually solve this problem? First, we say that less participation within the acts of tourism per day limits the amount of harm individuals can inflict on the environment, limits the amount that individuals can inflict on those particular tourist sites. To say that you don't have to close down the Inca Trail in cities like Peru because of the amount of damage that you have within those cities. I think this is something that you needed to consider.

So, firstly, they tell us that people are, they tell us that none of our economic benefits are valuable at the point at which you're not getting proper wages, right? We think that you are getting proper wages for two reasons, right? So, firstly, local business owners have empathy towards people who are from their own region, from their country, right? Secondly, employees just work more productively when they are satisfied in their wage at the point at which you are making a ton of money off of tourists. The benefit that you get from your employees being fast, being able to out-compete other restaurants because they're satisfied, because they're able to afford nice meals and everything and not be malnourished, so they can't get the food there on time. We think that that benefit far outweighs the money that you would be paying them at the point at which you're making so much. Secondly, what else do they tell us? They tell us that our benefits to infrastructure do not matter because most of the money is spent on maintenance. Note that this is not true. Most of the money is spent on establishing the infrastructure in the first place. Because often, places that have a lot of tourism are not very well connected. They are not super interconnected with other regions, which is why they're unique, which is why they have so much tourism in their first place, right? And obviously, the most cost comes when you're first laying that rope. Retouching it costs much less. So the benefits are way, way bigger because of tourism. Without tourism, governments simply don't have an incentive to do this, often because, again, these regions are not inherently super-connected through other regions, through other areas of the economy."

They give us, well, it's not really a principle, but they mostly give us analysis on why people hate tourists, why there's so much conflict between locals and tourists. Firstly, we think this is grossly exaggerated, because if people were really throwing rocks at tourists everywhere, and I think tourists would pretty quickly be told about this by other tourists, by their friends and family, read about it on the internet, they would stop coming there gradually, right? I am not sure why the government needs to intervene here and suddenly cut tourism down, just suddenly creating a vacuum in the economy. We see that this has happened before when tourists feel unsafe, as they tell you that they do in these situations. For instance, in Egypt, when there was a lot of terrorism, tourists stopped coming pretty quickly. So if they really want tourists to stop coming, then that's already going to happen anyways. There's no reason to enforce this actively. But secondly, we don't think that this just happens a lot. We think that a lot of people depend on tourism. For instance, in Bali, as we told you, where 60% of the population works in tourism, I'm unsure why these people would be throwing rocks at the very people who pay them. Before I continue, I'll take a POI, yes. As we were already showing, I think that normal-time tourist destinations don't make it much money. How do you ensure that normal-time can continue to maintain their status in tourism? Okay. So, yeah. I'll be getting to this in a second. Now, secondly, yeah. Secondly, on this principle, please note that if they really care about the locals' wishes, I'm not sure why they would not be respecting those wishes Because those wishes are what prompted them to get into the tourism sector in the first place, to welcome tourists I am unsure why they would want to limit their autonomy in this case"

              "text": "Secondly, on their argument about the environment, what do they tell us? First off, tourists go scuba diving and shoot fish. I think it's a bit ridiculous, panel, because generally governments are not going to allow people to destroy the very nature that they are profiting off of via tourism. There are fines in place, there's often jail time. This includes both things like natural resources but also cultural heritage. We see that the person who defiled the Rome Coliseum recently got actual jail time for it. And that's just drawing graffiti on an old building. Secondly, please note that it is necessary to have tourists for conservation. For instance, national parks let in tourists so that they can finance upkeep, so that they can hire people to stop poaching or to stop overfishing, which are the real biggest threats to these communities, right? We see globally that the biggest damage to the environment comes not from, like, several tourists, you know, going diving. I'm not sure why this would happen. It is from people fishing illegally in areas that are already depleted of biodiversity, right? But secondly, yeah, it's also just really expensive to hire specialists in, like, for instance, restoring frescoes or keeping thousand-year-old concrete intact, right? And thirdly, even if there is damage, we think that it's less important that these things are perfectly preserved, for instance, in the case of cultural heritage like the Great Wall of China, and that their value, their cultural value is transmitted. Because here in Serbia, for instance, a major source of cultural heritage like the Great Wall of China, and that their value, their cultural value, is transmitted. Because here in Serbia, for instance, a major source of tourism is monasteries. But all these monasteries have a ton of restoration done on them. This doesn't make them any less valuable. It doesn't make them any less attractive. Because the point is not whether the rocks are the same ones that were placed there 100 years ago. It's why they were built, what culture they represent, and what they can teach us about history. Before I continue, I'll take another PYS. If the assumption is that no jobs are of tourism, what is the incentive to pay high wages when there is more supply than demand?"

              "text": "Yeah, that's basically it. Okay now on our extension about About why tourism is actively decreasing inequality I will give you two reasons as to why it is more equal than other areas of the economy So firstly tourism's primary resource is culture culture that cannot be monopolized and it cannot be bought. It originates within masses and is an expression of their way of life. It allows the poor to transform their hitherto invisible cultural capital into monetary capital to improve their lives. Poverty solutions like hot pots become unique, authentic specialty dishes. The traditional songs of fishermen and beggars, shunned as crude and unbecoming by locals for generations, become expressions of the most beautiful emotions. They can sing these in tourist areas for massive tips in dollars or in bars for a regular wage. Cave homes built into a mountainside or thatched-roof houses are transformed into miracles of resilience and unstated beauty. Real estate in the most impractical or secluded areas of a region skyrocket in value because their limitations have given them unique characteristics that set them apart from anywhere else in the world because this is attractive to tourists. Whether locals begin charging for tours or sell their houses to rich proprietors for tons of money, that money is probably pretty significant to these poor people who have never had access to any kind of proper working standards, but it's probably pretty affordable to rich proprietors, their economic but also social status is elevated immediately. This reduces economic inequality, but it also erases absolute standards of living. And note that this takes place regardless of whether rich people are able to replicate elements of culture. Tourism is a search for authenticity in the face of an ever-globalizing world. Tourists are going to want to go to the places where real people live, not just a replica of the city that they just came from. So what we have told you so far is that if you want to care for the people in the favelas like they talk about, the key is not to reduce tourism because, okay, first off, they never analyze why like tourist goods such as like, you know, you know, going to restaurants or like ready-made food, are the same goods that the people need. I'm unsure why powdered milk is something that tourists need en masse, so I'm not sure why the prices would rise that massively. In any case, we really want to care about these people. Please vote opposition. Thank you very much. For the second time this is Mason."

They said that if these areas are so bad, there will be a gradual decrease. We don't think that it's gradual. If people are having stones thrown at them, nobody is going to want to go to Venice, nobody is going to want to go to Barcelona. So I think the comparative here is that we reduce tourism now and we allow tourism to be sustainable for future. Instead of 100,000 individuals coming at one time in the year, we have 5,000 individuals coming in every single month of the year because the demand is too inelastic. So people are still going to come, but the locals won't be bad. On this side of the house, when individuals see that stones are being thrown at them, they are going to stop going to Venice. The idea here then becomes that all of the economic harms which they talk about happen on their side. The second reason why they can't access economic harms is specifically for natural tourist destinations. If these areas are degraded beyond use and nobody wants to go to them like the Great Wall of China where two-thirds of it are beyond use, like the Guadalupe Islands where they had to be closed because only eight fur seals remained because tourists were causing these seals to die. That is when we have the tourism sector completely dying. It is only on their side. We think they have to contend with this if they want to argue economic benefits. We think we are winning on that front. But finally, going on to Clash Matter, my first Clash Matter debate is where are we better for the tourism industry?"

              "text": "Before I move on, I'll take a point. So, what do you think is the incentive for landlords to rent out exclusively to tourists who, if they mess something up, can just go back to their country and then make the process soon then extremely difficult? Well, one, as you have analysed in all of your speeches, tourists have more money and are willing to pay more money. But two, I just don't think it's true that somebody can break my house and it will be really difficult for me to sue them. I think the legal system can cross through countries. The part would be called back to go into court. I don't understand the importance of that. First clash here. Where are we better for destinations? Three parts here. Firstly, on regulation. We already proved to you why regulations are not effective. We tell you that, one, there is something which makes the enjoyment less possible. For example, if you aren't allowed to do certain things at tourist destinations, like take photos of fish because you disturb them, of course that is going to be something which makes individuals not want to enjoy them. The comparative there on their side of the house is that they say that we're going to regulate. We try that this regulation doesn't work several times throughout all of our speeches. They need to prove to us why this regulation is able to work. They need to contend on that. But secondly, on the idea of sustainable tourism, we already try that the tourism on our side of the house is still going to exist. Individuals are still going to have jobs in tourism, they're just going to be on a lower scale. The impact of this then becomes that on our side of the house there's an incentive for the economy to diversify. Individuals are going to invest into making factories, into creating farms, into creating all of these other jobs which individuals can enjoy. All the comparative individuals are stuck in this cycle where they have to be in tourism? They have no other choice. But secondly, which other tourism is eventually going to fall on their side of the house? When tourism does fall, it will be an extremely stark shift. Nobody will have a job with that very much regrettable. Finally, we have to talk about the incentive to develop. We told you in first that the only reason we're going to get things like virtual tourism is when real tourism doesn't exist. We tell you that when there's more of an incentive to diversify your forms of tourism, to partake in things like eco-tourism, that is when you get tourism developed as an industry. Whereas in the comparative, when all of these tourists are coming physically, there is no incentive to change. We think that that is going to be much worse on their side. We think the reason why we're winning on this level of tourism is because we proved to you that, one, we get sustainable tourism. Two, we get development of the form of tourism on the side of the house, they get none of those. But secondly, on the environment, we told you in second that there's high levels of pollution. When there's high levels of pollution, people suffer. If the water is contaminated, I'm going to get sick. If I'm sick, I can't work a job. That's something which is so regrettable. My children don't get to go to school. But this doesn't only affect the tourism industry because in Bali, anybody who wants to drink water"

              "text": "three two things here, on the principle. We already told you that the hatred that these locals have is directly tied to the existence of tourists. It particularly looks like when it's overcrowding, when individuals are noisy, when they're polluting your waters, when they're disrespecting your culture, you are angry at them. We don't particularly understand why these individuals are going to be so happy at these tourists. We have forced them into a cycle of poverty. We have forced them to work these tourist jobs where they don't get a lot of money, as I already proved to you in my POI to them, because there is so much supply for this. Like if everybody wants to get a tourist job, I don't particularly understand why they are all going to be paid such high wages. Like fair and fine, maybe people will be empathetic, but I don't think that empathy is going to supersede capitalism. Capitalism is a system where you want to make money, people are going to give you minimum wage, within hours of your importance there. But moreover, we think that on the economic clash, we've told you quite a few things. In terms of price increases, we've said there's going to be universal price increases. Without that, the groceries are going to increase, individuals can't afford to buy birth control, individuals can't afford to buy birth formula for their children, their children are going to suffer, their children are going to starve. Secondly, individuals are going to be displaced. So even if they do get this level for their children. Their children are going to suffer. Their children are going to starve. Secondly, individuals are going to be displaced. So even if they do get this level of investment, only the tourists are going to benefit because the investment is going to be centralized on these tourist areas. On the comparative, locals are moved to the outskirts where there's no education, where there's no hospitals. This is very regrettable. So even in the best case, where there is investment, we make a useless investment when the locals don't benefit. What is the contention here? We already proved to you why investment is unlikely to happen because this money has to either go into maintaining these areas or into then investment. I would think if these areas aren't maintained, it is going to fall anyway. So again, we need to get a choice. Before I move on, I'll take one more. What are the incentives then on your side to actually develop infrastructure and maintain things that are not making any money? To create jobs. At a point in time in which you create factories and you create industry, people can get jobs. That is why the government does anything. Like, for example, in other countries where there isn't a tourist sector, people still have jobs. The government still performs their basic role. I don't particularly understand why the government suddenly becomes an evil actor who does nothing for the people just because there aren't tourists coming into the area. But even if that was true, we think it's very regrettable that the government is only doing things for tourists and is ignoring the local people. We think that is an evil government which we can't support. Finally, where are we better for tourists? Two things here. One, on the experience. We thought that when there's less tourists visiting, the experience overall better there's less overcrowding there's this noise pollution there's this whole growth pollution so those 5 000 tourists who are going to be going throughout all 12 months are going to be enjoying enjoying this tourism more they will be willing to spend more money when that is good but second in turn they're going to be better able to appreciate the culture because these 1 000 tourists can go with the tour guide and actually can learn things about this culture whereas on the comparative if there's 100,000 tourists, nothing is really going to happen on that front. Nobody's going to learn anything. What do we bring you on site provision? We bring you a safe hold. We appease the locals and we keep tourism safe. We are the winning side. We are proud. Thank you.

              "text": "case now. What did we tell you? Firstly, note that we tell you that we create jobs, right? We have two responses to this. Firstly, all that is low wages. Finally, we know that this is likely better than the alternative, right? In most of these regions, the alternative is, for example, living in, working in a factory, an efficient job, whatever. Note firstly that these wages are likely to be higher because we are better able to regulate this, right? That is, at the moment that you have big companies such as the marriott there's uh there's more international attention on them these companies are often based in the west therefore we are actually able to regulate that the that they are in fact paying these workers a minimum wage even if we are taking proposition at their absolute best and they say and saying that they are only going to get a minimum wage at least we are able to ensure that they actually get a minimum wage they have no means to do that at the moment that these locals are likely going to be working in sweatshops otherwise. Secondly, even if you do have a low wage, I mean, you get a massive amount of tips from tourists, right? That is, if you are a tourist, it is very customary to tip people in a hotel, to tip people in restaurants. This might seem very small to you, but if you're thinking that these tourists usually tip in euros and dollars, that foreign currency has a massive value if you convert it to the local currency right these tips are usually make up a massive percentage of these people's salary of these people incomes by dropping them of this they no longer are able to afford their basic needs secondly they tell you that this work is only in high season even if that is the case then they rely on that income to get through the rest of the year, right? Okay, on to infrastructure then. Before that, I'll take a POI. Even if it is true that significant limitation causes jobs to decrease, it's not better for governments to control this than for it to happen abruptly when the area either becomes unlivable or people no longer want to go there. Yeah, okay. So, a couple of responses to this, right? Firstly, notice uncertainty. They've never actually given us any analysis as to why this is the case, right? That is, sure, you see beaches on Hawaii eroding. However, Hawaii is still known for its beautiful nature. Even if it's not, it's still known as like an historically beautiful place to visit. Therefore, these people are still going to visit it, right? Sure, Rome has been vandalized. Rome sells a massive historical status as a beautiful place to visit. It's still going to be popular even 20 years from now. They've never given any sort of likelihood analysis as to why this is actually going to happen, right? But also, intuition check. If you see a child on a balance beam and you think that there's a chance that they're going to fall, is it intuitive to then push them over? No, obviously not. That is exactly what proposition is doing. Secondly, on infrastructure then. They say that this money is going to be purely doing secondly on infrastructure then they say that this money is going to be purely spent on maintenance therefore they don't benefit firstly note that tourists often pay taxes directly to the infrastructure they use right for example road taxes are really common for tourists to pay therefore we think that there's going to be enough left but secondly note that you can uniquely get fdi to develop these regions and attract them for example foreign companies coming in and setting up internet because that attracts tourists. No, there's infrastructure you cannot get from any other industry. That moves me on to my second point of analysis, as to why even if other industries are going to be developed on their side, why tourism is a uniquely better industry for these locals, right? Firstly, on labour, note that tourism is uniquely very dependent on human labor that is under industries such as fishing such as um like factories for example you're very easily able to replace that with machines therefore on tourism you get actually these jobs being filled by human labor rather than being placed by machines secondly on infrastructure tourism is the only industry where that infrastructure also benefits locals. A factory being set up in your city does not benefit you. A road being set up in your city or internet being set up in your city does benefit you. Those are two unique benefits that we get on our side of the house. At the end of the day, panel, note that at the end of the day, panel, we already take this cash massively because your economic well-being as a local has a much more direct impact on your quality of life. That is, even if my beaches are being littered, if I'm living in Indonesia, at least I have money to feed my family. This matters significantly more to me. But if we really care about the environment, not that these funds for preservation are a prerequisite to actually preserving this environment. Beaches erode naturally. We have to fund money to actually preserve these beaches. That is something that opposition can never get. At the end of the day, Paolo, vote for the true well-being of locals, vote opposition."

In the best case, tourists are annoying, but in great quantities, they are a scourge to the earth. Two arguments in the proposition case. Firstly, improving the life of the locals. And secondly, reshaping travel culture and combating climate change. Now, into the frame. We tell you, PAC, that the locals are the most important stakeholder in the debate. Because they are the people that still have to live in these major tourist destinations even when the tourists leave. They are the people that pay taxes to maintain these destinations. They are also the people that are building these cities throughout generations. They are, most importantly, the people that will have to stay there and deal with whatever consequences the tourists leave afterwards. Therefore, I urge the panel to care the most about locals in this debate. So now, how can we win this debate? Two things. First, we can prove to the panel that locals are better on our side of the house. Or then we can prove to the panel that locals are better on our side of the house, or then we can prove to the panel that climate change is significantly combated on our side of the house. Both ways, by proving either, we will win this debate."

This makes the lives of the locals extremely hard because it's very hard for me to get to a hospital, for example, to see my mother, if there's an excessive amount of crowd near the Colosseum and I have to get through the Colosseum to the hospital. It's not convenient for the locals. It's not great for the locals. Moreover, these tourists leave a significant amount of trash and litter and all kinds of disposable material behind. Moreover, they also consume much more than these locals. They consume much more plastic. They consume six times the amount of water than the locals consume. And this is not sustainable for these major tourist destination cities. Moreover, there is noise. There's significantly more noise with overcrowdings, with just, you know, the people walking through the streets or the crowd shouting when they see the Eiffel Tower because it's just so great for them. And even, no, you know, the people walking through the streets or the crowd shouting when they see the Eiffel Tower because it's just so great for them. And even, no, thank you, and even if we do not take these examples into consideration, just because I live in an apartment building and my rich neighbor landlord is renting their apartment continuously to tourists, when they continuously rent their Airbnb to tourists that do not care about regulation, that party every single night. It's very hard for me as a student to study for my medical school entrance exam. We tell you that all of these are directly reduced on our side of the house, because just by limiting the sheer quantity of tourists that visit, all of these problems are already significantly reduced on our side of the house. But now, secondly, we're also reducing the indirect harms that these tourists cause to these major tourist destinations. We tell you that these tourists, with their share quantity, they are directly pushing up the prices of all services. This means, for example, food prices, gas, every single thing that you can imagine are going up because there's so many of these tourists in these places that you know Everyone can just charge so much more but we tell you that this still does not benefit the locals Even if opposition tells you that why we tell you that the only people that are actually Benefiting from these are already the wealthy we tell you that it's only the rich landlords, those who have owned this property for already 100 years or big international or regional corporations. It's only these three kinds of people that actually benefit from there because they already own this property in these major, you know, tourist destinations. They have property there and they can rent them with extremely high prices to these local businesses. We tell you that these people will rent with a high price, and this makes the people who actually are in these places, these local business owners, they have to sell at a significantly higher price if they want to make any kind of return or profit from this. And this, again, makes the lives of those who don't do this much harder because you have to now pay at a much higher price. But you don't have this because you are a local. And we tell you that only tourists are able to do this because they are only temporary. They come for a fixed amount of one, two days. They're able to afford this because they think that, okay, I'm going to pamper myself for two days, pay a bit more. It doesn't matter for them. But it matters for these locals that have to stay there even when the tourists leave. That is not true in the status quo. The status quo is so that these tourist destinations, these cities are flooded with tourists everywhere. There is no local or tourist quarter because all of this is a tourist quarter. Everywhere in the city, there is so much demand from the tourists that all of the prices are spiked up. Moreover, we also tell you that this problem manifests even more when you look at housing prices. Because I already gave you the example of people renting more and more Airbnb's because they know that hotels cannot accommodate they simply cannot accommodate all of the people that want to go to paris that want to go to rome that want to go to bernice it's simply they know that they have they can you know rent more and more airbnbs at you know limited amount of time it's for them it's even more profitable to maybe keep them for a few days without anyone leaving living there then you know they are able to do that and you know still rent at a much higher price and, you know, still rent at a much higher price because when they know, when someone rents it, it's so much more profitable this way than to rent for a longer period of time for, you know, a local."

In our second speech we will explain how this motion leads to massive loss of current and future infrastructure. But first some responses regarding the quantity of tourists versus the quantity of tourists. On our side, we still can have and likely will have regulations and incentives for tourists to behave well. These also rebut all of your points. Note, panel, that the proposition cannot claim we have no regulations on our side of the house. We simply do not regulate the number of tourists, which does not mean we do not regulate certain behaviors. In the status quo, we see that regulation of behaviors is happening. A. Barcelona is banning Airbnbs, which rebutts all their point about housing prices. B. As we have seen in Copenhagen and Japan, they are offering perks like free lunches for tourists who use public transportation, who participate in cleanup activities, or support local businesses. Also, it rebuts the whole environment part. D, or we see that they are limiting the hours where alcohol can be bought to reduce bad behavior. E, we also see that there are stricter regulations and are being implemented, and there are increased fines for littering or damaging cultural sites, which are directly used for resuscitation or upkeep the very same. So these regulations are voting issues and popular among locals, which is the reason they are implemented."

              "text": "Moving up to my first argument, the lack of viable alternative industries. We see this because of geographic constraints. Most of these countries simply do not have anything else to offer. So they have no minerals to mine, they have infertile land, they have multiple regions that are hard to access. Prop would need to explain why any ship is feasible and most countries would have the geographical ability. So second, there's no incentives for companies to establish themselves in these regions. A, in many countries you have comparatively higher tax rates and workers' rights. For example, Ireland, which is a tax hub and has very low tax rates compared to any other European country or Asian country. B, therefore, it is very easy for companies to move to a place where they don't pay taxes, like Ireland, for example, or Bangladesh, where you don't have any workers' rights. So in countries like Italy, it is way harder to establish yourself. Our third point is investor trust. Because there are tourism-specific investments, you have first a lack of high-speed internet, you have lack of heavy-duty roads, and your priorities easy and quick to build roads for tourist purposes. You have lack of industrial ports because beaches were prioritized. Four, you have localized skills and knowledge gap. Hali specializes workforce which needs to be re-educated to fit in a new industry. A. The workforce in these tourist-centric regions has developed skills specifically tailored to the tourism industry. Tour guides, hotel managers and cultural event coordinators possess skills that are directly tied to local tourism. So B. There is a lack of knowledge for new sectors. Developing alternative industries would require new skills and expertise that the local population currently lacks, for example, programming, mining or fishing. This is expensive and relies on the cooperation of the local people which is not guaranteed. We believe the fear of economic instability bothers the willingness and the ability of individuals to invest in learning skills. This means even if taxes and worker's rights would not be the problem, the local infrastructure and population will. We think it is unlikely that government should be able to attract and lobby companies and investors to move there. Historically, they are a huge competitive disadvantage against other countries who have worked on this relationship for decades and also they have way less to offer them because infrastructure, as I already mentioned, wasn't built and the knowledge was focused on tourism. This means that investors are not going to want to invest before these accommodations are built. And without investment, it is unlikely they will be able to build them. Because at the same time, the tourist countries are missing out on their biggest income, which is tourism. Especially if we look at the investment on a comparative, we are losing out on massive amounts of money. Currently, there is high investor trust in these regions because they have huge amounts of people coming in and the direction is increasing. Before I move on to my second argument, I will take it away."

              "text": "Argument two, massive unemployment and economic regression. How does this happen? We have direct job losses. The tourism industry directly employs millions in sectors such as hospitality, transportation and retail. Significantly reductions in numbers mean significant amount of people will lose their jobs. There are less customers, less visitors, and less clients. So we also have indirect job losses because tourism supports numerous of other industries such as agriculture, this means food supplies for restaurants, and manufacturing goods for tourists. The loss of tourism would ripple through the supply chain. Also, third point is financial burden on the state. We would have massive unemployment benefits and business support needed. The state would need to provide unemployment benefits to displaced workers and provide business and previous business owners. This would strain public finances. This would require reallocating budget resources and impacting public services like healthcare and education. This is especially bad at the same time you significantly limit the biggest income source of the government, which is tourism. So, then we have a psychological and social impact. The fear and uncertainty. Even a slow implementation of tourist limits would create fear and uncertainty among the local population, undermining confidence in economic stability. This is crucial because the development of new industries is dependent on people spending money on this new industry and supporting its development. Why will this not be the case? A. People fear the unknown. They have worked in tourism for decades. Their whole family is specialized in it. This means when the government passes this policy, they will fear for their existence even if the government promises unemployment benefits or other compensation. First, people are often mistrustful of politicians and promises because they are rarely keep them. Second, also they cannot imagine how else the government could get money if not through tourism. This leads to people behaving extremely risk-averse, and they will only spend money on their very basic necessaries because they are saving money for hard times to come. This includes additional education. So note that the basic for economic growth is that people are willing to spend money on goods and services. The more people spend, the more money is circulated and added to the economy. This means that people can have jobs and pay employees. If the amount of money is now significantly restricted because we limit tourism significantly, people start hoarding and saving money rather than spending. This leads to a nationwide regression. This means even if some other industry was planned to develop, it will not be able to do so because people will be unwilling to spend money on goods and services from that industry. And investors will not want to invest in a regressive economy because it is extremely unstable and violent. Never be proud of your course. I'm going to ask you to not hold this. I'm going to ask you to sit down. Will it be possible for me to be able to hear you?"

So, what will tourists do now that there are these major restrictions? What will happen? We here in Team Proposition have identified approximately three types of travelers. Number one, those who will go anyway to these major tourist destinations, right? Number two, those who will go somewhere else, either within the country or within some other country or within their own country. And three, those who simply will not go. Number one, those who will go anyways. We have to remember that despite the fact that these restrictions still exist, despite the fact that we are putting restrictions on, people can still go to these locations. We have to remember the example of Venice, right? Venice has implemented these restrictions, but there are still millions of amateurs who go there every day. Who go there at all times, right? Simply because we are limiting the amount of tourists doesn't mean that they won't go. Not to mention that because we have this entrance fee, which team opposition doesn't seem to want to talk about, it means that we can still uphold the economy of the city, and we can still help these tourists, we can still help these tourist industries, and they will still get their money. Not to mention that with this entrance fee, we can also ensure that these major cultural sites can uphold themselves, that they have the money to invest into themselves so that they are not eroded due to the amount of tourists that go there. Not to mention that now that there is no more over-tourism, now that there is no more over-crowding, these natural sites and these very important cultural artifacts can stay and that they can stay and they will not be eroded due to the massive amounts of people that go there every day. For example, when it comes to the Greek islands, a very big problem with the Greek islands right now is that their vineyards are slowly dying, right? Because there's simply so many people going there every day. There's simply so many people visiting these sites every day. And it is estimated that by 2045, the Greek islands will no longer have vineyards, simply because of the fact that there are so many tourists that go there all the time, who stomp on those places, who stomp on them, make the soil worse, and generally do not let the vineyards breathe. Which is not just destroying the natural beautiful sights of these islands, but also destroying a wine industry."

Then, when we look at the people who go somewhere else, right, team opposition is very worried about the economic loss that may happen from this. However, we remind you, panel, that we are only talking about major tourist destinations. Now that people cannot or do not want to go to major tourist destinations, they can still go to other places in the country. They can still go to smaller towns. They can still travel to other places, meaning that even if they do not go to Paris, they can go to other places in France. A lot of people want to go to Paris because it's French, right? Because they see it as the French capital. Because they see it as the culture capital of France. However, now that they might not want to go to these places because of these restrictions, it's still very possible that those people who wanted to go to Paris because it's French culture will still be interested in going to other places in France, meaning that these since it's still very possible that those people who wanted to go to Paris because it's French culture will still be interested in going to other places in France, meaning that these jobs that the opposition is so worried about can simply continue in these smaller locations, which will now also have more tourists in them. Then, when it comes to the group three type of people who simply will not go, we believe that, yes, well, it is very important to talk about these cities and the major economic impacts that happens within these cities. We also believe that one of the major things that we have to talk about is the fact that climate change is ever getting worse, right? Climate change is only worsening. And what we have to do is try and combat it in any way that we can. And something that we have to remember is that in order to make big change, we first have to take small steps, right? And we believe that limiting the amount of people who can go to these first destinations, limiting travel in general, is a very good way of taking that first step. Because one of the major reasons of climate change is due to the fact that we are simply, is that we are consuming too much, we are spending too much, we are living these extravagant lives without thinking about what it does to the ecosystem, without thinking about what it does to these areas. And this small change of limiting who can go can in the future lead to bigger precedents. Not to mention that this small change is fixing a massive issue for locals, right? As we talked about within our first speech, it is fixing the problem of overcrowding, it is fixing the problem of these places being too expensive, it is fixing the problem of locals not being able to properly live their lives in these cities where they grew up, in these cities in which they pay taxes to, in these cities in which they have so much emotional attachment to. We believe that this is one of the best ways in order to ensure that not only these cities have the best upkeep for themselves, but also that the locals can stay within their communities and can have this national pride within their beautiful places. And because of all these reasons, we are so happy to propose, because we believe that even with these small steps, we can make big changes. Even with these small steps, we can do so much good within the world not only for the cities for locals but also for the environment thank you All right. We don't limit people, we limit hearts."

So, you also point out that your entrance fee is enough for the economy, but you agree that millions of tourists are less on your side, so how high would your entrance fee have to be? A million times as high? This is just simply unrealistic on your side, and you are not facing the economical harms that my first speaker has mentioned quite thoroughly.

              "text": "Second point of rebuttal on the pricing being spiked by mass tourism. I told you on my POI this is simply untrue and locals are actually profiting from charging more to the tourists because the spheres where tourists and citizens compete for services is limited. What do I mean by that? First of all, different consumption patterns lead to limited overlap in high-demand goods. For example, tourists don't buy a significant quantity of basic goods or utilities, but rather go to fancy restaurants, souvenirs, and local artifacts. There is no shortage in the goods the locals actually need, which means the price stays quite constant. Second of all, in the rare case that they do compete, as you mentioned, housing and transport, there are easy implementations on our side taken to separate the competition. First of all, differentiate it through a pricing system, where, for example, citizens and local students have passes in public transport to pay less. Politicians that implement this, as my first speaker has explained, are extremely popular, which means this issue will be likely solved through voting. Second, tourists just pay more for attractions, like fish markets in Barcelona, taxis, restaurants in Asia, or Thailand's national parks, which means the revenue is reinvested in the same industry, so the infrastructure or the buses or the drivers are just upgraded so the locals aren't harmed because this balances out due to the more money they get from the tourists. Third of all, tourists prefer convenience, so they will opt for private transport options like a rental car, and this reduces the strain on public transport, so there's not really an overlap. On the housing issue, tourists often seek accommodations near major attractions, not in the residential areas, so this is not an actual problem. Second, if too much overlap happens, measures will be taken, as we see in Barcelona, banning Airbnb, and then government will likely implement seams to offer registered housing offers for the tourists, so they can, again, control the accessibility and pricing and free of housing for the locals. So this is, once again, mitigated. And even in the worst case where locals now have to drive a bit further to get to the next big local store, the money and benefits they earn from selling to all these high volumes of mass tourists more expensively just simply outweighs this minor possible part. Now, on"

              "text": "the point of vulnerable locals, we have to focus on where the delta is between mass tourism and your side of tourism. On your side, we have basically exclusively large chains like the Crowne Plaza, Hilton, McDonald's, that still exist because of market dominance and economies of scale. Comparatively, on our side, we additionally have support and opportunity for small and family-run businesses, hotels, and restaurants. Why is this? First of all, this bill will perfect. When major hotels are crowded, fully booked, or too expensive due to high demand, tourists turn to smaller local businesses. This only happens with tourism because of this high threshold. Second of all, economies of scale. Shades offer competitive prices and consistent quality, which small businesses can simply not match without the high volume of tourists frequenting their stores and restaurants and hotels every day. Furthermore, the extended tourism reach, which leads to infrastructure improvements and economic growth in the proximity, which extends beyond the major destinations to nearby smaller towns and coastal areas, as we see in Dubrovnik, where the tourists also go to see the surrounding coastline, but still have Dubrovnik as the main incentive to go there in the first place. Furthermore, reductions in mass urban migration that happens due to this because the establishment of transport lines to these surrounding areas reduces the need and burden for residents to migrate to urban centers in order for better opportunities. So they can commute easily, and this spillover effect also gives them jobs in more places. And these points specifically address your most vulnerable stakeholder. You think the problem for them is overcrowding, but the problem is poverty and unemployment that you cause on your side."

              "text": "Now, on your point on environmental destruction. First of all, if tourism exists on both sides, how does the shift in environmental improvement happen on your side? This is the quality versus quantity thing again, where we explain to you that we have regulations that specifically address the biggest harms that tourists cause and on the other hand we have the resources due to the tax revenue from tourism and incentive and incentive to enforce better um like environmental sustainability because we also want to make this place nicely livable for locals and tourists now rebuttal on limits being beneficial for tourists this is simply not true because first of all on scale you are excluding so many of the people you are visiting. Second of all, it's not beneficial because you lack the high volume of tourist revenue which is necessary to establish and invest and maintain the infrastructure, which I will go into my argument. And then it is just simply more important for the locals. Last point of rebuttal I want to go into before I go into my argument is the culture point. First of all, there is the incentive to keep the culture because it makes it attractive both for tourists and locals. Second, we need the money to get generated from tourism to maintain and even live out this culture. For example, Mexico has cultural festivals where tourists and locals can enjoy the side-by-side, but the locals need the money from tourism to even live and be able to enjoy this. Now, on to my argument why massive loss of infrastructure for current infrastructure and future projects happen. Well, we're losing the tax revenue that is exclusive to tourism because, first of all, they majorly rely on tourism in these destinations, and second, due to the inherent locality of tourism, which means that they cannot relocate to avoid taxes because they're actually specifically located there. And tourism just simply has a high tax revenue because there are so various channels. Hotel taxes, overnight fees, sale taxes on goods and services, and entry fees to attractions. So this is not like a one-time thing as your access fee, but rather the tourists every day going for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or hotel, and buying some expensive souvenirs on the way. So what will the impact be on your side? You simply have a loss of investment as well as a loss of tax revenue and thereby reduced government funding. My first speaker has already explained to you why this is detrimental to the people facing unemployment because the government no longer has the budget and the funds to help them. And second, how this leads to them being super scared and insecure to join with any other sectors, even though these other sectors are unlikely to happen anyway due to all the reasons why tourism is exclusive to these places. But going deeper into my question. Is the state government not so dependent on tourism because they don't deteriorate during the off-season? Of course they are. Major tourist destinations are major tourist destinations. This means they are majorly and significantly reliant on tourism to fund them and to make them, like, that is their main income area. So, where does this income lead to? This income currently is being used for infrastructure development, because mass tourism necessitates improvement for infrastructure, roads, airports, electricity and life airlines, as well as sanitation and waste. As well as, like, healthcare and emergency. You mentioned that crowded hospitals are a problem, but at least we have hospitals on our side because tourism is generating the money to actually build these things in the first place. Second of all, tourism is an incentive for enhanced safety measures because the incentive is on the one hand, the locals want to protect their national heritage and they want a positive reputation for more tourists to come, and they have the capability due to the tax revenue from tourism that we have exclusively on our side on this scale. The result is they hire more police officers, install surveillance cameras, and improve emergency response services. All of these benefits are also accessible to the locals due to the spillover effect I mentioned, simply to the state funding having a higher budget, the auxiliary industry trickle-down effect, and the spaces for progress being established, because we have the money to at least establish the spaces that they can then build on later on. The alternative on your side is not better, and restricting tourism will significantly slow such developments and hinder overall progress in the whole region. We don't limit people, we limit harms."

Maybe it is now that investors don't come in the status quo for any other field in these countries but the tourism field, purely because the tourism is the main field that is profit-giving.

Secondly, we told you that tourism is still in place. We told you that, yes, we're significantly limiting the amount of tourists. We are. However, firstly, the amount of tourists is still there.

People do not feel good inside in the status quo. People are not feel good in the status quo. People are not benefiting more from the tourist destinations. They said it right in their previous speech. These people are poor. These people are unemployed. And this is because the state does not care for them. They do just develop the area of tourism, forgetting about the services for locals, about their well-being. On your side of the state, it doesn't have the funds to finance these people, and people are massively unemployed because there's less tourists. How are they not having it there?"

And if they really care about the environment, they have to explain why on their side of the house, anything is better for the environment. Because although they have still not managed to prove that there will be any alternative industry to prevent this mass unemployment, let's say they would actually have done this. Then they would still not have been able to prove why any other industry is better, right? Look, how is mining good for the environment? How is animal agriculture good for the environment? It is absolutely not. And if a lot of jobs are dependent on any other industry, like for example mining, it is very hard to bring in regulations like making mining more eco-friendly. However, with tourism, it is very, very easy to make minor adjustments, like for example, offering people free lunch so that they help in beach cleanups, which is far harder to do in any other industry, right? And we're telling you that countries already have preemptive measures, like rewarding tourists for being, like for clean up or something. And even if only 1% ups in because of the scale we get in our sense of the house, that's still a lot of people who are doing positive stuff, like for example, beach cleanups, right? So at worst, the environment is symmetric on both sides of the house."

Look, a lot of this stuff is just generally caused by climate change, which is not completely exclusive to tourism. And secondly, in cases where it's really, really so bad, again, we have other regulations, like erosion, we just tell, like, we just put policemen there and tell the tourists, hey, please don't litter, which is easier to do in our sense of the house, because now we actually have more capital in order to finance this sort of surveillance. And now the doubt of this debate is that the side of proposition has still not managed to justify this ban. So what they've told me is, okay, some tourists are disrespectful. Look, we agree.

On their side of the house, you only have crown plaza because there's no need for local business because crown plaza is not as expensive um as it is on our side of the house we're also telling you that on scale the large scale of tourists allows for so much monetary gain which contributes so much to the local economy right on proposition the severity of impact is so much worse because workers do lose jobs and people are not willing to spend money as pointed out in first speech meaning all the areas of the economy suffer.

Second one, on economy and how we win here on scale. You say there's still some tourism jobs, but like, let's look at it. If there's one of 100 people that still have a job and the rest no longer have jobs but face unemployment and uncertainty and fear but no longer have noise complaints. This just does not weigh up to the most beneficial economy of tourism which gives them all employment, which gives their state money, which stabilizes the prices for locals and oftentimes Dubrovnik finances the whole of Croatia's sanitation system with their tourism revenue. This is something we can only achieve on scale on our side. I think that is also the logical fallacy where you point out that locals pay taxes. No, the tourists are paying these taxes and we need these tourist taxes to stabilize the life for the locals. Now, on the third"

So on our side because we have the money from the tourists and the incentive to create this hospital for the tourists and the locals. So on our side we exclusively have the high enough budget to invest in these things. And as I told you, with the scale, Dubrovnik really finances the whole nation's sanitation or healthcare.

You've also not addressed here the fear and uncertainty of the people, and you just pointed out that they might go somewhere else.
