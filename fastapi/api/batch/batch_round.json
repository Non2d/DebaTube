First, we kind of like doubt the premise that you can publish a book during your criminal ages, but let's assume you can. Look, the difference of publishing a book is that in the case of publishing a book, you're reflecting the fact of why you had to commit a criminal, and it's showing a sense of guilt in committing a crime, right? This is different from voting, when prisoners try to legitimize their views and agree to more radical changes in the case of catering to politicians, right? I think there's a fundamental difference between public books, and we don't think that should be a metric for allowing prisoners to vote.

First, is as I explained earlier, and this will directly clash with the argument about what is voting. We think voting is a privilege, and this privilege comes with certain responsibilities and the responsibility to obey the law. The fact that you are a prisoner is the act of refusing to obey the law. That means that the state is justified in removing certain rights in order for them to make this kind of certain rehabilitations, right? I think that the fact that you became a prisoner and disregarded the law means that you shouldn't be able to be allowed to benefit from the democratic system that you yourself decided to reject."

Prisoners are knowing the best why they did crime and what is the psychological thinking of why they committed crime, right? So let me take committed crime, right? So let me take, like, such, like, several cases, right? For example, like, the cases of robbing, right? When prisoners does robbing, like, they, like, rob things, like, of other people but like the reason will be like mostly like the social like um like the financial problem or something right so the financial problem is now like given like those prisoners like incentive to do like robbing so as we see like those kind of cases, prisoners are having a problem that social structure is now not fulfilling to those prisoners. So to that extent, we can reflect prisoners' opinion that they have lack of social welfare and government can like notice what is the problem that is occurring and can like contribute to this society right the like other cases are like also like clear that for example like murder right when murder is happening those prisoners can only know why they murder, right? What is the, like, what is the reason they did, and what is the issue, right? Most of the time, like, stress are, like, given, right? So we can't, so as we take this motion, we can contribute to change this society and reflecting opinions right the impact of this argument is that government can't know even if like prisoners like investigation are given and like psychological like investigation are given right the only one that can know about the consequences and circumstances of prisoners, it's the prisoner's own, right? So it's a beneficial thing to take this debate. So lastly, let me briefly, like, compare between the government and opposition, right? So the opposition is like keep talking about like the principle of the argument and why this is unjust for taking but they didn't like even talk about like what is the certain impact of like not taking and They didn't like really extend about that. Our side of the house are clearly talking, we can contribute those opinions to this society and make a world with prisoners and those citizens can live safe.

We think this is inhumane for government to try to defend. But let's take the best, best case scenario. That was the whole rhetoric about how like you need to find a middle ground, right?
