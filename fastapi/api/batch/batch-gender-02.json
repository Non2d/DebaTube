Second of all, why the discourse that you produce is inherently counterproductive through recasting, and why we're better on our side. Before I move into that, some basic definitions. We define art and pop culture as generally entertainment that's created for either self-expression or sending a message. We think this oftentimes means mass media. We're talking about things all the way from movies to plays sorts of viewed art, because we're talking purely about actors. Second of all, we're talking about creating new lead characters, we're talking about those characters that have more screen time, have more agency, that are protagonists, that forward the plot. When we're referring to minorities, we're talking about all sorts of minorities, ethnic, ethnic, essential, or religious minorities, even women, et cetera, those are the kinds of minorities that we're willing to talk about in this debate. What are the differences between creation and recasting, to make this extremely clear? Creation is when you have a new storyline, when you have no existing, sometimes no existing, families that are a hype for your directors or your writers. When you're fundamentally centered around, oftentimes, the identity of your character, you're constructing them from scratch, recasting fundamentally one that comes with emotional baggage, something that comes with emotional ties, expectations, where oftentimes they are played originally by a majority character, and now you're simply changing the actors behind them. That is the difference between both of those. We don't—sorry. So, onto our first argument. Why do we think art itself—Lemore exempted? Before I conclude with that, yes. Why should the majority of famous characters so far stay dominant majority? We think that staying the dominant majority is fine. We think introducing a new host and diversity and diaspora for everybody to have somebody to look up to is a better role than the one they suggested. Before that, two yardsticks for this debate. Firstly, we think that the main goal is also to have minorities feel that they're exempted and feel that they're empowered. Secondly, that majorities are also changing their minds and optics."

              "text": "First argument, why do we think we achieve that better on our side of the house. First argument, why do we think they're able, why do we think the art will be better on our side? We need to find the issue with recasting comes in three lenses because it's constantly an onslaught of pressure to make sure you balance the representation on either side. I mean, keep the studio producers aren't great at deciding how we're going to write a character. So we need three major ideas of how the character turns out. One, they either come out as hollow and superficial stereotypes, and the kinds of that are just simply grafted upon, and just change the actor, and the character fundamentally remains the same. Why do we think this is the case? Because it only is very easy and expedient for students to use virtue signaling as a feature of attracting more audiences. They think in their minds of the corporate boards and law. As long as you have a black actor in a white role, it's fine. We can mix and match the best of both markets. This is the kind of lazy advertising we see in certain kinds of movies, right? If we're going to look at, for example, Ghostbusters, they try to engage the feminist agenda, but the most they get through touching this is by inverting stereotypes and having Chris Hemsworth just act more feminine. Meaning that in and of itself isn't sufficient as a representative of feminist movement as large, what it is is simply just changing one or two characteristics and calling it a day, that's the kind of thing we don't support because the real messages are lost. Second of all, right, the kinds of production that try to balance identities and why this is an issue. Because fundamentally some characters just cannot be changed. Some characters have characteristics that are just simply attached to the previous identity of the majority that they hold. What does this mean? It means, for example, if you try to make Superman, for example, just be black, and just change that entirely, it doesn't function. Why? Because the character's experience of, for example, black people about police brutality, etc., are directly antithetical to the rest of the things that a policeman can do to the rest of the things that Superman is. He's fundamentally impervious and damaged. He doesn't have to care about what other people think about him. He's fundamentally working with police all the time. He don't have to stand up against any more repression. The fact that these characters intrinsically exist in a way that empowers them directly because they came from majority classes, sometimes means they're just unable to be connected or changed in terms of racial characteristics, right? That's the kind of thing that you don't have. Or another example still, for example, imposing an LGBT character, or one that was originally straight, adding in new scenes that don't actually apply, or adding in plans of dialogue that sometimes might be, for example, offensive, and don't actually have any, might make you offensive, that's the kind of harm that you have. Thirdly, the kinds of studios that become super sensitive, that try to basically, essentially rewrite the character by adding too many characteristics. Within these cases, what you basically do is have a caricature. What you do is reduce the original character into one that's just very close to ethnic minority. As a result, what you essentially have is one that just accentuates all their stereotypes to best make it possible and show that we have actually considered it so much. What does it mean to you who is the actual character? What does it mean to you who is the active element that they have? What do we have on the counter-fanzhou? We have a better role because fundamentally, we have one where you create new characters. Where their identity and their expression can be integrated as one. Where they no longer have to deal with this balancing act of which character fits what role. What does this mean? we have one where you create new characters, where their identity and their expression can be integrated as one. Where they no longer have to deal with this balancing act of which character fits what role. What does this mean? It means that we have characters that explore nuance, people that actually source stories about individual experiences. And we like to show that empirically these things are more resonant within the minority communities. Look at the popularity of films like Moonlight, fundamentally you create new characters of Black Panther, fundamentally you create new characters that resonate with people's own struggles, rather than try to integrate struggles into a storyline that doesn't match, meaning that's the one that reaches out to more people and is better about. Second of all, you create a structural incentive, where producers are forced to, for example, create new characters that just simply think about it more, right?"

              "text": "But they appeal to niche markets where they don't have to balance the incentives of both things across the board, they have a better incentive to create better characters. That's what we have. And let's just do some simple weighing, right? The probability we have to balance is if we see a world where more producers try to balance the act versus more producers trying to create new characters, what do we have? You have a probability that you mess up and mess up badly all three scenarios. Or you have our world where you try, and sometimes your movies don't take off. But when they do, they're so much more empowering. They're so much more meaningful. That's the weighing we have today in this debate. That's why we think we're so much stronger. What are the impacts if their movies got wrong? It means you have stereotypes. It means you disempower social justice movements because you picture these minorities in positions of power. It makes it seem like their struggles are no longer relevant because look, they're already powerful. Meaning you don't have any sort of benefit in that way. Second argument, why do you worsen discourse, and why is it counterproductive? Understand the basic message that you're sending, when you basically have a minority put into the role of a majority, right? It means that they always have to live in the shadow. It means that this person could be James Bond. He could be just like him. It means you can constantly live in the shadow, perceptually, instead of being an individual, you're just one of them. You could be like them. I mean, that's the kind of harm that you have, is, you're just one of them, you could be like them. I mean, that's the kind of harm that you have, is that you're not trying to show that you can be them, that you can be yourself, and that your individual traits do matter. We think when you're trying to force somebody into a mold, you only reduce their individual characteristics into something that's palatable. I mean, that is disgusting. Second of all, right, we think you also create preemptive firestorms, right? When you have issues of reverse incentives, when you have voices that are prejudiced because of their emotional ties to the original character, meaning that they say things like, I'm not racist, but I disagree with this character being portrayed in this way. Why is this an issue? Because then studios make compromises, either they do the character, make them blind, which is worse. Second of all, when the minorities themselves speak out against the representation, and they want more, it means that producers can sometimes give cheap responses, right? Take the example of Iron Fist, where there was a minor Asian committee, strived to try and change a character to an Asian, the producers couldn't, what they did was just quickly say, oh, we'll add this random Asian character and create him, and try to model all the three characters as one. I think that's worse off for your side of the house, because what you have, therefore, is perverse incentives for these kinds of producers, right? Because they're reactionary and rushed. Fundamentally, what you have is a situation where you disempower the minority, where they don't have the capacity to actually express themselves, where they constantly view in the shadows. For all those reasons, we are so proud to propose. Thank you. Please come forward."

              "text": "The next thing I'd just like to note on framing is that this motion supervising contacts comes out of the trend of remakes happening all the time. Things like IT, Ghostbusters, literally all of the Disney movies are currently being remade, showing you that there is a constant demand for these remakes, and minorities in this instance are very likely to fill these roles. That being said, looks like an opposition to material. Now, if there's first and second argument, we're going to answer together because they're basically two sides of the same coin. It's telling you that they don't want minorities to be overshadowed and that minorities shouldn't have to exist within roles that are in remaking. A couple of really big problems with this. First, listen to the language that they bring you about the characterization of these roles. They tell you that you lose the active characters whenever black people are put in white people roles. They tell you things like scenes of gayness do not apply to the character in a remake film. We fundamentally reject this characterization. We tell you that whenever minorities are recasting these roles, they actually bring something to the table. That it is not bad for a minority to be in these roles, and that it does not violate the intrinsic aspects of this death. We reject their language and characterization to begin with. The second thing that we would tell you is that you can use their own words against them as to why you're more likely to get tokenization. They tell you that studio directors cannot write for people of color. Note that on the comparative level, their side is so much worse. Why is this the case? Because studios are about cash. That means that insofar as the hegemonic majority already maintains a stranglehold on what people want to consume in media, it's more likely that you're just going to get white characters from rom-com than you ever will people of color if that's all it is. That means the only way to make cash is if your movie is about the minority experiences of that individual. That's so harmful because they themselves tell you that studio directors cannot direct for people of color. We would tell you on our side of the house that those characters already have been dead because they were made so in the first place with things like in their original ones. The next thing that we would just like to say is combating their characterization that you know it's important that people have representation in these things and that whenever you're recasting or remake that you don't actually have representation for your people. I would tell you that me as an Asian American I'm more than simply the fact that I'm Asian. I can do normal things, right? We don't think it's bad for there to be minorities in movies doing normal things. With that being said, let's look at our first substantive argument about improving industries. Two ways that you increase the number of people of color under our side of the house. First, movie studios have internal implicit quotas for who they're willing to create movies about. Note this clashes directly with their first substantive argument because it shows you why. Even if tokenization is less bad on their side of the house, you're not going to get as many movies about people of color. Movie studios like Paramount, Pixar, A24, all of them have to have internal implicit quotas about what they're going to support, what they want to show people. We need to just mean things crucially, like there will never going to be two Mulans in the same year because hey, one is enough, right? We already got this tale out about Asian representation. No need to have more stories about the same minority experience. We would tell you on the outside of the house, you could have two movies with two black female leads that are different in storyline and capabilities and things of that nature because they fundamentally tell different tales. On their side of the house, because they want it to be about this single story of one person living throughout their minority experience, they have to have that same story told twice because they themselves tell you it has to be more similar. The second way that you improve industries is by decreasing the barrier to entry for making these films. Note that the creation of a new movie is easier on our side of the house, because movie studios still want to make remakes right now. They know that they're probably running out of ideas, which is why you see this huge trend towards making remakes in the status quo. In that instance, we think it's entirely likely that because they do not want it to be the exact same as the original, that they're going to cast people of color in their main roles. Additionally, because they know that they have to appeal to a wide audience, so it's better to have people cast in this. Why does this argument matter in this round? Because we show you that we increase the number of movies being made. So even if the type of representation you get on both sides of the house is qualitatively equal, you have to default to our side because we show you that you get more representation for these individuals. Our second substantive argument is going to be about approving the audience internalization. Note that the most important thing is telling the narrative that not all ethnic majority or heteronormative stereotypes about whether or not you're male should be what's considered as regular. We do not believe that movies that are telling stories about everyday life, like rom-coms and things of that nature, should only tell the stories of white individuals. And we think that the most famous films, the ones that are the most iconic, are always reflective of this majority. For example, The Sound of Music is one of the most famous films of all times, and it is completely indicative of this. We think that with the idea of remakes, these new characters already have three-dimensional development embedded within their storyline. That's why they were so famous to be remade in the beginning because they already have that depth of analysis and character. We think that beyond their minority status it's going to be beneficial because one, before I move on to this, I'll take your point. The point on which I character that doesn't reflect the actual experiences minority people have in real life, what used to give to those people? That's completely a lie, right? I as a minority experience some of the same things that white people also experience. I also experience love and loss. These things are communicated in movies. I do not as a minority only have to be in movies about how I'm oppressed. That's ridiculous. Moving on. We would tell you that being a minority in a free cast in a film makes your life beyond minority status. This directly responds to the POI we just get. Because you don't always have to have representation in your culture because you have that as an individual growing up in a minority culture. For example, Indian kids grew up to the tales of Krishna."

That's something you get on our side of the house where individuals are able to live real lives. But additionally, we think that you're going to benefit the audience perception whenever you have things like people of colour recast in these roles. Why is this the case? Because remakes happen on two fronts. Either first, it's people who are growing up and seeing these remakes for the first time. We think it's better for that because they see the normalization and internalization that these people can just be regular people. The second thing is that older people are going to want to see the new movie. So even if you look at some backlash on their side of the house, which they say is going to happen, we say it's a good thing. It's good to force yourself to confront the racism that you endure. Why do you think it's okay for Ariel just to only be white? We think these are good things to confront because it increases the amount of discourse.

Oh, like one, these characters are inherently complex. They explore, they contain depth within them that was wider popular in the popular in prospects and this still helps minorities because minorities feel things like love as well, like they feel common experiences. Here's the issue, they never told us why those sort of experiences were exclusive, right? That's to say, Black Panther, our original black character also experiences things that are universal, like struggles with loyalty. The one thing that we achieve exclusively is the unique nuances of this identity that you get from having a character that's explicitly surrounded around that identity and those traits. They never told us why that was a trait that was even necessary in this debate. So at a point where they say the only thing we get is humanisation because of comment tropes,"

Again, the reason why this argument doesn't stand is because we already gave you some analysis as to why this is probably more true on their side of the house, right? That is to say, when companies have to engage in virtue signaling, the fact that there's a character already implicit, that you're grafting an external appearance onto a character means that you weren't considering the way in which an actual individual of that minority identity would have acted within those circumstances in the first place. Because there's an existing character that we're trying to graft characteristics onto. At a point where you make that characterization more of that identity experience, that means because you weren't even considering that in the first place, you resort to tired stereotypes, you resort to tropes. Like, compare that with our counter-model, in which we suggested that producers probably have more of an active need to think about the way minority characters exist within these roles, the ways that they're paid, the kinds of experiences that a character like this would have if they were of a minority identity, and they had to start from scratch. That means that you can't resort to the sort of things they talk on you, make no state panel. It's probably true that stereotypes happen a lot more on their side of the house.

The problem with using an existing character is that all these traits have already been predetermined. A plot has been written, the end result of where this character is going to go has already been determined. And when we just simply graft on a minority identity, inherently that means that you get a lot less genuine reflection of how minorities live their lives. So at that point you get just far less accurate and disingenuous representation of how this works. What does this mean? They ignored my partner's entire, like half of the case, right? This idea about discourse and why perception gets so much worse. Now thank you, I'll take a P.O.I. after a rebuttal, right? At a point where it's simply, like, people can simply say it is the same character but with just a different colour. That's where you get in power people to say, I'm not racist, but they're encroaching upon our cultural stereotypes. That's where you get the sort of outrage and reaction that really disempowers the ability to get minority characters on stage.

We suggested that if that effort was focused on creating original characters, you'd probably get a lot more efficacy. But two, even if you don't believe that, I don't think it's as much of a dichotomy that you're talking about. This isn't just about movies, right? It's the fact that original characters can also be introduced to things like TV shows that have a unique identity, instead of relying on tarot cards and existing characters. That's something that I have contended with. But finally, even if they arithmetically get more people, at a point where all those depictions are a lot cheaper and don't reflect the kinds of experiences people have, because you're inherently relying on the character that was assigned for the majority of the identity, you don't get the nuances and reality of the experiences that people face, we don't see why arithmetically more representations does anything for these people.

Look at what happened, right? That's to say, you've got like things, a sense of collective ownership around these people, because these are things that are unique to that identity and unique to that community in the first place. That's why you've got things like students of famous black, like historically black universities in the United States engaging in traditional summer gospel before they watch the movie for the first time. Because it's such an uplifting experience, right? Was it something that they actually owned? Instead of something being provided to them, CEOs trying to capitalize on the existing character that was owned by the majority in the first place.

Notice this about the kinds of movies and kinds of art that we're willing to support. That one, the story result revolves around the individual character and far more uniquely reflects their traits. That is to say, given that this character was created with the explicit intention of representing a minority and the actual experiences that they face, actors simply have more material to work with, right? The kind of unique experiences that you're never going to get of Ariel. And so you think on the first level, that thing's just going to be a lot better and a lot more nuanced. The same idea. The plot is centered around the kinds of experiences these average members of these communities actually face. Things like Moonlight, right? When you have black people, like there's an entire movie surrounding about the trials that black LGBT teenagers face within the United States. That's a unique kind of plot line that you don't get with characters that are retrofitted for a minority majority inherently, right? So the characters uniquely designed around them. What does it mean? We think that it means that you get the sense of collective ownership surrounding these actors that we talked about. And this means that they're able to do things, like they're far more able to talk out about their minority experiences, right? They're able to integrate unique plot lines that are specifically focused around these minority identities and bring in their own personal experience when they go out on things like talk shows. But the second thing, that you're far more likely to be successful in this capacity and find other roles. What is the commandment that they have to deal with? That the story isn't centred around the actors that they choose in order to fill these majority roles. That they're always going to get drowned out by the ritual that we talked about. That it's never going to be about the artwork and ability of the actor itself but whether the act of recasting was just in and of itself. We think that distraction from the actor and the ability to engage in artistic success is so harmful. But even when it is successful, we think you get things like relying on a handful of existing actors. Like it's always going to be Will Smith for instance, and self-focusing on other actors that are struggling right now but could potentially fill the role better. We think that's a unique part.

What's better for minority representation and what's better for the discourse to promote minority representation before our third substantive argument on the benefits to actors directly clashing with their third. So their third substantive argument is basically that now it is easier for minority actors to gain prominence. Three responses here. First, we think this has created internal noise. They say here that starting from scratch is good, but prior, in the proposition one, they said that starting from scratch is bad because you have racist executive leaders. Secondly, in terms of prominence, we think it is far better for a minority actor to be in an iconic movie where there's a broader appeal base because it is obviously more prominent. It is literally iconic. Point. Thirdly, this argument is contingent on the fact that it creates more nuance. I'll deal with that more later. First question, then, is which side is better for minority representation? is contingent on the fact that it creates more nuance? I'll deal with that more later. First question then, is which side is better for minority representation? In Proposition 2, they give you this one-off argument about how it creates more role models. We don't understand why a black Ariel can't be a sufficient role model for a little black girl either. We think that doesn't stand. Then they say it creates hollow and superficial stereotypes. This is their first warrant. We have two responses. First, the arms are parallel. What about a minority-led movie isn't also virtue signaling? Secondly, use their example against them. Strong female leads in Ghostbusters with a feminine man is good for exposure. It shatters the notion that everyone expects things to be male. Sure, it didn't explain dense feminist theory, but we don't think that's going to happen on your side of the house either. Rather, it exposes people to the fact that big buff Chris Hemsworth might be able to be a little bit feminine. Secondly, they said that some characters just can't be changed. Three responses. First, that seems a little problematic to me to say that it's too hard to make Superman black. Secondly, take them on their best ground and take the Superman example. Okay, maybe now the Superman movie has Superman fighting against the police to protect black people. We think that you can change the narrative to actively make Superman good. Thirdly, the reason that they say Superman is invincible is what little black boys want to see. They want to know that they too can be invincible. They want to be Superman. They don't want their own segregated version of the movie. Black boys want to be Superman too. Why can't they be Superman?"

The best iteration of this argument is more that people want to see their culture promoted. So we'll respond to that argument. We say people see their own community culture all the time within their communities. The question of the debate then is where does the whole in representation lie? We say the whole in representation lies on seeing yourself in average people, in average roles. The fact that a gay boy and a lesbian girl want to be a mermaid and a merman too. That just isn't linked to race. The last argument they give you is that the balancing act is bad. But that's remarkably uncomparative. They have a balancing act on their side of the house too. Like, I don't understand why Paramount doesn't also have to appeal to their white viewer base for Black Panther 2. That feeds onto argumentation about tokenization because they still have to appeal to the white voter base, meaning their best case scenario of Black Panther, if anything, gets whitewashed in order to make it profitable for everyone. Or in their worst case scenario, they don't tokenize it and only black people see it, so they don't actually advance any forms of representation because white people do not go see it. On that point, what was their response to our material? They just said their mechanisms were never fully explained. I mean, come on, give us some more credit. She gave you two mechanisms. She said, first, there are internal quotas, meaning there are just frankly fewer movies. She said, secondly, that there's a decreased period of entry because right now there are lots of remakes. I mean, Pixar's next ten movies are all like Toy Story 5 and 6. Pixar is making remakes in the status quo."

They're only on the side where the remake does this happen. Secondly, we tell you this backlash is good. Why? Because instead of a racist person just seeing Black Panther and saying, oh, that's the black movie, I'm not going to see it, the racist person now sees they want to go see Little Mermaid, but it's a black Little Mermaid, you at the very least expose the fact that they're racist, and at best, you force people to have a conversation with them to talk about why it's good to have a black Ariel. What did we hear in response to our material that minorities should be doing things more regular? They said identity influences the way you live your life. Exactly. The way identity influences your life is that you never see yourself as normal when you never see those roles. Moreover, we think remaking iconic movies is the most important impact in this debate. Because they are in themselves iconic. They are part of the social fabric. Meaning, even if they get things like Moonlight, we think it's better to have black people in iconic movies because then people feel that they are part of the social fabric and not separated in niche movies like Moonlight. Before I move on to my third sub, I'll take a break. At the point where your only benefits are role models, subversion, and prominence, you achieve nothing that is unique to recasting. What makes that actively and specifically better than the prominent original movies we were talking about? That's a funny question. You said our only benefits and then listed three for me, but I can give you some more if you want them. We would say at the point in which now minorities see themselves in regular roles as opposed to only having movies about the fact that they are a minority, about the fact that it's about their minority culture, at that point, we'll add a fourth thing to your list of three for me."

Emma Stone playing an Asian woman. Or Nick Robinson playing a gay boy in Love, Simon. People extracted value from minority culture without that value going back to the actual minorities. The only way to fix this is to remake movies and cast them with minorities in those new roles. We think this looks like the new Lion King movie, which is primarily made up of both black and gay actors. Proposition never fills the vast moral void left behind by these movies, which is primarily made up of both black and gay actors. Proposition never fills the vast moral void left behind by these movies, which extracted value from minorities. At best, they just create new value. The second layer is decreasing tokenization and stereotypes. In a world of minority-specific movies, tokenization always occurs, because the people who own these big production companies are white and powerful, meaning it's more offensive, it leads to typecasting. In order to appeal to the wider and whiter audience, they have to create more less, more shallow cultural descriptions.

First of all because they tell us that there will be quantitatively more storylines because we have enough two black female leads. And first of all, debate math aside, we just don't think that many movie studios will have an incentive to take a major iconic movie, take out the two main characters, and replace them with black women. We think that there is a far bigger incentive on these movie studios who are putting these minorities into the positions because they want the money that comes with virtue signalling to put them in as side characters or as supporting characters, replace the cheaper and more expendable characters that people don't have such a strong emotional attachment to. But second of all, they told us that, well, people, you can't get more money from like making remakes and therefore there are going to be more of it, right? Well, I told you already quite clearly that the trend of remakes is really secondary to the trend of people developing famous movies such as Crazy Rich Asians, such as Love, Simon. We think that that's the trend that we want to support instead. But crucially, we think that their entire article exposure is just less important than what we brought to support instead. But crucially, we think that their entire argument of exposure is just less important than what we brought to the table, right? Because they didn't really give us a reason why there's intrinsic benefits to seeing quantitatively more people of your ethnicity on the screen. We think that it's counterproductive when the representation is worse, when it propagates stereotypes or cheap misrepresentations, and we think it's also worse when the discourse surrounding the movie is also more toxic and more poisonous. We think that we're going to prove that going by our art sense of improving lives of minorities and changing the lives of majorities, we win. So what was their idea on majorities? They said, and this is on our side, you force these people to go to the theatre, watch the movie, and then talk about it, and then their lives will be changed. No, this is just not true, right? Because the first reason is we think that they have just got this key stakeholder here completely wrong. The abhorrent racists here are going to say, oh there's a black character in Black Panther, I'm going to show up and watch that movie, this is certainly not going to go to a black rip aerial remake and go, ah this is something that I want to watch in my spare time. And they're far less likely to say, having watched this movie in my life has changed. But second of all, we just don't think that a remake of a beloved movie, of a beloved movie, which is, and you already have an original, right? So if you really want to watch it, you stay at home, you watch the original, and you stay clear about what Rotten Tomatoes and other people on Reddit are telling you are a bastardization of a film that you really like. You often instead boycott the movie because you're so vitriolically against it."

              "text": "So having one idea on exposure, let me go into the idea on portrayal and the quality of this. So Byrne spent six thick minutes on this in his P1 about how he gets worse stereotypes about worse misrepresentation when you have all the baggage of an original movie attached to a remake. They try to swim us into saying that, well, actually, movies aren't all about your experience of oppression, and rhetoric about how she's an Asian American, right? But three things. First of all, you're a minority. You have plenty of different experiences, but you're not an alien on a different planet. Rather, the difference is, there are categorically elements of your life which are different from that of a minority. You might be more careful when you're out on the street at night, you might be more wary of the police person, you might just frequent different areas of town or face more barriers when applying for certain job or educational positions. All of these are important things to convey about a minority experience, because to gloss over them would be to give the majority a false sense of security, a false sense of idealisation, but we think that you can't achieve this when you're remaking a movie without sacrificing big parts of the plot and therefore alienating viewers. So the second response to this was, they tried to co-opt all of our analysis by saying, well these same studios are just the same, but they just have bad incentives, and it's going to be worse if you're trying to produce a fully original movie, right? We just don't think that's very nuanced at all, because it's not the exact same studio, right? We think often Marvel Studios is categorically different from another smaller studio, which is producing a movie focused on the minority experience and therefore it's going to have incentive to bring in character design experts or bring in actors who have a very close connection to that character as opposed to just grabbing a big name famous actor and they're okay you're black people know your name here quite as if it's a remake it will get us more views but then second of all the approach to the movie is completely different when you have baggage as opposed to when you don't because when you're trying to balance this new movie with the legacy of the previous one, you're struggling to stay true to the previous movie and therefore not alienate all of that base. But you also want to still get some brownie points for the minority character in your film, right? But then what does this mean? They just get a far messier, far worse movie. You either misrepresent the minority or you alienate the majority and make them frustrated and angry. Because all of these are bad outcomes. On ours in the House of Watchers, you have the incentive most of the time to have nuance because you want to picture a movie as being profound, as being interesting. You want those good reviews, right? Like, hence we have these deep movies such as Moonlight being pumped out. But second of all, at the briskest hour, at least we have a genuine and sensical, like, smoothly flowing plotline that doesn't make people go, ah, this is a movie with a black person in it and it happens to be terrible, therefore social justice is corrupting pop culture, therefore I'm against this movement in general. So we think that one of these reasons that we get worse, that we got two more responses to the third, right? They told us we can dramatically shift the plotline, but these movie studios often don't have the incentive to do so because it's unnecessary, because they think they just want to go on their existential path and second of all they gave us the idea of whitewashing. Like surely whitewashing is something that you do more when you're featuring a group that's iconic and aimed at the general population as opposed to when you're trying to keep your minority families. For these reasons, go to your proposition next. Thank you. ."

I may happen to be Indian, but am I not really attached to Indian culture? I like cursing, I like loud American music, and please do not tell my parents this, but I like chicken. What did I look up to when I was a kid? I looked up to Captain America, I looked up to Iron Man, and I looked up to my favorite Disney characters. Those were my cultural icons. But later I noticed that they were all white. But those were the ones that were most important to me. I couldn't relate to Ram and Krishna even though they were my original new story brown characters. But I did relate to the superheroes I saw, the detectives I saw, the people I saw on the screen, but they were all white. Why couldn't they be brown? What about being me made it so much different that my culture could not be reflected if the same story arc of Captain America, he just happened to be Indian? What about my culture could not be reflected if the character that I looked up to as a little child could not look like me? What Proposition wanted to bring me was a character that talked all about being Indian and American, maybe dealt with the interesting race question of how we were painted post-September 11th.

It's not necessary to invest in little, small, original movies, or even big picture original movies. They're about heavy issues. What people want to see on the big screen is not the racial reality of their daily lives, the example that their Prop 3 brings you, of knowing that you have to walk a little more carefully on the street. I don't want to see that on the big screen, though. I just want to see people look like me, that act normal, that act regularly. The plot line has this direct incentive on their side of the house to make it about being a minority, to be the worst form of shallow representation. Because do not forget their first substantive argument. It was all about the mechanisms by which making these original news stories would allow for the culture of minorities to be represented. The story I told you at the top proves that race doesn't automatically equal culture. My culture is not homogeneous to the most recent Indian new original character that they had in The Jungle Book. My culture is homogeneous to what I saw as a kid. That's what I like. I'm just a normal American, and normal Americans on the big screen should be brand. Which is why the remakes are particularly necessary. But what does Proposition bring to you? They say that it will be cheap. We're willing to risk a little bit of cheapness and a little bit of shallowness for the importance of this normalcy."

Before I go on to the crucial impact of this argument, I'll take your point. As a studio like Marvel who crafts the representation of the future icons of children, do you repeat past heroes and change their skin color, or do you create new ones for the children to adore? Okay, so this is interesting because this gets into more of the practical mechanism we're now about to go over. What is Marvel most likely to do? Marvel is about to remake a bunch of films.

This is something I don't think they've quite dealt with in this debate yet, because they're one, give you a certain number of mechanisms, like the fact that writers are bad, that studio execs have a profit incentive. Then, look at who they're trusting to write the stories for their new minority characters. Those same studio executives, those same writers, are they really going to give you an excellent story about minority representation? But let's say you have original black writers, original brown writers, original female writers. Those writers are significantly less likely to get the same impact that cultural icons already have on society, because they're already entrenched. It's significantly less likely for them to make the new blockbuster, to make the new icon that kids look up to, which is why remakes are just much, much more better. They have also not answered our entire third substantive argument about how this return to normalcy is a necessary reparative purpose, because for so long, these characters were kept white. For so long, being a detective, being a superhero, was kept white, was kept the dominant majority. That is the point. When they tell you that people will react to this because they're attached to their old characters and they don't want to see them change, they don't want to see them be not white, that is opposition's point. Paul, you should question the mindset that you have that these characters are intrinsically tied to their whiteness, that these characters are intrinsically tied to being a dominant majority."

Remakes are inevitable. Remakes are coming right now. It's super, super hard to develop new, original characters. That means it's so much easier to get representation through remakes. If remakes are going to happen in either world, I'd rather those remakes be ones that change the ethnicity or change the dominant tropes of those characters. Given that's the case, we've given you lots of mechanisms including profit incentive and just what's more likely for movie studios to do, that should remake, those remakes would have the biggest cultural impact on society. Which means even if you're a little confused on which representation you might think would be better, if there are reasons for the prop, if there are reasons for the op, just know that we have a significantly larger amount of it on our side of the house, because remakes are just so much easier and so much better for the corrupt studios that they think that they are going to convince on their side of this house.

Look, even if the majority does not change their mind, the question remains, who helps minority communities feel more represented, therefore? And I think it's very clear, at least if we have a film where we have a character that's relatable to the minority, it doesn't matter if the minority doesn't change their mind, at least ours is better."

Whether or not we're going to create Black Panther, not just create another Black Superman. You don't have to retreat to cultural stereotypes of the past. We are moving onwards. That was what we told you when we told you we wanted to create a tapestry of new characters, not simply rehash and repeat. We don't think icons therefore matter, because it's more empowering to feel and relate to black characters than can ever be powerful to relate to black Superman."

They try to strawman our arguments as in, because we somehow said that there's racist directors, it means that all our movies, because they're made of, and all our scriptwriters are bad. That's not our argument. Our argument is that when you try to put a black character into a white character's role, you restrict creative freedoms. You restrict the capacity of writers to escape the bounds that are defining the character in the first place, meaning that you deprive them of a capacity to actually try and change things."

You can't simply just change the baselines of everything, right? That's the reason why, that's the argument that we gave you. We told you, on the contrary, that you can make a new character. Fact, Panther can fight the police because you're making a new character, writing new storylines. It's not the same on their side of the house.

We understand that it does, but it's whether or not you can restrict creative freedoms that is the issue at hand."

You don't want them to do normal things. You want them to do new things, individual things that define themselves as a people. We don't think it's fair when they try to insist that they have a better world on our side. Understand this. We want the children of the future to grow up living and dreaming of Wakanda, not Metropolis. We don't want them to live in the past. We want them to live in the future.

That is to say, a public defense of controversial feminist issues like opposing the matchmaking industry in India, for example, which would be good for female solidarity, but might jeopardize your own political or your business career or your status within your family or your social life. Where the feminist movement and opposition might push you to work to dispel narratives that female domesticity exists even though you want to be a traditional stay-at-home mother. Or even when you are working, opposition pushing you to advocate for more affirmative action and diverse hiring policies regardless of if you're a low-level employee and that might jeopardize your own career or that you're in a male-dominated industry that would make you quite uncomfortable."

              "text": "The second part of this model, it is also important to note on proposition, but won't change on this motion. We say when your personal incentives firstly aligns with the feminist movement and comes at no cost to you, you are still likely in order to try and promote equality. That is to say, if you are a CEO or a top-level manager in a company, you can probably implement maternity leave, given that it would probably be good for you as well. You can access to vote, likely, in either side of the house. If there's a municipal protest that is near you, that you have the time and money in order to advocate for, and issues that you care strongly about, that don't sacrifice anything else to you, you will continue to do that. The second reason why we think this happens is that we do have a basic empathy that extends to other women, especially if they've been in the same positions as us. We just believe that when the trade-off exists, you should always choose yourself. The last thing that I want to mention in frame is that solidarity is not all-encompassing. That most of the time, it is majoritarian and privileged views on what solidarity actually means that ends up existing. The reason why is because the people that oftentimes produce feminist media have the wealth and oftentimes the capital that can reflect this. That is to say, the books that sell out the most are ones that are written by rich white women. Secondly, the concept of solidarity can easily be manipulated to what best actually reflects the agenda. That is the reason why in a lot of the parts of the world women who are trans are not mentioned within solidarity exists. And the people who do oftentimes discuss and define solidarity are celebrity feminists or the west and the privileged world. And lastly the reason why you can't get any change is because oftentimes they're irreconcilable. That is to say religious evangelicals I can't say the word. Wow, my God. Sorry. They're irreconcilable. That is to say, religious evangelicals that oftentimes cannot exist along with a sex-dominated industry because of the ideology that obviously opposes them. That means solidarity drowns out political will for the most important issues, and oftentimes it means that the values are oftentimes different. That is to say, the family that you might care about as a black Caribbean woman that oftentimes are emphasized in a lot of African households is very different from the kinds of no family at all, don't listen to your husband, don't have kids kind of mindset that a lot of western feminists include. First argument then on the movement obligation. Because of the sacrifice of equality by the patriarchy, opposition now chooses a solution that forces women to sacrifice even more. We think this will never be just. Why is this not just? The first, because we have obligations not to harm women and this will always harm women directly. It will rip them of their dignity when we force them to confront their bosses, force them to confront the family members that they fear having uncomfortable conversations with that likely mean they're going to be humiliated and embarrassed. It rips them of financial autonomy when we force them out of jobs that they work or force them to spend resources on others that they probably don't have any kind of direct obligation or care about. And it rips them of choice. They're probably always going to be burdened by the thought of whether or not they're being a good feminist when they're opening an OnlyFans account, for example, when they're going into a certain kind of work, when they're spending money on consumers' obligations because they want to buy pretty clothes for themselves. Opposition has promoted a solution that solves oppression by oppressing women themselves, and we think that will never be just. Firstly, because there's equality in membership, that every single woman should have their own kind of equality and dignity that shouldn't be undermined. But secondly, that the most contradictory principle that is to say the feminist movement should protect people so if we care about acting and violence against women and a mission in terms of not protecting women in the best ways that we can by taking money away from other women and taking value and labor from other women we should care more about direct violence but secondly we see we are oftentimes forcing women towards some goal that is really just tenuous at best. And genuinely on proposition, we're agnostic to the idea of what kind of solidarity is good. Is it solidarity for wearing religious dress as choice, or is it solidarity for removing any kind of restrictive religious clothing that oftentimes exists in different parts of the world? Is it the kind of solidarity that means you should be for or against sex work as a viable way to make money as a woman? In these cases we think there will always be some kind of women that are excluded from the movement, some kind of women that do genuinely have their dignity and their choice and their autonomy oppressed when the feminist movement tells them that their choices are not good. Women are not social battering rams. This will always be wrong devoid of practical outcome. Second argument I want to talk about in terms of reviewing buy-in, but I'll take a POI before that. I don't know how this debate is exclusively about cases where people have to be heard in order for someone else to gain that."

              "text": "I just want to point out that this goes back on literally the last two or three decades that has been choice feminism at the active forefront of a lot of the feminist movement, especially in the West, where it is to say that women have been able broadly to choose any of the kinds of career options that they want, that they can choose to, for example, work in a corporate industry that they don't need to give large amounts of money and participate in the feminist movement as much as they do. And therefore, this goes back on a lot of the rhetoric that has been included within the feminist movement that will probably be bad for a lot of the individuals that are within it. But secondly, we already talked about why it must exclude some people, why it must exclude some people, why it must include a lot of some women, and particularly probably the ones that are minorities, that don't fit into a majoritarian and elitist view of what it actually means to buy solidarity, and what it means to have solidarity to the best forms of feminism. But lastly, we think that some women will probably always choose themselves. They care about gaining capital, for example, they care about ensuring that they aren't going to have horrible relationships with their family, and now they're going to be called selfish. Opposition also has to prove that the manifestation of this narrative is going to be positive, but in many cases it is not. We oftentimes shame influencers who want to model online in their comment section because we say they are bad feminists. We shame people for their choices that they make as a woman because we say it is not feminist and it's not solidarity within the feminist movement. And the change here is that you probably won't have the support for the normal kinds of feminist policies and the movement that does exist. You probably won't align yourselves with female politicians, with movements, with like workshops or development careers that exist within your workplace, for example, because you don't believe that the feminist movement is actually representing you. You might even actively call out the feminist movement and undermine their credibility when it exists. In all cases, this will always be bad for the feminist movement who loses a lot of the support that they would otherwise have. The third argument is also very simple. The women should be allowed to develop unfettered in terms of their career choices. They should be able to use male mannerisms if that is what allows them to survive, to make more money, which means that they can institute policy when they are at the very top, when there's far less pushback. That is the best way to ensure their survival for all women, not just the ones the opposition says they want to protect. Incred's going to be best if we hold the first opposition speaker. Thank you. Okay. Can I speak this volume? Right. Okay. So."

What we say in response is that solidarity is also not global. Solidarity just like the feminist movement depends on who exactly it's about. Feminist movement is not a unified block. Solidarity within it is also dependent on who exactly creates the movement in a given country, in a given community, in a given minority as well. We believe that thus solidarity is also flexible enough to allow most people to actually relate to it, even if that means that it's going to happen in the higher up groups, or for example in the lower down, less privileged communities as well. Panel, what we also hear about from this side is that there is a principle right of choice. Of choice to actually hurt others, of choice to actually exploit other people. Note who this debate is about. This debate is about women. About women who have been inherently exploited and hurt by patriarchy, by a system that actually gave those people that right, that actually made those people able to make that choice. We believe that that choice was never actually given to those people in a principally right manner. Why? Because it was given by an inherently faulty and non-equal system of patriarchy, of a system that essentially exploits some social groups. We believe that this choice is never actually right to have, it's never given to those people inherently. We believe that it's okay to actually make the feminist movement criticize it. Secondly, people inside of the government have called us out for calling women on the higher stages, basically calling them selfish by the feminist movement. Note how the definition of selfishness is essentially what they defend.

We believe that it's putting the well-being of other women equally or above your own needs, as the trade-offs that have been mentioned by the side of the government. Also note how in the status quo we experience both sides of this house in some cases. We believe that right now in this debate we are standing on a crossroads where we need to choose one of those two practices. Note how this messaging actually happens. Basically, most of it happens through real-life examples of such acts of, for example, solidarity or acts of selfishness, of women, for example, choosing their own good over somebody else's, but also through social media, through using. And why is this narrative exactly so attractive? Because, first of all, it is all-encompassing. It touches every single woman on the planet. Every single woman on the planet deserves solidarity by this narrative. It's extremely attractive for a woman to actually believe it because it guarantees them support. It also touches women in all social causes and situations because as I've mentioned before it actually is flexible enough to do that. Panel, moving on to our cases. First of all, principally panel. The feminist movement ought to simply support the ones with the least agency in society and prioritize solidarity with mutual support between women. Now, the feminist movement is simply an exclusive space that is giving every single woman support. An exclusive space in many countries and many societies where they simply had no other choice than to find the feminist movement to support them. Now, this is simply the largest foundation of the very existence of the movement in this debate. It is about being universal and about being universally united in the troubles of women. Now note how pushing for growth, what the side of the government essentially does, assumes that you have the agency to actually reach out for it, to actually reach out for the top of the social ladder, to actually reach out for the better position in your workplace. Now this is the very same reason for the existence of the Hellenist Movement, because not everyone has that agency, not everyone has that possibility, and this is based on historical and also present stripping of agency from those women. Now, note how the rights of women have been historically stripped collectively, and we believe that it's principally wrong to try to take those rights individually, like the women on the side of the government would try to do. If by your admission the idea of solidarity can be manipulated, why is it good that exclusionary and privileged women can now define solidarity in career paths and take away agency from"

It never actually goes back to you from other parts of society, from the most privileged people, from the patriarchal men that have been oppressing you historically, it only means that the balance of power changes within women, within feminism, within the group that needs support from the most, not exactly giving them support as a whole. Note how maximization in the motion on the side of debate means that you should take a chance, even if it takes agency away from other women, even if that means that other women have to lose a job, for example, so that you can have a better salary, they have to defend it. This is principally wrong on simply the whole scale of why feminism was created, of why feminism still exists, of why feminism is effective in any way, and also how it supports women. But moving on to our second argument panel, and how our policy simply better impacts everyday life. Note how women hear, women, but not only women, Moving on to our second argument panel and how our policy simply better impacts everyday life. Note how women hear, women but not only women, hear this message in radio, in feminist magazines, from their favourite politicians or from their favourite celebrities. What you get in that case is that you should, is basically the narrative that you should show solidarity to other women but also that other women could and should show solidarity to you. Note how this simply increases the amount of accountability in your everyday life, in your school, in your workplace, in your country as well, which also reaches other social groups than only women. We believe that this message also reaches men. It also makes sure that those people know that women deserve solidarity, that they deserve, for example, to be cared of, that basically their oppressors deserve to, for example, be called out, even if that means that you have to risk something on your side. Notice how only on our side this message actually reaches all of those people. Now, this narrative makes you simply do a couple of things. First of all, it increases your will to actually observe social treatment. What it means is that there is simply much greater shared responsibility in society. What is also much more likely is that you are, for example, going to support other women, for example, in your workplace, you're going to take a stand in harm's way, making sure that, for example, the workplace does not become as toxic as possible, or, for example, you will tell your friend to not go, not, for example, take a position in the workplace that you know is going to be harmful for them, even though you, for example, risk being fired from that job because you have just basically made sure that no one else will be hired from them. Note how on our side, this essentially is not only accepted by a much wider group, but it actually affects every single woman, regardless of their own possibility at the agency to actually reach out for greater good. Note how on Wayne, this is simply much more important. Why is that? Because it simply affects every single feminist deviation possible. On every single level of agency, whether that is the feminism, for example, in Poland, or whether that is the feminism in Bangladesh, or whether that is the feminism in India, we believe that solidarity can exist in every single place like that. This is exactly why we believe that it's extremely important. For simply staying loyal to the most core principles of feminism, for simply staying loyal to the most core basic principles of people staying together and creating a group of support, please vote opposition.

I think what is true, and what we characterize in our case, is that the vast, vast majority of women are oppressed in at least one significant way. So over 90% of women, even in the most privileged urban places in the world, experience sexual harassment on an annual basis. Things like domestic violence, like catcalling, like workplace exclusion, cut across borders of race and income. We agree that women experience different levels of privilege. Our argument was that all of these women are sufficiently oppressed that the feminist movement has obligations towards them as individuals. The woman in New York has financial privilege, we agree. But when she is harassed and stalked at work, she experiences a real visceral harm that we think we ought to care about too. What is the consequence then of this, oh dear, I forgot a page, of this morally speaking? I think the first thing to say is that we have an individual obligation towards this person that cannot be justified in broad utilitarian terms. So for instance, if we take a situation like criminal justice, if one person is deprived of a thousand dollars, that is bad and that person ought to be compensated for the damage that happens towards them. But that does not justify us taking another person who has also been robbed of like $80 and redirecting their money towards this person. And the reason for that is that we treat individual victims as individual agents whom we ought to repair their damages individually. So I think even if they can prove that on net, women in general are benefited, they need to explain why it's justified a direct cost upon individual women."

That you, if you are a conservative feminist female politician, for instance, who is constantly harassed on Twitter about not making sufficiently liberal policy in their world that supports solidarity, that is a cost upon you when you are wracked by guilt by not being able to adequately help other women in the movement, even if in many cases you didn't actually have the ability to properly help these other people. So we think that is an unjust moral cost as well. That is why I think independent of outcomes in terms of the feminist movement, they do need to justify this cost"

              "text": "upon individuals. Secondly then, let's talk about what solidarity looks like. What I think Poland gives us here is a series of general claims about historical inequality and globalism. It is astonishingly unclear what they are specifically advocating for and what solidarity looks like in the real world. So it is unclear to us, for instance, why progression in your career would require you to unemployed other women, as I suggest illustratively. And I think we needed a lot more specifics in order for them to be able to claim benefits to a wide variety of women. And I think the reason why they are ambiguous in this case is because there is legitimately ambiguity in the world over what is good for women. So we gave you numerous examples of it. The issue of religious headwear, for instance, is widely contested across the world. Many women in the West believe it is oppressive towards women in the developing world in regressive strands of religion, whereas lots of people around the world and in Muslim countries, for instance, genuinely believe they are more comfortable and feel empowered by this headwear. We think it is wrong for the West to impose a narrative of solidarity upon them and to decide what is universally good for women and then try to build a narrative of solidarity around them. Even issues like abortion, which I think are the most probably sympathetic to their case. Many of us happen to be pro-choice in this room because debate is a liberal situation. I think billions of women in the world are pro-life due to things like religious reasons and actively oppose a narrative of solidarity that aims to convert every country in the world to the most leftist strand of feminism that exists in the left. We think it is wrong to stake our movement upon the specific interests of people in this area. And I want to note that these illustrations take opposition at their best, where women in privileged contexts do in fact have an underlying level of concern for the needs of others. Because what it proves is that even if you are broadly concerned about them, the way that you rectify that concern is through imposing your agenda upon them in a way that is unjust. So I think the consequence of this is one of two things. Either A, they have an incoherent movement that is incoherent insofar as people have differing interests over what is good. They disagree upon that. And so there are competing narratives of solidarity from different groups. So one narrative of solidarity from like more religious women for instance who want more conservative versions of feminism one narrative of solidarity from women in the in like more urban western context one incredibly leftist version you aren't able to rile people up around a common goal or secondly they have to make alternatively they make a decision on which version of feminism they prefer but this is likely to be slanted towards the interests of the privileged. And we gave you two reasons for this, which I think go unresponded to. The first thing we suggest is that privileged people are the ones who are able to manufacture feminist media and the agenda to begin with. So for instance, prominent female politicians in areas like Western Europe are the ones who get a lot of airtime on television, and so they get to set the agenda for what issues are the most important to discuss. So if they think that the wage gap, which is more approximate to their lives, is more important than something like gender-based violence, they will build a narrative of solidarity around that. Social media advocacy, in many cases, I'll take you in a second, centers around things like microaggressions rather than real material issues that women in the developing world experience, because rich people are the ones with the highest ability to be able to spend time on social media creating this content. Before I move on, I'll take the point. Not how the side of the government overwhelmingly focuses on social norms and issues, totally forgetting that equality and solidarity can also function in social situations, within their own groups, within people, within families, within workplaces, not only in politics, not only in social norms and religion. Yeah, so I think, A, we have given you reasons to suggest that it will be overwhelmingly centered towards trivial social issues because it is controlled by people who care disproportionately about this. If the argument is people who are collectively in a materially oppressed situation will band together and have solidarity, I think that is unlikely to be successful because these are people with the most limited amount of political resources. So even if every incredibly poor woman in America decides to band together, these are still people who don't have the financial resources to for instance build a strong movement and can't lobby to the same degree. The second reason why this is unequal is because the idea of solidarity requires reciprocity, which is to say if I am a privileged person, the movement of solidarity means I want other people to also contribute towards me. It can't be one way. So if I, for instance, have a lot of feminist protests around something like sexual harassment, and I don't see poor women from other areas showing up to my sides of the issues or seeing them as important, then by extension of that, I don't feel a similar level of obligation towards them because I don't feel as though they have sufficiently contributed towards my issues. So this explains why the movement is likely to be fractured along these lines as well."

And lastly, that individuals are more able in our world to rise to the top to capture things like important positions in politics and business when they are not forced to make sacrifices that are actively damaging to their career. That is when they are able to rise up and create change that is beneficial for women through things like role modeling, through more policies that are helpful, through using their capital to donate towards feminist causes.

So panel, Pano will believe this is already a really really uncharitable view of our side of the house. So Pano, three major responses to this. First of all, we believe that this is an extremely unlikely way of this narrative to function. Pano will believe this simply won't apply to contentious issues in most cases. And this is what our leader of opposition has already told you. Pano will believe that there are a lot of issues that the feminist movement can focus on without alienating anyone. There is no reason for them to focus on contentious political issues. This is talking about things like sexual abuse being bad. We believe that there generally aren't women who will disagree with that. Then secondly, Pano, we tell you that the solidarity narrative very likely doesn't tell you what exactly to stand for. And so we believe that if you don't believe that very likely doesn't tell you what exactly to stand for. And so we believe that if you don't believe that something actually harms women, you're extremely unlikely to oppose it at the point at which you stand for the solidarity narrative. The point at which the movement simply tells you, well, you have to support other women, you have to sometimes lose your own comfort in order to, for example, call out problematic behaviours, we believe that it is in most most cases, up to you to decide which exact behaviours are problematic. At this point, your point about alienating women who are against those mainstream feminist narratives simply kind of falls out of this round. Falls out of this round. Lastly, we believe that in most cases, simply they once again disregard our point about these being very likely localised. This means that at the point at which we live in a highly religious society, like for example India, we are firstly extremely unlikely to buy into this mainstream feminist movement in the first place, meaning that those narratives never will actually reach you, but then secondly you're likely to have your very own support groups that don't actually tell you to oppose those things, believe that this interpretation of this framing is really, really uncharitable on their side of the house.

              "text": "there will be one argument about the safe space for vulnerable groups. But first of all, let's engage a bit more with other cases. So first of all, they tell us about the obligations of the feminist movement that forces women to sacrifice themselves even more. The first thing I would need to note there is that this isn't even a principle panel. We believe that at the point at which we prove that women in general are better off on our side, we believe that we can simply take this criteria simply because they only tell us, well, it is bad to harm women on our side of the house. But secondly, even at the point at which they extend it to those individual women not being supposed to sacrifice themselves, we believe that at the point at which we prove to you that we can avoid more of those individual victims of, for example, patriarchy, we believe that we can simply prove to you that there is less women having to sacrifice themselves on our side of the house, simply once again taking this criteria. Then secondly, panel, on this idea of this narrative alienating and shaming some women, the women that actually do choose themselves. First of all, we believe that their impact on this case is absolutely absurd. Panal will believe that these women are extremely unlikely to publicly denounce the feminist movement because it looks extremely bad to denounce a movement that talks about issues you've obviously managed to avoid. At the point at which you manage to actually get yourself into this privileged situation, into this situation, after you, for example, are able to have this high income, we believe that you're really, really extremely unlikely to talk negatively about the movement that simply talks about you being the privileged one. At this income, we believe that you're really, really extremely unlikely to talk negatively about the movement that simply talks about you being the privileged one. At this point, we believe that those women are extremely unlikely to do this. So what are they actually likely to do? Panel, we believe that the much more likely response on their side is those women actually wanting to make up for it, because at the point at which the movement simply calls out their privilege and calls out the fact that they have managed to avoid all this discrimination, we believe that in order to simply look good, but also in order to not feel guilty about themselves, they're extremely likely to, for example, give out resources to actually help those vulnerable groups. We believe this is a much more likely response. Not only this already flips your case, this means that even if those women are guilty on our side of the house, this simply leads to even more benefits to those most vulnerable groups on our side of the house. But panel, lastly, even in their best case, even in the case at which they actually manage to get way more women in those higher up positions that are then able to, for example, change the systems, we believe in their best, those women have no incentive to do this because at the point at which they actually buy into a narrative telling them that the only thing they need to do for other women is succeeding themselves, even at the point at which they reach those high positions, they're extremely unlikely, for example, push for some political change or actually support other women is succeeding themselves, even at the point at which they reach those high positions, they're extremely unlikely, for example, to push for some political change or actually support other women, simply because the narrative of the feminist movement tells them they have already done their part."

For your concession, the feminist movement tells women that they shouldn't model, they shouldn't be a stay-at-home mom, they shouldn't do the things that they are doing. So why will these women want to participate in a movement that they are not represented by? First of all, we literally don't tell you this. We tell you about why this narrative is likely to be about non-contentious issues. But then secondly, if there are some women who are literally in the status quo already against the mainstream feminist narratives, we believe that they're extremely unlikely to actually buy into the feminist narratives. They're extremely unlikely to actually listen to what the feminist movement tells them to do, they're extremely unlikely to somehow oppose the feminist movement, because already they don't even hear the narrative, they don't even follow feminist channels on YouTube or Instagram, who believe this is a group they have chosen really, really unstrategically."

Because this narrative simply looks like, for example, Sheryl Sandberg which is a literal millionaire telling women that opportunities are around them they just have to simply lean into them. This narrative looks like feminist movement telling you to be a strong independent woman in full control of your life. We believe that for two major reasons. Most women simply can't identify with that narrative and think that such opportunities simply aren't attainable to them. So A, we tell you, we believe that this narrative is very often pushed by extremely privileged women, which are the ones who have achieved the success. This is the thing that their proposition has already conceded in their speeches. And this means that for most women in those lower social standing, this simply causes distance.

We tell you that the actual women who are likely to look out for support from the feminist movement are the ones who feel the discrimination in everyday life, are the ones who feel that they cannot improve their own situations by their own, are the ones that feel that they are unable to buy into the site proposition narrative. This means that once again they feel that it isn't even possible to develop and empower individually on site proposition. Panel, note how this already mitigates the impact from site proposition because we believe that the ones excluded from the feminist movement on our side likely don't buy into it in the first place. But panel, this also brings us to the second impact. We believe that on their side of the house those women simply feel like either blame because the feminist movement tells them that they have autonomy over their situation and yet it is their fault that they're not succeeding in such a huge way as the feminist role models do. But then secondly what they're also likely to feel is simply feel that the feminist movement isn't for them but is only supporting women that already are in positions of power simply once again denying the existence of patriarchy and of their everyday struggle. This means that on their side of the house those women who need the support from the feminist movement the most are extremely unlikely to buy into this, are extremely unlikely to for example like get help from the feminist movement because they feel extremely unlikely to buy into this, are extremely unlikely to, for example, get help from the feminist movement because they feel the movement doesn't target their needs. And so they're unlikely to, for example, go into a feminist support group. They're unlikely to, for example, go into a course that is like many of the feminist movement, believe that this is an extremely tangible change on their lives on our side of the house. Importantly, this argument is crucial because it happens even if no one actually acts differently under the narrative on their side. We believe that even if no one actually changes their behaviour, what's important is that those vulnerable groups feel exclusively on our side, that the feminist movement is there for them and is there to support them. This means on our side exclusively, they can actually get the support. And for this, please vote opposition. Thank you. Ready?"

Because the only way opposition can get any of their benefits on forcing people, for example, to help others, to give back to their communities, to make sure that other women are well off, is to do the prescriptive things.

              "text": "one what does this narrative look like i want to bring back the framing that is uncontested about why the privileged are the ones who control the narrative and therefore the primary beneficiary of solidarity is in fact the privileged for three reasons. One, because the channels of the feminist movement are controlled by the powerful. The people who are up there doing the speeches and giving the talks are Sheryl Sandbergs, for example, who care only about lean and feminism and the wealthy parts of the movement. It is media conglomerate executives, for example, who pick the most privileged, the most fit for media, those who are the most representative, for example, within them. It is not those who are poor. It is not those who are minorities, who have historically been disadvantaged by these movements, who control these narratives. And therefore, disproportionately, this is going to be about benefiting solidarity on wealthy issues for wealthy people. Secondly, because minorities are cut out by the expectation that solidarity is reciprocal. And I think this has to do with the way in which the narrative is internalized. When as a little girl, you see in the media that helping another woman out eventually benefits you when she comes back and helps you in need. And implicit in that, I think, is a self-interested bias, a self-interested incentive, and that is what you link with solidarity. The problem is that minorities often cannot give back in the self-interested way that side opposition talks about. That when you as a white feminist show up to your protest about microaggressions, you do not see black women marching alongside you because they are, for example, working for their families since that is something that they need to do. And therefore, the solidarity does not instead apply to minority issues, but it only applies to the privileged. The third thing we told you about is people see themselves with those who they have in common. It is difficult for a white woman from Toronto to connect with an indigenous feminist from South Africa. They cannot understand, for example, what years of apartheid can do in terms of the feminist movement. And I think in this way, when you imagine yourself marching alongside in solidarity with other people, you imagine yourself with people similar to you. So the forms of solidarity that they're talking about, where it is those who are privileged who are helping the disprivileged, are in fact the least compelling form of solidarity. I think the"

              "text": "with us by second. Theme number two on the unfair instrumentalization of women. Even if the framing is not correct, I still think we are winning here. What we told you was this. Women are not a means to an end for a social good, and it is both morally unjust but also bad for women to instrumentalize them under their side. Sex workers under their side are shamed for the way they present their bodies because that is not seeming in solidarity with other women. Conservative women are told they are not good feminists because of the way that they think. Their response is a principle about how women have obligations to one another, especially to the disprivileged. Aside from the fact that this is contingent on the practical, I have three other things to say. One, the women that they are harming are not those who are culpable for the harms that opposition tells you about. And this could talk to you in second about how the vast majority of these social structures were ones that were constructed by the patriarchy, and therefore harming more women to solve the problem is counterproductive to their policy. Secondly, because to the extent that women may have been complicit in the suffering of other women, it was a coerced form of complicity. To the extent that, for example, white women maybe were in fact told, or those who were privileged were told, and internalized within the patriarchy that other women were bad and therefore did not have incentives to support them. That is not their choice, and therefore it is still wrong to punish them for doing so. But thirdly, because I think what we gave you was a more compelling and better principle, that people have different conceptions of a good life and therefore the feminist movement should empower them to do so. That you should be able to be a conservative and a feminist at the same time that's something that you believe in. That you should be able to, for example, pursue sex work even if that doesn't seem in solidarity with other people. The response from their side is that this is illegitimate. That is an absurd claim. We told you that many women have many reasons to pursue incentives. They're not simply tools to be used by the feminist movement and I think the fact that under their side they use them as tools as such is something that is morally reprehensible. The last thing they say is our side denies support for the vulnerable because they cannot identify themselves with the movement. One, I out-framed this in theme one, but two, why? It's completely unclear as to why the vulnerable woman cannot find support under our side of the house as well, that our narrative is about individual development and success, and that can be different for every single individual person. So you can still get support from other women under our side of the house, albeit slightly less so, I'm willing to concede, but that is still less important than many of the other things that we talked to you in this debate. The last thing is on social change, but before that, PY. Final piece of note, how women of privilege have only the possibility to actually be made aware of their privilege and be aware of how they can actually impact other women negatively on our side of the house. The problem with women not being responsible for their own privilege only exists when they have no narrative that tells them how their privilege wags. On our side, this narrative is given by the feminist movement. That is when they can actually change. No, I think this education already exists. I gave you three reasons for why it is not very plausible that the solidarity under your side of the House is likely to be that, because of the way in which people think. I still think you need to engage with that."

Firstly, that there were individual incentives to produce change under either side that converge even without solidarity. The rights of abortion, for example, which all women tend to support, or rights against gender-based violence. You do not need solidarity in these cases, you just need people to turn out to vote, which will happen under either side. Secondly, because there is a growing social consciousness among allies, which was our third argument, that their side stamps out. I think this is an alienating narrative to men, when for example it feels threatening and therefore there's a rise of anti-feminist movements that we've seen recently because women are collectivizing in a way that men do not see themselves being included in, because how do you include yourself in feminism and in solidarity that only is about women helping each other? But thirdly, because when women succeed, they will help others. And I think this is crucial. You knew what it was like to be doubted every step of the way, to be laughed at in board meetings, to be told to go away because you didn't belong to be there. And you do not need the feminist movement to tell you that other women are deserving of respect and empathy. Of course, it will not be perfect. We concede that you will not completely understand the issues of minorities under either side. But their movement alienates people from this narrative in harmful and pernicious way. It locks people out of movements that were supposed to help them. And on side proposition, we could not support that. I think it's best to speak"

These will be women who are already privileged in the first place. Why? Because they are in a position where the fact that they are giving something up has impacts. So for instance, a CEO of a company calling her co-workers out for sexist behaviour, potentially risking her position. And the fact that this woman managed to become a CEO in the status quo means that she was probably came from a privileged background, able to go to university, able to carry the double burden by, for instance, hiring a babysitter, likely from the majority ethnicity or religion. And so this means that the group that is making sacrifices on our side is the most privileged group in society, and they are making the sacrifices in favor of those minority groups. And so panel, that is why we are winning this debate, because we are showing you how the most vulnerable actor is the one that is better off on our side of the house. Okay, a note that comparatively, on your side, these underprivileged women have no support system at all, because they do not have the awareness that there's a big movement fighting for them. They do not have the awareness that, and also the issues that they are facing are often extremely difficult to overcome because they are structural discrimination at work, biased during job interviews, etc. And therefore they need this huge source of support that they only, this collective support that they only get on our side of the house.

Firstly, on the framing of narrative and buying. Secondly, on the situation of individual women. Lastly, on the best-case way. So firstly, on the framing of narrative. Panel, note how most of the points that site proposition tries to push throughout this debate is that, well, this narrative is only for privileged people because it is only pushed by such, because feminist movement is only about privileged people. Panel, even if we assume this was entirely true, we believe that it also applies to their side. Panel, if the narrative needs to be so narrow and so specific in order to convince anyone to buy into it, we believe that this also happens on their side. What this means is that this entirely undercuts most of their impact because at the point at which they tell us, well, exclusively on our side of the house, those people who are underprivileged are simply cut out of the narrative. We tell you no, if the narrative only talks about specific issues, about solidarity within specific issues, but also about specific ways of actually advancing yourself and actually like improving your very own personal situation, we believe on their side this issue is entirely symmetric. Once again, we believe that this is simply really unstrategic to try to out frame us on symmetric frameworks. And panel, we believe that at this point, the impacts on their side are simply way worse. Because we believe that on our side, you can still feel the support even from your very own social group. Panel, even if you believe that well, this support only happens within social groups, the people who are more privileged help the people who are more privileged, the people who are less privileged also help people who are less privileged, we believe that in the end, you can still feel the comforting narrative that there is someone in there who will actually help you because you probably do have some social group around you. What actually happens on their side is that you can feel the benefits of individual development once it actually isn't attainable to you in any way. We believe at this point, people are way, way more likely to actually buy into a narrative that's comforting and that actually acknowledges their struggle. That's something that exclusively happens on our side of the house."

Not how we tell you that for every such woman that loses out on, for example, her promotion by calling out an abusive boss, there are several more that can, for example, avoid the abuse whatsoever by simply not coming into this workplace or actually knowing what is in for them. Panel, we believe that at the point at which they never engage into the comparative weighing and into us telling you how we are actually the ones that protect more victims from being created and protect the more vulnerable groups within this debate, who believe that they simply lose out on the trade-off of ours because yes, like some women, we'll surely be harmed on our side, but we believe that there are way more that will be harmed on theirs."

And panel, at this point at which we acknowledge this trade-off between those two groups, we believe that we can win on firstly the vulnerability of the groups, secondly the scalability of the impact, because we believe that the belief and support network is actually able to benefit everyone, even though both the least and the most privileged ones. But lastly, panel, we believe we can also win on the likelihood, because at the point at which they never actually tell us who does the narrative, like they never actually engage in the fact that the narrative doesn't reach everyone equally, that there are some people who buy into the feminist movement way more, and there are some people who need its support even more, we believe that at this point at which we prove to you that the only ones actually buying into the narrative are the ones actually needing help from the feminist movement and are the most vulnerable groups.

In response to the moral wrong of the oppression of autonomy of the people the feminist movement swore to protect, and in response to the alienation of women and men in a narrow definition of solidarity that would trample on the voiceless, opposition gave us silence. When we asked first opposition in the very first minutes of our constructive why the feminist movement's protection of minorities ought to come at a sacrifice of other women, we heard silence. When we asked second opposition why it was going to be a safe space when the resentment of women and men shut out of an exclusionary movement would cause people to leave, we heard silence. And when third opposition ends up telling us that the sacrifices of women would quote-unquote pay off, they were silent to the actual desires of women who clearly know when maternity leave or gender-based violence is necessary and clearly can vote into policies or do the kinds of actions that they want when it comes at no cost to themselves, who are not babies that need to be paternalistically coddled, but should be able to make their own decisions about their lives, about their empowerment that the feminist movement should never have infringed upon."

And I just wanted to point out how the vast majority of the responses that we got from opposition was not principally or normatively based at all. That they told us that this was practically contingent such that if we helped other women in the long term, this would be justified. Where they told us that the women who were forced to sacrifice would have some kind of practical benefit in the end but that's not what the principle is about the principle is saying that it is unfathomable for a social movement to hurt its own to ever support any kind of alternative or model that went against all of its ideals to protect its individuals, that if its very core was to protect individuals, then it ought not directly hurt them because of the most controversial way that it would exist as a social movement that would obviously cause more harm unto people.

              "text": "But the second thing on change, and honestly, I think we systematically questioned the opposition bench for solvency, and in many places they were incredibly vague. We pointed out why knowledge and education for when it was the case that privileged individuals should know about disprivileged individuals were probably available on either side of the house, more so on ours, when we didn't have the fundamental question about solidarity and the privilege of solidarity actually existed. We told you that for non-contentious issues, which they tried to frame the debate around, that they would be supported either way, straight from the beginning of our first. If it was at zero personal cost to you and you were in a workplace and sexual harassment was happening and everyone was against sexual harassment, then you would obviously all be against sexual harassment. If you were in a male-dominated workspace where you had no solvency, where nothing could possibly happen, where you didn't have other women who could support you, it was bad to force women into a position where they probably wouldn't get anything done, where the only thing that would happen is they would jeopardize their own career. Opposition told us solidarity was likely, but they never proved what it was to happen. They concede in their reply that probably the way solidarity would exist would be privileged. And this doesn't across both ways, because our model is necessarily saying that we have flexibility in the individual development and empowerment of women that can exist for every single iteration of feminism. They assert no woman will be upset in second opposition. But clearly they would be, clearly they would be if they're not represented by a movement, as I think opposition points out. And their own buy-in argument does not make sense at all. It knifes their framing from first. If it is true that women in developing countries are fully and completely dependent on the feminist movement, and they were always going to buy into it, they probably weren't just going to say, oh, I no longer care about my own rights because the feminist movement is not trying hard enough. The feminist movement is trying. They're just not sacrificing other women for the good of these individuals. It is unclear why this causes people to move out of the feminist movement. We see that women at the top were likely to help the ones at the bottom when they had institutional and systematic change that opposition refused to acknowledge. On all bases, it is this case where the feminist movement is able to survive. Incredibly proud to propose. Thank you."

What does this look like? It means that they embrace the concept that LGBTQ individuals are capable of having a nuclear family. Note that this is quite similar to what the LGBTQ movement did with the free love movement when it came to doing things like trying to co-opt marriage equality for queer individuals. B, we think the messaging the movement would then adopt is they would advocate for the legitimisation of LGBTQ individuals being able to do things like have a family. So they focus on creating accessibility pathways, for example, making it far easier for queer individuals to adopt a child or have a biological one through IVF. Secondly, note that there are many iterations of what the nuclear family ideal looks like. So at this precipice in the debate, we think the LGBTQ movement would frame the ideal through the lens of queerness. For example, having the ability to have a family isn't only restricted to heterosexual individuals. But note that this doesn't mean that the community will have to advocate only for family at the expense of other things. We think they can still do it. We think they can still advocate for queer individuals having access to things like marriage. It doesn't have to be exclusively family."

For example, that having a mother and father isn't necessary in order to raise a child successfully, queer individuals can do this too. Thirdly, what is the actual comparative that opposition needs to defend in this debate? Note that in the context of the status quo, we've already been able to secure things like marriage rights for queer individuals in many liberal democracies, but the one stereotype that we have yet to defeat in the status quo is the notion that LGBTQ individuals are incapable of having a family because they're going to corrupt our children. Note that the stance of having a nuclear family isn't one that exists in a vacuum. It is a lifestyle choice that the movement is going to prescribe onto individuals. Therefore, on the side of opposition, they also need to prescribe an alternate ideal lifestyle for LGBTQ individuals to pursue. Note then on our burden. Insofar as we prove that, them choosing to co-opt a nuclear family ideal is able to empower the ability of LGBTQ individuals to pursue a family and uniquely dismantles the harmful stereotypes that are imposed onto them in the status quo, that is enough to take this round. Two arguments. One, on how the adoption of a queer family model is the best form towards humanising members of the queer community. And secondly, while we maximise the choice of members in the community to have access to things like family planning."

              "end": 681.86,
              "text": "On the first argument, three parts. One, note that the adoption of the family unit for many social movements has actually been an extremely strategic move, because a vast majority of the social movements in the status quo were successful largely because they chose to integrate the family unit into their models of hypocrisy. For example, the civil rights movement saying that all individuals, regardless of race, should have the ability to do things like have children. Or the feminist movement choosing to co-opt the nuclear family to show that working women are able to simultaneously hold a job and raise a successful family. What this means is that every social movement to an extent in the status quo recognises that society is built upon the family unit, and we believe that the LGBTQ movement participating in this trend is crucial towards their success. What is the conclusion of this layer? One, it shows that the concept of the nuclear family model is malleable and it's susceptible to evolution, so it isn't a stagnant one that opposition would likely try to argue to you. But secondly, past precedent shows that other movements have been largely successful when they choose to adopt this model, because what you're doing is you're trying to show the rest of society that we can be the same as you, and we are not as different as you think you are. Secondly, why is this trend of co-opting the family unit actually beneficial against fighting stereotypes? Because note, the biggest stereotype that queer individuals face in the status quo is that you are incompatible with the quote-unquote normal ways of life, that you are unable to exist as a functional member of society because your sexuality is different from the rest of them. The way you combat this is by humanising them. So how exactly does embracing the family unit humanise these individuals? Two ways. One, we do things like spotlight the very human experiences of queer families when it comes to raising their children. For example, through shows like Modern Family, which show Mitch and Cam who are able to successfully raise their adopted daughter Lily, and the parallel once again is the free love movement, where we showed that all individuals deserve the ability to love whoever they want, and that was highly successful when it came to garnering things like marriage equality. But secondly, and more importantly, note that society's greatest respect is reserved for parents. Because uniquely, parenting is something that requires large amounts of sacrifice. It's difficult. And when we show that queer individuals are able to be good parents, we think this respect is cross-applied to LGBTQ individuals, because society can empathize with them with how difficult it is when it comes to raising a child. And the way we overcome these differences is by showing that our interests are aligned. Why are we able to do this? Because now we think that the notion is that these individuals are just like me and they deserve my respect. For example, Pete Buttigieg, who's not only a politician, is also capable of being a father. I think these are the instances of humanization that we think are good. Lastly then, on impacting, what are the two stereotypes we dispel? One, that these individuals are not capable of being selfless, because when we show that parenting is extremely difficult effort, it takes plenty of positive perceptions that are now attached to these individuals. And the parallel is that politicians who don't have families in the status quo are criticized as incapable because they can't even control their home. Literally every single successful politician has to have proven their capability via having a successful family. But secondly, and more importantly, we remove the gender stereotypes of maternalism and paternalism that exist in families. Because what we show now is that queer relationships can be diverse, that a family can sustain without having a maternal or paternal figure, and that both parents are capable of offering things like emotional compensation to their child. Before I go on, sure. Modern-day feminism and other social movements reject nuclear families as it confines people to static boundaries of being the breadwinner or the caretaker. Why should the LGBTQ movement then adopt this despite the rejection by parallel social movements? So, one, that's not true. I would argue that feminism, the only reason why we're advocating against the nuclear family unit is because it does things like say that women only have to have things like children. But uniquely on our side, the counter-narrative that we are pushing is that LGBTQ individuals don't deserve the right to have a family. Uniquely, when we dispel the stereotype that they are capable human beings, that is when we actually maximize choice."

              "text": "Second argument on how we maximize the ability of members to have access to things like family planning. The preamble of this argument is that the purpose of the LGBTQ movement has always been to empower all choices. Three ways. One, not that society has historically disempowered LGBTQ individuals from having a family. Not only have they faced multiple hurdles in terms of the aforementioned stereotypes in the first argument, but the greatest injustice you could impose onto these individuals is that when they cannot access their right to have a family, why absent of this emphasis, you won't be able to get it on their side? One, the movement isn't going to concentrate resources on creating accessibility pathways. So sure, there'll still be queer individuals who want to have children, but these are only the most wealthy who can afford the high cost of IVF. What this means is that people, absent of having the movements backing them, will be structurally locked out of accessing family planning. Secondly, how does the queer movement empower the choice to create families on our side? One, we advocate for paving accessibility in two ways. So one, when it comes to independent organizations like NGOs who provide funds to access things like IVF adoption and they provide consultation services. This is crucial because the barrier of entry into family planning for queer individuals specifically is very high. But secondly, we lobby governments to pass legislation that enshrines the ability to have kids. So we provide parental leave to queer parents, prevent discrimination in adoption centres, and we increase the accessibility of these individuals to experience the joys of parenthood. They would doubly punish these individuals on our side because absent of them actively embracing this model, you don't say that all queer individuals deserve the right to have a family and you don't empower them. No one should be stripped of the ability to have a child and that is May we now have the first crop take off the case for the side opposition. Hi, there is a microphone on the table. Do you want? Can everybody hear me if I talk at this volume? Then we're good. Thank you."

It says that there is just one way a family should look and that all people ought to choose to operate within that structure. This was never what the most diverse, broad-spanning community in the world wanted to embrace. Your queerness has no conditions. On setup, firstly, what does actively embracing the nuclear family ideal look like? The community sets this at the standard through messaging, social pressure, activism, and leadership. You, as an LGBTQ plus person, are told to aspire towards A, getting married, and B, having children as ideal. This debate then operates in two spheres. First, in countries where marriage and children are accessible to queer people already, like liberal democracies. In these countries, Proposition would actively put down and criticize gay people who did not get married to one person and adopt or have children the same way we might criticize single and childless people in the status quo. Second, in countries that do not have legal marriage and adoption, their side identifies this as the primary concern of the movement. This is a concern that Prime Minister completely skips over. This strategic concession will be damning for them in this speech."

The status quo already pushes that nuclear families are good, so in these places, the queer community didn't also need to do it too. However, in countries that do not have progressive pro-LGBTQ plus legislation, we would push the queer community to advocate for anti-harassment and anti-workplace discrimination laws, visibility, and acceptance, all things that are likely more pertinent concerns in the universal interests of all LGBTQ plus people.

The feminist movement rejects motherhood as a precondition of your acceptance in the community, and the civil rights movement never focused on this. I mean, people had children before and after the civil rights movement. But secondly, note that their argumentation here was just example level. We think that there is more likely moral panic surrounding queer people, and so we would like, we see more dehumanization at the point at which you saw this type of adoption. Secondly, the second thing they tell you is about how the biggest stereotype in the status quo is that you're not a functional human being if you are a queer person.

              "text": "Our first substantive argument is on decreased choice, and the thesis of this argument is why you get more coercion of LGBTQ plus people on their side. Three ideas here. One, structural alienation of subgroups within the LGBTQ movement exists on their side. Look, the queer community does not just contain gay and bisexual people, it also encompasses polyamorous people who date multiple partners and asexual and aromantic people who do not have interest in long-term relationships. Also, people who do not want nuclear families, slash do not see this narrative as appealing, regardless of sexual orientation, are not going to buy into the movement on their side of the house. Secondly, even for people that did buy in, you limited opportunities for exploration that were crucial to LGBTQ plus groups. Why is this the case? Because gay and trans people who are raised surrounded by heterosexual couples and heterosexual norms often do not realize their identity until later on in life. On their side, these people felt behind and excluded because they hadn't been able to immediately settle down the way that their own community, their only support system, said that they should. Thirdly, adoption and other ways of having children are very expensive. Even if it's legal, even if some NGOs step in on their side of the house, adoption is very difficult. It requires home inspections. It requires tens of thousands of dollars that are spent on the process. Further, we think the closer you get to emulating straight relationships, the more likely you are to see a need for expensive tech processes like in vitro fertilization that they tell you about. These were three groups of people who together comprised the vast majority of the LGBTQ plus community who felt shut out, invisible, dejected, and as though they were the wrong kind of queer people on side proposition's best ground. On their worst though though in countries that never Listened to queer people's calls for reform everyone felt dejected and as though they were unable to live a fulfilling life We think that is what this affects them go who choose to have children. Similarly, even if you embrace the family unit as a queer movement, it doesn't mean you need to shame queer individuals who don't opt into the model. Listen to their own mechanisms on their side of the house. They say that this social movement and this narrative is going to be so strong and so empowering, so obviously there would be coercive pressure in order to buy into the things that they tell you about. We think this is very tense with their own case."

              "text": "Our second substantive argument is on protecting the aims of the movement. And the thesis of this argument is simple. The LGBTQ movement does not exist to pander to heteronormativity and straight norms. In fact, it would be tremendously harmful for the community to embrace the nuclear family. Three ideas here. One, on the capital trade-off between advocating for marriage rights and other rights and protections in countries without pre-existing progressive laws. Look, every dollar you pour in, every speech you give, every lawyer you hire, every event you organize for marriage rights trades off with those same things in favor of workplace protections, hate crime laws, visibility, and so on. This is according to their own warranting about the concentration of resources. There are two harms of this. First, on the scope of protections and what is more pressing. Marriage is not desired by all LGBTQ plus people, whereas basic economic and harassment protections are. Moreover, our protections are logically prior to marriage and adoption because the severity of harm is so much greater. Queer people need material subsistence, the right to feel safe at work, the right to not be killed as more pressing than a marriage contract. But second, more immediate rights and protections lead to marriage rights. This will flip their entire case. The best way to get a homophobe to change in their ways is for them to exist in and see the humanity of queer people in common spaces with them, which can only exist when basic workplace protections exist. Additionally, homophobic people often view marriage as sacred, thus they're further polarized away with their type of advocacy. This means more immediate rights lead to marriage rights eventually, but not the other way around. Secondly, on losing buy-in into collective actions in all countries. Very simply, we told you there were many LGBTQ plus groups and other groups of queer folks who cannot and do not want a nuclear family. Moreover, many people in the movement just don't want to have a family and children. These are huge swaths of people. You are likely to isolate and alienate them when your movement devotes significant resources towards their concept, fracturing the ability for the movement to do anything in collective action. Thirdly, on backlash, there's a unique moral panic surrounding children because society views them as particularly vulnerable. There's also a unique moral panic surrounding the sanctity of marriage within religious and conservative communities. Thus, it's safer and steadier to make sure that you can get immediate, smaller reforms because you risk danger to queer people otherwise. Three impacts. One, they lose access to more important material problems. Two, you lose the ability for the movement to advocate for anything. Three, you risk further danger. Queerness has no conditions. That is what we stand for. Thank you. And that's the first up for that very fine speech. And it is now time for the second up to extend the public case."

Now, what is the characterization of parallel social movements in the status quo, and how does the queer community fit into this trend? When we talk about the civil rights movement, we aren't talking about Martin Luther King, okay? We are talking about depictions of fresh off the boat, Asian families like Kim's Convenience, like Raven's House, making sure that every single disparate community is represented in the most humanized way possible, because society's greatest admiration is reserved for their parents. What this humanization does, is does more than say that they're humans, but say that they are selfless, they love individuals, they're responsible, they're capable, they have emotional intelligence to raise a child. They love, and they love beyond themselves, not selfish individuals. That is the greatest stereotypes that queer individuals have to overcome. That they refuse to carry their family's legacy. That they're living for themselves, living in their twenties forever, refusing to live in reality and for others. We make them selfless. We make them charitable and kind. That is how you humanise individuals. The suffering, the troubles of parenting, all of them make them selfless. We make them charitable and kind. That is how you humanize individuals. The suffering, the troubles of parenting, all of them make them uniquely humanized under our side of the house. The feminist movement as well is diverse. So they can't just claim that the feminist movement is inherently anti-motherhood because the feminist movement is probably the world's greatest social movement. The thing done on proposition is that motherhood was never a precondition to being a woman, but you were allowed to access it if you wanted to, and that is the crux of all social movements."

Because all of their analysis on having more pressing issues is exactly dealt with when we get more resources, more critical mass, and more support. This looks like two things. One, out of sympathy. This looks like the freedom for love movement, which means that straight individuals are likely to sympathize with you by saying that society is oppressing you and depriving you of a human right. The human right for marriage and love, on our side, we extend it to the human right of having and loving a family. Secondly, when it comes to critical mass, we think the other stereotype that the queer movement has to overcome in the status quo is that they are exclusionary. Why have a queer parade, a pride parade, and not a straight pride? And that is exactly how we get rid of the stereotype of exclusion because now there's no difference between a straight mother, a queer mother, a lesbian family. We all just want to love our children. We just want the best for our children. And through the depiction of queer individuals like this on our side of the house, we are able then to get humanization and political support. That means they will vote for your issues. That means they won't believe that you're overreacting when you're talking about, like, oppression. That means they believe you deserve rights, and that is how you get empowered in policy, but also in terms of, for instance, workplace discrimination. They don't believe you're inherently unhardworking, because if a queer parent and a queer father can love their son above all else, then surely all queer individuals too can share those characteristics, and we eviscerate the stereotype that they live only for themselves."

Yet somehow on their side of the house, they'll be able to create structures that prevent protection and etc. Surely they don't have to prove a positive comparative, but we are able to prove that the humanization of individuals gets far better. In fact, in developing countries, this probably gets even better because, for instance, the nuclear family structure is far stronger in these countries. For instance, in Malaysia, you need to have children to bring your family pride. But the only reason why they detest queer individuals then is because they can't have a family. They can't carry the family name. But now they can. Now they have a family. Now they have children. Now they have a loving wife. And now the queer community is likely to get more support then. Before I go on, I'll take a point. Proposition is running to the middle. Loving your children or showing families on TV that are gay is not their side of the house. If you want to claim you've got such sweeping policy and sweeping benefits, then you need to take a hard stance instead of citing examples about showing gay couples on TV."

If you also want to defend depictions of family, if you also want to defend enshrining the queer family as being a viable option for queer individuals to take, then you are contradicting your first argument about how there are other more important things to care about. We are saying this is the most important thing because this is the prerequisite to everything else. Your case needs to engage dynamically. But secondly on individual empowerment in two ways. One as I've previously stated, every social movement is built upon empowerment, and even if that's not true, society itself is inherently oppressive, so any counter-narrative by social movements are required as the counter-narrative and the corrective mechanism for existing oppression. But secondly, when opposition says having children is difficult, that can't substitute for analysis. Just because you might not want biological children doesn't mean the millions of queer individuals don't. We must therefore empower the choices of these individuals, because IVF isn't the desire to be closer to a straight person, it is the desire to see your genes passed on, a biological extension of yourself for you to love and to care for and raise into a human being. And these are all points of actualization that opposition cannot co-opt insofar as none of their resources can go towards this empowerment if they believe this is so unimportant. But lastly, we proved that we're able to empower multifaceted representations of queer individuals insofar as historical depictions of queer individuals have been premised upon one-dimensional characterizations defined by their sexuality. Like the butch lesbian who wears flannel and sits on a motorcycle, the difference is that on their side, they are accessories to a plot and they're disconnected from the main story. When they become family members, when they're integral to the nuclear family structure, they interact with other people within the story in meaningful and interesting ways. And they're able to have dimension that opposition would never allow them to have. The American dream was premised upon actualization and autonomy, empowering all individuals to achieve whatever they wanted to. If it was a family, proposition test, hear, hear. Thank you. All right, everyone good? Awesome."

I want to forward another extension as to why they get less support on their side of the house and it's because they decrease solidarity and cooperation with other movements. Note that right now the LGBTQ plus movement is able to cooperate with other progressive movements like the feminist movement and more younger left wing movements. The problem with the nuclear family is that it directly contradicts the aims of those movements. For example, in the feminist movement, they're trying to get rid of the oppressive labor roles that are endemic in nuclear families, that women have to be the provider for children, and that men are the breadwinners. It was oppositional, young, ambitious people because they didn't want to settle down and throw away their career. This was a massive impact because they got less financial support on their side of the house and they got less political support. These young individuals and feminists were less likely to show up for political rallies, less likely to lobby, which means that you not only lost LGBTQ plus people, you also lost massive levels of support from other individuals."

You never got change in terms of adoption if you didn't get buy-in. Buy-in was an a priori concern to every other impact in this debate. They never got access to their arguments if they did not have a strong movement. The second thing I want to talk about is about individual choice. Go ahead. Do you oppose the queer community's greatest political success of legalizing queer marriage since there are polyamorous people on your side as well? We would argue that if that comes at the cost of trading off with more immediate needs that people have, then sure, we oppose it. But on our side of the house, we think that we get better movements and stronger movements, which means we still accomplish the very same aims that you talk about. The second thing I want to talk about is individual choice. And I want to note the volume of material that Sungjoo gave you that was just never engaged with their side of the house. We told you there were polyamorous people and there were asexual people that were structurally alienated, that you limited the exploration of identities and you prevented people from exploring on their side of the house, which is a keystone experience in the LGBTQ plus community. That it was simply very, very expensive to do things like raise a child and enter a marriage. And there are two impacts of this. First of all, you vilified people that weren't able to do things like access marriage. And second of all, you forced people that didn't initially want to get into marriage to do it, which means that for a long period of their lifetime, they'll be very, very unhappy. Panel, I want to note that marriages are something that are inherently coercive. It is very, very hard to break out of a marriage, to do things like split assets. There's massive societal and reputational harms. So what do you do on their side of the house? You not only destroy the movement, but you reduce the quality of life of individuals. All of their argument is that people deserve a choice to pursue things like marriage. We would argue that, number one, this is contingent on people having the resources and the capacity to do so, but second of all, there's other mechanisms of fulfilling long-term marriages. Even if we don't support nuclear families on our side of the house, we're still fine with people having things like children, having things like families, having things like houses. I want to note that in this debate, the most important thing was buy-in, and when you fractured the most important thing, which was support from the LGBTQ plus community, you never got buy-in, you never got success.

Why is dispelling such narratives so important? Because first, it's what holds the community back from attaining social acceptance."

              "text": "unless you're able to have this. Maybe there are other grounds to which you can get acceptance, but we explain why engaging on the specific issue of family unit is important. Their contention is that parallel movements oppose the family unit. This is untrue. The conception of a nuclear family has evolved to be inclusive of things like interracial marriage and adopted kids, and this deals with the extension of second opposition. It's all I can do on this. They don't prove it. Which means the burden they've yet to prove is why are these values so bad that they can never ever reconcile? You know, specifically in developing countries where the nuclear family was important, that we had to get this and it's going to be good. Let's do the weighing on coercion. Let's take what is our best case. On our side, some people are nudged towards opting into the nuclear family. On their side, some people are nudged away from the nuclear family. How do you resolve the deadlock? The first is that there are other barriers that make people reconsider having children. The time and monetary constraints of a nuclear family is what gave rise to countervailing narratives like don't have a child if you can't afford him, or be prepared for 18 years of parental duties which neutralises the push to have children. In comparison, it's easier to coerce someone out of having children because there's no tangible visible cause yet to say you are a bad queer person if you don't align with the values of not having children. That's why there's more coercion on their side because it's easier to bully someone out of it which is why we promote choice. But secondly, the problems of a nuclear family can be largely mitigated through community support for queer families or work-life balance legislation. But the harms of the lesbian woman who longed her whole life to raise a child but now cannot do so is exclusive to their side because they can never have a child. And that's why having a child is inherent to the nuclear family. On exclusivity of harm, we win. That's the distinction. That's why their side is far worse for choice. Their only mechanism for change are TV sitcoms. If you see gayness as sin, and you see a gay family on TV, you are more likely to view that as the conglomeration of sin than seeing gay people as handy dandy. That is an insane demonstration of your inability to listen to our case. What we said from first was that if you agree there's a concentration of resources, but how you're better able to push for these things means that you're not necessarily saying you have to opt into it, but the creation of the platforms and policies that you have is what pushes people towards it. And this issue takes some of their best on the second thing of creating access for queer families. Even if you could dismantle the idea of a nuclear family, the question was whether you should. Because the narrative that queer people are compatible with the nuclear family unit is precisely what lets you advocate for the support structures that enable them to safely start families, like IVF or adoption centres. I think it's the prerequisite to opening up choice, which responds to the seventh minute on org about why it's hard to have a child. I'm saying that embracing the nuclear family is what creates the platform for you to want to have that child. And this is important, because if you agree that these people are going to otherwise suffer, they really want to have a child because it's so important for their self-actualization. We create the pathway for them to get that point. It doesn't exist on their side. Their only response is this trades away resources from other predictions. This is just ridiculous. So we should just define all queer art because it's seen as less valuable. We should abandon protests to have trans people in the military because it only affects a small group of people? What we explain is that it's an important issue, so we should put resources into it, even if there are other considerations they should make, that is just non-comparative. Secondly, we explain it's actually easier to campaign for family support because family is glorified, because it's seen as intersectional with other movements, like supporting Planned Parenthood welfare, it becomes easier for us to get these legislative protections on our side or the forms of social acceptance that are on their side. So at the end of this clash, they don't actually have any exclusive harm or benefits in this debate. Our third substantive expands on this excellently by explaining that, even if it wasn't direct material alleviation, it was through media representation that empowers queer people. Within pop culture, we pivot away from homogenized portrayals of queer people in movies as the eccentric character or someone who's the Mary Sue by showing that why within these families, there are someone who's core, someone that can be lovable, and someone which you are humanized with. At the end of this debate, we proved two very simple things that means we make it to the finals. First, we're able to explain why these parents are better able to have those children there, but two, why these people are able to get rid of the worst stereotypes that currently hold down the queer community."

Honestly, Team USA was disappointed when Team Malaysia decided that this debate would be about we have to defend gay people never have families and they get to defend that they always have access to families. I want to start this speech by really stepping into reality and talking about what this debate is actually about. Their side of the house needed to prove to you an overvailing narrative that told people nuclear families were something you ought to have, something that we should idolize, something that spurred all the change they wanted on their side of the house. Let's be very reasonable panel. Our side never needed to defend that these people could not have families. They themselves characterized you in first that in a vast majority of cases people could already have families when they chose to. That marriage laws across the world made it so that people could access these familial units. What then was the difference between the two sides? Because Team Malaysia, you guys getting up here for the entirety of the debate and trying to say we don't support families was not sufficient argumentation. The reality was this. Our role is one in which you got advocacy for immediate needs, that you still have things like access to gay marriage, but you've got support for the choices of LGBTQ people. Their side of the house had to defend an adoption of the norm, a norm that a nuclear family was viable. The second thing I want to do just at the top of this speech is point out a contradiction. Last Peeker says we didn't have to support the nuclear family narrative as it exists today or the specific iteration of it, but then they go on to say about why this narrative is such a good thing. Guys, if you think the nuclear family narrative is so problematic, then why are you supporting it on your side? Presumably you would also rather support a world where people had the agency to commit free choice, that we supported things like people's liberation and didn't antagonize people for settling down."

I have a couple of things to say.

The first push we heard was on fractionalization, that when you were induced to the idea of a nuclear family, and when this is something the movement necessarily pushed for, the adoption came with a trade-off. In order for the LGBTQ movement to substantially push for change and to encourage people that this idea of a nuclear family was good, it came at the expense of ideas like liberation. It came at the expense of the idea that you could spend the rest of your life or take the first dozen years of your life to figure out who you are. You could explore your sexual identity. The idea of a nuclear family was diametrically opposed to these things. They could not just get up here and say, oh, we get this too on their side of the house, because the adoption of a norm, what this looked like when people were giving speeches about having a nuclear family and how it was so good to be a gay person and a familial unit, all of those things necessarily came with a trade-off. And that alienated people. In movements all across the world where support for LGBTQ people was already in the vast minority, you needed the person who was asexual or didn't have romantic preferences to buy into your movement because then you galvanized collective change that uplifted everyone. This was a much more reasonable comparative, and it's way too late for proposition-reply to actually respond to the arguments you heard and the round."

              "text": "But second, we told you about how this was likely to immediately alienate people, that look, the wash in this debate was societies where we already had this acceptance. But the change then was that you threatened one thing that people felt was closest, that the idea of the nuclear family was so enshrined in conservatism, which they concede to you themselves, and that necessarily meant that people felt aggravated and threatened when you also tried to adopt this idea of a nuclear family, that they felt threatened and were not likely to open reforms, that they immediately shut down. They hated the idea that people were overstepping on the nuclear family that they believed righteously belonged to them. So all of this meant that their arguments in this round were applicable to the vast minority of people, the places where nuclear families and the choice already exist, but our arguments catered to the vast majority. It is way too late again for Proposition to Reply to come to this. The last piece of material then I want to forward to you is this idea of elitism. They try to say that, ah, we make things less expensive on our side of the house, but this is not really the reason why things like IVF were so expensive. It was because companies knew it was an inelastic good and that people would pay anything to have access to those things, and they were able to use this monopoly power to create high prices. Their side of the house, maybe if they get a little bit more support of that, is knived by the fractionalization that occurs when they feel like the only way for the LGBTQ movement to go forward is to regressress because they concede this. The nuclear family is an outdated idea of how society runs, so why on earth proposition would you insist that everyone go to revert to it? I have no idea. Before I talk about the second clash on better outcomes. If conservatives are so uncompromising and will antagonize every deviation from the patriarchal nuclear family, how does a queer couple in an area where queer marriage is legalized opt into a family? I think that on your side of the house, you get more antagonization. I just explained to you that people feel like the thing they value the most, the nuclear family, is being stripped of them to begin with. This is why you preferred our counterfactual, where we did not set the bar as so high as to try and take a nuclear family, but pushed for gradualism, that you could still get access to things like equality in the workplace for LGBTQ people, but you did not need to insist on this primary doctrine that dictated the language and the rhetoric of the movement on your side of the house."

Their only response to this is to say, ah, but when we advocated for equality and gay marriage, those people didn't necessarily feel alienated. But our response is quite simple. The act of embracement was a question of the lifestyle of those individuals and insisted that there was only one way you ought to live and one presiding paradigm. It was not about choice. This was different from things like marriage. It was about the one way you ought to live and one presiding paradigm. It was not about choice. This was different from things like marriage. It was about the only way you ought to live your life is this very specific prescription on their side of the house. It was antagonistic to things like liberalization, whereas existing in some sort of marriage was not. This was the difference on our side of the house.

In response to a POI we give in their first they say ah the feminist movement like embraces nuclear families. Guys, that's just not true Feminism and fourth-weight feminism today is diametrically opposed to those ideas So in this regard we think it was a reversion of norms for the LGBTQ community to go back to adopt a nuclear family when their other, sister movements were harming it, which meant you got less buy-in from constituent and neighbouring social movements on our side of the house, and you got less ability, rather, to mobilise the change you so needed.

I think this entire issue is contingent on how people are going to react to the queer nuclear family, and their case of change also relies upon some degree of humanization. Insofar as we prove that our humanization is the most effective, that is how you're able to overcome stereotypes. You only believe it's a sin because you believe that queer individuals have horrible morals, but when you see them loving and caring for the child, then it gets rid of the stereotype that they are selfish, that they don't care. Three things. One, about backlash. How do you think any movement ever got any change? If people were so homophobic, does opposition really believe that the moment you say, let's have queer marriage, thereby encroaching on the sanctity of marriage, people are like, oh, that's fine. At least you don't touch the children, right?"

One, we told you about platforming successful stories, stories that on opposition would not exist because we told you about structures that never existed. Secondly, because of shaping parental perceptions. Like the feminist movement, they were not opposed to family because they empowered motherhood. They were opposed to the patriarchal norms of nuclear family. We can then be opposed to the homophobic norms of patriarchal family, and that is how families evolve over time. That is the reason why women are allowed to work and still have families, because things are allowed to evolve. But thirdly, on shared history, historically children are the very thing that connects all individuals when it comes to the love is free, it is about making common ground that opposition eviscerates."

What opposition has to defend is a world that never touches the idea of a nuclear family. By embracing it, we are able to show alternative mechanisms of somebody who could still love their children. The impact is simple. It's not just IVF. It is about stopping the demonization of queer families who are told by the movement that they are conforming to heteronormativity and are not allowed to access families."

But we say that our principles apply in any country in which opposition can prove to us that such tax codes exist.

Fifthly, we realise that some of these institutions carry out genuine charitable activities and we support this. So we will therefore make all charitable activities tax deductible, just as we allow charitable work by corporations to be deductible. Just to be clear however, we will ensure that these activities are genuinely charitable, so things like missionary work do not apply. However, full day and exercise such things would. Let's be clear, these normalizations would still be tied to property, assets, investments and income."

              "text": "empower women all across the globe. On to my first argument. Why tax exemption is a privilege and not a right. We think it is high time to update the RK policies with the favour of religion in order to reflect more modern values of equality. We believe that the government should have every right to tax women's coordination pursued precisely through the first view on the principle of reciprocity. Religious institutions could not exist without the support continually provided to them by the government. They could not hold poverty if the government did not hold up the law and the police force which we all pay for. More importantly, they could not exist without the right to free association, speech and freedom of religion, which is upheld by the police and the judiciary, which, once again, we all pay for. It is abhorrent that religions can derive such benefit from the taxes we pay and the laws which we uphold, and they do not contribute their fair share to upholding them. Secondly, as long as religions don't pay tax, the burden on ordinary people is dramatically increased. The general population pays for the billions of dollars of government spending, and whilst some of this burden falls on the wealthy, a lot of it does fall on ordinary, wealthy-class people, the poor and women. In our world, it becomes possible to alleviate this burden when religions pay fair taxes. Team Canada will leave poor women to make up for the greed of religions. So, to be clear, the premise of this debate is that religions owe an enormous debt to society and to the government and should have been paying taxes for it very long time. However, just as the government has taken it away, so too can the government forgive. With this, it could be reasonable for the government to forgive this debt if the religion helps it to promote certain policies. In the same way, crediting by forgiven debt is the debt of the enemy. However, it is reasonable for the government to forgive the debt of religions, since those religions help to promote certain useful policies. What we propose is to do something of a deal with religious organizations that is unprecedented for such deals. We already give Times Square this to corporations who promote affirmative action in the second or combat climate change. We will forgive the debt of religions which promote female leaders. That's what we stand for."

              "text": "or should be part of the government in religious institutions. Therefore, we think that religious institutions have an equal playing field, have an equal ground. That's what we stand for. heroes. Now onto our second question. So it's time to know, why is policy resolved in the appointment of more women? Firstly, how does our membership incentivize change within doctrines? Let's outline in my example the money involved here will be a sufficient incentive for change within the religion. Note that this is an extremely large sum of money that we're talking about. It would impact religious institutions both on a small and on a large scale. On a large scale, when the Catholic Church has to pay tax on the CC channel, when it has to pay property tax on trying real-estate materials in every major city in Europe, the church that currently exists will not be financially viable, as any reserved religious organization would not be able to exist as it currently does. In addition, we imagine that for most religious leaders, the thought of losing their jobs, their buildings, and other pet projects they've been working on for a long period of time will be a sufficient incentive for them to change their policy. Furthermore, we think that on a smaller scale, with independence laws and smaller congregations, they will also come by without policy. We imagine that it is most likely also that for inferior leaders, that will close down entirely, as would be the case given that they will die of small donations and tax exemptions too. Furthermore, we think this incentive would also speak to particularly hardline and devout leaders within the movement. Why have that aspect? Because every program that a hardline leader wants to promote still requires money. Launching new missionary efforts, converting new funders, or introducing new education programs in order to save souls, these things all require money. You see, no reason why they would prioritize not appointing female leaders over anything other than a bit of their doctrine. In addition, we think this is especially true given that we imagine that at least some religious organizations will have a private policy and will then keep their money and their missionary benefits. Given that happens, any church where you please honor that we refuse to comply, this is being outcompeted and losing followers as a result. Now, we think that this policy, this chain, will be fairly easy for leaders to make within their religions. Why? Two precisely. Firstly, if a religious leader was to introduce a policy, even if they are doing so for purely financial motives, it is very easy for them to claim that they are doing it for genuine doctrinal reasons. That's why when Pope Francis wanted to soften the church's stance on homosexuality, he was able to back himself up by claiming that the Bible already supported him. The Jew on Jesus' son on the mountain said, if a man is gay and loves God, who am I to judge him? Thus he justified an entirely new policy with reference to old, already existing doctrine. Can you imagine something similar would happen when appointed human leaders. He perhaps would quote Jesus' words, but the person with the most knowledge should be the leader, or any other thing of sorts. This is especially easy given that religion can be very contradictory, and leaders can choose the interpretation that most believers get pregnant with women in order to prepare for the equality, while still adhering to their religion. The second reason why this change will be easy to make. There are men inside a school who want to change doctrine. Who want to change doctrine. This is for two reasons. Firstly, they want more confidence. They will get back if they incorporate other values into their religion. And secondly, they live in a modern world, they absorb modern media, and the idea of female leaders is just by no means a thing. And this means that there are people who exist who want to change doctrine. There is no less resistance for them to do so. But, we'll thank you furthermore and lastly why is it that this change would be accepted by members of these individual organizations for comprehensive reasons firstly it is the nature of religious leaders that the court was deferred to them because they think they come from a place of higher purpose and they represent something bigger than the individual religious leaders commonly affect politics in a community they have dinner people's, have the power to win hearts and minds, panel. And as such, they are trustworthy and essential parts of communities. Secondly, when women show charisma, knowledge, and dedication, the men who oppose their curriculum will come to respect them and learn that they should respect women in the more general sense. Thirdly, with generations, what now seems to be radical ideas become far more accepted, and what we see is that this resentment is going to naturally cease to exist with time. Fourthly and finally, it is just not true that women take no leadership roles in these communities to begin with. There is to an extent no female leadership, and it was our policy to build on that. That's why in the Indian Tunchayak, the community councils, that is, women routinely take leadership roles. If conservatives can accept women on village councils, they can certainly get used to female priests. Part of it for all these reasons, and because we refuse to grant privilege to those who willfully slander women, we are very proud to propose."

The first idea they gave us is that they're going to require religious institutions to appoint a large number of women, they're going to require them to appoint them quickly, and they're going to require them to appoint them at all levels. We have a few questions about that, because that actually was sort of vague when you get down to it, right? What is the timeline? How many women need to be appointed? When it comes to the formalities of the tax code, Team Wales needs to have those answers. We'd also ask you, does a woman need to be the pope? Really, how consistent are they going to be with, of course, forceifying all levels of leadership happening? Another question, would they consider the mother superior of a covenant of nuns to be a female religious leader? We ask you secondly, what if women genuinely believe that their role in the religious structure is not to be a formalized leader? What happens in Team Wales' world when no women volunteer themselves up for this position? In terms of their argumentation, they told us that taxation is the right product for religion. We told you that society can also benefit from religion the way that religion benefits from society, and that's why we've negated the obligation to tax like we do with charitable institutions. And if it's true that they're so principally required to pay their taxes, why are they willing to present an exemption if they comply? The only reason is that they actually don't want to separate the church and state. They want to use the church as an arm of the government to promote their politically subjective doctrine. I think this is really tense with the model they brought. We gave you a POI on the roles of men and women in the religious institutions and whether or not they thought they were equal. They gave you a sort of evasive answer in which they said, we want equality, which we know, under the status quo, they don't think the roles of men and women are equal within the religious framework. This means two things. Firstly, it's tense with their concession that women have existing power and existing roles. It means that they just don't value those roles, and I'm going to prove to you why that's a real underestimation of the power of women."

I'm going to demonstrate why it is that they've significantly undervalued allowing the most robust incarnation of religious freedom. And here's why it's important. Question mark. Religious freedom is a necessary extension of several other things. It's a necessary extension of freedom of assembly, of freedom of association, and of freedom of expression. It also is a necessary extension of the right to autonomy and the right to self-determination. These are all things that Team Will seems to value when it comes to a very specific group of women who are religious and who have the aspiration to become leaders. They don't want to apply those values to all members of a society which rights are prioritization. Here's where it gets far worse for teen women. The rights violation that they're engaging in is one which people can buy their way out of. Wealthy congregations are just going to pay the taxes and get their tax status out of the way and carry on with business as usual. So that means that Proposition is only prepared to violate the rights of the poorest within society. That means that Proposition's best case scenario uses extortion to weaponize people's poverty against them. Team Canada finds this intrinsically immoral,"

I don't think that's a very strategic example for a team of whales to be using, because that's an example for the type of change that they want, without the nasty mechanism that they want to use, proving the absolute dirt of a need to intervene in this, which is one of the things they have to do.

              "text": "Team Canada believes that empowerment is not tantamount to a job title, nor is it tantamount to formalized authority. Power structures within religious institutions are not as rigid as team proposition makes them out to be. Remember, religion is not just about giving people a way to believe in a higher power. Religion is also about giving people rules to live by and a way of thinking. So yes, religions typically do have different roles for men and women, but to say that one role has more value and power than the other does a disservice to the countless roles of women within the religious framework. Let's look at nuns within the Catholic Church who know, don't give sermons every Sunday, but have spread education all around the world for hundreds of years. In the minds of millions of children raised by nuns, women hold a different but a hugely potent responsibility when it comes to activating the lives of their wives. On this basis, it's wrong for the government to tell women that they are oppressed and then ride in on some sort of a white horse. It's up to women themselves to decide that they want change. And if and when religious women decide that they do want this change, there is an existing mechanism for them to realize this change that affirms freedom of religion rather than violating it. A process is as follows. Religion, like the people in this room, places a high value on discourse and debate. This comes in the form of a discussion of different interpretations and readings of foundational religious texts. Slowly, when dissenting opinions gain ground, they form a new congregation or a new sect. This is why you have Catholics and Protestants, Shiites, Sunnis, Wahhabis, and Alawites. The difference between these groups is their opinions on what the best interpretation of their text is. Specifically, within Judaism, you have egalitarianism Judaism, which is actually specifically focused on the principle of granting equality within the framework of traditional Judaism. I think that's the best proof there is that we can get the same outcome on team composition without using an unnecessary intervention on the important framework on religion. But finally, they make the change slower and less likely to happen. Why? Proposition wants this debate to be about the most extreme religious groups that are the least likely to change on their own. These are the exact religious groups that already perceive the modern world to be at war with their God. They believe that God is the highest authority and not the state, and that the state is attacking their way of life by trying to violate that higher authority. This means they leave public society, in which they feel threatened, and turn inward, they turn insular, making them less receptive to values of liberalism, making them less receptive to the change the proposition wants. They failed on their burdens. We're proud to have them. Thank you."

I'll first be rebounding their facile attack story case, then be talking about their freedom of faith point, as well as their second substantive argument. Now firstly, about their facile attack story case. So basically the only attacks that they had were on our mechanism, and that we weren't specific enough. No thank you. Firstly, we tell you that we are giving general mechanisms that are going to work different in each case scenario. We don't necessarily have to give you a unique time frame for everything. That's not our burden to take. They then tell us that we have three burdens on our side. They tell us that we have to show this appassionate problem, no thank you, that the model is the only way to achieve it, and that we have three burdens on our side. They tell us that we have to show this depressing problem, no thank you, that the model is the only way to achieve it, and that we get more good than harm. Firstly, and the idea that it's a depressing problem, my first speaker did address this, and I will be talking about this entirely in my substantive, no thank you. They tell us that we have to prove that it's the only way to do this. No! We have to prove to you that this is a way to do this, and that this is a way that we are going to achieve the aims of equality that we think are so important. We're having to have policies that occur simultaneously. We're just saying, no, thank you, that this is something that we think is good for society, and that is how we achieve less harm than good, because we create this type of equality. They never told us what their versions were, because conveniently, of course, they didn't have any. We think that their purpose is to show us why this model won't work, why it won't provide some equality for women, and why at the very least it will result in no thank you. Tax revenue, even if our case doesn't stand, right? So they tell us in response to our case that tax is a privilege, not a right. That we think that no women are going to volunteer for these positions. We think it's completely a distinct mischaracterization to say that no women believe in their religion enough that they would like to lead other members of their church. That's simply untrue. We think that secondly, no thank you, they tell us that we're trying to use the church as a political tool. No thank you. If the political tool is to make the equality of women a priority, to make people, girls go into education, no thank you, to be able to empower them to achieve the most that they can, we're fine if that's a political motivation that we believe the church should be doing. Basically, we contradict ourselves when we say that there are women in power, but not women in power already, that this change hasn't already happened. Well, we told you that there are women in political power, and why is this important, right? Because the church right now is bypassing what changes are occurring in all other parts of society. In India, women serve in representative councils. No thank you. But in religion, women are still uniquely excluded from religion. And that's why this incentive uniquely applies to them. No thank you. They did not respond to my entire first speaker's argument about why this will work. They simply brushed this aside and their first speaker completely responds to this, we'd like to hear some information about four minutes of our speech. Thank you. No. Now to this point about the"

Firstly, if a belief has a harm to an individual, if a belief is causing these individuals to not be able to go to school, as is the case, we're thinking, of values that perpetuate women not having education, not having enough power in society, we think that that belief is irrelevant. Secondly, we don't let racist people, people who think that there should be segregation, allow their beliefs to be absolute, right? We tell them, no, it's wrong. Men, like, blacks and whites should not be segregated. That's why we have anti-segregation laws that have been passed. Thirdly, the whole idea that identity is absolute is completely incorrect, right? We also think that justice is a belief, but Sharia law is not allowed in courts because it's uniquely harmful, and it has institutions that are uniquely persuasive and harmful, and as such, identity is not relevant in that case. They need to show us why identity in every case is absolute, if identity in religion is such an important thing. They tell us how men will be underwritten by religion and these institutions will just pay tax. No analysis as to any of the systematic reasons why we told you we get women appointed is true. No, thank you. They tell us that people will pay to discriminate how this is immoral. Firstly, the payment in itself, when people have to give tax, this lessens discrimination. So essentially, their principle of how you're paying to get out of discrimination isn't true because the tax money is lessening discrimination by promoting policies towards women. Secondly, there's a difference between paying to do a good thing versus refusing an incentive to do a bad thing. Governments sell licenses to do things like dump chemical waste or sell permission to dump CO2 in the atmosphere. But in my doing this, something that's bad for society, for the company, the religion is harming people as a whole, right? We can't pay everyone directly, so people give government compensation to the reclendent of these people. No thank you. Now to their second point, lastly, about how the empowerment is of. Empowerment doesn't mean you should appoint these women. We think when you appoint these women, you result in a lot of the same benefits that they have already. You result in good religion. You result in people who are devoted to their faith. But you also get promoted ideologies far more in your world. No, thank you. They tell you that, like, the role of women is different and accurate and equally potent. Ladies and gentlemen, do you think it is okay and that women are equal when a half of your population doesn't, like, half of your population doesn't go to school, when they're not allowed to have the basic right to be educated, right? Because that's what happens in these societies, when you perpetuate the idea that women should be housewives, women should clean the kitchen, women don't have the responsibility or the ability to defend, like, to defend other people. They tell us the last thing to thank you, that organic change is extremely important, and how, like, this is something that has happened already. We already gave you reasons as to why this is the case. Not only that, we tell you that these churches need incentive to change their ideologies. If there's a difference between someone wanting to do something and someone actually having the incentive, a man actually having the incentive to take away some of their privilege in order to promote"

On Team Wales, we are going to empower women across the globe on both the principles and practical levels. On a principle, we don't think that arbitrary factors about a person's body should ever be able to be used as a justification for discrimination.

At the very least, on our side, we get a woman no longer having to suffer her personal agonies and silence because she knows a woman will represent her in a court as well, in a religious court as well. Secondly, this will foster the notion that women can be independent, autonomous, and educated. With female leaders appointed, there will be an expectation that women should be educated and prepared for roles as leaders. Parents will realize that it's commendable to give girls a choice and give them the opportunity to be educated, and will ask for more education on the side. Ultimately, we want women across the world to lift their eyes to the horizon, to achieve as much as their hard work will allow, which is why we're so proud to stand under the team line that we will not grant privilege nor favor to those who willfully slander women.

But missionaries often do a lot of non-profit work themselves in communities and other countries in the world. How are they going to tax exempt one half of the activity that missionaries do, but not the other half of the activity that missionaries do, but not the other half of the activity that missionaries do?

But on Team Wales' side of the house, people are not going to see this as a religious interpretation, but as a state interpretation of doctrine, which is why people don't accept it. This is especially important when Team Wales concedes that Scripture doesn't explicitly rule out women for leadership, meaning people have to be able to buy into it, something they're not assuring on their side. Then in response to the third POI, they say, well, if excommunication was inconsistent to their principle, then they wouldn't support it.

              "text": "The premise of this argument is that removing tax exemption comes at the expense of the non-profit work religious institutions do, which is harmful to women and destructive to communities. Both teams agree that there are in some cases going to be religious institutions that will outright reject the attempt at enforcement, but on Team Canada we can tell you that number is a lot greater than Team Wales is willing to admit. What is the problem with this? Well, let's look at some of the activities, the non-for-profit activities, that religious institutions do that Team Wales is going to be skimming the top. First of all, general activities, such as providing homeless shelters, such as providing drug rehabilitation, especially in those poorest communities that they're leveraging where the state has failed to provide those services themselves. Second, faith-specific activity, such as spiritual counseling, such as faith-based education, the interpretation of scripture, things that the state necessarily can't provide because the state doesn't have the religious power and authority that churches do. But third, a lot of these services that religious institutions provide are actually benefiting or benefit women the most because of things like childcare and daycare, because of fundraising for single mothers who have to raise families by themselves, ladies and gentlemen. These are things that Twin Whales is going against. What's the problem with this? All of these things are funded out of donations. Some of these donations go to missionaries. Some of these donations go to the churches that they're going to shut down. Why is this bad? First of all, less services means people are left in the dust. Since not-for-profit activity, by definition definition spends all of their money on helping people, by cutting some of that off, necessarily some people are not going to be able to get services. But we think it's wrong for Teen Whales to be able to decide that the state can force a woman to quit her job to take care of her children because there isn't enough childcare in her community, if it means that there will be a female priest at the altar. We don't see how teen whales can justify this feat of social engineering if it is fought on the battlefield of forcing a homeless person to have to go through the bureaucratic system of welfare that they might have been excluded from before rather than getting help from the church that they've depended on for so long. But second, women are often the very people that lead all of this not-for-profit activity. So for example, women in Iran buy textbooks and give them to women who are forced to stay at home, which is a big part of the reason that there are now more female than male scientists in Iran. Unfortunately for Teen Whales, a lot of missionaries are the ones that go and deliver these textbooks to people, something that they wouldn't tax exempt. But third, often this affects the poorest communities the worst because it is those communities that depend on these essential services more than any other. Often the church is the lifeline of an entire community. And if Team Wales is willing to close down that house of worship to enforce a political agenda on that religion, we say that is awful, we say that is abhorrent. Ladies and gentlemen, Team Wales aims to use the houses of the holy as a grounds for an experiment in social engineering.

So, twice I've talked about the principal and as to how TeamGames has already won the principal convincingly. I'm checking out to prove to you why social reaction there and speaking won't be as massive and women have better outcomes in our world. Before that, I'd like to talk about the gender criticism of their entire case. If they're going to predicate an entire argument on charity, they must listen to the model to start with. Because in the model, we clearly told you, we will have tax-deductible options for churches who want to do charity. We already do it for corporations, right? When corporations want to supply to charity, they don't, they can subtract that amount of money from tax they pay. Which means that churches will still be able to give food to the poor and still be able to make sure that people don't go to the vets starving. And we think the churches will take this option, right? Because it's the same to let people starve. You can take the tax deductible option and give money and food to people who are starving. So like the entire second argument's logical link is missing because these strategies can still work, everything could work better. But what happens in our world is that the money that the church accumulates on property, on the paintings they hold in Christian chapels, won't be used to promote sexist policies anymore. That's the real benefit they couldn't take down."

              "text": "Let's start talking about the principle. Here, the first speaker's first point was, she had two things to say here. First is that this is an extension of a basic right, and secondly, churches can buy their ways out of it. Rich churches can buy their ways out of it. About the extension of basic rights, note that we responded to it by saying that no right is absolute. Yeah, right to free speech exists, but we still ban hate speech if it means that speech will be used in a negative way. Secondly, that right has to be balanced relative to women's right to be free from discrimination. And they never could tell us why women should be continually discriminated in their side of the world. But secondly, they tried to nuance it, right? They tried to say that, oh, it's theologically women are different but still equal. That's because there's a massive social indoctrination by the patriarchy to make women believe in this. When Islam started, Hazrat Muhammad's youngest wife Aisha was a scholar, was a judge, was a warrior and was a governor. But as things moved religion is selectively sexist, but men in positions of power inside religions are sexist. And in their world, that never changes, and I'll tell you why it changes in our world as well. But finally, we told you how the point about buying their privilege out does not also work, right? Because firstly, if the result of that buying their privilege out is is massive improvement for women in leadership and also the tax money that we are getting will invest in women's education and all of the policies that are true women I think that's what outcomes but secondly we might predict second speaking gave you and and and and and now she told you that we already have our governments to set set permits for dumping waste like many governments and for permits or dumping waste. Like many governments sell permits for dumping nuclear waste. Because even though there's a minute source of harm in that case, even though rich companies can get away with their privilege, it's still beneficial because that money can be used for more policies that is beneficial for all. So in their world, that thing here is awful. But finally, when I asked him a POI, what's the moral difference between racism and sexism, he had no answer to it, which is to tell you that sexism is as pernicious as racism. If a man cannot categorically say that a black, if a white man cannot categorically say that a black person is worth less than me, religions should not have the right to say that women are less worth than men. I think that's categorically a problematic thing, and this is akin to racism, something we cannot tolerate at all. Given all of these things are true, our principle stands. Our principle was simple, and their second speaker's response was extremely feeble and weak. Our principle was, churches owe a massive debt to the government already. Note that they couldn't take down all those analysis which passed away. We told you that one, that there's a principle of reciprocity. The church literally survives because the state protects its right to survive. And secondly, we told you how when church doesn't pay up, then poor people and women has to pay up. And it's immoral to shift that burden of payment to people who are already vulnerable. They have no response to it. Given that thing is true, then we told you when, like with the predatory analysis, that the church owes the debts to governments and the government can make a deal out of this debt. The government always makes deals out of people. When they settle with corporations, when a corporation owes something to a government or violates its laws, the government makes a deal in a government or violates its law, the government makes a deal in a private settlement in the court. So the government has the right to do whatever it wants with the debts that it owes to the government. And they have conceded. The churches owe a debt to the government, both financially, both from the principle of reciprocity. That's why the government can do whatever it wants with that debt, and we have won that principle as well. I'll move on to the efficacy before I take one more question. Would you force the Catholic Church to appoint male nuns or male father superiors? Alright, like this tactic of trying to get forced answers out of a small three-word. You're telling me how that's principally different? Like, please enlighten me in your last speech of the day how that's principally different from our side. Take your principles off at least."

              "text": "Alright, in terms of efficacy, ladies and gentlemen, this revolution is very crucial. Because they try to make you believe that religions are conservative, are oppressive, and they are modern, and they are good. There is a tension in the characterization. But what's important is to get the distinction between why Paul allowed homosexuality and why he won't allow sex, women leadership. Because men won't voluntarily hand their privilege away. The reason why Pope was okay with homosexuality is because it affects gay men primarily. So a man in a position of power inside the church's hierarchy won't hand his promotion to a woman. He will hold the promotion, right? Which is why in affirmative action policies, men won't handle their leadership position away. The government has to force organisations to force men to hand their leadership positions away. They have to tell me why men in positions of power will have any incentive to hand their privilege away and we think they won't do it. Given that's true, the knowledge of affirmative action is clearly consistent. When that doesn't happen internally, we must have an external push and they have conceded, our external push is going to work, which is why the second speaker's analysis is that charities won't exist because he believes that our push is going to work. Now the burden of the third speaker thus becomes to tell me why men in portions of power in churches and mosques will voluntarily give their leadership position away to women. And I think that's a rather hard point to pull and they won't be able to do it. But secondly, we clearly told you how organic change does not happen. Now, this is quite unfair on them as well. Because they try to tell us that their attack on our model is that, oh, what's the timeline? Oh, how many leaders will you have? They tell us that their attack on our model is that, oh what's the timeline? Oh, how many leaders will you have? Now, I want to ask them what's their timeline? Because I'm going to 2000 years after the birth of Jesus, to have a woman in the leadership position. And Petra, you haven't given me a female leader, ladies and gentlemen. What's your timeline, Team Kanda? Will you give me a female leader after 3000 years? I want to know your time and how it happens. But secondly, the efficacy point really clearly does not work as well. Because we don't know how churches will be able to provide charity and furthermore churches have every incentive to change. The final question remains will leaders comply and they cannot beat that thing down. Because we told you leaders have every incentive to comply. Why? Because it's a two way street. Leaders lobby against a motion policy in the White House. Leaders lobby against any policy they don't like, which means they depend on the government to a very large extent. Given that's true, leaders have every incentive to comply with this change. And given that's true, it's easy for leaders to manipulate this theology. A leader can say, just like gay men are allowed now, women are allowed as well, I think it's totally consistent with our theology. And if leaders do it, our policy is successful. At best, we have shown you that sexation is going to work. At worst, we are getting massive amounts of tax money, billions of dollars, which we are going to reinvest in women's rights and women's education. Extremely proud to stand against sexism, extremely proud to stand in the proposition."

              "text": "That's what they need to prove to you in this debate. I'm going to have two areas of clash about the principle and about the effectiveness of the power movement. Before that, a couple of things. I want to clarify two points from some opposition that were completely mischaracterized and strawmaned by Prong. The first, why our argument about churches being able to provide fewer services is still a huge harm that they have to contend with. They can't just say that they're going to reinsert taxisem status when churches have non-profitable NGO work. The reason for that is a lot of their essential services they provide are directly linked to their religious activities. So missionaries are the ones that go into communities, like the missionary women who a lot of their essential services they provide are directly linked to their religious activities. So missionaries are the ones that go into communities, like the missionary women who go into communities and provide them with training about how to use contraception. They host food banks and all those sorts of things on their own property, but they're getting rid of that with their property tax. So our points about the impacts of getting rid of essential services on communities still stand. Secondly, I want to clarify, they're pushing onto us that we have to establish a distinction between racism and sexism. Let me clarify this. One, this point that they're making is hung on them proving that what we're doing is actually sexist. I'm going to debunk all of that in my speech, so you can wait for that. But second of all, the clear difference here is that racism says that one race is good, the other race is bad. What we're saying is we're protecting the ability of religions to say women are important, but they're important in different ways, and it's up for women within those communities to determine what their role is within that religion and what it means to them to be an empowered woman. We are saying that it's important for women to be empowered, but it's not the role of the state to impose on those religions what it means to be an empowered woman. Before I get into my two areas of clash, I want to point out a strategic point about this time proposition's case. They have a tension in their characterization about how religions feel about women in the church. The first narrative that we get is that these religions are so oppressive towards women, the government needs to intervene to protect them from discrimination. Women can't even go to school or access basic social services. The second narrative that we get is these churches are already being forced to liberalize because their congregants are moderate, because they want to attract and appeal more congregants, and they point to movements around the world. What is the strategic impact of this tension? If the first narrative is true, that these men and that these religions are so conservative, they undercut all of their benefits. Because one, if it is so antithetical to these religions to not appoint women, they just won't follow this motion. But two, if they do appoint them, those women will be labeled as heretics, they'll be mistreated, and none of their benefits about respect occurring will ever accrue. But if the second narrative is true, that these religions are already liberalizing, they haven't proven to the necessity of this motion. And in fact, they've dropped. Not only this motion isn't necessary, but it actually hampers liberalization, because religions need to feel secure in their ability to control their narrative and how it will make people feel like if they support women's rights, they're supporting the state's attack on their doctrine, the state's attack on their freedom. More importantly, the fact that they haven't resolved this tension is harmful for them for the simple reason that they bang their case on proving that they protect a group of women, that they protect this vulnerable actor, but the point which their characterization about how actors will act is unclear. You can't believe that any of their benefits will accrue. Versus on our side of the house, we tell you that the impacts are certain. The impacts of people losing the ability to access their faith. The impacts of poor communities losing out on essential services. I have no idea what the world of proposition looks like by the end of this debate. That being said, two areas clash. Firstly, on the principle. The major claim that we get at the top of PROC is that religions are only able to exist because of services from the state, giving them a privilege is unfair. Ten, you should not weigh this point about tax exemptions being unjust as the most important theme in this debate. The reason being, they are very willing to reinstate that tax exempt status, both if they appoint women to certain positions and if they can provide social services and goods. That is to say that their principal argumentation isn't really about tax-exempt status being unfair, it's about socially engineering religions to achieve a certain outcome. Their more important claim that all of their material is predicated on is the assertion that it is objectively wrong to not have women in positions of power, because men have opportunities that women don't. I have two responses. My first is that this argument assumes that the moral code that society has is the same as the moral code within a religion. People opt into a religion because it provides them with values upon which they center their decisions, upon which they can construct their faiths and their identities. It is an intensely personal and private decision when you opt into a religion because it tells you the type of person you want to become. There are many things you may think are objectively wrong or not fair. So for example, when an individual refuses a life-saving blood transfusion for religious reasons, or when parents teach their children creationism, those may seem unfair and unjust to us, but they're just people opting into their own moral code and their own sets of values. But the second and more important response here is the assumption on team proposition is that equality means the same thing, even if it's important, outside and inside of a religion. We've never heard a response to the point that if you are a woman in your religious community, and people respect you so much because you're their nun, because you're their mother, because you're a special teacher, they see you as their connection to God and they value your respect so much. So we've never heard why it isn't equal if women are respected in other positions. Why is it equal if they have the same opportunity to flourish in other respects? The next area that I want to look at is the idea of empowering women. The major claim that we get from their side of the house is that this motion will lessen discrimination towards women because religious institutions are now incentivized to appoint women. In a case where they aren't, governments spend money to help women. And within religions, women are seen as role models. Before I resume that, sure. Ma'am, your second speaker concedes that female leadership is consistent in theology. Why do opportunistic men leaders handle the privilege of women? So, well, part of your case is saying that they're liberalizing already and that they have an opportunity to change. Our case is that we think that there is a movement within these religions to liberalize and to give women positions of power. If there isn't, we would say that it is up to the women within those communities themselves to determine what equality means to them. And if they're happy with being in a position where everyone else respects them because they're their nun, they're their teacher, that's okay because it's about what's important to those women, not the state passing down Western imperialist notions of what it means to be equal, of what it means to not be discriminated against. Let me respond to their mechanism of how they actually protect women. The first assumption is that their mechanism will actually work in the wealthiest and most conservative churches. We say that they're going to swallow up the tax. And even if the government now has more money to spend on women, not sure what that means. Like, if their problem that they characterize is that the problem is that within religions, people don't respect women, they don't solve the problem even if the government on outside spheres is spending more money on women. They draw to our point about the disproportionate burden on poor churches, on the churches that have to make a choice between their faith and staying alive. But critically, the assumption on their side of the house is that within a religion, your respect comes from your title and your status. It doesn't. It comes from the fact that people, your congregants, believe that you are appointed by God, that you are their connection to faith, to spiritual, to the divine. What they do is they say to these people, the state is now determining who the person that represents you and your faith is, and people won't buy into that. At best, it looks like the woman is tokenized. She's able to give a 10-minute sermon, but people don't really care. At worst, it looks like that woman being called a heretic and saying that she's a traitor to her religion. At the end of this debate, they haven't proven that they're able to protect the most vulnerable actor that they've baked their entire case on protecting. Moreover, we told you as it actually gets worse for the women, who in the status quo are already pushing for their legalization, pushing for them to have respect within these religions. Don't make this a war on God. Don't make this a war against the state. Make it the ability of women to fight for their freedom in the war that they want to fight themselves. Thank you."

Their response to this is that men won't cede their power, and they talked a lot about it with Francis, saying that homosexuality is okay. I don't hear any reason why it was that straight people were willing to cede their power in some sort of way that men aren't willing to cede their power. I think queer people struggled for this right, for this emancipation, very, very hard. And I don't think they've been very fair on T-Mills by painting the Pope as this magnanimous guy who woke up one morning on board for the gay agenda. I think gay people within their religious framework said, we need a change, and then fought for it without the intervention of the state. Okay, we need a change, and then fought for it without the intervention of the state. Okay, women and religion are already doing this. We empirically disproved this idea that men won't cede their power by showing instances where men didn't have to cede their power for women to get the power. They formed new congregations, they formed new sects where they did it for themselves. Rather than asking the government to give them power, rather than asking men to cede their power, women got up and took it. This prevents their ability to do so."

Now let's talk to you about what we stood for on Team Wales and why our case wins this debate and why we rebutted all of their arguments while they remained unresponsive to ours. We tell you that equality is a priority. We give you systematic reasons why women are underprivileged in society, why they don't get an education because men think they need to protect them and that they're places in the household. We tell you that this tax is a deal, that we believe in taxes, that tax exemption is illegitimate, but we believe that equality is more important and that that's why this motion is coming to pass. We tell you that we don't think that men are going to want to hand their power away, that that's why this hasn't happened already, and this is crucial in this debate, right? Because they told us that we need to show you why gradual change won't already happen, and this is the reason that we've pushed all the way down the bench, not only in conjunction with my first speaker's entire analysis, right? Because we don't think that men have an incentive to do this unless they're pressured to by the government because the government thinks it's such an important thing. This is why we win, right? Then lastly, we have to show you why this is the only way. Our policy is mutually exclusive to everything else. No, ladies and gentlemen, we don't. We have to show you why this policy is going to be a great way to empower women, a great way to promote equality and spread social values we believe are extremely important in society, and any other policy that is willing to support this, we support as well. We can give clear reasons for this."

They tell us about gradual change, that no, you're not going to get any charity if we don't do this, that this is a massive, massive harm. And that the church isn't going to oppose this because it comes from the state. Interestingly enough, this whole argument came out in their third speech, but then they also in their third speech told us about this idea of backlash, and that, oh, finally, this is when we realized that this is the harm that they've been talking about all along. Because they tell you that there's massive harm, but then it isn't until their first speech where we realize that, oh, it's because the church is full of reciprocity. Now what do we tell you on Team Wings? We tell you that these leaders will comply. We give you methods of why this is the case, unresponded to. We give you reasons why society will accept it and why this change is going to be a subtle incentive for churches to make this shift, not necessarily a way for them to oppose the government, a way for them to slowly accept this change in and of themselves from the church's point of view."

We talk to you about justice and arbitration and how women don't have this right now and how this doesn't mitigate any of their points about how women have different roles in society because they still do their justice, right? Lastly, because they misunderstand our tax-deductible, the entire tax-deductible point about how everyone is scared of us until the charity ends, when in reality we still support that charity on our side. And because we bring it to the team line that we will not give privilege nor favor to those who willfully slander women, we are so proud to propose."

First argument, motherhood removes women's control over their own selves. Three ways in which women's choices are hurt. Information, the choice to enter motherhood, and the ability to leave. First, on information. Glorification of motherhood is responsible for the lack of information about it. When it crowds out other information, right? When you don't know what kinds of pain pregnancy induces. when you don't know post-mortem depression even exists, where women feel incredibly depressed after they've given delivery, when many women don't even know when they're on the delivery bed that women often defecate during the process of delivery. But also, you don't know about the long term. You don't know that it's going to suck out all your time, your money and place an incredible familial burden on you. But why is motherhood the glorification of this non-responsible for it? Because you grow up with the idea that this is something you have to do. You never seek out information. You're told you don't need this information when this is just something that's automatically assigned to you based on the sex that you were"

They just want to tell you how beautiful it is to be a mother. How incredible it feels when your child goes to her first day in school. How incredible it feels when your child does this, when your child does that, but never what it looks like for you. But second, the choice to enter is imaginary. It starts at birth when you're born as a girl child. The kinds of dolls you get are dolls of children asking you to take care of them. When you're asked constantly when you're getting married, when you go to little girls as uncles in Indian weddings and ask them, oh, when do you want to get married? Or who do you want to marry? What kind of a child do you want to grow up? When it invests itself in tangible things, when literally parents across spaces like Shrilankar Vandesh give their girl children a humanities education as opposed to a STEM education because that just perfectly sets them up for that marriage. When there's a familial and societal pressure, right? Because you save up for marriage if it's a girl child and you save up for college if it's a boy child. It's not just that that the narrative often is overwhelming, often becomes an external pressure, but that it physically limits your choice. It physically limits your choice when you quit your career at a crucial age because you can't go back to developing it. It physically limits your choice when your parents give you a specific kind of education because that's"

Something that's investing itself in every woman's life. And we think that's just disgusting. What about it? It's self-perpetuating. Mothers raise their own girls like this. That if this debate is about children, it's about the little girls who are told this from when they grow up. Because boys get the Power Ranger toys and the job options. But girls, right from when they are born, are told by the men in their families that this is what you're going to be. But finally, it removes the choice to leave relationships, to leave families, to leave marriages. Because even saying that you don't enjoy being a mother is something that's shocking. Oh, what? Did you just say that? You're not even allowed to talk about it, right? When you're told, when you say it, when you can't complain about the housework you're doing, you can't express your opinions, but you also can't leave a relationship. You have to stay for the children. You have to stay to care for them. You have to stay because it's your role to protect your child. It undermines the choice to get a divorce. When you're constantly told, what will happen to your child? What will happen to that boy that's in your house? Remember, glorification uniquely hurts women and little girls. And in respect to what kinds of other pressures exist on women, this is something that is intrinsically problematic, something that we always forget and reject. Before I move on, yes? The expectation to have children is always going to exist for women. How is it easier for women to deal with this expectation when we are all constantly told that motherhood is not rewarding for them and we are the negative? So let's just rephrase that. They're saying, oh there are other things that contribute to this precious wealth. Then why do we need to remove one of the biggest contributors to it? But the other thing that they're saying in their POI is, oh we'll oppress you. But you should feel good about it. That you shouldn't complain about it. That you shouldn't get to, that movement shouldn't get to organize against it. Because when a feminist woman questions that, they're questioning something that's so important, so culturally relevant, we reject that. Second, glorification of a mother's sacrifices comes at the cost of her dreams. What is the cost of modernity?"

We lose these scientists, these economists, these accountants. But also, you lose financial independence, right? You lose the mobility to leave a motherhood that you've entered at the point which you didn't have a job, at the point which you don't have your own personal savings. You're entirely reliant on the family. But there are many women who choose not to do this, who would rather choose not to do this. Opposition always forces them into this. Insofar as we save just those women, it's intensely regrettable. But even if sexism always places the pressure to have a child, what else does this concept of motherhood extend to? It extends to not being allowed to have your own hobbies, your own social life. But in that life, it's, oh, my friends are my child's friends' mothers. But I can't do the kinds of hobbies that I like, because I need to concentrate on my child's hobbies. Even if it's about women who are always going to end up in these marriages with these same children, they are still women who don't get to have their own lives, their own experiences, and in the least some mobility and some savings to live. But the extension of this is the external pressure, right? The external pressure that results in men getting a lesser burden in families. It's saying, oh, women are mothers so men are fathers. They can do things like taking care of their money. They can do things like taking care of careers. And it's based on disproportionate burdens on women. They have to take care of the dishes. Even if motherhood is enriching, it becomes not enriching at the point where they don't get the support of others because it's just their burden.

This debate, however, is not about the way the psychoposition wants to characterize it and say that females, whether females should be suppressed by society and should be denied the ability to not have a baby and should be denied the ability to get information or education, because obviously we oppose that too. Obviously we believe that females should be able to do whatever they like,"

              "text": "but what this debate actually means is that when you decide to have a baby, when you decide that motherhood is good, then we should rather perceive it as an enriching experience, as rather a rewarding experience to you as a society. So now, what did sarcopoposition say? That this is never rewarding and that glorification harms women and pressurises them to become mothers since it basically makes the duty to have children better. Not to steer a battle. That they never actually explain why perceiving mothers as having an enriching experience means that this duty is going away, or why this duty is made stronger by enriching experience. They never say how, but when we start to perceive motherhood as something negative or neutral, how then this duty is just abolishing. We're going to show you that this duty still exists and that this debate takes into the context whether we should reward these mothers for fulfilling that duty or whether we're not rewarding them. Why does this duty still exist and why this type of position to fail to provide another explanation? Firstly, women will be and are always the persons who are the only ones physically capable of carrying a child, so hence that duty will still exist under their shoulders, not under the male shoulders, they are the only ones physically capable of carrying a child. So hence that duty will still exist under their shoulders, not under the male's shoulders. They are the ones giving birth. And secondly, all societies, even the most liberal ones, are the ones to pressurise females still into having children and into bringing offspring to their nation. Even Germany pays mothers in order to have offspring to their nation. So this pressure still exists for these two reasons, and cyoposition never showed why this will cease to exist. So let's now talk about why rewarding mothers is good for societal level and secondly why it's better for parenting. First point, no thank you. Rewarding means that females' position in society will be better because the role still exists and we rather want to reward them and make them to see somebody that is not just fulfilling their burden that exists on their both sides, but rather somebody who is making that decision themselves, who are strong human beings, who make that decision because they believe that this is rewarding for them and they believe that they can gain some very personal benefits under that. Firstly, because you're not as strong if you're just as good in that duty, but rather we want to perceive females as doing that because they're doing it for themselves. And women are seen as not just doing their duty and being submissive, but rather wanting that baby and therefore deciding themselves to take that burden and to carry that baby. So, for example, New Zealand's Prime Minister just decided to have a baby in the office and we see it as a positive thing because she wanted to do it, because she feels that this would help her become a better person, help her become a happier person, a better Prime Minister for New Zealand, and we celebrate it. And therefore, the society feels that women are not just simply giving in to the pressure that society gives, but rather taking it because they want to. And this is something that we celebrate. Because, for example, in conscription service, this is a duty that, for example, in some states are for people. We celebrate that the person in health aversion becomes a better human being. And therefore we see that positive attributes are after doing that duty given to that person. And the same happens with women who happen to give birth, because they're seen as now better and more developed human beings. What are the impacts of this argument? Firstly, it means that females, when they break out of this duty to just live in, to be submissive, and rather be independent, strong women who make that decision themselves, are much more likely to be perceived as equal with men, because now they're not dependent on men and doing what men require, but rather doing what they themselves want. And so it makes the society perceive them as stronger, more capable, and hence policies that make their lives easier, such as, like, pay gap policies, or, for example, anti-discrimination policies, like the females are not accepted into the same jobs as men, or now, like, not as effective, because females are perceived as better, stronger, more equal with men, not having to do that duty, and rather, when they take that duty, it's something for the personal development, taking you in a second, so we expect it for the society if we see and perceive females as stronger themselves who want to do it, rather than just giving in to the pressure. Oh, is your point that somehow motherhood is appreciated more when it's seen as mothers doing it for their own self-interest? Yes. We believe that we want women to feel like they're doing something for their own self-interest rather than just giving in to some patriarchal policies. This is the fundamental prerequisite of female being empowered, being strengthened, and being perceived as equal to men. We celebrate it. Secondly, how it's better for parenting. Because when parents feel and when mothers feel they're doing it for their own good and for reward rather than duty, this is better and much more easier for them to, for example, be in labour or to be pregnant. Why? Because if I believe this is good for my own being, if I'm pregnant, if"

So it helps parents and women to be more able to cope with these extreme hardships, that 18 years of bringing up the baby and caring for that baby and sacrificing yourself for that baby, is because you feel that this is a rewarding experience and the society feels that you're becoming a better person and that you're doing it for your own good and you yourself believe that it's for your own good. So what it means is that females and mothers are much more happy and mothers are much more happy to do it and therefore doing the job better and hence their children, when they're not perceived as a duty, but rather as a reward, are much more likely to feel so happy because their mothers want to engage with them, want to be nicer towards them and therefore doing their duty better. For all these reasons, because of the societal position, secondly, better parenting, I beg you to pause."

              "text": "Three big ideas that came out of that last speech. Firstly, that this duty will still be placed on women. Secondly, that this causes an appreciation of mothers for doing what they do. And thirdly, this idea that this narrative needs to be better bettered. Let's deal with these one by one. Firstly, on this idea that this duty still exists, we agree. What we are saying is that this narrative is much worse in terms of perpetuating this duty. That is to say, we agree that on both sides there will be some exemption of gender roles. We think those gender roles will be worse on your side. Three reasons. Firstly, the fact that you can't resist at the point where there is no way for you to mobilize against this kind of oppression. Because the justification behind this is, oh, this is good for the women, that's why you can be mothers. Secondly, the fact that these women aren't given the full information of what the harms could be, meaning they don't have an incentive to resist due to the lies and misinformation created by this cultural norm. Thirdly, the fact that this pressure often is imposed by people like men, who actually believe that it is a rewarding experience and therefore impose this pressure on women. They think women can't make the best decisions for themselves. They think this is a genuinely good decision to make. Then on the second item, this causes the appreciation of mothers for doing what they do, and this causes the perception of them as being women. The first thing to note is that insofar as they want to say that this allows them to cope with things like tremendous external pressures, we are happy to respect women in ranges of different professions and occupations for doing what they do. We're happy to extend that kind of respect. That's clearly not what this debate is about. But secondly, we don't really think they are perceived as equal in society when what they are expected to do by society is to be a mother, is to not go to work. They are not going to get equal pay at the point where an employer expects them to quit their job early because they have to stay at home and be a parent. But thirdly, this idea that this creates better policies. We think policies like parenting and cream are much worse off as far as companies perceive this. As you know, this is a rewarding experience. We don't need to give you more of a reward. This is just an invitation. We don't think those kinds of policies are meaningfully passed on your side. Contrast is then against our argument. The fact that this narrative removes women's control over themselves. They say, oh, women make this choice. This choice is really empowering. We are happy with women making the choice to become mothers. What we said is that in a number of instances, their narrative causes women to be structurally unable to make that choice because of misinformation about these harms, because of the fact that you grew up with the idea that you are meant to be a mother, because when you go to a wedding, you are told, when is your wedding going to be? When are you going to become a parent? No, thank you. These kinds of coercive pressures are perpetuated on their side of the house. Lastly, on this idea that this narrative leads to better parenting because it brings happiness to people. Two issues. Firstly, if women don't choose to become a parent, presumably they might actually be worse parents because eventually they will realize that this is a tremendous strain on them, meaning it's bad for the children. Second, we want children to have good role models. We want girl children to realize that their mothers are in the working profession and that is good for them, meaning it's actually good, no fancy, for the children. But what they didn't engage with is that it's destructive to the lives of women at the point where they are deprived of financial independence as a result of their policy. They are deprived of having access to things like friendship, hobbies, having a social life, and that this expectation is a source of unique discrimination against these individuals. Go ahead. Men oppress women because they perceive them as weaker and because they feel that they have the power, rather than because they believe that this is good and rewarding for women. The point is that men perceive the notion of motherhood as being a weak profession. We would rather a woman be able to make the choice to not be a mother and go to work, become a business executive. We don't think that would be perceived as weak either. That's the comparative in the long term that we stand for."

First, this narrative excludes women who don't have children. How is this true? Firstly, it undermines reproductive autonomy. It stigmatizes women who do things like have abortions, use contraceptionists. Why would you do that? Being a parent is really rewarding. Having a child is really rewarding. That means you're both a child killer and someone who gave up on a rewarding experience for yourself, which means they never understand the actual reasoning for why women do things like have abortions, do things like seek some kind of reproductive autonomy over themselves. And that kind of narrative constantly re-entrenches itself because now women aren't given autonomy. It perpetuates the notion that women are making bad choices for themselves. It is men who should now be determining women's choices because clearly they're making a terrible choice by having an abortion. This means women are systemically denied access to their choices about reproductive health. But second, it stigmatizes women who are physically unable to have children, people like infertile women, who are told they've been denied the experience which defines their womanhood, who are condemned as barren. Within the impact is that women are systemically denied the ability to make choices about themselves and constantly face stigmatisation. On the comparative in our world, women are allowed to relieve rewarding lives which are not just based on the idea of them having children. It means they're able to make reproductive choices about their ability to have an abortion, to not have children in the long term."

              "text": "This narrative perpetuates the idea that having biological relations with your child is absolutely crucial. In their world, biological motherhood is the unique kind of motherhood which is glorified. Two reasons why this is true. Firstly, because this glorification looks at the full process of motherhood. It's not just you raising a child, it's you having that child biologically. It's the process of pregnancy which is significantly glorified. You have to take on the entire burden of having a child. But secondly, the narrative that exists right now is that the reason this is a rewarding experience is you're extending that experience to someone who you consider is your truly own family. Your blood, no thank you. Someone who's a part of your family and a part of you who you're now having a shared experience with. Why is this incredibly problematic? Two sets of reasons. Firstly, women who adopt children are stigmatised. This means that adoption in general is disincentivised. But this also looks like LGBT women being systemically discriminated against because they can't have biological children. Because biological procreation is the only means through which it is legitimate to have children. But second, it suggests that the only purpose of sexual relations and sex is procreation. The idea that the point of you being able to pursue a sexual life is to fulfil that thing which makes your life the most rewarding ever, fulfil the ability of you as a woman to have a child. This means it's stigmatising, denies women access to sexual pleasure of their own and sexual autonomy, perpetuates the idea that only men can enjoy sex. In the most extreme cases, it looks like actively denying the ability of women to make these choices through things like female gender mutilations. But it also means that LGBT individuals are discriminated against because they are not allowed to pursue their sexual pleasure because it can never truly result in you having a child. It means their relationships are not meaningless. We agree that the narrative of the gender roles of women exists on both sides. But this narrative of this being a rewarding experience for women makes it much worse for all of these women. Because the belief that women have to get meaning from their motherhood gives birth to an egregious burden. Very proud of you. that women have to get meaning from their motherhood gives birth to an egregious burden of many problems. 8 minutes 16 seconds.

We can see the fact that gender roles are a bad thing and women would probably be better off if they had more choices. They still have to prove why the societal pressure wouldn't exist. Their point still remains while Truman asks, when are you going to have a child and when are you going to get married? Because the whole society still sees you having a child as a necessity and something that you need to do. The point is about whether we see a child being given born to as a reward for the society. They need to prove why we telling the mother that you are going to be born from having a child is a good or bad. We tell you that the perception of telling a woman that in the instance where you do have a child you are going to benefit more than you are going to get harm is good for those women.

Moving on to the Roan case and the things that we heard from Team India. First to tell you that people have very little know-how and that this harms them. We all have told you, we would rather have you deal with these things that you might go through. In this instance, we are told that this has always been to be one. They tell you that women can't pursue their dreams, which I think that is always going to exist under their side, because the first thing is that mothers would still have been told to have a child and get married. But furthermore, notice that women might dream of having a child and that's a legitimate dream for those women as well that might give self-exhortation to some women and they are actively saying that these women shouldn't get self-exhortation from that place because they are doing less legitimacy to those women's dreams and that's something that they maybe shouldn't be doing within that in the instance of today's society motherhood is becoming more volatile and you can be a mother while achieving those dreams as well, but we don't have to actively undermine the glorification or the value of being a mother in the conventional sense. We think that this is a benefit that they are taking away from the women in our societies at the moment. But I want to tell you an extension about how women who are currently using counter-productives are going to be worse off. In things as well, if they continue to the path of this due to the fact that children already exist, then those women are always going to be worse off. In the instance where they continue to the fact that this duty to have children already exists, then those women are always going to be harmed under their side as well. They're still trying to have children and all of the harms that they tell you about in your extension will remain in the instance where they continue to the fact that this duty still exists for these women and they're actually improving any of the cases that they outline in their extension. Then they tell you that you are raised to believe and this is the only thing that's going to be rewarding for you. I think that this is good because in the only thing that's been rewarding for you. They tell you that this is good because in the end it might still be good for you. They tell you that it takes away financial independence and friends from these women but we don't see why that's true. They are giving a very crude, very crudely characterisation of motherhood. You can still go to work as a mother and you can still have friends that you had before. This characterisation is simply not true and see, maybe it isn't telling you why it should be true because mothers are still human beings and can still interact with other people outside of their family. They don't think that they are simply closed off to their child that they have had. We don't think that this is a characterisation that they can get away with in this way. Before we move on to an extension, Doug. Do you support the narrative in developing nations that say that women should find it rewarding to be homemakers and cook and clean for their husbands? I'm going to tell you why that's beneficial in this argument now. I think it's beneficial for these women to have that role, but have no role at all. Moving on to my extension. So, I tell you that this debates about whether motherhood is seen as good or bad, whether it is seen as rewarding for these women or not. We need to consider the historical aspect and the developing nations in these lines of argumentation as well. We have already talked about how this duty is always going to remain for this woman. People want to carry on their civilization or their nation, and early women can fulfil that role, and that is why the duty is always going to remain for them, argumentation that teenager simply doesn't engage with. This role would exist on either side of the house. We now need to look at the fact, how are we portraying these roles, and how are we telling those women to deal with those roles, whether they are rewarding for them or not? I think that it's beneficial to say that women are rewarding from the roads that they currently have. Notice that this reward isn't only seen as individual. In the instance where we're doing something rewarding, then it's going to be seen as a reward by those other people as well. In the instance where we are creating the agenda road for those women, then because of the fact that you are doing good in providing that gender role, you even get some kind of position in that society. In the instance where you are successful as a mother, then you are seen as a good person because of the fact that you are a mother. These women gain some kind of position in these societies because of the fact that they are creating some kind of benefits for those people in those societies. In the instance where those women don't even have a role as a co-maker, and they have much less legitimacy, much less position, much less leverage, to ask for some kind of changes for themselves. This is exceptionally exacerbated by the fact that these women are not going to be seen as successful. Their role is always going to be seen as a negative thing, that they are never going to get any benefits out of, or that they are never going to be able to create any benefit by. In the instance where this role is rewarding,"

They play a bigger, big role in the society already, thus they can see that they desire more rights because of the role that they have in those societies. They are capable of raising the family, which means that they are capable of doing other things, an understanding or a rhetoric that these women in those countries can use. This also exists in these conservative nations as well. Women in Saudi Arabia can say that, I have a role as a woman in your society, give me driving rights as well, because I'm capable of running your family, I'm capable of running your car as well. I think that throughout history, and in more conservative or developing nations, women are able to use the role that they have inside the family to get more rights in a whole societal scheme. Team. Teaming is true to your way, motherhood is good for these women and thus should be shown as rewarding for all of these reasons. Thank you for your position. 8 minutes 14 seconds I would like to thank the second speaker of the opposition for their speech and I would like to invite the third speaker of the opposition for this speech, I would like to invite the third speaker of the opposition to deliver this speech."

The vast majority of people don't want to be actively hateful to women nowadays, but rather they think they're doing it for the women. They think I'm doing it for my daughter. That entire subset of people they drop. But notice, we engage with their best case. We said the difference is that these are pressures you can fight, when now women are told that what's being pushed on you is something you don't like, rather than having the excuse of this isn't oppression, because you ought to be enjoying this. That is the world that they stood for. Not that we were the only side that told them that when the narrative isn't you are enjoying it, only then society knows it's a problem. Only then society is likely to fight against it. We had this in our previous speakers and they pretended in their third speech that we weren't the ones who were responding to their world. No thank you. But furthermore, other people buy into this pressure. That is, the way funding works. The way funding works, when you fund your daughters to go into humanities versus STEM, and the way you think that you're acting for them, most of these choices that push women into motherhood are made before women can voice complaints. And why that matters is because of the fact that the people, the guardians who are making these choices, actively think that they're doing it for the women. The women have little ability to object, and the women have little ability to go get other information. That's why it's likely that this is the strongest portion of the various oppression, the oppressionist forces that act on women, that forces them into motherhood without any reconciliation."

The narrative is no longer there. Is that I as a man don't need to help you out because well you're enjoying what you're doing, right? I don't need to help you in any way. It becomes motherhood is a burden that you need not necessarily enjoy and that means me as a father now should try to pitch in as much as I can, much more than I can. That's why their side made motherhood worse. When you're forced handling five kids all on your own, without anyone to care for you, we were the only side that removed father's excuse for not staying at home by saying, oh, you're enjoying it, so I'll let you have all the kids to yourself. That was the world that we contested, taking them on their very best case, the women who stayed in these homes as well. What were the arguments that they brought up? They said that this makes women look stronger and better in society. But does it? You admire soldiers because they're sacrificing something and you don't assume that they're having a good time. You admire soldiers because you think they're doing something hard. This is the exact opposite. You're saying women are enjoying themselves. Why should we care for that? Yes, it's hard, but the reward is even more. Yes, there's depression, but it's worth it at the end, in their very own words. How are you admiring mothers anymore? Rather, you're saying that they enjoy themselves. This is something that they're doing for their own selfish self-interest. That's not the narrative that we want to push. And that's why all of their ideas on how women can ask for more rights, false. Two responses directly to their second speaker's argument. Firstly, assume that they had the argument of how this empowers women by making them role models. This is non-economic work. They have very little money to lobby. They have very little ability to put themselves up in society. That's why their version of how women get uplifted is what we've been trying for the past three centuries. And surprise, surprise, it hasn't worked. What has worked is having women in businesses, having women as CEOs, which means that that is the most uplifting form of empowerment that you can give them. We might agree that women in businesses are beneficial. You need to prove why without creating a base rate for these women, they wouldn't even have had access to getting into those businesses to change something. Okay, like this entire idea that the society is so oppressive that no women works anywhere in the world is simply false. Note that we've continuously told you that the main reason why women are pushed into having children is this narrative that they enjoy themselves. They've never realised, they've never tried to deal with that, which is why we think at the end of the day, they haven't proved that women, all women are going to be oppressed anyway."

They burden them even more when they are pushed and refuse to have the ability to question it. Lastly, the third question about those who don't have kids. There was literally no engagement on this from their side. We give you two arguments on how there are people, the most vulnerable people, who cannot have children or who don't want to have children. Those who do abortions are now shamed because they're told you're giving up a pleasure of your life. Why should we allow you to do this? That's what Republicans say when they say we're not going to allow this abortion legislature because women don't know what they should deserve the most. Children help them out. We won't let them take these children away. A huge argument on the most vulnerable people, on LGBT individuals, on people who want to actually avoid having children was completely dropped from their side of the house. And that means they don't care about choice panel because they refuse to deal with the argument that condemned those who actively made the choice not to. That means that their society didn't realize that the vast majority of depression, the forcing women to have children without questioning it or being able to make choices for themselves, comes from the idea that they enjoy it."

              "text": "to talk about two things in my speech. First, I'm going to look at why gender roles will still persist in respect of glorification, and then secondly, I'm going to look at what are the tangible harms when we don't perceive motherhood as rewarding. So first off, why are these gender roles still going to exist? Well, there are two first arguments. Firstly, that motherhood removes some sort of autonomy from women and they have to cause their career. And then secondly, that women are forced into the same roles that are individually not allowed to have a social life. This is basically the same argument. And moreover, we think that both of these things also exist under the proposition team, and theyover, we think that both of these things also exist under their proposition team, and they are both rebutted by us talking about the fact that gender roles are going to exist, because firstly, like historically, women have a duty to bring up children, this is something that has happened in societies, because men did physical work while women were just domestic, and women gave birth to children, which means that this will fundamentally still exist under societies, so thank you. Secondly, all societies want to be sustainable, even in the present. We've talked about this in all of our speeches. For example, there are many countries paying mothers to have children. We still have that duty. These women still have that responsibility. This all means that women are still going to be forced into these roles, and all the harms that they talked about, of having to quit your career, no thank you, of having to take a man very early in your life, are still going to exist. But moreover, what we have talked about is that these gender roles are even going to be entrenched under proposition, and this is because women, this is only going to be perceived as women are only fulfilling the duty that we have given to them in society, no thank you, because of two main impacts. Firstly, we don't to them in society. No, thank you. Because of two main impacts. Firstly, we don't see them being pregnant because they want to, but because we just as a society want for them to bear that child, which means that we don't recognise the autonomy of women to make independent decisions about their life. When it is something that is actually rewarding, no, thank you, then we recognise that this is something that is part of women's autonomy, and we think that this is something that overall attains some sort of societal change. Secondly, we also, when it's not rewarding, then we don't recognise that these women have some sort of personal growth when going through such a hardship of actually bringing up a child, no thank you. The impact of all of this is that it is harder for women to portray themselves as strong, equal individuals in our society, which means that all of the harms that they talked about are going to be so much greater. But lastly, under this point, one more thing. They talked about infertile women and LGBT women, and then asserted that we didn't respond. This is not true. We already said that all of these problems that are associated with these groups are going to exist under their side, as they are also not filling the role that women are given in society, which means that these people are still going to be seen as worse, or are still going to be negatively perceived. This is a symmetrical argument. This group shouldn't exist in this debate. Moving on to my next point about what are the actual tangible harms when we don't perceive motherhood as rewarding. But before that, Sean. In your best case, where gender roles still exist in women-stained families, why is it worse when women cannot question these roles and fight to share both? Yeah, I'm getting onto that. So they talk a lot about the fact that women can't mobilise because men see it as something positive and also something about misinformation. You need to look at the fact of why do men oppress women in societies. This is because they feel that they are supreme to women. Now we need to look at under which team do men feel more supreme to women and under which team do men perceive women as worse off. Under us, women are seen as benefiting from motherhoods, a duty that is going to be given them under any case. This means that under us, women are going to be perceived as a stronger social group, one that more justifiably should have a voice in our society. What is going to happen under them is that women get no sort of benefits. It is not rewarding. They don't improve as individuals, which means that we don't perceive them as strong individuals. This also contributes to a domestic narrative of them only being in that role. They shouldn't exit that role because they didn't get any sort of benefits from being in that role, which is something much different from what happens under our case. But now they also talk about the fact that men don't understand why reproductive rights are important in any way and that they're just going to force them down. But we think that men will never understand why reproductive rights are important anyway and that they're just going to force them down. But we think that men will never understand why reproductive rights are important when women don't have a voice. Women are the agents who are going to tell men when reproductive rights are important. This is how it is happening in our society. Women need empowerment for them to have a voice. We as a society and men overall need to acknowledge that women can be strong individuals, that they can be successful at something. We need to give them this political voice. And we think that their alternative narrative is that giving birth and bringing up a child. It's just some sort of mutual duty. So we don't feel that we'll attribute something positive to them. We also don't understand that if it's seen as just a neutral duty for women, then why would men help? Why would all of their conservative narratives disappear? We think that men will still see it as something that is inherently for women, and they're not going to be contributing in parenting, so we don't believe any of that argumentation. But what else did they say? Overall, they said that women don't know how hard childbirth is. And overall, that rewarding experience"

And we think that if we see this job as actually rewarding, then we acknowledge the hardship that women have to go through. It is a false characterisation to say that we see that women enjoy this. It is the fact that we understand that it is hard, and we understand that they benefit greatly from it, and that we are acknowledging this hardship. Which means that we understand that women are strongly capable. Which leads to, like, overall two things. Firstly, it means that it's going to be easier for women to actually be in society so that, for example, employers see them as deserving of a job or deserving of a promotion and things like that. So it's easier for women to actually participate in society and not be oppressed. But secondly, we think that it's also for women individually, as being people who have this role and duty anyway, that they perceive their own hardship as beneficial anyway. So the comparative is that if they have this duty and they don't perceive their hardship as beneficial, then it's much harder for them to actually do that duty. They don't want to do it. They feel themselves as more repressed, which means that this is going to lead to a more overall internalisation of the fact that they are repressed in that society which will make it harder for women to actually try and get that political voice that they need more of a which will mean that there will be a larger proportion of women who see bringing up children as a duty as something negative which means there will be a larger proportion of children who don't have a very nice upbringing because it is seen as a duty not something loving, which means there will be a larger proportion of children who don't have a very nice upbringing because it is seen as a duty, not something loving, not something caring, something that we talked about in our second argument.

No matter whether this is beneficial or harmful for these women, people would always expect that from these women because we have given you a strong analysis about why people always think that women should bear those children as they are the only ones who can do that and thus ensure the fact that this civilisation or this nation is going to exist in the future. They never actually promote that, actually engage with this argumentation, and simply say that because it is seen as beneficial, people are more inclined to do it, but never tell you why this inclination to actually make women have children wouldn't exist under their scientific house. But they also contradict things about this duty idea that we provide to you, because the second speaker says they can see to the fact that this duty exists. The third speaker, however, completely dismisses this idea and simply talks about the fact that mother would be seen as a rewarding thing. They needed to deal with this argumentation rather than simply dismiss it and not engage with it, something that we didn't get from sight for positional disrespect."

You obviously see mothers having swollen ankles, or having post-modern depression, as you know about the hardships of motherhood, even if you haven't pampered about it, etc. In theory, the mothers have very limited opportunities, which is an untrue characterisation that we constantly refute, and instead, the mothers can have a normal life, and furthermore, the point about time being not able to have children is not exclusive to our side and it's another harm that they are actually dealing with because of the fact that this duty exists.

Firstly it can be seen as important on the side of position because of the fact that you as a mother create social position for yourself, create social leverage to influence some kinds of things. Women would be seen as more inferior under their side because they don't actually create something that is beneficial for the general society, but also are seen as more inferior because they are simply doing something that may not save them to do, but is very harmful for the women. In our under-ourside women are doing something that is beneficial for them and seen as rewarding, the swimming can say that I am doing things for my own benefit and for my own choice, giving more leverage to the ideas that they have. But furthermore, they have earned a strong position because of the fact that they have motherhood, the extension that I have that was completely unanswered by cyberposition. Ladies and gentlemen, motherhood is a good thing and we should reward it and it is great benefit for women. Thus, I vote. Thank you.

But we also engaged with our worst case. When they told us that they perceive women as strong, you know, women are perceived as weak because they're given and condemned to care roles. They said you are weak and can only be a mother. If you want strong women, choice is what creates women who are seen as strong. When women can become successful, that's what creates the idea and breaks the gender roles that you described. Problematically, they never showed why individual women were happy. Not that they showed why women being happy caused this link to changing perceptions in the first case. But even in our worst case, even when women were stuck in these relationships, we gave you four benefits. They have a voice, and they get to share the burden, and they get some mobility to live, and they get some social life rather than living around their children. In the reality, they didn't fight for individual women with careers, employees who didn't give maternity leave, they didn't fight as a feminist organisation this abortion, for infertile women, for LGBT women. We stood on the side of the most vulnerable. In light of what our future of the global world should be, if the question is what do women want, we say let them decide."

But that's not the debate, whether you can garner small moments of happiness from your child. This debate is about whether that happiness weighs up in comparison to every single sacrifice that you make along the way. Because when is something rewarding? Something is only rewarding when the output or the outcomes of that action outweigh the efforts or the sacrifices that you make along the way. What do these sacrifices look like? First, the physical sacrifices. Now take it back. You as an expectant mother go through nine months of the worst hell that you'll ever experience in your entire life. You wake up every morning feeling nauseous, feeling the need to vomit, not only your food but also your blood. You feel like your food habits and what you want to do, where you want to go, what you want to see, all of these are being deeply affected and deeply changed by the concept of that pregnancy. You spend sleepless nights because your body's hormones have gone haywire and you literally cannot function throughout the entire day because you are exhausted, because your body feels like a bag of bones and flesh and not a functioning human body. In labor, you're going through the most painful experience known to man. A human woman's cervix will expand nine times its regular size when you're giving birth."

Imagine all of that pain happening to you, and you simply believing that it doesn't happen. But the pain is also psychological, because this is a unique experience. We as men, or we as husbands and sons, cannot relate to what our mothers go through, our sisters go through when they are going through this pain. We cannot relate, we cannot console them in any effective manner whatsoever. These people psychologically when they are giving birth, when they are bearing children feel weak and feeble. Feel like they are victims to their circumstances and there is nothing that they can do about them. No medicine will comfort them as much as they want to. But finally, the harms are also to your identity. So even after that child has been born, you are forced to give up all of your identities in favor of motherhood. You lose out on your careers because your identity as a businesswoman or your identity as a politician comes inside your family, comes secondary to your identity and your responsibilities as a business woman or your identity as a politician comes inside your family, comes secondary to your identity and your responsibilities as a mother. But then, why are the rewards that you gain not sufficient? Because these harms are objective, but the rewards are, the harms that you incur are always objective, but the rewards are often subjective. The happiness that you gain from your child is not always rewarding. One, your child might not be successful but even if he is successful he might not follow exactly in your footsteps, grow up exactly how you imagined him to be. This child, but in the vast majority of cases, even if this child succeeds you have no ownership about that success because society tells you that these are all personal efforts of that child in and of itself. The conclusion of this is that the narrative that says that it is all worth bringing life into this world is simply false. Why is it bad to preach an incorrect narrative? Because the person that is making that decision is deceived into that narrative. This is the exact same reason why we don't allow things like false advertising or fake news. Because they establish a version of reality that is simply not true. But more importantly, this specific narrative is one that cannot be countered. Especially in developing countries where you are told that it's a requirement for women to have children. It's a responsibility of women to have children. This narrative is inescapable and thus it harms these women the most. Yes? The motion clearly calls for you to oppose motherhood as a whole. Do you not think it is convenient for you to just shrink your case to coercion? So, we don't think it calls for us to oppose motherhood as a whole. It calls for us to oppose the belief that motherhood is rewarding and only a rewarding experience. They cannot misconstrue the motion to their benefit. Second argument about why this narrative is coercive. What is coercion? Coercion is a form of manipulation that implicitly pressurizes you to do something. What are the tenets of coercion? Firstly, an informational asymmetry. Even when that information exists, that this isn't a rewarding experience, that is hidden from you by society, by means of that larger narrative, that this is rewarding. But secondly, also the lack of opt-out mechanism, why you cannot abandon that child. Even once you find out that this is not a rewarding experience, you cannot shirk your responsibilities. You can only embrace them further. Why is this coercion unique to all other forms of coercions that they will likely talk about in their case? One, the scale. Because compare this to the coercion that advertising or fake news chooses. Advertising coerces you into buying something. Fake news coerces you into voting for a certain party. This coercion literally coerces you to give up all your pre-existent identities and form a new identity. An identity which you do not understand the implications of. But secondly, also the effect. So other forms of coercion have a widespread effect and do not cater to you as an individual. But this is an individual, this"

Your parents, your colleagues, your co-workers, all of them tell you that being a woman is an amazing thing. It's a glorious thing. And all of these harms are minuscule compared to that. Art and media tell you that the holy grail of womanhood is motherhood. That all of your identity has to be tied to that one single thing. What are the impacts of this? This impacts you in a couple of different ways. Because your entire identity being hinged on motherhood tells you that motherhood is all you need to be happy. So it's okay to give up that six-figure salary job. It's okay to give up that European vacation. Because you know what? You're a mother. And being a mother is all that will garner you happiness. But more importantly, you're also pushed on more responsibility because if something is rewarding, you have to work for that reward. So if the rewards are greater, your responsibility is greater. This is the way in which society tells you that it's the responsibility of women to look after their children. It's the responsibility of women to ensure that their children are brought up. And this narrative is a key component of that. We think that motherhood is great, but it's not as great as society will tend to inflame it to be."

First, we do not regret the widespread belief that motherhood is a rewarding experience. Second, this obviously does not mean we have to stand for false or false experiences of motherhood, such as for instance when a woman is raped. Hence, this debate is clearly about instances where women choose to engage in motherhood. So to be clear, this debate falls under the category of third-wave feminism, where we recognise women's choices and everything that they are agen-ted should always be respected. Next, this does not mean we cannot stand for other empowering narratives, such as for example, women choosing to pursue a career in the workplace, we can also stand for fatherhood being an easily rewarding experience. No thank you. The role we envision is one where motherhood is valued by society, as is the case with any other profession. And this means that we are more likely to have things such as pensions deemed for an elderly woman, or paying housewives for their work."

Second, how we change societal attitudes towards women. kedua, bagaimana kita mengubah sifat sosial terhadap wanita, dan kedua, saya akan membincangkan bagaimana di luar mencipta lebih banyak keadilan dalam tanggungjawab rumah. Tetapi sebelum itu, beberapa pertanyaan terhadap kes mereka. Pertama, saya akan mengambil alasan pertama mereka tentang naratif palsu dan kedua, saya akan membuktikan mengapa keadilan ibu tidak kohesif. Tetapi sebelum itu, kita hanya perlu perhatikan bahawa kes mereka sudah berkurangan, walaupun sebelum saya mempertanyakan kerana mereka mengatakan bahawa pertemuan ini hanya berkaitan dengan keputusan yang akan dihukum.

Dan sisi mereka juga mempertahankan kebanyakan yang dihukum dalam pertemuan ini, bukan hanya keputusan yang dihukum. Dan saya akan membuktikan mengapa kebanyakan keadaan tidak dihukum dan mereka membuat keputusan dan kita harus memperbaikinya. Pada sub-sentensi pertama, ia adalah naratif palsu. Mari kita tahu bahawa mereka mengambil keuntungan, tetapi mereka hanya mengatakan bahawa ada keadaan kesakitan yang berlaku. Dua jawapan. Mari kita tahu bahawa mereka menggoda tentang makanan tidak berfungsi. Kerana saya rasa kesakitan ibu bapa sama-sama subjektif untuk semua orang, walaupun kita adalah makanan atau tidak. Jadi saya hanya mengeluarkan naratif ini dari pendapat ini. Kedua, mereka mengatakan perbezaan antara kesalahan objektif dan kesalahan subjektif, bahawa beberapa keuntungan adalah objektif atau kesalahan adalah subjektif. Mari kita tahu bahawa segalanya dalam keadaan ibu, ialah subjektif seperti kesalahan yang ibu menderita, kegembiraan yang ibu menderita, semua ialah subjektif. Jadi siapa yang akan diadjudikasi, apakah itu menyenangkan atau tidak? Saya rasa metrik untuk adjudikasi adalah pilihan dan anda fikir not? I think that the metric for adjudication is to be choice, and you think that the choice is something that outside empowers. Let's then move on to the last random idea of identity. I think that if anything, having a rewarding narrative is what empowers women even more. I will show you later why this rewarding narrative is what empowers women in the workplace as well, something that their side wanted to talk about. On the idea of coercion, we think that outside breaks the idea of coercion because we think there are competing narratives on our side of the house as well. So we think that women can make a fair and balanced choice in regards to whether or not they think the choice of parenthood is clear. No thank you. So I think that this is basically the case dealt with."

              "text": "My first substantive will show you how we empower women. The thesis of this argument is that women who choose to be mothers should not be told that they are oppressing themselves. We start from a very basic premise that motherhood is something that a sizeable number of women are going to engage in. We obviously do not live in a world with artificial wombs or one where males can take on the biological function of giving birth to a child. So for society to function, we do need offspring, and we think that only women can do this. In fact, I think it is uniquely empowering to be a woman, to be able to carry on your legacy, to be able to contribute to the future of humanity by giving birth to the next generation of people. So why is the narrative that motherhood is rewarding and empowering for these women? Because we believe that it is wrong to tell these women that they are oppressing themselves. If anything, I think this narrative stands on a very patriarchal notion that the value of the world is based on what men do. So if their side sees this coercive, I think their side encranges this coercion even more. Think about it. A mother's process of teaching their children, pouring their hearts and souls into the child's upbringing is inherently valuable. When a mother goes through children's fairy tales and Aesop's fables, instilling moral values, no doubt, into a daughter, till the day she comes home with a police force job acceptance letter in her hands. When a mother nurtures social interaction skills into a son, till the day she sees him walking down the aisle, happily married. So who is Tim Blankenash to say that all of these emotional fruits of labour are always inferior to capitalist pursuits? For one observer, hence we think that we recognise that the fruits of motherhood is empowering. But before I move on, Sean. In a world where these successes of the children don't exist, what do you tell mothers around the world? We think that you can debate only a small extent of this debate when the children become unsuccessful. The point of sight of Team Singapore is very clear. We think that when mothers engage in parenthood, they recognise that there's a spectrum of outcomes that might occur to a child. But regardless, the choice that they make is empowering. They need to do it with this entire spectrum, not just the cases where the child goes wrong. dan keadaan yang mungkin akan berlaku kepada anak-anak. Tetapi tidak kira-kira pilihan yang mereka buat adalah memperoleh. Mereka perlu melakukan dengan sepanjang jenis, bukan hanya kes-kes di mana anak-anak berjalan dengan salah. Jika ada apa-apa, saya akan mengambil alasan dan mengatakan bahawa walaupun anak-anak tidak menjadi SDIU atau SDIU atau menjadi penyakit, itu tidak bermakna idea keadaan ibu-ibu secara keseluruhan ini tidak berharga. Kerana ibu-ibu sendiri yang membuat pilihan dengan pengakuan ini. Tetapi kita harus tahu bahawa idea kepercayaan hanya berdiri di sisi mereka. themselves made the choice with this recognition. But let's just note that the idea of disempowerment only stands on their side, because it stands on the male narrative that only office work is valuable. So the point here is this. On both sides, women are going to choose to be mothers. The question is why proposition can tell them it is not valuable. Let's then move on to the second substantive, how we change societal attitudes towards women. The thesis of this argument is that the narrative that motherhood is rewarding combats the notion that the work of women is inferior to that of men. We start from the central claim that the narrative that motherhood is rewarding for the mother equally tells society that motherhood is valuable. Think about it. We tell lawyers and doctors, no thank you you that the job is rewarding for them as an individual. But we think that similarly, this can be done for motherhood as well, to tell them that their job is equally valuable for society. And with this, we think that we can protect a spectrum of women. First, we protect working mothers, what type of proposition mother to talk about. We think that workplace gossip entrenches the narrative that working mothers who choose to take care of their children are quitters or losers. If anything, I would suggest that it is on our world where we are able to break this narrative, to be able to tell mothers that they are making an empowering and rewarding choice, and there are practical benefits to it."

We think that if it were true, they would also justify deceiving people to donate one of their two kidneys, deluding them to the point that they believe that this won't hurt you. More importantly, deluding them to the point that they believe that this won't hurt you. More importantly, deluding them to the point that they believe that it will be rewarding. Never ever recognizing the immense cost to it. But no, we think that's horrible. Because the same way in which you delude the person to believe that their bodily autonomy is not that important, that the physical harms are not that important, the psychological harms don't exist, we think that analogy applies here as well. We believe women cannot be used as battering rams for the society's economic labor, for families to pass on their legacies, for their families to go down the heritage lines. Because while they sacrifice so much, it is true to say that they get little in return. More importantly, as I'll prove to you, why states give them very little in return. First point of argumentation from that side. Patriarchal societies, no thank you, say that motherhood is not valuable. We see portraying motherhood is not a rewarding experience. It's not the same as portraying that it is valuable. You can show that it's a valuable experience by telling people about the immense costs of it. The immense harm that these women go through and they still do it simply to benefit the society. What you do in your side of the house is tell them that you, when you go through this period of motherhood, get more rewards than the sacrifices. That on an individualistic scale, this is the holy grail of reward. That this benefit outweighs any of those harms and therefore you should not ask for more. But more importantly, if they want to place this debate in patriarchal societies, we think your side worsens it, where people believe that this experience is in and of itself so rewarding that perhaps us catering to these women is not a necessity anymore, that perhaps they get so much more in return, that when they claim that we need paid maternity leave, that we need more people in the society to cater to their needs, their demands, that it is more of an asking for a privilege. We think that's a world in which your patriarchal status gets worsened. Secondly, they tell you that you entrench coercion by showing that it is oppressive. No, we are not telling people that motherhood is a wrong thing to do. We are not telling people that ithood is a wrong thing to do. We are not telling people that it's an oppressive thing to do. All we are saying is that we need people to recognize that there are harms, that there are also benefits. And for these people to find that out by themselves. We believe that there will be people who look out into the society and see how some women do get certain levels of rewards. When they see their child walk, when they see their child speak their first words, those are rewards that they will categorically conceive. But the problem is when you tell this woman that those rewards are so immense that it will outweigh any sorts of harms and to a great degree you will not let them know those harms in the first place. That is the competitive that you need to address. Then they tell you that the pain and the benefits are always subjective. So we need to empower choice. And that's exactly our stance. We need to empower choice for that means to get rid of the most coercive narrative and the result of which is disbelief. Lastly, no thank you, bringing children up to be successful, carrying their legacy on is immensely beneficial to the community. They can see that these women will to a great degree want to be mothers in the first place. So I don't see why conceiving children is going to be a loss for our side. They will conceive children. The comparative is in which side does the pressure on children increase? In a world where you tell that the reward is in the form of your children being successful, in the form of your children not being recalcitrant, of your children being obedient. That is a world in which the pressure on these children to subscribe to the same illusions that you have portrayed, that you have given to these mothers, is a world in which you coerce those children to meet those demands that these women have. Coerce the students to fulfil those demands that these women have. And in a world in which they do not, these women become frustrated to a point where their family life becomes worse. And that is the comparative that you need to address. Yes. We told you very clearly that the value of motherhood exists regardless of whether or not the child is beneficial. Your burden is to show why there are more harms than benefits to motherhood, not that there are just harms."

Why motherhood leaves you vulnerable even in your future and the state gives you very little in return. Your sacrifice, no thank you, your sacrifices for the children significantly outweighs the rewards to the extent that it leaves mothers vulnerable even in their future. Your narrative blinds women from forcing all of this because you give them illusion of happiness that outweighs those harms. What are those harms? First of all, the sacrifice of our physics. Starting from the time when she was pregnant to breastfeeding their children, they give up their physics to cater to the child.

In reciprocity the state gives them very little protection. In most states, even in the USA, there is no filial responsibility laws. Children, when they grow up and need to look after their own family, their own business, and especially their own children, they have very little capacity to look after their families. Often they do not realize that they have a moral obligation to look after their parents, which means they are still vulnerable. Secondly, in the vast majority of countries, women have less political capital. Very few parties cater to them. And especially when they grow old, because they are less economically productive, very few states have an incentive to cater to them. The conclusion is that when these women become vulnerable, the state and the community together gives them very little protection during that period of vulnerability. This narrative blinds you from seeing that. First of all, it's a relationship that is unreciprocated. You give more, you get very little from that child, but secondly, you give more, but you get very little from the state that coerced you to do all of this. The narrative glorifies those 16 to 18 years of motherhood, venerates it with illusions and blinds you from expecting the ways in which this period will expropriate your self-defense, your protection while the ones that propagate it will give you very little in return. The problem in this debate is not the fact that we do not understand how motherhood is valuable. We do that and especially that can be done better in our world. We do not think that motherhood is in and of itself a rewarding experience where we think that we need to reward them, that we need to give them a value, not the fact that this experience will be in and of itself valuable enough.

Similarly, the burden in this debate is not to show you that it is bad to force mothers, force women to become mothers, because that is not what this debate is about. This debate is about telling you in cases where you choose to be a mother, why they can be rewarding.

It is coercive to force people to get married because there is no opt-out clause because you can't get back the years you spent married to that person. You can't use huge amounts of bodily autonomy lost because you have to talk to your spouse and live in the same house as your spouse, for instance. So literally every single choice that they want to stand for is going to be coercive as well. The question is this, when people weigh the costs and benefits and decide that it is meaningful for them, why is it that this is not rewarding and why is it something that we should frown upon? Literally, that case seems to tell us that if a person chooses to become a mother, they will tell that person, no thank you sir, that she is betraying her sex, that she is oppressing herself and living under a false consciousness. That is not what we think is happening. We think in the vast majority of cases, because even if that case is true, it is at the margins, but in the majority of cases, we think what we stand for is a world where mothers choose to be mothers and that is empowering for them.

First of all, I want to point out that on our side, we actually expand the choices of women because we help them to expand access to the workplace. Now the second speaker says saying something is rewarding doesn't mean it's valuable. No, in our first speaker we clearly drew the link. When you say something is rewarding, that means that you aren't wasting your time doing it. That means that you are having a productive life, for example, doing it, and you aren't just being, no thank you sir, a random person who is wasting their life away. That links to the idea that it's valuable, because you are contributing to your life and having a meaningful life. If anything, the notion that women are wasting their time or are useless or are inferior to men stems often from the idea that the work they do at home is not valuable. So in fact, on our side, we increase access to the workplace. Because the reason why women don't have access to the workplace right now is because of the notion that they are wasting their time outside and that a woman is being a burden to society if we let her be a mother. If anything, on our side, we encourage more government support, no thank you sir, for mothers who want to return to the workplace, because we understand that the mothers who have gone to become mothers have created a valuable contribution to society. So the point is that, no thank you sir, on outside, we do not stand for coercion, no thank you sir. In fact, what we stand for is choice. Because at the point at which a mother chooses to stay at home, at the point at which a woman chooses to have a child and become a mother, we think it is our duty not to tell her that she is wrong and that she doesn't know best for herself, but to tell her that she is doing something that is rewarding for her. My second question therefore is on whether motherhood is actually rewarding as a concept, and I'm going to show you that it is in many cases. So the first thing they say is, what if your child is not successful? Well, we think many children are successful. Now, I know we are both Asian"

When your child gets their first paycheck, we think that is a hugely proud moment for their parent. And note that they themselves concede that this debate cannot be about absolutely unopposed narratives. Because they say that they would tell women that it is rewarding to have small moments like seeing a child walk. If they believe that there is no opt-out clause for motherhood, if they believe that it is always disempowering, then they would tell us that nothing about motherhood is helpful, nothing about motherhood is rewarding. The fact that they don't is because they concede that this debate has to be about weighing the costs and benefits. And in the case we told you that many of these women are going to find meaning in their motherhood experiences. We think it is the height of patriarchy to say that meaning exists only in the wage you receive. Meaning exists only in the promotion you receive at work. We think meaning can equally be found in the experiences mothers have at home.

My outline for today is on how we create equality yang dilakukan di dalam perjalanan sebagai seorang peguam, di dalam mahkamah sebagai seorang peguam, di dalam hospital sebagai seorang doktor, tidak membuatnya terlalu berat untuk ibu bapa sebagai seorang orang. Tidak mengapalah. Argumen saya untuk hari ini adalah bagaimana kita mencipta keadilan dalam tanggungjawab rumah. Klaim penting dalam argumen ini adalah bahawa kita memanfaatkan wanita untuk mengambil tanggungjawab lebih banyak di rumah. Jadi sekali lagi, ini berguna dengan alasan tertinggi untuk wanita yang terpaksa tinggal di rumah. Jika ada apa-apa, kita berfikir mereka akan menjadi wanita yang tidak berjaya, kerana mereka berada di masyarakat patriarkal, mereka akan terpaksa tinggal di rumah di kedua sisi. Soalan ini diberikan bahawa mereka mempunyai tanggungjawab rumah, Anything we think that are going to be women, unfortunately, as they sit in patriarchal societies, will be forced to stay at home on both sides. The question is, given that they have domestic responsibilities, which side ensures greater equality by ensuring that fathers also play a part in domestic responsibilities? So what does this look like? It looks like doing chores at home, so women aren't the only ones doing chores. It looks like spending time taking care of the child at home, for instance, because the parent is someone who is able to share responsibilities for picking up the child after work or caring for the child as childcare. Why is it true that on our side, we have more fathers who are willing to play a role at home? We think the notion that motherhood is inherently not rewarding stems from the idea that any work done at home is inherently less valuable and degrading. The idea that if I contribute at home or I stay at home, I am not contributing to society. And that is why mantu is not rewarding. The idea of how many of the things they talk about, how it takes away your future career options, also apply equally to fathers as well. And therefore, on their side, they discourage fathers from being able to have work and stay at home and care for their child, because equally, many of their arguments are symmetric and are tied to fathers as well. Before I move on, Shua. By your own analogy, the death of soldiers isn't particularly rewarding for that soldier itself, but we recognise that it is valuable, important and not degrading. Why does everything that is valuable have to be tied to the notion of reward? Sir, we do acknowledge that being a soldier is rewarding. We think it is rewarding to stand up there and die for your country, and stand up there and protect the country where your family lives. Similarly, we think it is rewarding when you stand up there and raise a family, when you raise someone and mold someone into the image of who you want that person to be. You have to show us why this reward is not something that you can recognise, and we think it's often linked to patriarchal notions of what capital gives meaning. So my argument therefore is on the idea of how we encourage more parents and more fathers to contribute at home. As I said just now, the idea of how their arguments often apply equally symmetrically to fathers as well. So the idea of how there's no opt-out clause when you leave the workplace and you can't return in the future. The idea of how it's physically demanding. Unfortunately, we understand that many women do bear the brunt of pregnancy, but their arguments are often what discourages fathers from staying at home and taking care of their child as well. Given that on both sides, what they're doing is essentially discouraging fathers from being able to stay at home and take care of their child, we think it especially punishes mothers, because they themselves admit there is already a societal perception and an expectation for mothers to stay at home. In that case, if there is already an existing societal expectation for mothers to stay at home, then if you levy the same narrative on both sectors, we think you disproportionately"

People who are in the middle, who are uncertain about whether they can or cannot be mothers. And it is there, we say, whether that belief of the glorification of motherhood, whether that helps them to make a good decision or helps them to make a bad decision. Second thing to clarify is their entire idea of creating this forced link between the fact that rewards essentially mean valuable. Look, we already told you that in cases where you get some rewards out of something, doesn't automatically make it very valuable and vice versa applies. So you might give a lot of money to charity, right, billions of dollars, but you might not get any rewards out of that because that money wasn't used to produce.

Why does it make them feel ashamed if we say that it's very painful, you have to sometimes give up things, and that you might not ever get back again?

When they see these sorts of ads, when they see these people constantly telling them that guess what? Everything will be forgotten. The sacrifices you made, the bodily pain that you made, or the fact that you left your job. It's all alright because when you see your child walk, it's gonna be fine. We think that is the delusion that they feed and we think that's taking away the empowerment. Because under our world, we believe knowledge is the best form of empowerment that you can give women. Where you can give women reality checks, saying that it's not going to be always okay, it's not going to be that guess what, just because you see your child becoming a police officer means that you'll forget the sacrifices that you made. You might still feel bad about it. We think these are important things to tell moms.

              "text": "So if I break this down, the case doesn't exist. The first thing is that they claim that the attitude towards people change. And here's a simple logical flaw that I found there. If it's already very rewarding bearing a child, why would society want to give you more rewards? Because if you remember this correctly, they claim that society would be willing to give you more things for the pain that you bear. But, I'm sorry, this is apparently the most rewarding thing in your life. Why will the society be incentivized to give you more? If anything, society actively tries to take away things from women by telling them that guess what, you do get things. That's a sad thing to say, but society really feels that way. We don't think, ladies and gentlemen, they have an incentive structure under their world that creates any sort of change. But more importantly, why does our world change this incentive? Because under our world, motherhood is a selfless act with oftentimes no rewards or little rewards. Where women do this, at the good little rewards. Where women do this at the good of their heart, women do this because they want the next generation to be fine. We think when women, you prioritize women as doing something of a selfless act, only then will the society want to change their attitudes, not under their wall ladies and gentlemen. In comparison, what did we give you? And these are things that haven't been refuted, right? We told you why there's a disproportionate responsibility that you bestow upon women. Because how many times have you heard or seen in an ad that fatherhood is rewarding? Because in the vast majority of cases, it was always motherhood to be the bearing light of what it means to bring out a child. What that does is, in patriarchal and developing countries, we are not just talking about nice countries and liberal countries. In these countries, it's a way in which people bestow extra responsibility, which they say, that since this is so rewarding for you, please go take care of them. We think that is something, an active harm, that they don't stop. But secondly, we think the entire argument that we showed you about why states don't give protection is also reestablished given that on a comparative we showed that under their world there's no incentive for a reward. At least under our world, states recognizes the fact that these women are doing a selfless act and we need to give them additional rewards and additional protection for it. So conclusion being, under our world, we create an incentive structure for women to be helped in society, under their world they don't. Second, is it really true? If not, why is that bad? No thank you, right? Note that it's crucial to recognize that our cases are not the minority of cases like they would like you to think. Because success is very rare, what reality is that you don't go the way in which you perceive things to the minority of cases like they would like you to think. Because success is very rare. What reality is that you don't go the way in which you perceive things to happen. But before I move on, sure. So if you believe that the narrative of motherhood is so rewarding, then to be clear, why would y'all like... If your side believes that the narrative of motherhood is not rewarding, why would there be any incentive for your side to ever reward mothers or encourage motherhood? Because they know that since rewards don't exist, society must give the women rewards. As simple as that. But why isn't it true? Because note, it is their burden to tell us. Why? For in cases where it isn't true, you would still tell women that it is rewarding, right? That is their burden because these are the women that are being deceived. Because we gave you a plethora of harms and the plethora of instances where these women are coerced, right? We told you about how they feel bodily pain, psychological pain and things of that sort and why the returns is not always existent, right? In that we heard no response. So in simple conclusion, given that we saw in some instances this must be true, you have no right to deceive these women in those certain instances, if not all. And lastly, as to what makes a child do better off. This is very simple, and I'll quote the second speaker here. They say that happiness comes when you mold someone into someone who you want them to be. If that is so, if you make women this dependent upon their child's success, imagine what they do to make sure that their child is successful, right? Because since we have no direct engagement, this contradiction in and of"

Because all they say is that you only have the proof that there is coercion here. They say clearly the motion calls for them to oppose motherhood being a rewarding experience as a whole, not just in the case where they were coerced into it. So you have to deal with the majority burden that the motion clearly calls for you to defend. The last thing is that you only want to talk about women in their margins. This doesn't sound to me like what the motion is calling for them to do. So even all these convenient grounds, let's take down this one claim of coercion. First response, society also coerces men to work because often this is also rooted in biological notions of men being more strong and more able to work in the workplace. But why does that side not say that this is wrong? Why does that side say it's fine to coerce men into entering a 9-to-5 job to make money for the family? Because are they suggesting to me that inferiority is coded into the DNA of women, that if they carry out their biological function of being mutilated, it's just inferior to a man holding a job in the workplace?

For instance, saying that wearing makeup or wearing high heels is wrong. But what we say is that your issue here therefore is not about coercion. Because coercion always exists in every choice that all of us makes in society. You are here wearing nice clothes because society says if you don't wear clothes, you would wear dark clothes, you would probably look un-perlapable for society. So every choice is coercion. This adjusts to me that your problem is not coercion. Your problem is that you don't like this choice and you've not proven to me why this is inherently the great choice that women should not be able to access."

But we think that even for women who engage in this, who opt into this, we think we should empower these choices. What we should regret is not the expectation of women entering motherhood, but the larger societal structures that do not value them entering and engaging in these expectations. Because we have a 9-5 work day that says that you cannot reconcile the childcare responsibilities with being a person who works. Because your side says we should not pay housework because this job is not valuable. Because your side says we have no place for women in a formal economy when we create this capitalist structure, but women are not rewarded for the choices that they take up. So they tell us here, that this all-realty tells us that they assume what is best for women. I'm sorry but no one in this room knows what is best for every single woman. So what we should err on is maximising the number of choices that women can access, and for every choice they do access, even if it is to be a mother, we should accept that and create the best possible conditions for these women who choose to do that.

              "text": "about how the narrative currently is too skewed to be rewarding women who want to become mothers, and therefore we should rebalance this scale. First, are you seriously suggesting that women don't know what they are getting into when they are pregnant? Literally, look at the number of pregnancy books that you see in bookstores, the number of how young girls are often listening to their mothers about their stories of giving birth to a child. They know all of this and even if they don't, they have friends, everyone around them who does give birth to a child. Think about all those family gatherings that someone says, when you give birth to a child, you need to note 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No, this is what it's going to be like. So clearly, we don't think that there's a problem with information asymmetry. But second, your side is rather extreme here because if you claim that the halves are always going to be so bad, then you are essentially saying you are restricting choice for every single woman because it is just so bad to be a mother. That sounds to me like the most anti-feminist argument you can probably come up with because we think that women should be able to make choices. Your side does not allow them to do that. Second question on how our side benefits mothers. I'm going to here deal with the new advance in their third speaker because they said if motherhood is so rewarding, you will always find meaning in it regardless so the narrative does not affect it. This makes no sense. Societal narratives obviously inform public policy and here's where I'll deal with their third substantive. As they currently aren't identified, the problem with the status quo is that the state does not compensate women. But the mechanism is strange. Ask us in the POI, why is it that when we say that something is rewarding, we will get rewards for this? Because clearly, we exist in a capitalist society. So value is often ascribed to the capital. If you give me a moment. That's why lawyers and doctors get the highest salaries. We say that these jobs are rewarding. And that's why they are compensated with the highest salaries of society. Because society places a higher premium on you see that these jobs are rewarding and that's why they are compensated with the highest salaries in society because society places a higher freedom on you engaging in these jobs. Clearly in a capitalist society, when you see something is rewarding, you get more rewards for that. Before I go on, yes? If this information asymmetry does not exist and if the benefits are so objectively true, then why won't women conceive children and bring them up to be better human beings on our side of the house? Because we think that on your side, you initially tell them that there is not re-braining. And this is what leads governments to not have support for them because they have to make a choice between entering the workforce or being a mother. That's what happens when you say that only one mode of being a woman is legitimate because your side forces them to in this false binary. Back to my arguments. When they say that motherhood is not rewarding, there is less of an incentive to remunerate these individuals for entering motherhood because now states see mothers as not being economically productive. They have no incentive to give them pensions or support schemes. What is the comparative on our side? The first"

After giving birth to me, my mother went back to work only to receive a huge pay cut because she took her entirety of her maternity leave. And this signalled to her employers that she was taking her motherhood responsibilities too seriously. That is what will happen on your world when you say that motherhood being a rewarding experience is not a legitimate idea. So on your side, women who go back to the workplace do not get appreciated because they are simply seen as favouring one form of being a woman more than the other. Stuff the law to me like a case. Ma'am, if motherhood is already rewarding, why would external forces want to reward it more? I initially just dealt with this argument by saying that on your side, you do not reward them. You can't claim that the comparative is that we already reward them too much. When women don't have pension schemes currently because they don't have a job, when women who are housewives don't get remunerated, you can't argue to me that now we are rewarding women too much when women don't have pension schemes currently because they don't have a job, when women who are housewives don't get remunerated, you can't argue to me that now we are rewarding women too much. That simply goes against the grain of reality. Back to my argument. Even if we take their keys at the highest, so let's accept their substantive is true, that when you say something is less valuable, you have more rewards for this. This helps our argument on fatherhood because we say that when you make fatherhood seem more rewarding, you have more government support and this helps women as well, because you don't have to be the only one shouldering the responsibility of taking care of the entire family alone. So your own argument at its highest point directly proves our point about why fatherhood"

That is a bit strange, because the premise of the entire case is that motherhood is always dead. The physical pain always outweighs any rewards you might be able to get. In that case, they can't stand for governments giving help to mothers because they would encourage more women to become mothers. If they want to be consistent in their case, they cannot stand for any government help for mothers at all because any government help for mothers, any policies like maternity leave, would encourage more women to become mothers. And if the central premise in their case is that motherhood is always a bad thing, and to be consistent, they can't stand for government help at all. So to be clear, unless they abandon the entirety of their first argument, we have to recognize that the work they stand for is a work where society doesn't help mothers. They must actively stigmatize the idea of being a mother, because being a mother is always a false choice, that it's always going to be bad for the woman. The reason why they didn't stand for that earlier is because they conceded that mothers can sometimes be empowering, and that is the case we ran. More importantly, we told you, when women choose to be mothers, we think it is important for them to be able to feel empowered. What the water proposition does is make them feel ashamed. Recognize that this bit must actually apply to these mothers and if you're gonna talk about on the margins, then sure, if women wavering on the fence deciding whether to become a mother or not, if they choose to become a mother anyway, what they do is tell them that they are making the wrong choice, what they do is strip them away of the ability to get help from society."

They tell you that all choices are coerced. We told you why. One, they don't coerce people as vulnerable as women are because they coerce men to be social workers, they coerce men to work, and I don't see why those are as coercive as these are. But most importantly, the harms and the sacrifices required in all of those works are not as immense as this period of motherhood is. Most of the benefits are amazing."

One, the immense pressure on children does not exist. An absolutely unrecruited argument because this narrative glorifies motherhood in a way that says when your child does this, this, this, this experience becomes rewarding when that immense pressure exists on the child we think family life get worse they never told you why states don't betray because we told you why state provides you with a promise but then does not does not cater to you during your vulnerable period they never told you why these objective harms don't outweigh the benefits they told you why some women would probably subjectively think that these benefits are amazing. We told you why those are minority of instances, whereas in the vast majority of cases, the harms are objectively greater because they harm your physics, they harm your financial ability, they harm your family life. For all these reasons, we think we need to give women a choice, but in a more healthy fashion. You're very powerful, police."

              "text": "But now moving into my first argument about empowerment, where we claim that we empower minority communities because we tell their stories in mainstream media. This argument will prove that meaningful representation only comes when you see someone like you having their own story and character and not just having the same skin colors. So why do we reflect minority experiences more meaningfully? We think first thing, this happens because we write a new character, right? With a backstory, complexity and nuance. This means that as a writer, you have to tell a compelling story about this person. On Up, you base your character on the old version, and you don't write a new backstory with new character traits, since the character already exists. For example, when Hermione in the Harry Potter musical was cast as black, nothing changed about her character. She didn't tell the story of the young black girl. The only thing that changed was her skin color. Secondly, on our side, you adapt other characters to that minority. When you write a minority character, you have to write into the script the relationship that exists between minorities in that show, like for for example, like family relationships in Black Panther, but also relationships with other majority characters. And thus you portray the complexity of the experiences that are unique to minorities, right, in society. We think that often you recast, you don't have to consider minority experiences in a meaningful way. Because instead, the minority is an afterthought into a pre-existing story. They are assimilated, they are unimportant. Listen, we're not saying that we get a perfectly nuanced Hollywood on our side. We're reasonable. But we think on the comparative, opposition is far more likely to be shallow and stereotyping of these minorities. Why? Two reasons. Firstly, because of the visibility of what you change on up. Viewers already know the original story. They know what James Bond is meant to be about. And thus, what you add when you put a minority into that role sticks out like a sore thumb. It's thus perceived as how stereotypes will also be perceived. This is basically how, in the new female reboot of Ghostbusters, they added period jokes, simply because the new characters were women. This leads to stereotyping, because you necessarily have to change specific things to indicate that a minority doesn't have it. But secondly, on our side, we can reflect positive societal change through lead roles. Society has largely become much more accepting, much more open to minority narratives. And we can have pop culture that is celebratory of minority identities. Like Moana, for example, which celebrates indigenous identities. Why is all of this important? Because we think we get much more meaningful representation. Indigenous girls are told that they can be their own Disney princesses with Moana, and not just the same little mermaid, just with darker skin. Their culture can be celebrated in the mainstream. And even if this doesn't appear to be a significant difference on the outside, because you still have the minority's visual characteristics displayed, we think carrying with that the unique experience and narratives holds all of the crux of what representation truly is. In our world, minority stories are told with intent and caution, and not just as an afterthought. Minorities are told that they matter for who they are, instead of just being told to be content with seeing their skin colour on TV. But now moving into"

Okay, this argument will prove that when we create newly enrolled, we get less angry majority, like less angry privileged people, and therefore have more exposure of minority stories. So how do people pursue new minority entertainment on our side? Minority, they're seen as a new story and a narrative with unique characters. This means that there is an incentive for people to watch it, for a few reasons. Firstly, but before I tell you about those, yes?"

But it's much better when you keep around the unique experiences of what makes someone a minority, and not just the skin color, not just the stereotypes, right? But continuing on with my argument, we think people are unlikely to watch these movies on our site for reasons like liking the gender, like the genre for example. Like if you like action movies, you're likely to go and watch Black Panther. But also, things like having big Hollywood ads and exposure, seeing your favorite actor, minority or not, on a movie poster. And we can still benefit from things like franchises, like Star Wars, creating new minority leads. What happens on Up when you read Hots? Firstly, you're more likely to get backlash. Listen, we're not saying that people are outright and explicitly racist, but we think people in an oppressive society are're more likely to get backlash. Listen, we're not saying that people are outright and explicitly racist, but we think people in an oppressive society are much more likely to feel anger when they feel like their favorite character is being co-opted by political correctness. These same people may be open to thinking Black Panther is awesome and saying the catchphrases of Wakanda, they just don't want you to take James Bond away. We're not defending these people, but we think their anger perpetuates harmful narratives. What is the impact of this? When hardcore fans of original franchises are angry, they do things like spread bad publicity, through Twitter hashtags, through online ratings. Like when the female group of Ghostbusters rated very poorly on Rotten Tomatoes and ended up not selling much in theatres. On our side, you get more exposure. You're more likely to see these stories and think of minority experiences as important. We don't want to live in a world where entertainment of minorities is disregarded because it's the second and worst version of the original role. Stand with me. of the original vote. Stunned vote."

The first is the backstory, creating a pre-storyline to justify a transition. For instance, a character can have a backstory of growing up in poverty that he subsequently overcame, even though they might not have been part of the original character. Second, continuing a storyline of a particular character, where the role of a lead character can be passed on to a minority. For instance, in a very contemporary example, Captain America handing the shield to Falcon, for example. That's also a form of recasting a character. Third, alternate universes or adaptations, where conditions of lead characters are re-explored through the lens of a minority character. So there can be changes to the original story for viewers to compare and contrast."

For example, Miles Morales had an uncle that played Proud of, which represents all the sort of problems that exist with African-American kids growing up in a black neighbourhood, for example, that is riddled with crime and gang incidents. We bring in another example of Othello, about how Othello can have remade plays where Othello is played as a Caucasian rather than as an African-Italian man, and his wife now becomes the African-Italian wife, that's the Mona, no thank you, rather than the Caucasian wife. The value of this analysis is that our stories remain believable and enticing to the original audience. But crucially, we can incorporate new aspects of minority culture without having to make a new rule. So we think that it is an unfair imposition on site proposition to say that there can only be visceral differences, like a change in the skin colour, but we cannot make minor tweaks to the storyline or the context. For example, because we think that all of that is within the purview of site opposition, because it uses the same character, just minor tweaks, not an entirely new character that is unheard of. That is the key distinguishing factor between the two sides. Don't let them mislead you into saying that"

              "text": "So I have two broad arguments, two broad rebuttals for today. First, on empowering minorities, and second, on coming perception. And on the first idea of empowering minorities, recognize that their side talks about a sprinkle of representation on our side. But they themselves have no mechanism as to why the writers and the scriptwriters on site proposition won't have the same sprinkle of representation they talk about. We POI'd them about why these writers have any incentive to do so. They had no response, no structural features why the writers on site proposition who create new rules are not under the same stereotypes and the same discrimination and the same racism that they claim exists on our side. In my first argument later in my constructive, I'll prove to you why the writers on our side have even more incentive to be even more representative. Second question, on public perception. And they tell us that on our side, these characters will stick out like saw of thumbs. But I think that that is inherently racist of side composition. To say that a black James Bond has significantly different characteristics just because he's black and just because he's not James Bond anymore. I don't think that that line of argumentation has any relevance into this debate as I'll further prove in my argument how I'm able to reiterate these individuals. So my first argument on river exposures with minority representation. And here in my first argument, I'll continue to clash with the lack of mechanism from side proposition as to how to impact representation. The thesis of this argument is that recasting minorities in existing gender roles generates even more attention on minority representation. Premise, the industry of popular culture and art is ruthless, both in the production as well as the consumption stage. On production, most studios and production houses, filmmakers, have strict vetting processes for scripts because they demand security and certainty for profits. They often tend towards more established brand names, characters they know have stood before and will probably continue to sell again. That is why they often go for sequels and prequels. For example, on consumption, most art and culture consumers also tend towards the mainstream because they don't want to venture to new content that they're unsure of whether it's good or not. You don't know whether the money that you're about to spend on a movie ticket, no thank you, is worth it, whether the evening that you're going to spend watching a new play is worth it or not. And there's often an inherent inclination towards films that these individuals grew up liking. So even if the remake, the sequels are not as nice on our side, they think that it is better because these individuals often have emotional attachments to the films that they grew up watching as children, for example. Why is it better then that recasting is so much better for minority representation on our side as compared to new roles? Three reasons. First, because recasting is more likely to be approved by production houses. It is safer and can make at least some profit because of the established brand name. And it doesn't have to be astronomical profits because these production houses would rather go for the certainty that you can make some profits rather than the risk that no one wants to watch a movie that is completely unheard of on site proposition, no thank you. If only they give the opportunity to clash with their first argument, our site actually has more incentives and more ability for screenwriters to become even more reflective. Why? Because if you're working with an established film, production houses are more likely to give you bigger budgets. They are better able to hire fact-checkers, for example, or key experts on the representation in order to make sure that the recasting of the role is accurate and representative. When you go with established fields, then it's your production houses are more willing to give you more money to do these things. The second reason is because recasting is better able to capitalise on fan bases. And here I want you to clash with their argument on corporate perception. Because on our side, people are more likely to go with established roles that they want to identify with. So for example, when Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse came out, for example, there was a huge or immense public backlash because people were generally very amiable to the idea of Spider-Man because they grew up watching that particular character, reading that particular comic book. So it is not true, on site proposition, to claim that they are being banished. Why is this so important? Because representation for minorities is about scope, about how many people know about it. It is about the ability for you as a kid to go to school on dress-up day, hold on a moment madam, and say, I can identify with this, and not get re-obsessed with the majority population, just because they haven't heard of this character before."

Second argument on breaking traditional oppressive strongholds. And the thesis of this argument is that recasting uniquely attacks old constructs that harm minority representation. When comparing content and production, people are only able to do so when there's a common basis of comparison. So for example, we are able to disarm negative stereotypes when the new release of the James Bond film that is played by a woman, for example, is able to show that being a womanizer is not true in society and not intrinsic to the character of James Bond. It is on our side when we show that there is no enclaving of minority representation because there is no one in society that says only black people can play this particular character, only the majority of people can play this majority character. On our side, we increase the representation for minority cultures because we get better incentives and better abilities."

You need to make the story be reflective of their experiences. And also, we think that there isn't going to be stereotyping on our side, right? Exactly because on opposition,"

Black Panther has done incredibly well in the box office. Movies that have been recast, on the other hand, movies like Ghostbusters, have been doing terribly.

Our claim is that minority actors are significantly harmed because there's a significant backlash that targets them. So, as we've told you, there's extreme backlash on our side. But why do these minority actors take these roles anyways? Because, firstly, on side opposition, these are some of the biggest and most frequent roles, right? Like, these roles are seen as potentially money-making. For minorities, are these recast signals, right? They also think that they're going to make it big. Often, they believe that these sequels are going to be popular and make these actors famous exactly because of the rationale that Team Singapore gave you, right? Instead, these roles attract extreme backlash. This is important for two main reasons. Firstly, actors are targeted. Fans attack the actors, not the casters of them, exactly because they're the visible representation of this acting choice. So they get blamed. This looks like Leslie Jones, a black woman in the Ghostbusters reboot, being harassed enough on Twitter to have to delete her account because she said it put her mental health in danger. But the second impact is that harassment often focuses on their minority characteristics. This looks like Twitter trolls saying things like that a new Ariel is ugly because she's too dark, right? This horrifying rhetoric not only impacts on the actors themselves, but on the rest of the community that we want to help on side proposition, right? It impacts on young black girls that see this harmful rhetoric being perpetrated online."

I think on side opposition, they give you structural reasons as to why certain movies are likely to get more funding, more advertising, and more, crucially, attention. But I also think it's odd for them to say that we just can't give new ideas or new looks on these characters. Because think about it, a female version of Sherlock can have a new story about how she was raised differently, but I think there are certain callbacks that can be done to fans. So for example, this character has very similar idiosyncrasies with the previous character. All of these things are ways in which movie studios can attempt to make similar ideas, but still, because they need profit-making incentive, they presumably want to make the character as interesting as possible. They presumably want to give these people something new to watch. So I don't think it's true for them to say that they're just going to recast characters, because if that's the case, they're really not going to make any money. So on both sides of the house, we have to accept, there will be studios who try their best. The question is whether or not we give them the means to do so."

              "text": "And I'm going to be attacking this in two questions. The first is on the reach of social justice, and second on deconstructing insidious narratives. So first, on the reach of social justice. Under this question, I'm going to explain why we get more people to consume art that contains minorities. And recognize that this is important in this day, because it's the main way that prop will be able to achieve the vast majority of their benefits. Recognize that cultural resonance occurs when the majority is appreciating. This is for two reasons. The first is because often people trade stories about ideas about things that they've watched. So watching a film is also important because of the people that you watch that film with. The second reason is because the benefits of their case only go as far as the scale and quality of anything on their side. So why do you not get this on their side of the house? Matthew gives you a couple of reasons. Matthew explains that the movie industry is incredibly risk averse. Because in other areas, for example, like testing products, you can have a test group to watch a movie. You can't do that with art, for example, because your test group is the art itself. What that means is that movie studios don't want to spend exorbitant amounts of money on things like world building, character building, pushing out new trailers, lots of ideas, and they have to straddle that with, for example, anything like spoilers in a movie. On their side of the house, new characters often become extremely hard for people to add to these areas. And that often means that movie studios choose to do a lot less on their side of the house. The comparative is actually very different. The comparative is when you have a character that many people know and love, that's when more people are willing to watch it. And yes, people often do go to the studio, not to watch the same thing, but to watch new and added expansions to the character, new and added expansions to the story. Like when people watch Superman, they don't fall in love with Superman because he's white, they fall in love with Superman because he represents ideas of strength, power, the idea of overcoming adversity. These are feelings that people want to see expanded upon, and that's why people will still be willing to watch films, even if they are recasted, because they represent ideas, not people, on their side of the house. To be crucial, we get more investment, more advertising, and more people to watch these ideas. They don't, on their side of the house. But what's the main response? We heard just a glib claim about backlash. I'm just going to take this down. The first thing I want to point out is that backlash seems to be rather symmetrical on both sides of the house. Presumably, if someone was really racist, they would say, that's not how I want my action hero to look anyway. So that's really symmetrical. But I'm going to push this further. I'm going to explain to you why backlash may not be as bad as they say. Because it is discussion, but actually way better than ambivalence on their side of the house. Ambivalence, which means that people don't discuss the boundaries to which people are likely to push for. They don't discuss the many issues that exist. The way we think about discourse is that more people are able to look at it and understand the consequences to which it comes from. By the way, it's also important to recognize that people aren't actively racist. People want to hide their racism sometimes or they're more subtle in nature. And what that means is that people aren't going to hate a character just because he's African American. Or more, for example, because they think that the story is not good. They can't sit on our side of the house because that character has been tried and tested and people know that it's good. So I think it's wrong for them to say all of these structural reasons. So to be clear, they get significantly less of their benefits on their side of the house because people don't want to invest in new movies because people don't want to watch them."

              "text": "Madam, I just explained to you why people would be willing to watch new extensions of their characters, especially because movie studios have an incentive to call back to these groups, and why they have an incentive to add new dimensions to a character, apart from just stereotypes because movie studios actually want people to watch these films. Moving on. So the second question on the deconstruction of insidious narratives. Here, I need to point out that often, narratives and understandings are subconscious. So for example, when we think about masculinity, we tie it to certain images of popular culture. So for example, the idea of masculinity is tied to James Bond. I think it's important that we deconstruct this. Matthew gives two reasons as to why changing the nature and character of such a person deconstructs this. Because now you break the image that only a man can be a spy. You break the image that only a man can be powerful. You break the image that only a white person will be able to carry out certain actions that they otherwise wouldn't. And it's bringing these narratives crucially that allows us to push forward and not fight for social justice. Because we need to break tropes that currently exist. We can't just break images and add more ideas. We need to finish the current ones and tie them not to have been created in the past. I don't think they create this and I don't explain and they don't explain why they repunt this. The fact that they don't respond they create this and I don't explain it, they don't explain why they're rebutting this. The fact that they don't respond to this analysis in Matthew is damning to their case. I'm now gonna move on to my team's third and final argument on allowing for the creation of new perspectives in the medium of art. The thesis for this argument is allowing for the creation of original, well, the recasting of original characters pushes for the creation of new ideas. This argument takes proposition at the highest because we explain to you why we better fulfill the purpose of art and push for core social messaging at all. The premise of this argument is very simple. Art runs with perspectives and I think this is relatively important. Art from the very beginning of time, like Shakespeare, was all about stepping into another man's shoes and accepting how they were able to feel. So the second premise of this argument is how we allow this better to happen on our side of the house. The main reason is scope. So for example, co-opting a character with certain thoughts, images, or ideals that many people have already known means that people are more willing to empathize with their character in the first place. So what's important here is that people already empathize with this character. The way we push this is when we flip it on them. So here's a good example of this. Watching the movie 12 Angry Men might give us some understanding of how, for example, the racist they call else might be towards African Americans. But it also talks to us about power structures of men. Flipping the narrative and, for example, talking about 12 Angry women that has been released, changes this significantly. It allows us to see new perspectives on the ways in which things are created. Here's another example of this. Flipping the way in which we tell the story of Julius Caesar in plays, for example in Shakespeare in the Park, allows us to analyse the power relations that occur between men and women, but more crucially than that, juxtaposition is important here. Juxtaposing the former and the latter allows us to see the differences in how people see them. And this is important. It allows more self-reflection on the ways in which we view popular culture. Because it's important if people see something, oh, I didn't realize that I would think like that. But the more you push on this idea, the more likely people are able to see the biases that they have in themselves because they are able to compare and contrast new ideas and new beliefs from the ones of the old. And this is a unique thing that can only be done on our side because people don't often automatically contrast things, especially when they are seen, for example, in things that they don't automatically relate to one another. So what is important in our case is that we've proven to you that we get more scale, we get more people watching minority films, we get more of their stories out. We believe that recasting, rephrasing health minorities"

First of all, we do think that on their art side, you do have the profit incentive. This is for three reasons. A. Because minorities are a big part of the consumer market. This looks like in the US, having a significant percent of the population being black, which means that they will be interested in watching this. And on top of that, the fact that you're likely to have a specific genre means that people are going to attend this movie and you're actually going to get revenue. This is a structural reason alongside all the things we've been telling you, such as the fact that you do have a new storyline, you need to think of the experience and make it more representative. Because you get the backlash of this very human and the fact that you have to restructure the narrative around that minority character. We've told you structural reasons and they can't misrepresent us on this. But second of all, even if you really can't get any revenue, you just cast a famous person alongside a minority character. This is not exclusive on their art set in the house. This can look like a very famous actress that might or might not be minority, which, by the way, we think there are many actresses that are minorities, so you can get these famous actresses or actors playing these roles, getting that revenue, or you can just cast someone else along to actually get it. This proves to you that there are alternatives to increase revenue and increase production for the movie industry that we do get on our side of the house, because this actually does lead to more revenue."

These are very different, right? By their characterization of how recasting looks like, you basically, recasting inherently includes replacing a character, right? This doesn't look like replacing, this is their characterization of what will happen looks more like what will happen in proposition, where you actually introduce a character and then you- Do you mean triple? No, lastly, this is important because it makes production companies actually have an incentive, right? You can still gain revenue. Minorities are not a way that doesn't give you financial revenue. But second of all, second response to this, they said that they capitalise on the fanbase right? First of all, the fanbase, even if we concede to this, they don't really increase the demographics and the number of people that are exposed to these movements. Because presumably these fanbases are like very small that they're willing to go they're willing to go again to watch a movie that's so remade. They can't claim that they increase the exposure that exists to these minority experiences in the movie industry, but then say that only the fanbase will watch this.

Two responses here. First of all, these wouldn't exist in composition either. Because if you're casting a black character, you're not going to cast another character in the same space. So at their best, we get equal heart and equal benefits on both sides of the house. But secondly, they undo this because the reason when you repass someone, you fundamentally undo the storyline. And don't believe them when they tell you that people will buy into this. Because what their point actually looks like, it's changing who James Bond is. This is important because fans won't buy into the storyline anymore and will think that this is just changing the storyline that they were so invested in. Take all their mechanisms about how fans have an emotional connection to these characters. We can see to this and we think all the things we've told you about backlash actually get worse. We told you on our side of the house that this backlash doesn't allow these minority experiences to progress. It leads to things such as hating the actors and spreading racist and sexist rhetoric on platforms that are available to so many people, and actually entrenching and worsening the issues that exist. They haven't told us, they haven't responded to the point of the world truth in our second speech, and they haven't told us the way in which they actually feel with this backlash. In the end of the day, both sides won't need a representation. But we do it through making it meaningful, through making it representative, through actually reconsidering these minority experiences and actually giving some inputs to the popular industry that will be viewed by the majority that actually will be the negative part. Because minorities are more than just different characteristics. They are different stories, and we need to listen to them. Sound movies. Thank you. To win this debate,"

In first, they start off with high intentions on engaging the full spectrum of movies and theatre, literature and art. But by the end, their policy only worked in a select few circumstances. It had to be a movie in a franchise, with aggressive marketing, in a popular genre, with a famous actor. Essentially, Black Panther. They need to engage with the majority in this debate.

And if you notice, it's extremely contradictory. On the one hand, she says that only small details will be changed. But on the other hand, suddenly we require a major rewriting of the storyline. Very convenient change of characterization whenever it suited their responses. What was the reality? We told you earlier on the topic, Matthew, that people watch movies not just because of specific characters, but because of the values and the ideals that characters represent. That's why even if you recast, the values should make it the same and the people will watch it. We think it's insulting to claim that a black James Bond or a black Superman does not represent the same values. We don't think this major rewriting of storyline is necessary."

              "text": "I want to talk about two points of contention. And this is what we told you were the criteria for what art should do in a social justice debate. First, on awareness. Second, on representation. First, on awareness. We told you how there's an increased scope of people watching due to their writing on the tales of existing popularity. The only response we get is this one line I heard from speakers. It that says that fan bases are small. No, this is a contradiction. Because if fan bases are small, none of their logic stands. All the stuff that they said, we will be interested in the action genre, no thank you, doesn't stand at all. In reality, we don't think these fan bases are small. Look at all the examples we gave you of extremely popular recasted movies, we don't think these fan bases are small. The second thing we tell you is upon the increased scale of minority productions. This means that even if we concede that people equally watch productions on their side, which we don't, on their side, there's less art for them to concede. Here, to their credit, they were more responsive. The first thing that the speaker says that just get a famous actor, it might or might not be a minority. First of all, that already consists of what they said in their first two speakers, about how it was extremely valuable that new minority actors portray these roles. I think they have to choose between either forsaking on some movies or their second speaker's understanding of minority actors. Second, they can't just do this mechanism by magic. Popular actors demand money. If the film is not going to succeed because there's no fan base, where is this money going to come from? I don't think they can just get a popular actor on their side. The second response was, oh it's an interesting genre. Sure, but in the same genre, there are many competing films. And I think, as compared to a small minority film that no one has ever heard of, people are more interested to watch John Wick 3 or Fast and Furious 8 for example. Because these already have an existing fan base that supports them. Their next response was, minorities are a large part of the consumer market. First of all, this is not necessarily true. We don't think that minorities are a large part of the consumer market in all cases. Their example is of African Americans. What about much smaller places like the LGBT community, like the disabled community? Their side simply does not cater to all these groups on their side. Their final response is, we need to be interested in advertising. That's again not true because advertising for an unheard of film is drowned out by the massive advertising budgets for all the huge franchises that compete with these films. Their final response is that recasting is a risk as well. That's not true. We think that because of the existing popularity and existing fan base, for that particular values and ideals of that film, it's less of a risk than their side. These were just all the responses, no thank you, to the scale of production on our side. Their last response was they're the incentive to fake minority movies because of demand and that's precedent. This isn't true. Let's address this so-called precedent. Here I'm going to take down their shining bright examples of Black Panther and Jedi Rey. You know what? We told you that Black Panther was a great example for our side."

We didn't really hear a response to this POI. We think it's because the incentives are symmetrical to not make these characters reductive and actually make them representative of the community. I'm not going to deal with their outlook on backlash and their point of information. We told you there was a spectrum of individuals in society. There were those really discriminatory ones and there were those on the middle ground. We want on both. First, on the really discriminatory individuals. We told you right from first speaker that it's much harder to degrade and target who a character that you love and are passionate about. We think it's really, really discriminatory individuals. We told you at our first speaker that it's much harder to degrade and target who a character that you love and are passionate about, with this wisdom in really, really discriminatory individuals. On the middle ground, we gave you reasons like formative progressivism, why discrimination is much more subtle today. We thought it was unpopular to say, I don't like this character because he's black. But it wasn't unpopular to say, I just don't like this character because he's not very imaginative storyline. That changes on our side when really racist individuals has to come out and say I don't like this individual because he's black that's when it's benefited on our side my second speaker told you why discourse is better than ambivalence this also takes on the second speaker's argument about minority actors because it was hung on backlash let's go even further we benefit minority actors and all the children who want to be actors on our side because we increase movie production and this art is more successful. If they really want to talk about Backlash, I will give you the example of Kelly Marie Tran who was told by Star Wars fans that her portrayal of Rose Tico was terrible because it wasn't imaginative. That was because it was a new character that people didn't like on their side. If they would care about Backlash, they would be supporting our side. What have I shown you? On our side, there's more consumption of art and culture representing minorities, there's more art raising awareness on minority issues, and there's a decrease in backlash. Second point of contention on representation. Their main argument here is that there's more shadow and stereotypical characters on our side. That's not true. We challenge them to give us a systemic reason other than the frankly racist notion of sticking out like a sore thumb. And we only got one thing, that you need this character to be representative of experiences and therefore you can't fit it into the mode of the existing character. That's not true. We're talking about backstories and sequels being able to fit into the mode of the existing character as well as talk about all the minority issues on our side as well. But next, I don't think there's any minority meaningful difference. Because if artists wanted to be reductive and shallow, it would happen on their side too. Even in new characters, you can have very shallow, very stereotypical characters on their side. I don't think this is a benefit they can claim. What did we tell you instead? We gave you three mechanisms for Matthew to combat discriminatory rhetoric. This continues to clash with their notion of discrimination. We told you one, on breaking stereotypes. Two, on reforming discriminatory rhetoric. This continues to clash with their notion of discrimination. We're talking, one, of breaking stereotypes. Two, of reforming discriminatory characters. And three, that we're talking about the major traits of the majority group are not intrinsic to this character. We don't think that any of them have been responded to right from first speaker. This is important and fatal to their case. I want you to ask yourselves why it was they were afraid to engage with these arguments. What have we proven? We better awareness, we better representation, we better help the vulnerable minority groups because we have been casting, we now will go to the second one."

That makes the debate very clear. This debate is not about racist caricatures. This debate is about the vehicle of social justice that we ought to choose. And I'm going to explain to you, by walking through the two worlds at the end of this debate, to explain to you why the world of the opposition was significantly better. But first, the world of proposition. The world of proposition was the world of the African-American child who brings his favorite superhero to school, only to throw it in the trash when he goes home because nobody recognized who it was. The world of proposition was a world in which minorities will not be able to as often see themselves on screen. This is often because of the fact that, as we said, it wasn't really respond to at all by the way, about how filmmakers often are incredibly risk averse, how fanbase sounds incredibly risky, why all of these things explain and suggest why their side gets significantly less political capital and support for these films. And question, importantly, this is where all of their benefits, including their first, second, and third arguments, were harmed."

I think, moreover, in the world of proposition, they don't even lose, win their argument on backlash, because we gave you structural responses all the way down the line. In the proposition, racists will remain to be racists. People will still continue to say that the action heroes that they pump out on their side don't quite look like action heroes at all. But I think it's important to recognize in this debate, therefore, is that the world of the proposition was unable to deconstruct the pre-existing narratives that caused these ideas to come out in the first place. So look at all the tropes that currently exist in their world. Yes, they have new characters, but the tropes and classics like James Bond still continue to tickle the imagination of children all around the world. If that's the image of a spy that they want to have on their side of the house because they don't deconstruct the fundamental images of masculinity that are tied to saving the world, then I think they don't get the benefits of social justice. So to be very clear, the side of proposition has equal amounts of backlash, but they don't reduce the amount of minority benefits that they have on their side. So all their benefits don't accrue. In fact, they make it significantly worse for all of these reasons."

We were the world that recognised that filmmakers on both sides of the house had the incentive to make films watchable for all. The question therefore is how we empowered them to carry out this activity. And it was the world of the opposition that explained how that was done. Because we were the world that explained why they had more investment into these movies. We were the world that explained why people would be more willing to watch these movies in the first place. Because people who have emotional connections don't just watch these movies because of the fact of their skin colour. They often watch these movies because they represent values and idiosyncrasies and jokes that they themselves understand. So for example, I'm a great fan of Sherlock. I will continue watching it if they change the gender. Same with Doctor Who because Doctor Who is a character that's constantly passed down because of certain ideas and idiosyncrasies that exist in this debate. So to be clear, fans will watch them because they care about the values that are created. I think what's important is in the world of the opposition, people get and watch these films together. That cultural capital on both sides of the house that we want is only acquired in opposition. It's in the world of the opposition where people are actually able to hear the new stories and new voices of minorities because people watch them, people understand them, people admire them. We believe that recasting recaptures our audience. I've never been prouder to oppose. Thank you. Singapore began this debate characterising these characters that we were costed as beloved"

By centering the reinterpretation of religions on this public agenda, the most important platform of shaping perception, by the way, the LGBTQIA plus community takes like the wind out of the ultra conservative sail. It would disable and make those claims even more groundless and the LGBTQIA movement would be able to establish a bridge over the trenches of contemporary radicalized identity politics.

So what is threatening for the, for like in the LGBTQ movement is that they think the movement is attacking their lifestyle. They think that the movement is coming for them. And this is by, this is because of the anti-religion aspect, like of the religion. So what is our metric in this debate? Firstly, we would like to get more inclusivity for the LGBTQIA plus movement, its members, and especially religious gay people for the sake of intersectionality. So now to our first argument on how we get more acceptance. So the status quo, there's a clash of LGBT and religion, right? This is what we call it in the framing. They are framed as mutually exclusive. And the primary attack on the LGBT is that it's against religion, right? This is what we call gender framing. They are framed as mutually exclusive. And the primary attack on the LGBT is that it's against religion, right? Therefore, it's withholding more people from supporting this community. So the problem of the religious people with LGBT is not the fact that they exist or that they would be harmed by them, but that it violates their religion. So in the status quo, a lot of religious communities view gay people as sinners right because it is against the religion this is what they claim"

The movement is now only in opposition to those religious individuals who are expressing active hatred towards the community, to those who are doing active harm, right? Because the movement itself does not generalize against another group, which makes it less hypocritical. So how do we get our acceptance? Two layers here. Firstly, in the status quo, religious people view gay people as their enemy, and this is partly because"

              "text": "of their type of interreligion. And when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how there are fundamentally good parts of religion that they support, like, for instance, love not taken love love your neighbor for instance um they do not uh they no longer feel that they are being attacked by the movement and that in conjunction with religious leader like the pope starting to be more supportive of gay of gay people is likely to lead to less opposition on both sides since there are some values which both can agree on right secondly religious gay people are more likely to go to church if they are not shunned by the movement right this means for instance more directive exposure for not taken for these groups to members of the movement and this is good because they can see that individual like they are individuals and human beings who deserve love and respect so how does this work people are more likely to be afraid of things they don't they like don't know anything about, right? And that is just like, that they just heard bad things about, right? And this can be simply explained by evolutionary reasons, like for instance, how a child is afraid of strangers, because they are not certain if that person is going to harm them in any way, or if that person is going to protect them. So what impact do we get here? Firstly, by centering the narrative in the movement, they push back on the primary attack on them by eliminating the mutual exclusivity narrative of religion and LGBT leads to more acceptance. Therefore, there will be a safer environment for the LGBT people fulfilling the whole goal of the movement, right? And also, not only for LGBT people in general, but especially for those most disadvantaged by their community, helping the most in need, falls principally in the line with the mission of the community, right? But before I move on to our next argument, I'd like to take a point. You are running away from your Bowdoin-Assad proposition in this debate. You can't say the LGBT movement is neutral towards religion on your West Side. The LGBTQ movement has to support a certain interpretation of religion on the West Side of the house. Look, we think that what we characterize you in our framing is that currently this exists because of this entire religion narrative, right? That someone who is gay must be a sinner according to that side. This is the principal clash in this debate that we are like basically characterizing how we are getting rid of that, right? But now onto our second argument or how we get more LGBT friendly policies and how we get more discussion and therefore recognition by the church. So this is directly coming from the first argument, right? Because as we get less violence and polarization, the perception of the movement is going to shift, right? Because the goal, again, is acceptance and equal rights for all. And when this centering happens that we give you, like by the analysis of the first argument, the people are going to change their mind. And why is legislative change more likely to happen on our side of the house? Firstly, because conservative legislators have to cater to the voter base, like this includes a lot of religious people. And conservative policies and pushes on policies have to cater to the voter base like this includes a lot of religious people and conservative policies and pushes on policies have to embrace religion and the interpretation of religion that their voters subscribe to so in state in the status quo they push mutual exclusivity of religion not taken and lgbt because that is the belief that dominates their voters right but by centering this topic um essentially what is going to happen is that they engage the conservative religious voter base, their perception is going to change, and policy makers will have no other choice but to follow it. We get more discussion and willingness to engage on LGBT topics as a whole. So what impact do we get here? Firstly, if more social acceptance comes from religious voters, the parties will have less incentive to sabotage pro-LGBT policies, like, for instance, gay marriage, gender affirmative care, etc. So, basically, we're getting equal rights role as these conservative policies and politicians have to cater to their voters. But secondly, on vulnerable stakeholders like children. So, religious parents now, in this status quo, just send their kids, for instance, to church to cure their sexuality, right? And this happens in the status quo because there's a lack of understanding around the topic, right? They have a lack of empathy for these people because they don't know what they feel like. And they make them feel guilty. And literally small children who feel gender dysphoria or discover their sexual identity at a younger age are made to feel guilty about themselves and this is fundamentally wrong because they have no control over this right this is proven and they have severe impacts on their mental health like no like they have lower self-esteem they're more likely to not become a malfunctioning in adult life and because they have been told that something is wrong with them like no wonder that in the status quo the suicide rates are this high and this has to change because in the status quo lives are ruined and ended like and ended like based on this immensely flawed perception so if the impact here is that we get more inclusion for the community where they can function properly they can work without being discriminated against they can get married they can adopt kids and have their own family go to church and practice their religion without other people bashing on them. Never bring project proposed."

              "text": "in the chat. Two things on opposition stands in this debate. The first is that prop needs to defend reinterpreting religion as the center of the LGBTQ plus movement. The movement as a whole is large and composed of individuals who do individual things in their private time. Proposition cannot simply support having gay preachers talk about rights in their own church or private discussion groups between closeted Christians. They need to support reinterpreting religion as being the center of public attention in the movement and the center of the LGBTQ plus narrative. Prop needs to prove that religion needs to be one of the most important things in the movement. That is their burden in this debate. Prop is already way behind because their first told you that they're only going to support being neutral. And that is way out of the spirit of today's motion, given that they need to support religion as the center of this movement. Secondly, the center of the LGBTQ plus movement right now is pride. And that's exactly what opposition supports. The big issues supported by the movement are things like body positivity, sexual freedom, and free expression. This pride movement manifests itself in activities like colorful parades, drag racing, supporting Beyonce, things of that nature. We can support members individually taking stances on religion on our side. We don't think the movement as a whole, however, should take a stance on religion. We don't think that the LGBTQ plus movement must completely oppose religion on our side, given that there's religious members of the movement too, who are very active within LGBTQ plus advocacy. If Prop proves that the two have an antagonistic relationship right now,"

              "text": "we support neutralizing that relationship as well, Given that, two pieces of rebuttal. The first is that Proposition needs to support the LGBTQ plus movement actively reinterpreting religion. If you reinterpret religion, say something like Jesus loves you even if you are gay, then you are actively taking a stance on that religion. You are not remaining neutral on it. Therefore, by the very nature of the motion in the action of reinterpreting religion, you must already take a stance on what religion means. It's also pretty disingenuous to reinterpret a religion whose values you do not even align with, given that you are making such a big change towards Christian canon, you presumably have to be a Christian yourself as well. Secondly, proposition soft case is probably not in the spirit of the motion, but even if it is, it's such an unimpactful case. Taking no stance on religion at all is not going to make religious individuals like bishops and the Pope, according to their impact, support the movement all of a sudden. They won't support this movement that used to hate them that now is just neutral towards them. You need to change the minds of so many conservatives who believe that you are a movement of sinners in order to change all of these important people. Even if the LGBTQ movement is currently anti-religion, religious gay people can separate different social circles and different parts of their identity. You can go to church on Sunday and then go to pride parade some other day. Before I move on, I'll take a point. So we, you're misunderstanding our case. We tell you how we're not taking a stance on whether religion is good or bad, but we're breaking the gate of like telling that religion has to conflict with like your sexual identity response. If that's your stance, you can cross the aisle right now and take a seat on our side of the house, right? Because that's exactly what religious movements look like in the status quo. They have no active stance."

Even in the gay positive set, even in the gay positive sex of current religions, such as the Metropolitan Community Church in LA, gay rights are integrated into religious family values, promoting the nuclear gay parent family and sexual abstinence amongst gay partners. This sect is fine, but applying the values of the sect to the movement as a whole publicly means sacrificing the sexual freedom aspects of the movement that currently exist. If you reinterpret religion, you must do so under the assumption that the larger values of religion are good. The further you stray away from this fundamental aspect of religion, the weaker prop case becomes because at that point you can no longer co-opt religious people into your movement. The impact of this is threefold. The first is that you sacrifice the authenticity of the movement. Every single thing the gay movement wants to support, that individual members want to do, has to be checked against the millions of pages of text written under all of the major world religions that currently exist. Every new activity being done will need to be checked for whether or not it can align with the new religious compliance of the movement. For example, it is unclear whether the LGBTQ movement can uncontentionally support surrogacies and IVFs for gay couples on prop anymore without knowing whether or not they are able to justify it religiously through one line of text in the Quran and one line of text in the Bible and one line of text in the Torah and all of these religious texts that exist. The second impact is on the fracturing of the movement. A lot of people in the LGBTQ movement are anti-religion for a variety of reasons. Some are liberals who dislike the way conservatives have infiltrated institutional religion. Others come from religious communities and face oppression in them. This will create fracturing within the movement as those individuals become alienated from the new center. Unlike beautiful colors and fun musical events, religion is one of the most controversial issues in the world. This translates to less political support for LGBTQ plus candidates and less legislation and less cohesion in the movement as a whole. Not having an explicit stance on our side does not alienate the religious members because they're able to separately discover their religious identities. But taking a stance on prop in favor of religion is a stance against certain members. The third thing is losing the potential for intersectionality. The trend in the status quo is that all the movements are pivoting towards sexual freedom. Feminism supports sexual freedom and women reclaiming their sexuality. The Black Pride movement is re-centering around sexual freedom and reinterpreting Black culture as being freeing instead of degenerate. The LGBTQ movement stands at the center of this intersectionality by emphasizing sexual freedom, where feminist icons like Beyonce has a new song called Break My Soul that samples the drag queen Big Freedia. This is good because there is strength in numbers. LGBTQ people will always be a minority, but they are no longer one when combined with all the other social movements. Sexual freedom is their common ground, and prop takes that away. This weighs up against the marginal increase in support from religious communities on prop, because the sudden recentering of religion on prop goes against centuries of homophobia, whereas on op it's fairly easy to get other oppressed individuals to become allies when they can also relate to the trauma of the oppressed. Second argument, therefore, on trauma."

              "text": "This argument is about LGBTQ individuals born in heavily conservative societies. Their parents and communities indoctrinated them into believing they were sinful, they might have been sent to convergent therapy. These people are few in number, but given their suffering, high impact in this debate. Coming out of the closet was probably the hardest experience in their lives. There's a reason why LGBTQ movements from the most conservative communities choose to completely change their identities after coming out. They quit their jobs, they find new friend groups, they move to New York City, they completely leave their churches. The LGBTQ plus movement on our side is a safe space and a source of catharsis for these people. It is able to act as this type of space because the movement has a completely unique culture that is the antithesis of church culture, where people are encouraged to be themselves, to do whatever they want, rather than value things like purity and chastity. People from the oppressive backgrounds are therefore able to find themselves and recover from their trauma through the movement exactly for that reason, because it helps them forget about their old lives for long enough to build new ones. This changes on prop, where the LGBTQ movement forces these individuals to relive that trauma every single day of their lives. They inevitably have to co-opt and center religious procedures and individuals in the movement in order to have authority and ethos when reinterpreting values. This looks like having gay preachers talk about the Bible, giving sermons which per Christian tradition will inevitably include the hints and stories from possibly traumatic childhood childhoods. That's why this argument matters because even if you buy proposition case that is simply going to be part of the movement, so long as it is part of the movement that trauma is all relived. So for all these reasons I'm very proud to oppose. I would like to thank the leader of opposition for that fine speech and would like to call upon the deputy prime minister to continue with the case for the side of proposition. Take care.

We think that, like, first off, due to all of the different movements that they talk about, like, for instance, the feminist movement or other kinds of movements that also generally support, like, the LGBTQIA plus movement. We think what this means is that these individuals are not going to be locked out of things like not having sexual freedom, right? We think that highlighting specific aspects of the church for the specific cause of making it more palatable to religious individuals, which is what our case is based on, we think something like this is not necessarily going to push back on like or directly no thank you or like go against fully like sexual freedom and those kinds of concepts and even if it does these individuals are still going to be accessed being able to access those kinds of concepts in general and get acceptance from other kinds of communities right we think furthermore um like this doesn't this note that this doesn't, note that this doesn't exclude the religious people that we want to win on our side of the house. We're not like having this motion to specifically get to the most fundamentalist individuals, right? What we want is to like create a common ground with the movement and with these groups. We think that what this again looks like is having especially that certain ideas of religion are very much good certain ideas are things that can be supported by the movement also note that it's becoming more widespread that these ideas like having no sexual freedom etc are things that that are that are no longer mutually no thank you are are no longer something that is directly tied to religion right we we see that in the state of school there are more and more religious individuals who are also joining all kinds of movements right supporting these kinds of ideas or at least not open opposing them openly right what this means is that by like going towards these values and maybe yes preaching some sort of family values on our side of the house saying that yes we support like things like settling down into into a family etc we don't think we think that that is like specifically enough not to alienate these individuals right we think furthermore this is not likely to fracture the movement why is this so we think that first like the reinterpretation of the religion will not necessarily support will not be necessarily support for it nor blind the movement right we think members right? We think members of the community will still and should stand up to discrimination and inequality and oppression whenever it comes from things like religious people, right? We think furthermore, this means that this is like an open and average non-fundamentalist religious people are still likely to support the movement. Right. We think that the fundamental concepts of the movement, which is which is that like these individuals should be able to live how they want or something that are still likely to draw people in. Right. We think that in the status quo, even there are some different segments. No, thank you. There are different segments of the movement. So even if you buy this argument, we think that like, there's not going to be a lot more fragmentation than in the status quo. There are still things like, like some gay people not supporting trans people, etc. Right? We don't think that the movement is like completely unified in the status quo, because it doesn't have one uniform narrative, right? So moving on, we think that, no, thank you. We think that like, we think that we still have potential for intersectionality because note that they say that the only thing that like intersectionality is based on is like this support for sexual freedom. We don't think that this is true. We think that in general, a lot of these movements are based on the idea of acceptance and equality, right? That's the fundamental tenet of all of these movements, not sexual freedom. We see this is with, and this is why, like, for instance, there are like different like conservative individuals who are like very, very religious supporting the feminist movement. Right. We think that what this means is that we're still likely to get this kind of intersectionality with the support of the government goal of getting of having more equality and less discrimination. Right. We don't think that sexual freedom is what is like the central tenant of these movements. Now let's talk about trauma, and I'll directly respond to this in our point of intersectionality, but I'll move on to a POI before that. How do you gain enough ethos in the religious communities to impactfully reinterpret the Bible if your movement is still neutral and half the people in your movement publicly hate religion? Our movement is not neutral. We tell you in our framing and we tell you in the beginning of this speech that what happens on our side of the house is that we have a very direct support for religion as a concept for people believing in things. We also tell you that we have a direct support for very specific religious concepts this is not neutrality right furthermore we think that this in itself lets individuals focus on common ground between this movement and and and um and religious values which means that religious individuals are are no"

We think on the other side, there are a lot of religious leaders who are still somewhat against the LGBT movement, right? We think that this duality, the people are most ignored are religious members of the LGBTQ community, right? We think that there are a lot of people who still believe in religion. We think that this happens regardless of their family, like, treating them not that well, right? We think that they can still embrace the, like, abstract concept of religion, even if their religious families were bad, right? We think that this is what the movement highlights, because on your side of the house, you're literally pushing the narrative that like the religion is the direct cause for the suffering of gay people through things like different like church camps or whatever, trying to change their sexuality, right? We push back on this narrative. We say that there can be like a coexistence between the religious movement and um religious people and the lgbtqia plus movement right so what happens on our side of the house is one religious we've lessened anti-religious sentiment in the lgbtq community these individuals can still be mad at their abusive families this is not something that is re-traumatizing them secondly we think it can serve as a place of acceptance for people most torn by their identities, which they perceive as contradicting. And we also stop people from being torn away from their religious families in cases where they are not abusive. Thank you."

              "text": "questions in this debate, one on religious backlash and how religious groups will react, and secondly, on the obligations of the LGBTQ groups. One, on religious backlash, three things. First, on the prop mechanization, they simply assert that on their side, LGBTQ groups will accept religion and this will solve all the problems. Their fiat only goes to the extent of reinterpretation, which means often like, that looks at things like, for example, looking at the Bible, looking at parts of it and saying, this can be interpreted to say that LGBTQ is being supported. Reinterpretation does not mean you can fiat mass love and mass support. So already their core mechanism, which that everyone in the LGBTQ movement will suddenly support and praise religion is one that is already untrue. We tell you it's more likely going to look like things like reinterpreting the Bible and negotiating what the religion actually thinks about LGBTQ groups. That already means that a core mechanism is off in this debate and it's a wrong characterization. But furthermore, this also impacts things like the fracturing of LGBTQ movements. Because we told you, if you do actually try to accept religion as a whole, many individuals disagree. Because if you look at the status quo, there is a large degree of negative sentiment within LGBTQ groups against religion. So for that reason, on their side, there will be a lot of fracturing. We heard no response to this entire argumentation. So on their side, LGBTQ groups are much weaker. That's bad because when it comes to things like voting power and uniform policies that we want to support that get changed for everyone, you get less of that when you fracture the movement as a whole. That's already bad. So that's already important to point out, because that means the characterization of what reinterpretation looks like is already extremely off. The third speaker needs to address this."

              "text": "Secondly, how will religious groups respond? And we're going to take them at their best and say reinterpretation just means to some degree that, you know, you just accept religion, right? Which is already, you know, as we pointed out, not the point of this debate. There's a gaping hole in the proposition case. They assert that religious groups simply will just accept the entire LGBTQ group at the point when you bind to religion. But they never actually prove this. Like one, just because the LGBTQ group says we like, you know, like parts of religion, why is it suddenly true that religion, like religious individuals will bind to the LGBTQ movement? Because as you characterize to you within religious groups, there is some sentiment against LGBTQ ideas, especially for more devout individuals, because people interpret the Bible in ways that say things like, for example, you know, it's wrong to be LGBTQ, and many people who are religious buy into the ideology. So even if this entire social movement buys into religion, why is it something that every religious individual will care and buy into the LGBTQ movement and vote for them? That's a mechanization never proven. So their entire upshot of, you know, then you get this massive voting base, never actually like legitimizes on their side. But secondly, as we told you, a more realistic view of this debate means you do have to reinterpret parts of religion, right? So people in LGBT groups are likely to challenge certain ideologies that are given by religious bodies. Like otherwise you have a lot of compromises, right? So for that reason, that also leads to further backlash. This already means their entire impacting and the only link to get to the impacting, which is that mass violence from religious groups occur is unlikely to happen in the very first place. And they never prove it. They just assert it. But furthermore, we're going to take that to even higher ground, right? Why is that religious backlash likely to occur? And this is like a larger impact. Because we tell you the very process of reinterpretation leads to backlash. Because what happens on their side in most cases that you look at the Bible, and you say, we disagree with how you perceive LGBT groups, we think the Bible says this, and for example, look at this passage, we think that process in of itself, especially what done by LGBT movements, and individuals who are not religious experts is specifically bad, because that is a process that like in general is seen as very sacred by individuals who care about religion, right? Because interpreting the book of like, like a very religious book, like the Bible, for example, is supposed to be done by individuals who are in high places of religious authority. So when individual movements try to co-opt that and interpret it on an individual level basis and implement those ideologies within their social movements, we think that leads to a lot of religious backlash because that seems something that is very important. And therefore, it looks like they're disagreeing with their religion. That's where religious backlash is actually likely likely on their side so you get even less support from religious groups they need to respond to this argumentation why is this so important because it speaks out all they're impacting at an even higher ground right like because it proves that politicians for example have an incentive on their side to take more extreme stances against lgbt groups when you're for example a republican politician because now the general sentiment of republicans and individuals who tend to be more religious tend to be against these movements. That takes out the best case impact. Also, all the argumentation I gave you about why they don't prove religious backlash, also shows why even in the very best case, they don't prove mass buy-in. So their only impact in the first feature is that we get more voting power. It doesn't actually happen. We're also going to introduce a new impact here. This is a new substantive, because we think in the status quo, if you want to get your LGBTQ ideas into developing countries, which often have more extreme religions, you need to take a more passive stance. On their side, when you try to reinterpret actively and you tell these countries, well, we are telling you this, right? We are interpreting religion. This is what we believe is true. That is a world where you need to mask backlash in those areas. That's specifically bad because that means infiltration of LGBTQ ideologies and acceptance never enters regions that are extremely religious in places, for example, like Saudi Arabia. So you never get that degree of implementation on their side of the house because you take too extreme of a stance. That's a big problem. So we proved you a religious backlash likely to occur and therefore all the impacts of buy-in don't occur. What do we tell you then? That's the second question. What are the obligations of an LGBTQ group? One, on religious individuals. Probe runs an argument in the first speech about children and gender dysphoria, but did absolutely no work to link this to religion or anything, right? So already the entire statement is quite irrelevant because they don't link it to the debate. We also flip this because we tell you that movement on our side is more accepting, right? Because our core ideology is saying pride is important. On their side, the core emphasis is talking about religion. So on a comparative on our side, these demographics are better off. But what do we tell you? We give you a very important argument on why we prevent trauma. Steph gives you this entire argument, and the only response you heard to it essentially saying that on their side, it's going to be better, right? And the only mechanization is that, you know, religious groups once again buy in and are accepting. We already proved to you that's unlikely to happen, but the biggest difference on our side is that you get to opt in. Because even in their best case, if religious groups do buy into your religion and are very happy about it, that doesn't mean this individual doesn't have the trauma go away. But on our side, you get a safe space. If you go into, like, you know, an LGBTQ rally, there is no talk of religion in most cases. In general, you have an accepting environment to be yourself and be proud of who you are. On their side, when you go to religious, when you go to LGBTQ rallies, religion is the center of what is being talked about. It will be constantly discussed. So for that reason, you never get a safe space in an environment to be yourself and escape your trauma of religion. That's a massive impact that affects a lot of people. We never heard a proper response. Secondly, and what are the goals of the movement? This takes the entire proposition case at their very, very best, because we're going to assume everything they say can happen, just say they get, you know, a little bit more religious buy-in. Why is our side still better? Because crucially, we think the purpose of the movement is to cater to the most people. And there are many other issues that affect a lot more individuals than religion. Because even if religious people buy in and religious people feel a little bit better on our side, that's a relatively small demographic of the entire movement. We think other issues, like for example, getting legislative change, things like for example, widespread fighting against discrimination, affect much more individuals and pride therefore should be the focus. The reason this is crucial is because one, if you just weigh on our side, everyone benefits from those things, right? So even if you're a religious individual in an LGBTQ movement, you benefit from, for example, less discrimination. On their side, only religious groups buy in and in general, this is like a lesser impact. But furthermore, on our side, there's also less fracturing because you cater to much more people. On their side, there's a religious focus. Many groups likely fracture away because they don't buy in to the general idea and don't agree with this being the center idea of a movement. That fracture means less political power and less change. So on our side, we cater to the most important issue, and we actually benefit a much larger group of people. We think that's crucial because the goal of the social movement is to cater to a large group of people to get large-scale social change. On their side, you cater to a small group of people and make that the entire center of the movement. We think that's fundamentally wrong to get change. We never hear a response to this, so we beat them at their best extremely clearly. For all these reasons, very very proud to oppose. I would like to thank Deputy Leader of Opposition for that fine speech and I would like to call upon Proposition Whip to conclude substantive part of this debate. What is out of proposition?

Second of all, then we tell you how the LGBTQ movement is directly framed and seen as some kind of, which is like the antichrist, basically, who's opposing the religious movement, who is actively committing sins. This was also acknowledged by the side of opposition. And this is very harmful because at the point at which they are framed as being very anti-religious, even though most of the members of the LGBTQ community are not directly opposing religion, they're just not accepted by religious people, that is why they are shown as some kind of like anti-religious, they're not going to be able to get acceptance on death of the house as long as this mutual exclusivity framework works on death of the house. So that is what they are destroying uniquely in this debate, they have never responded to this framework, so therefore they already lose on that. So first, who is able to create more acceptance? As I've already mentioned, at a point at which they are not able to show by this mutual exclusivity narrative is going to change they're not going to be able to change anything about the situation of the LGBTQ community right you tell you in the very framing of our first speech that the major attack the most majority thank you the primary attack that comes to LGBTQ people is coming from the religious community on the basis that it's against their religion right so the main like pushback on the LGBTQ community is not because of their existence not because of what they are doing it is because they believe that it's against the religion because it's mutually exclusive. That is what you're uniquely destroying. Firstly, we believe that they have given you three main pushbacks on this. Firstly, that the LGBTQ movement is not going to like embrace this, right? They're already strongman in that case. No, thank you. They are already strongman in that case when they are telling you that, oh, this is going to be a religious movement. They are not going to feel safe. They are not going to be able to like feel equal. Again, this is only the public agenda that we are pushing outside of the community. And we are is going to be a religious movement. They are not going to feel safe. They are not going to be able to feel equal. Again, this is only the public agenda that we are pushing outside of the community. And we are still going to be able to co-opt the equality because we are only going to co-opt the sentences and the frameworks from the religion that is directly not clashing with the active agenda of the LGBTQ community. Secondly, they're telling that this is going to be like major fracturing because of the anti-religion sentiment. We tell you that this anti-religion sentiment only exists in the status quo, no thank you in the movement, because of the anti-religion sentiment. We tell you that this anti-religion sentiment only exists in the status quo, you know, thank you, in the movement, because of the, like, anti-LGBTQ sentiment coming from the religious movement. So at the point at which you are going to be able to destroy this kind of sentiment, this is not going to be true on the SOTA, because you are only going to support those kind of ideas, which is not contradicting the core ideas of the LGBTQ movement. So the fracturing is not going to be, like, as severe as they tell you. But we tell you that in the second speech, even if that would be the case, the LGBTQ movement. So the fracturing is not going to be as severe as they tell you. But we tell you that in the second speech, even if that would be the case,"

So they have clearly not mechanized why there could be some significant impact on deaths of the house. And thirdly, they tell you that, oh, the religious groups are going to not respond well. Again, this is conduct for the mutual excluded narrative, which they feel at your desk, right? At the point of which we take out the perception of the LGBTQ movement of being the antichrist because they are directly going against religion they are directly saying that religion is bad they are not interpreting religion as a way that is applying to them they are going to be taking out it's like very backlashy response from the religious groups on the house so we have managed to prove to you that we are going to be able to get more acceptance on also the house at the point that you destroy this argument you thought this second they tell you that intersectionality is going to be happening significantly more on House of the House because, again, the basis of intersectionality is the belief in equality, which you're going to close on House of the House. At the point at which we do so, all of the social movements that they have on House of the House are going to be still intertwined with the LGBTQ community. So you're not going to lose any kind of political capital on House of the House. But what we uniquely got is the support from some religious communities. We're also going to be subscribing to the equality narrative. So again, intersectionality is going to be significantly more dominant on us or the House. Then the response about developing countries and how it's like extremist religious coalition is not going to have like any kind of backlash after this point. So what we tell you is that at the point at which you live in an extremist religious community, you're probably not going to say that, oh, the whole way that you have interpreted religion is wrong. You're going to be gradually moving on forward and gradually proving to these people that the mutually exclusive narrative does not exist. And we tell you that, especially in these countries, it is very important that these movements co-opt the framing of the religion. And especially in these countries, if they do not do so, they are going to be severely discriminated against on the other side.

We can do this under the capacity that we don't take a stance on religion in general, right? That we accept you whether or not you're religious."

Their burden is a lot bigger because their burden requires the movement to go into religious authority and tell them how to properly interpret religion in a more pro-LGBTQ way. They're running away from this burden. But second, even if you believe that you don't run away from their burden, their incredibly soft case poses a trade-off with all of their impacts. We point this out to you in second because no response. The trade-off is this. It's that if they only want to highlight very few areas of similarity between the LGBTQ movement and the religious movement, then you don't get much religious buy-in, right? Because if the only thing they highlight is, oh, we both say love thy neighbor, then like no religious person is just going to buy into your movement if you only highlight very few areas of similarity. That's a crucial trade-off. But third thing I want to note at the top is that there's just a lack of illustration, right? It is still unclear at this point in the debate exactly how they want to reinterpret religion, right? Do they want religious officials to do it? Do they want members of the activists to do it? No idea from them the LGBTQ movement. First, on the authenticity of the movement."

For the LGBTQ movement to be valuable, it needs to authentically represent the views of its members. We explained to you in the top of our case that reinterpreting religion means aligning with those values. Thus, you restrict to what your movement can support. Because in order for the LGBTQ movement to support something now on Thursdays at house, they need to find some support of that thing in religious texts, right? Sure, you might find support of like gay marriage, but you might not find support in virtual fertilization, which is crucial for gay couples in order to have a kid of their own, right? Therefore, they severely restrict what the movement can support if the movement has an obligation to align with religious texts. What were their responses? Their first response is no, but we can do this softly, right? We only need to highlight the areas of similarity, like loving thy neighbor. We don't need to compromise on other values. Two responses to their response. One, there's a signaling effect, right? Because religious interpretation isn't a secular rational discussion of values. It's an argument from authority, right? It isn't who is right, it's who is closer to the"

              "text": "Bible or who is closer to the Quran. Therefore, when the LGBTQ movement supports engaging itself in reinterpretation, the prerequisite to reinterpretation is the idea that you believe that the Bible is a source of authority, because you cannot have religious arguments about who is the right interpretation unless you believe that the Bible is a source of authority. Therefore, if you believe that the Bible is a source of authority, then you just run into a lot of contradictions, right? Because if you say the Bible is a source of authority here, therefore that's why you can't, that is why we can get gay marriage. Then you also have to defend why you can get IVF, even though IVF isn't explicitly said in the Bible. But second, if their case is about highlighting similarity, I don't need, I don't know why you need to reinterpret religion in order to highlight similarity. You can highlight similarity without reinterpreting religion. Highlighting similarity is saying, look, I support loving thy neighbor. You support loving thy neighbor too. So we both support loving thy neighbor. That's what highlighting similarity is. Reinterpreting religion is your interpretation of religion is wrong. This is how you correctly reinterpret religion. So this quabble is about similarity. You can probably still find some similarity on all sides of the house. Their second response is, oh, but body positivity and other things like sexual liberty is not fundamental to the movement. Therefore, the only thing that's fundamental to the movement is about loving everyone. And religion also says you should love everyone."

              "text": "No, body positivity is central to the movement. Why? Because it's a prerequisite of loving who you want to love, right? Sexual liberation means you can marry who you want. You can have sex with who you want. You can engage in romance with who you want. Not with the conservative notion of marriage. That is to say, one between a man and a woman and one in which you cannot have sex until you marry. So it is fundamental to the movement. Equality comes after that. So their third response is like, oh, but we can do it publicly to religious authorities. We don't have to change what happens within the movement. No, publicity is how people engage with the movement. Public events like gay pride provides, public events like social media posts is how people engage in the movement. So you can't do it publicly, but not have it affect the movement internally. It doesn't make any sense. On our side, we give the LGBTQ movement what it wants at its roots, which is liberty. And that'll be provided when you do not have to constrain yourself to religious authority. Second question, let's talk about support for the LGBTQ movement. They say religious groups will support you. Understand that their argument is contingent on an unproven premise. They need to prove why religious authorities will accept your interpretation instead of responding to you in a violent way. Because their case is contingent on the LGBTQ movement saying, this is the right interpretation, and religious people saying, you know what? I was wrong before. You're right. You know, your movement is right. I'll interpret it in the way you want me to interpret it. We think people are more likely to respond aggressively. They can concede that the LGBTQ movement is right. There's a variety of reasons for why this is the case. One, they've been taught a certain interpretation of religion for their whole life. The priests and the popes have expertise in interpreting the Bible. A random LGBTQ activist has no expertise in reinterpreting the Bible. So they will believe their traditional pope or an LGBTQ activist every day. But two, the church doesn't want to tolerate a slippery slope, right? Because they can see that their interpretation is wrong in this specific instance. It delegitimizes their power to exercise other interpretations in the future. Therefore, the upshot isn't the church will not support you. The upshot is the church will clamp down on you in more aggressive ways. Because in the status quo, you do have some level of more ambivalence within the church, right? Like Pope Francis in the status quo is relatively ambivalent about LGBT issues. He doesn't really try to talk about gay marriage. But on this house, you actively attack him. You attack the church. You tell the church, your interpretation is wrong. You need to reinterpret it using my interpretation. That is when the church is more likely to clamp down on priests, for example, who might be somewhat tolerant of LGBTQ activism in the status quo. Contrast their impact to our impact. Our impact is that you lose the liberal coalition that the LGBTQ movement is currently built towards. In the status quo, the LGBTQ movement has a coalition with the feminist movement and other minority movements. All of these other movements also oppose religion because religion also restricts their autonomy. The feminist movement opposes religion because it goes against the right to an abortion, for example, which is fundamental to their movement. Therefore, when the LGBTQ movement betrays other allies by saying, you know what, I will support religion by reinterpreting, by supporting... Did speaker disappear for everyone else? Okay, I paused the timer at 6.45. May the team members perhaps contact your teammate? Hello, can you see me? You were breaking off. Can you see me now? You were breaking off. Can you hear me? Now we can, I think. But you were breaking off when firstly asked that question. Oh, sorry. What was the last thing you heard from my speech and what's my timestamp? It's 6.45, so half a minute and a half, roughly. I think for me it was the end of the comparison between the impacts about intersectionality. The stuff about feminism, right? Yeah, yeah, you finish that one. Okay, okay, okay. Their response to this argument is that people in the movement hate religion in the status quo because the movement hates religion. No, they hate religion for their personal reasons. They believe that religion is the antithesis of the LGBTQ movement. They believe that religions will cause them trauma in their previous life. Therefore, on their side of the house, they're likely to create fracturing both within the movement and within the broader liberal coalition. This is bigger than their impact because it's a problem of probability, right? Maybe you get religious people to support you on their side, but you probably don't insofar as every other religious doctrine tells them to hate gay people. On our side, you lose the certain support of the liberal coalition when you decide to betray them by saying, I will not be pro-religion. I'll teach them how to reform their religion instead of taking a stance that is anti-religion. Our impact is more probable than theirs. Third, let's talk about religious people within the LGBTQ community. The first thing I want to say is what we told you at the top of 01, which is how much of their benefits actually has to do with the public nature of supporting religion or the public nature of reinterpreting religion. Because you can still have things like private discussion groups on all sides of the house, right? Those are things that are not related to the debate. So the debate is about gay Christians accepting themselves. They can still accept themselves by private discussion groups on our side of the house, right? Those are things that are not related to the debate. So the debate is about gay Christians accepting themselves. They can still accept themselves by private discussion groups like other gay Christians who have successfully converted. They need to defend publicity. What was our impact? Our impact was trauma, because what you eliminate for them is choice. When the movement on their side of the house takes a reinterpreting religion stance, that is when everyone within the movement has to support that in reinterpreting religious stance. They can't support a wide variety of other other things such as being pro-religion or being anti-religion on this house you give religious people trauma you prevent the escapism that currently exists in the status quo and for them the movement that was supposed to provide to them escape them is just a reminder of their old religious tendencies for these reasons we are very proud to oppose sorry about lagging out hopefully everything is clear no No worries. I would like to thank Opposition Report for that fine speech and would like to call upon Opposition Report's speaker to sum up the up-and-changers debate. You're here."

Centering reinterpretation means things like reinterpreting religious texts in certain ways that benefit the LGBTQ movement. It is unclear why they're able to assert in the proposition that it suddenly means mass acceptance or buy into religious groups. We pointed this out very clearly. We never heard resolution.

They need to respond to this somehow. This already points out that the impact is not really actualizing. But we also know the very best. We were very generous in this debate.

So it's unclear religious groups will suddenly accept, especially when they have certain ideas that are often against LGBTQ groups. But furthermore, we also told you that reinterpreting specifically as a mechanism is seen as very sacred by religious groups that should only be done by religious authorities in their religion. So now when another movement tries to reinterpret and do things that seem very, very important, that is likely to lead to mass backlash. That's an especially important link that was never responded to. So for these reasons, we're able to prove to you why these movements will receive a lot more backlash on our side. So all they're impacting on, you know, by and from religious groups are unlikely, in fact, to get much worse on their side. This is particularly important in developing countries where we told you in order to get LGBTQ ideologies in those regions, you shouldn't like, you can't like incite any like backlash. That was especially important. Impacting that was never responded to. So you proved to other best case doesn't actually like happen. Therefore, on their side, religions react in worse ways. Secondly, on vulnerable individuals, this argument on trauma was never probably responded to. And this is very important because that has a massive impact on these individuals. We told you these movements in the status quo are crucial safe spaces for individuals who were traumatized in religious groups and religious environments. On their side, you take that away when the fact that every time you go to a rally, every time you go to a topic, the center of discussion is still religion. And especially on the best case, if it's accepting religion, that's specifically traumatizing. We never heard a sufficient response. You need to buy these impacts on a very vulnerable group that's affected a great degree on their side. But furthermore, we also told you that catering to the LGBT group doesn't happen on their side.

That leads to fracturing, but also leads to mass harms to a group that the movement is supposed to protect. That also harms vulnerable individuals. That leads to the clash in terms of very actualized impacts. Three, what are the goals of the movement? This argument took them to their very best, but they never engaged with this. And that's a big problem for them. Because we told you that even in their best case, if you get some more buy-in, it is unclear why a couple more voters who are religious is going to be the tipping point for anything. So many of their impacts aren't very clear. What we tell you is very clear. The movement needs to cater to as many people as possible, especially its most vulnerable actors who are a member of the LGBTQ community. We get that on our side when we talk about things like pride that affect much more people. Religion is relatively niche. This is important because we told you when you get change on our side, it benefits everyone, right? So even if you're religious on our side within the group, you also benefit from things like, for example, less discrimination as a whole. That benefits both our people on our side and fulfills the purpose. But furthermore, we also want you to get less fracturing, and that's also crucially important to get political change. Movements need to actualize the most important policies, and since they have limited resources on their side, centering a policy and focusing on something that doesn't affect everyone is not a good strategy for the movement to take. On our side, more people are benefited, and we get more change. For all these reasons, vote for the opposition."

              "text": "Proposition Reply Speaker to deliver the last speech of this debate. You're here. panel in the status quo there is open opposition between religious individuals and the lgbtq movement someone needs to take a first step to close this gap when a religious person looks at the lgbtq movement all they say see is a movement that dislikes them a movement that is directly against them we think we need to we need we on side of the house, they can't just say that they support the same things. They need to actively stand and say, we support you. We support your ideology. We are not actively against you. We think this is a crucial difference that they need to engage with, right? We tell you what this specifically looks like. And yes, we do include reinterpreting certain ideas that are directly going against like being gay, being OK within like religious texts. We don't think that this is going to lead to extra backlash because as we tell you, these individuals who are so against gay people who are who believe that they are like they are bad. We don't think that by the movement reinterpreting this specific thing, they're going to change their mind. What they're likely to respond to and likely to change is the minds of individuals who are not like actively opposed against being gay as a lifestyle. We see this a lot in countries like for instance, Hungary, but they just don't, they just think that the movement is against them. They think that their ideology is against them. This is what we actively respond to on our side of the house. So what do we tell you on more acceptance? Note that on their side of the house, they don't really change anything, right? We think that when it comes to things like the feminists or things like individuals within the movement, they're likely to still support the core tenets of the movement, which are things like equality, which are things like less discrimination, they're still likely to vote for individuals who support these ideas, specifically because these are core concepts that they're going to support objectively, no matter what the movement is like saying. So the delta of this debate is purely religious people, right? We tell you two different layers of mechanization in first that they never directly respond to on why we're more likely to get support from religious individuals, not necessarily religious leaders, but religious individuals, right? We tell you first that in the status quo, people view gay people as their enemy, and this is partly because of their tie to anti-religious ideas, right? We think when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how they actively support it, apart from a few sentences that being gay is not okay, right? We think when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how they actively support it, apart from a few sentences, that being gay is not okay, right? We think that what this means is we think that they support the fundamental parts of religion about love and support, that they directly support religion because it spreads these concepts. This is how animosity and opposition can be struck down on our side of the house crop does nothing to this right secondly we tell you that religious gay people are much more likely to do things like go to church on our side of the house because the movement itself doesn't actively oppose this right you're no longer like shunned by the movement this means that there's much more direct exposure for these groups to members of the movement we This also looks like what we tell you, that the movement itself is much more likely to want to directly interact with religious people because they don't view them as an enemy, right? We think that these kinds of programs don't happen on their side of the house, specifically because of this neutrality and not wanting to engage with religion. We think at this point, we are much more likely to win religious people to our side of the house, right? What this means is that we get far more support from these groups. We do not lose support from any other group, precisely because of what we tell you on why they support the same core tenets, right? We also tell you that religious people within the movement, they're not traumatized by religion itself. They're likely're not traumatized by religion itself. They're likely to be traumatized by specific individuals who have used religion as a weapon. We think that it's good for this reason as well that the movement centers religion and talks about it more because they're able to differentiate these two things and not look upon religious people as a whole, as an enemy. This again leads to much more dialogue within the movement on our side of the house, leading to much more support from religious individuals. Thank you."

We think that this isn't empowerment. Categorically, we tell you that this is oppression. It is just dressed differently. And we think that for the feminist movement to lie and paint it as oppression, paint it as empowerment, is incredibly harmful in the long run."

              "text": "Two things in my speech. First, in terms of setup, then two arguments. In terms of setup, I want to answer two key questions. First of all, what does this redefinition look like? We think that this redefinition looks like using narratives such as dressing for the male gaze, but then saying that it isn't really dressing for the male gaze, it is more about your confidence. But at the end of the day, the implicit things within these narratives are still that you're doing it so that you are observed or treated well as per the male gaze. So we think that these narratives are still inherently patriarchal. This looks like things like wearing lipstick at work, wearing high heels in corporate spaces, wanting to be a housewife, validating things like being caring above your own well-being. And we think that what this has categorically done in the status quo is that it has reduced the sub-movements within the feminist movement that are against gender roles categorically. Rather, it has given power or increased the sub-movements within the larger feminist movement that glorify these gender roles, which is to say that there is many different variations of feminism within this larger scope of monolith of feminism as a movement, and we think that some sub-movements have been impacted more unfairly by this narrative than others have been. What do we oppose then? Categorically speaking, we oppose the fact that this movement promotes the idea that this is empowering. Yes, your point. So if I do want to be a housewife, can you tell me that I'm a bad feminist or just that I have bad cases of being a housewife? No, we don't tell you anything. That's like saying, if I wear red shoes instead of blue shoes, what do you tell me? We literally don't tell you anything. We don't think that everything that you do has to have some sort of categorical value message that you send. Sometimes you just don't take stances on something, right? Just because you don't say something is empowering doesn't necessarily mean that you say something is bad or you don't have a place. That's like saying, oh, so do I have no place in the feminist movement if I wear purple shoes? Then in terms of argumentation, two arguments."

              "text": "in, which is to say that if I prove this argument, I win this debate. The mechanisms for this are as follows. Firstly, I'm going to start by proving why this is inherently patriarchal. The reason this is inherently patriarchal is, first of all, let's understand where traditional gender norms stem from. These things really do stem from things like the male gaze, right? So what are the historical preferences in terms of what men value? And the reason this is implicitly true is if you think about it, why do you necessarily wear lipstick? Although in the current status quo, the narrative might be that this is to make you more confident, the reason that you necessarily do become more confident when you wear lipstick is because you infer that there is going to be someone in the boardroom who is a man and he might take your opinions with more credibility in the point in time that you're wearing lipstick. Which is to say that this is still ruled or powered by men to a large degree and this is largely largely still based on what appeals to men. So narratives like wear red nail polish instead of black because that is more appealing to men, that makes you a siren woman, these are all things that are entrenched in what is more appealing to men and they cannot categorically deny that. Yes, your point? So, women are not in my mind that you say, you're just not in sense. No, you do exist. In that point in time, I don't necessarily understand what your sexuality has to do with the fact that you're wearing lipstick. First of all, your point doesn't really make sense to me. But other than that, I still think that lesbians still do benefit from men finding their opinions appealing or men finding them physically attractive to a large degree, right? It is not that if you're a lesbian, there's not going to be any men in the boardroom whose attention you might benefit from."

              "text": "there is positive reinforcement. So even given the scenario that opposition tries to posit that you're a lesbian woman, we think that there is a large degree of positive reinforcement that is garnered towards you in the case that you do buy into these gender roles, right? Which is to say that when there is this positive reinforcement, it is very, very hard to step away from this positive reinforcement at that point in time, because the moment in time that you do, you start craving it, which is to say that this is a very powerful mechanism to lock you in and ensure that you keep doing these things over and over again in a way that is implicitly coerced upon you, but you are not able to actively recognize that you are being coerced to do this, which is even more harmful because when you don't recognize that there is active coercion, it is harder for you to fight against this. But even in the instance that it might not be patriarchal and you might really do it from your own self-will, we think that this is still very important for us to oppose for a few key reasons. The first is that society already rewards traditionally feminine behaviours. How does it reward them? Compliments, attention, we think that there is also a large degree of validation that you get from media houses who look around you, posters, have attractive women wearing beautiful heels, wearing beautiful lipstick, which is to say that there are implicit expectations for you to do this. How do these implicit expectations exist? These implicit expectations exist in the forms of narratives such as you look tired if you don't wear makeup. This means necessarily that society to a certain degree is expecting that you buy into these narratives and at the point in time where you're not able to do this, society tells you to a certain degree that you are doing the wrong thing or that you are not making the right choice. What is this doing effectively tells you to a certain degree that you are doing the wrong thing or that you are not making the right choice. What is this doing effectively for you as a conclusion? This is telling you that the conclusion is that when traditional feminine narratives are given a place within the feminist movement, we are limiting choice. Why should we then oppose it? We think that we should oppose it because society already has narratives of appreciation for traditionally feminine roles. Which is to say that if their concern is that women who buy into these traditional gender narratives will not get appreciation within society, that is a dumbfounded concern. Because they already do. Like I tell you, they get validation, they get appreciation, they already have a place within society. Who is the feminist movement more important for? It is more important for individuals who don't really have a categorical space within society, who don't fit into other alternative spaces and who need feminism because that is their home, that is where they find their family, and that is where they find appreciation, that is where they find acceptance. We think that at the point in time where this space ceases to be for them, we think that they largely, largely are harmed. So the reason this is so crucially important to oppose is number one, it is inherently patriarchal, which is to say that the feminist movement promoting something that is inherently patriarchal as empowering is just principally wrong because that is again at a juxtaposition with its own ideals but number two even in the case that it is not we think that we should prioritize individuals who don't have another home which is why we think that we must oppose it. Second argument for you then has the following pieces"

              "text": "the feminist movement hurts itself in the long run exponentially impacting more women there are a few mechanisms right the first mechanism of which is that we try to, when this, at the point in time that it happens, what is the feminist movement doing? It is homogenizing itself with patriarchal ideals. What does this specifically mean? It specifically means that at this point in time, the positioning of feminism as a movement is diluted because you no longer know what it stands for. Given that I've proven to you that these ideals do necessarily stem from patriarchy, I think that it is true to a large degree that now, at this point in time, the ideals of the feminist movement itself, or the position of feminist movement within the status quo is going to be diluted to a certain degree. What does this then mean? This means that the movement is going to perpetuate these ideals in many other spaces, which alienates a lot more women who don't fit into these ideals. So, thirdly then, we also think that people start seeing the movement as less valid given its diluted positioning. What are the impacts of this? We think that the impacts of this are that in the long run, we are able to reach less people. Why is this necessarily true? We think, first of all, that at the point in time that there is a large degree of diluted positioning of this movement, number one, on a policy level, this movement is just going to be seen as less valid, which means that policymakers, lobbyists are not going to be able to see conclusions that are derived from this movement and expectations that are derived from this movement as valid. But more largely, we think that there is also going to be a large degree of social opposition in the status quo, which makes it harder for people to buy into this movement.

It's making them feel good about themselves. It's making them feel like they're able to stand up for what they believe in. But notice this idea of empowerment does not replace other efforts in other areas. So this looks like the fact that the feminist movement may want to empower women at the same time as seeking other specific policy aids. We don't think this sort of thing comes at the expense of that. No, thank you. But we also acknowledge that the feminist movement exists in a range of scenarios, in the developed world, in the developing world. More on that later.

I don't think it looks like telling women that they should wear purple shoes or wear red nail polish. I think it looks like telling women that they can be a mother, that they can have a family, that they can be in a traditional married to a man relationship and still be empowered and not be a traitor to the movement. I think it looks like pointing to female politicians and CEOs who are saying they can do it, they can do multiple things, they can be a mother at the same time as being powerful, rather than what I think you get on their side of the house, which is only pointing to idols who are distinctly unpatriarchal and only the women who do not buy into any of these societal pressures that we think that they are quite coerced into doing. What we crucially think is that women need support from the feminist movement. We think the only way you give support to all women, most particularly the most vulnerable women, is on our side of the house."

They say you're buying into the patriarchy as the feminist movement and so therefore you shouldn't do this. They say that because gender roles stem from bad places, we should reject all of them. Panel, I think it's quite sad that Team Nepal think women have absolutely no autonomy and not a single woman chooses to be a mother, no thank you, or chooses to have children, or chooses to do traditionally feminine things. But I think many women do choose to do these things. I think at the point at which we've already moved past the second wave feminism that they're choosing to stand behind, women do have these sorts of choices. Then they say they're coerced. But I think actually, if you're coerced into doing these things, this sort of narrative from the feminist movement is even more important. Because if women truly are coerced into having children and into buying into the patriarchal structure, then I think the least that these women deserve, when they literally have no other alternative, is the support of the movement that's supposed to represent them, right? If side propositions think women are coerced into being feminine, I think the movement should help them get away from that. I think they should help them feel empowered in the thing that they're literally apparently"

              "text": "being forced to do. Moving on to my first argument then on how we get more buy-in to the feminist movement on our side of the house. The premise here is that in order to be maximally successful in achieving their aims, the feminist movement needs broad support. Crucially, it needs support from people who would not otherwise automatically buy-in to the feminist movement needs broad support. Crucially, it needs support from people who would not otherwise automatically buy in to the feminist movement. We think these are the sorts of people who they exclude. But we also think that other than getting buy-in for the movement as a whole, it needs to allow all women to see themselves in the feminist movement and all women to feel appreciated and that the movement is there to support them. So how do we get more support from the feminist movement on our side of the house and how do we support members of the movement more? This happens in a couple of scenarios. I think firstly it happens for women who are already in positions of power and people who have already benefited from the old narratives of the feminist movement. This looks like women who have already gained their position in their career and have been told by second wave feminism that they should be buying into things like having a job into not being feminine. I think feminist movement owes these women things like saying actually no we like now we've reached a point in society where you can be feminine and still have a job we think that you should we should let these women opt into the feminist movement we think you should give them support. But we think secondly and most importantly it's crucial for women who literally cannot not be feminine on their side of the house. We think often women who most need empowerment and support for the feminist movement are those who have to take feminine on their side of the house. We think often women who most need empowerment and support for the feminist movement are those who have to take feminine positions. This looks like women in the developing world who don't have access to jobs or high-paying positions, who literally just need help in, I don't know, securing support in their relationship. Side proposition denies them this because of the fact that it's patriarchal. They deny helping these women. They exclude them. They make them feel like the feminist movement isn't for them. It also looks like women who already in marriages, already have children, and already want things like policy for childcare, but on their side of the house, feel alienated by the movement. Because we think what their actual counterfactual is, is saying that the feminist movement is only for women who are not feminine. It's only for women, it's only for people who are not expressing these patriarchal traits that they say the feminist movement has to reject. Thirdly, we think you also get more buy-in from people at the lower level. We think you get more buy-in from children. We think on the other side of the house, when the feminist movement is seen as something super radical, when it's seen as political lesbians who are all anti-men and they're all anti-traditional patriarchal roles, we think that's the point at which, especially in conservative circles, feminism is actively demonised. People are saying it's unnatural. People are saying, oh, I'm not going to be a feminist because I think that's strange. We think at the point at which the feminist movement is able to attract the majority of women in society, who we do think generally do have pretty feminine traits because of the fact that they have been indoctrinated by the patriarchy, as they would like to say. We think that's the point at which they get more buy-in. I think that's the point at which the feminist movement is able to help more people. But what do we think the macro impacts of this and why are they so important? We think firstly and crucially you do get more policy change on our side of the house. Look, we acknowledge that electoral change in terms of feminism is often quite difficult. We think that's why this narrative is super important. We think the problem on my side of the house is you often alienate the women who have the most power. You often alienate the older women who think the feminist movement is too radical. These are the women who have money, these are the women who are most likely to turn out to vote. We think on our side of the house we improve this by making the feminist movement more palatable to these sorts of women who do actually feel like they want to be done. I'll take that for your life. Do you know why our radical stance is wrong? So your only response is that when you are radical, you get backlash. Are you really saying that we should stop doing right things because right things sometimes get backlash? No, that's not a response you have to listen to me. I'm not saying that the reason why we shouldn't do this is because of the fact that we're going to get backlash. I'm saying the reason why you should do this is because if you do say that women are indoctrinated and women do feel the need to be feminine, there are societal pressures telling them they need to be feminine. I think we should be supporting these women. I think"

We think that this is bad for women, particularly when the feminist movement is endorsing it because of the fact that the feminist movement is supposed to be on the power, on the side of women. We think at the point at which the feminist movement ignores all these sorts of women, they do feel actively excluded. They don't feel like they have these people behind them. Why do we think we counteract this on our side of the house? We think on our side of the house, women can be proud of the fact that they have raised a family, that they have made sacrifices, that even though they are doing traditionally feminine things, that their role is still appreciated in families. We think this impacts different groups in many, many ways. We think first, it allows women to actually get more help from men and more help from other people. Because we think on their side of the house, when femininity isn't seen as something empowering, that's the point at which men are shying away from the sorts of things that would actually help women progress out of these patriarchal positions. That's the point at which men think, oh, actually that's really inferior if I stay at home and look after the kids. But we think of the point at which the narrative shifts and it becomes women actually feeling empowered by this femininity and men feeling empowered by this femininity.

Because there are other incentives to care for mothers. Because motherhood, number one, is already valid by society to a great degree, but we also don't see why feminist movements are forced to leave motherhood as a consequence of not supporting fashion. We think these two things are completely independent and therefore their just entire stance makes no sense. Let's look at further what they say, however. They tell us that most women need to be able to see themselves in the feminist movement. What does first speaker clearly tell you here? She tells you that a variety of women exist in the status quo, which is to say that some women probably want to be mothers, probably want to be housewives. But there are other women who exist, who want to do other things, who want to conform, like who don't want to conform to the already existing narratives in society. We think at this moment it becomes increasingly important for a feminist movement to be a strong idea for them, to be a strong institution for them, which is what we think side opposition does not give these women, and that is why we think we win this debate."

I think, firstly, if you're coerced into having children, I think society already gives you a lot of solace, which is to say that if my father and my husband force me to have children, they're obviously going to be happy that I have children. They're obviously going to tell me, oh, you're such a great mother. We don't really see what new impact they bring here. But secondly, they also say that women who are mothers or women who conform to these narratives are going to be locked out of jobs now because other women don't want them to get those jobs. I mean, what is the link here? I think the greater idea that all of them are women is something that overpowers the difference of them wearing lipstick or them being a mother. We don't really see the link between why we have to support people promoting lipsticks, people promoting conforming to gender identities, or people promoting being housewife is a great thing in order to support the fact that women should have more jobs. We think these two things are just logically something that they cannot claim for us. But lastly, they claim that they get more buying from children. And this is because on our side of the house, the movement somehow becomes extremely radical. Panel, this is just unfair characterization. We think we can still focus within the liberal sphere to a large degree. Why is this likely the case?

Therefore, we think largely that our approach to this debate has an untrackable yesterday. You have to do that in the traditional perception of feminine roles. Traditionally, feminine behaviours are seen as weak and detrimental to the feminist movement. Why would you keep this definition? How does this empower women? I mean, there's going to be an answer to that on Clash Analysis, but I also don't think it's as simplistic as saying you literally oppress women. I think there's more to it than that. I'll flag it up for you. But let's look at the last thing, the other things that they say here. After the buying from Children's Point, they say that you often alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, no link. They just say you alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, no link. They just say you alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, just a call out. They don't do that. I think the movement has incentives to include those women. I think if they do not prove to us why these rich women, in all instances, are women who promote the identities or who promote the narrative that we oppose in today's motion, if they are able to prove that, we are ready to bite this bullet. But insofar as they are unable to prove that all rich women are women who promote the narrative that we oppose in today's motion, if they're able to prove that, we're ready to bite this bullet. But insofar as they're unable to prove that all rich women are women who like promote the identity or promote the ideas that we are trying to oppose today, we think we can still claim a lot of the benefits that comes from these women. Lastly, and this is like their hair, maybe they say that this leads to better treatment of women because historically, women are seen as financially inferior and they go on like a very disconnected link and how mothers are left out again structurally we think the incentives to not speak out against things like wearing lipstick going like wearing how he was conforming to being housewives and being mothers had to very very independent things we don't think we leave them out but the more important clash and this is i've gone to rebuilding at this point because i think their case just doesn't make sense because it's so like, you guys are going to be like political lesbians, right? We think the more likely comparative is that there exists a spectrum of women in society, which is to say that some women want to be housewives, but some women also want to not adhere to these social constructs. Now, at this point, what you need to realize"

How do we deal with both of these stakeholders that are on our side of the house? Firstly, let's analyze the stakeholders that they say we leave out. We think institutions like the family, institutions like society have already accepted patriarchal norms to a very, very great degree. What does this look like? This means that if you want to be a housewife, if you want to be a mother, if you want to be a traditional woman, so to speak, society already accepts you to a very, very great degree. Which is to say, they don't tell you, you're a bad mother because you conform to the ideas that we set and we think are good. If you conform to those ideas, you, by definition, become good to those people. You become a virtuous woman to those people. Now, what are the most vulnerable women in these instances then? We think the most vulnerable actors here are the women who do not want to conform to those narratives. What this means then is that they probably do not want to be mothers. Now, in this instance, we think a feminist movement serves as a unique institution that is contrarian to the narratives that already exist in society. Which is to say that even if adhering to patriarchal norms is something that is not harmful, we still maximize choice. Why is this the likely scenario? Because I told you earlier, in order to make a choice, you also need an institution to be able to conform to you that you are going to be able to make that choice to empower you. We think then the feminist movement has a principal obligation to be this unique powerhouse for this movement. At the very point in time you start conforming to traditional feminist norms again. We think you get an unnecessary burden of like promoting these women who are already taken care of by society. We think their main focus should be on those other women that are uniquely left out in the society. That is what we argue. Therefore, we think that we do not leave any women out and we take care of these people who want to do other things, who do not want to adhere to society. Here they conveniently tell us that we're going to be leaving a lot of women behind, but as I've already pointed you out, pointed you out earlier, their contentions are merely superficial because there is no structural reason behind it. Lastly then, before I end my speech, I just want to give a bit of illustration on how these feminist movements then evolve. We think that permeation of their narrative in society is something that is also very, very important, which is to say that if they have one solid narrative, it is much more easier to follow them as compared to if it is very, very diluted. So on their point on children, I don't really see why a child is going to be able to pick and choose between 100 different feminist movements while children on our side are basically going to be, I don't know, anti-political lesbians. Therefore, we think it's very, very simple. You need to ground yourself in reality. You need to be able to maximize the choices for this woman. Vote side proposition. Thank you. Proposition 2,"

This also encompasses traditional behaviours and roles. See becoming a housewife, see becoming a mother.

First, let's challenge the premise that all of these ideas are a result of wanting to seem more palatable to men. You might wear lipstick because you like it. It might be because it makes you feel more confident. It might be because you want to attract other women. There's nothing innate about, say, wearing the colour pink that is associated with women. Indeed, in the Victorian times, it was marketed primarily to young boys. But look, even if we say, maybe I do like nail polish because the patriarchy has told me to, A, I'm still getting utility from wearing that nail polish as a woman. But B, let's be comparative. Because note the burden that Olivia brings you in first, that they literally do not engage with. She says that their world looks like the second wave feminism that dominated before this contrasting narrative was introduced. Their world looks like telling women it's not empowering to wear makeup. Instead, you want to step outside of these worlds deliberately. The only thing that is empowering for you is to behave more like a man. That is the point at which you get people like Margaret Thatcher from the country of England, who stood up and said, what has women's live ever done for me, who wore shoulder pads and made her voice sound deeper so that she could be more respected because she would seem more like a man. So their world is not maybe about appealing to men, but it is about imitating to men. So we think even in their best case, they are still appealing to the patriarchy in their world.

              "text": "principle we shouldn't support this and therefore they win this debate. This is purely an assertion that the priority of the feminist movement ought to be ideological purity. We think that the aim of a feminist movement is not just to stand for equality, but to achieve it too. So we're happy to make some sacrifices if we get more utility for women. For example, we would say it is a good idea to have a 30% quota for women in Parliament, even if that's not a 50% quota, because at least you're achieving something for women, at least you're getting some utility. So I think we've taken down this argument, which they themselves established as their path to victory in this debate. But even so, which side gets more support? They shoo on this argument to the last minute of their first speech, and they pretty much drop it in second. But they claim that on our side, we alienate women who do not conform. Three responses. First, this is purely assertive, because we don't think it's necessarily true that more women want to adopt the masculine corporate mould of being a woman rather than being feminine. Probably different women prefer different things at different times. But many women on either side of the house are going to be either pressured into following these social roles or they don't want to feel rejected by the feminist movement when they do. So we think they also have to engage with the fact that they alienate women. Second, we think when you are less extreme, you say that more people can engage. Because unlike them, we don't have to stand behind labelling a certain set of behaviours as disempowering. We can say that we redefine these behaviours as empowering, while also accepting that other choices can be empowering too. Third, we think that often the women we support on our side are the most vulnerable, who are coerced into appealing to this feminine mould of being. I'm going to expand on that more later in my extension. We say, by contrast, we're able to get more women involved in the feminist movement on our side. First, they say, well, there might be women who don't like the kind of thing you're standing for on our side. I think I've dealt with that already. But second, and this is a really strange claim, they say the feminist movement does not owe you solace if you are a woman who appeals to society's model of what a woman should be. Because you already get that solace from society. Panel, we just don't think this is true at all. Women in the developing world might appeal to the patriarchy's idea of what an ideal woman should be. That doesn't mean they're getting maternity leave. That doesn't mean they're getting reproductive rights. That doesn't mean they're getting the kinds of benefits we think they deserve. So we think we get more support from more women in our world. But we also get better treatment of women in our world because of all of the analysis that Olivia brings you against, you know, engagement. When she tells you how in their world they support bad narratives about women that say you have to be more masculine or otherwise you're a bad feminist. They support bad narratives about femininity, behaviours that label as feminine, that means that traditionally feminine professions are devalued on their side of the house. That if men decide that they want to help with the washing up once in a while, that is also labeled as bad, that is labeled as weakness because it is associated with femininity. So they get less respect for women, they get less respect for women's choices, and they get less buy-in from the movement from men. We think already we're winning this debate. But look, before I go on, I'll take that one. In a room full of people who always say they're women for the male, to appeal to their male gaze, you would get more support if your woman had been up here by the principles that govern the male gaze. Is that right or wrong in your sense of the word? Look, we think that if we get more rights for women, if we get more maternity leave, if we get more reproductive rights, we're kind of happy to stand behind that. Like, sure, respectability politics might not be palatable, but we think it certainly does win you votes and it wins you actual change. Now, let's talk about the women who they claim are already catered to by society, so don't need feminism. Contrary to what they tell you, we think these are actually the most vulnerable women, because the women who are coerced into making the choices that they label as traditional femininity are often those who have the least power to opt out. They are those who are the most vulnerable and need the most change. How do we shift the priorities of the feminist movement to help them in our world? Three reasons. First, the feminist movement wants to empower women. So when you tell feminists that it's empowering if you choose to be a wife or a mother, they're going to advocate for making it easier for more women to make that choice. Second we decrease stigma around wanting to adhere to these roles so women no longer feel like bad feminists for advocating for these policies to saying please make it easier for me to get childcare. But third in our world there is a narrative that marriage or motherhood ought to be empowering. In their world panel there's an expectation that it's innately damaging. So you hold your husband to a lower standard, you accept that you won't get help for PND because you think they need the side of the house. That's just going to be an innately disempowering experience. So in our world, more feminists advocate for things like maternity leave that make it possible for women to have children and remain in the workplace or affordable childcare to make motherhood easier. Notice how highly you should weigh this in the debate. Because so many women want to be mothers either way. We help that vast majority of women around the world. Second, this is often a prerequisite to the benefits they want to talk about, because it's only when you get maternity leave that you can then have a corporate job. And third, we think this is specifically useful for the most vulnerable women who are coerced into having children on either side of the house. At least in our world, we get them some protection. We get"

Secondly, let's talk about the harms to women on a principal basis. And thirdly, what harms their side perpetuates to women and the feminist movement as a whole. So firstly, on redefinition, we tell you that the redefinition probably looks like the feminist movement as a whole. So firstly on redefinition. We tell you that the redefinition probably looks like the feminist movement arguing that it is good and it is empowering and it gives you power to dress for the male gaze because you look good on camera, for example. You want to be a housewife? That is empowering because you're a girl boss and whatnot. Things like media that is dominating the culture of how women think. How women think that if they are staying at home, they are being empowered, they are running the world. The clarification that should come here explicitly is that the motion reads opposes the attempts of the feminist movement. We are not opposing the belief as a result. But even then, I do not get why this influences this debate because the larger picture of this debate is that I really do not get why they say that it is bad for the feminist movement to propagate other narratives, such as it is fine to be more masculine. There is no logical link. Don't let them get away by this simple call-out that does not really have an effect on this debate. So let's buy the best case. I will show you why it does not make a difference. Secondly then, on the harms to women on principle."

Firstly, there's a historic precedent set by men and it was controlled by them and it was those men who formulated these precedents in the first place. And those are in accordance with male gaze and nothing to do with the utilitarian benefits on women. Secondly, it is still controlled by men in implicit forms, like when you give validations by appreciating a woman for wearing the reddest lipstick that you've ever seen in your life. So they cannot argue that now the women control it, because you're only editing a part of the narrative. The fact that lipsticks look good on women came from the male gaze. And thirdly, society tells you to do it and it is continued in other implicit forms like media and the posters that you see around you. How is this harmful? Firstly, there is no choice that is given to you. You're limiting the choice. The choice not to wear lipstick is not present when the feminist movement, who was supposed to be the only avenue for liberation against patriarchy for the vast majority, tells you that it is in fact empowering and therefore you're not supporting the movement when you do not wear a lipstick on your lips. Versus when we say that it is value neutral, for example, on our side, or it is okay for other narratives to exist, like it is okay to be more masculine as a lesbian or a woman in general, despite your sexuality, we tell you that it is more, it's just going to be a better choice that we give you. There are more choices that are posed to you. But second harm they inflict on you is they allow capitalism to"

There are always other ways to feel good about yourself, even when the movement pushes value-neutral ideals related to gender roles. I don't see why they have won this clash. We have clearly won this. Second clash, then, on the harms to the movement on an overall basis. Let's tell you what, we have told you what happens on two levels. One, there is a diluted messaging because of the way that this narrative interacts with the narratives of patriarchy. Patriarchy says something, this narrative says, oh, some things of patriarchy are good. When in reality, this movement was supposed to be a direct opposition of patriarchy because this is the only ground of liberation. Because the opposing ideal is accepted, now there's a diluted version of messaging. There are no clear boundaries that are set, for example, or maybe you just alienate women as a result of accepting a lot of these changes. But secondly, there's a change in the stance that is adopted by the feminist movement overall against patriarchy people now become more accepting of the male gaze for example in feminist circles so they influence other decisions of other feminists within the movement yes I'll take that point tell them they're empowered and they have the power to raise up against this patriarchy who completely reject them. Thank you for your concern. It is really funny how they asked this POI in my third speech. Firstly, this does not come out in their speech. Secondly, even if that were to be true, that people in developing countries are forced to stay at home, we tell you that it is logically flawed because these people are the least affected people by the narratives of the feminist movement. The reach of the feminist movement is predominantly in the western or more liberal spaces, for example. Even if it exists in the third world countries, it does not really affect to a large extent to the women who are being forced to stay at home because ideally they do not have access to feminist gateways, therefore that is happening to them. Their society is totally different. Please debate on a global stance."

One, women who do not feel like wearing lipsticks are actively told that they are not empowering themselves and the community. So particularly less feminine women, for example, when they bring up POIs about lesbian women for example, more liberal and neutral women or Marxist and radical feminists are told that they're not empowering the community. Secondly, you're seen as an active harm to the movement so you're an outcast. And thirdly, billboards advertise to you that you are not empowering enough. There is a buy-in reduction that comes after this because the goal of the feminist movement is to oppose and change patriarchal norms and this is directly contradicted. Therefore, you lack political potency. To this we hear a weird response. They tell you that there's going to, people are, more people in their side are going to push for maternity leaves and, I don't know, paid leaves for other reasons as well. We tell you that this is not exclusive. If you do a gut check of this statement, in both sides, feminists have reached to the parliament, for example. And in both sides, women are pushing for maternity leave. This debate was never supposed to be about 30% quota versus 50% quota. This debate instead happens on the way that the feminists are structured within these parliaments. So two harms result in comparing our cases. One, they are the only force that has the legitimacy to be able to influence these decisions, and therefore they take a softer stance when things such as you having to scrutinize laws against consumerists come up."

Patriarchy looks a lot thinner. Let's then talk about protecting women. So their main push here is that you galvanise these gender roles and that these gender roles are definitionally against the patriarchy. They give three reasons for this. The first is that this is rooted in things like the male gaze and that men are the ones who value things like wearing lipstick. A couple of responses here. Firstly, okay, maybe men once liked women wearing makeup and thought they looked pretty, but women now value wearing makeup and they like feeling pretty. They like walking out the door and knowing that they are projecting an image to the world that they want to project, that they feel confident in projecting, they feel comfortable in their skin doing so. So their claim really boils down to men valued women looking pretty first. And I don't think they would claim that the feminist movement should reject everything that men first valued, that the feminist movement should reject knives because men were hunters first and valued knives before women. Their claim just really doesn't make sense on a principled level. But secondly, and this deals with the second mechanism they give you on how these things are still controlled by men, redefinition carried out by the feminist movement is an active process. So yes, once lipstick was valued by men, but women can now say, here's how lipstick empowers me. And you get different narratives arising to the forefront of the feminist movement. So we're able to reclaim this control from men. And note that if it was true that these things like lipstick are still controlled by men, this is still going to be the case on their side insofar as they can't stop people from wearing makeup so what we do is we allow women's voice to dominate the conversation"

But secondly, if it is true that all people are being coerced into wearing lipstick and wearing makeup, we think that people at least feel better empowered when the feminist movement is telling them that you can wear your lipstick with pride and that you are a powerful woman when you wear lipstick and you're not just an insecure woman. The last thing I want to note, though, is that the most damaging thing for women is being deprived of choice. The reason why the male gaze is such a bad thing is because the male gaze originated from when men put women in pretty dresses and they gave them no way of opting out of that and they just looked at them and they just wanted to consume them like they were objects. Nepal has stuck in the past. Times have moved on. So there are three different scenarios that I want to go through to prove why choice is actually maximised on our side. Firstly, if I want to, for example, enter the STEM world, which is the push that we get at the end of their second speech and isn't really resurrected, and I can enter the STEM world because I live in a developed country, for example, I probably will do that when I decide of a house. There's both incentive and capacity. Secondly, if I can enter that world and I wanted to, but now I don't because of the shift to, because of the shift to, for example, saying that staying at home is okay, we think that's fine, because I'm able to access my preferences, I'm able to realize that maybe going into that corporate world wasn't the right thing for me. And actually staying at home is the right thing for me. And the third context is that at least like if i can't go into that stem world if i can't be a corporate lawyer and i want to at least i now feel more empowered when the feminist movement is willing to take me on board at least people are more likely to respect me the last thing they say then is that the feminist movement the feminist movement doesn't need to do this because these things are actually valued by society this is just largely untrue because as being a stay-at-home mother in today's context isn't free isn't isn't appreciated it's vilified by other women because it's women at the top of the corporate chain who say that i've jumped so many hoots you haven't i'm superior to you it's by men who get home after work and expect women to listen to them expect that they've had a tiring day that women have done nothing and that women who are just structurally inferior them. And even talking about their example of makeup, if you're wearing it, you're seen as insecure. We're far more likely to help women, but note also, we're far more likely to get men supporting the perception of women, because when men"

Yes? What do you think happens when there are no attempts women who want to go into these traditionally feminine roles and they don't get to do so on their side of the house because they feel locked out of the feminist movement because they have to make a choice between actually accessing their preferences and joining the feminist movement and all of the community that you want to claim on your side. Lastly, let's talk about buy-in because we told you we got more support. Firstly, because of the fact that there are women in the developing world who feel like the feminist movement is now for them. They say that you'll already feel the sense of solace. This isn't true because the feminist movement tells these women that you're inferior because you're a housewife. This is incredibly harmful for them. Solace comes and buy-in comes when the feminist movement tells these women that you can be a feminist too. We also told you about conservative countries where feminism is demonised, where feminism is seen as radical. We're likely to mitigate that perception and change it and bring people who were otherwise being locked out of the feminist movement into the movement in the first place. Even if you're unsure as to who gets more support, know that people are probably unlikely to be alienated from the development of the people they want to"

              "text": "Second, which side gets more support? They said that women are alienated in our world if they do not want to conform to these traditional expectations of femininity. First, we told you we do not have to judge these women's choices because we are not saying that we do not want women who do not step into these traditionally feminine roles to be empowered. Rather, this was a debate exclusively about how we approach these types of feminine roles. Do we redefine them as empowering or not? Do we accept what proposition tells us that they ought to be looked down upon? Or do we say that they are actually a legitimate choice? So we don't have to tell women who don't opt into this that they're doing something wrong. But second, we told you that if you have the desire and the capacity to step outside of these boxes, you're probably a feminist anyway, you're probably already relatively privileged, you're probably already making that free choice to yourself on either side of the house. By contrast, we told you this debate is about redefining these things as empowering. Note that we. So they have to accept telling women that it is not defined as empowering on their side of the house. They have to accept telling women that they are doing something wrong by the feminist movement, that they are not empowering themselves, that they are being bad feminists. But also just note how we gave you a feminist history lesson up and down the bench. We told you about how the comparative they have to stand behind in their world is second-wave feminism and that told women these choices were illegitimate. They never engaged with that. But look, even if you don't buy any of our other things, we think this clash wins us the debate because we prove a critical mass of women on our side. We think that gets actual better policy. But finally, which side gets better treatment for women? What did they say on this clash? Nothing. Panel, just check your intuition. Like if one team literally walks into a debate about the feminist movement with no positive claims on how this makes life better for women, I think that should be a pretty clear gut check that they're not winning this debate. But we gave you three clear paths to how this makes women's lives better. One, women are told that their choices are empowering. They are able to feel included. They are able to feel not like they're being shamed every day for being bad feminists. Second, because femininity is insignitized. So you can go into a female-dominated profession, you can be a housewife, you can ask your husband to help with the chores, and those things are not seen as weak. Those things are not seen as reprehensible and less worthy of respect in our society. And finally, know how they fail to engage with my argument, how we get better treatment of women, because this is about what the feminist movement chooses to prioritise, and it's only in our world that we get respect for these choices and therefore the feminist movement facilitating them. So because we actually make life better for the millions of women around the world who want to be housewives, who want to adhere to these expectations,"

Talking first about choice then, what was our substantive value within the context of this? We told you that the most important women within the context of this debate are women who do not have alternative safeties to fall back upon. So women who did not receive any validation from society, women who did not have any other support circles within external society, these are the women that we should care most about. We were happy to concede that even if this makes the movement radical to a certain degree, this radicalization is not a completely negative thing insofar as that these individuals who are benefited from the radicalization are the individuals who need to accrue these benefits the most, which is to make the larger point that if they get these benefits, we still make the world a better place at the end of the day. What did they then tell you? We told you that the people who conform to these traditional narratives already have society's support. There's two instances here. They try to argue on women who don't exist within liberal spaces. They tell you that women who exist in developed countries are most affected by this narrative. The problem with them making that claim is particularly and categorically that these women are unaffected by the narratives of feminism in the first place. My mother exists in a third world country. She speaks no English. She literally does not care what happens to the feminist movement. She does not care whether the movement calls her empowered or does not call her empowered because she doesn't care about the movement. She doesn't know what the movement is. The movement doesn't treat her. When the movement doesn't treat her, I don't necessarily see why the value calls or the judgment calls that the movement takes about her status as an individual is so crucially important because that is literally what the entire case has been contingent on. They are going to reach women in the developed world and they are going to call them empowered, solving their problems. We do not see the mechanism for how they end up reaching them."

Also, another crucial point out, if you already concede that somebody is empowered, there is way less of an incentive at that point in time to then work towards their empowerment. If you already think that wives and mothers are empowered, what is your incentive at that point in time to ensure better regulations for them, better maternity leaves for them? We create that incentive because we recognize that they are oppressed, they are not empowered, which is why we need to make them empowered, which is to make the larger point that we don't believe in arbitrary titles, we don't believe in giving them a title that doesn't belong to them. Rather, we believe in ensuring that we inst't believe in arbitrary titles, we don't believe in giving them a title that doesn't belong to them. Rather, we believe in ensuring that we can state the mechanisms to ensure that that title becomes accessible to them at some point of time in the future, which means that we are able to maximize change just because it is going to be easier for us to advocate under our ideology. Now, they try to wash away our entire principle on why ideological purity is important. However, this principle now becomes important under this clash of who maximizes change. The only point in time that you are able to maximize change is the point in time where you are able to ensure ideological purity. Why is this so necessarily important? Because when there is no ideological purity, the movement literally does not know what it stands for. When there is a lot of differentiation and radicalization within the movement literally does not know what it stands for. When there is a lot of differentiation and radicalization within the movement it is not a cohesive theoretical movement to follow. We think that at that point in time we end up losing a lot of arguments because we literally can't even agree implicitly within each other which is to make the larger point that if you care to make any sort of change if you care for any sort of utility and if you care for people who are actually affected by the movement, vote proposition."

              "text": "The need for solidarity within the feminist movement has expired, and what remains of it is but a mere veneer for the condemnation of the most vulnerable women by the upper echelon standard in society. Proposition is the style that stands for all women and for that reason we're so proud to propose. Before I forward two substantive arguments within this speech, onto our set of big things. Firstly, what does a world where the feminist movement promote the maximization of individuals look like? We think it is one where we prioritize things like choice feminism. So there are two main defining characteristics underneath this. One, individuals in every aspect of society are left to decide what is best for them. So for instance, when it comes to social interactions, we'd be perfectly fine with women weaponizing the patriarchy for their own benefit. Or when it comes to things like economic enfranchisement, we will also be fine with women cursing a job promotion, even if it comes at the expense of another woman. Secondly, there's respect for the individual choices that individuals make. So for example, when our political opinions divulge, that is acceptable, we don't need to condemn women for it. Secondly, what is the nature of the feminist movement in the status quo? Three things. One, I'd like to point out the feminist movement is experiencing an unprecedented level of power in the status quo as a result of all-time awareness regarding necessity for things like gender equality. But two, not that many of the things that are fundamental for basic living standards, for example, marriage equality and voting rights, have already been achieved in the status quo, so there isn't as much as a need for solidarity as opposition may point out. Lastly, the biggest hurdles that the feminist movement experiences now are no longer collective systems of oppression, but rather individualistic, and we only think it's under a paradigm where we empower individual empowerment, where that can be dealt with."

              "text": "Lastly, not that this debate isn't about the instances where what is good for the individual and the collective alliance, because on either side that would be symmetric. What we need to focus on is that when individual empowerment is perceived to come at the expense of solidarity, that is where the trade-off happens on the side of opposition. Two arguments can be reached. Firstly, a principle on how the maximization of individual empowerment best deals with the diverse circumstances of women, and secondly, why individual empowerment overcomes the hurdles to a success that women face. Only first argument, three parts. First of all, not that the patriarchy's enforcement of oppression is varying, so I'd just like to preface this argument by saying that gone are the days where all women are affected in the same way by coercive structures. Why is this the case? We think it's because the patriarchy's imposition of oppression is no longer universal but in fact it's subjective. To illustrate, for example, women who are conventionally attractive in the status quo are treated as sexual objects by men, but the same women who might not fit the norms of conventional beauty aren't able to enjoy things like pretty privilege. So what this shows is that social expectations have evolved to the point where oppression is individualised, and we think the best way to combat it is to allow individuals to pursue the avenues of empowerment that they deem are most suited for their circumstances. Secondly, we think solidarity on their side, as espoused by the feminist movement, merely extends the oppression that women face. Why is this the case? Well, in order for them to have things like collective solidarity, three things happen. Firstly, all women are presumed to have to operate on a collective in order to save individuals who might not know what is best for them. So what you do essentially is that you homogenise what is best for all women. So for example, a woman who chooses to don the hijab is considered to be oppressed, and individuals who might opt into things like sex work by her only fans are perceived to not want to do it. It's merely coercive. Why is this problematic? Secondly, they would institute policies that come at the expense of other women. So for example, the justification for banning things like the hijab is that it's anti-feminist and that all women are actually coerced into wearing it. The problem here that we want to highlight is that more often than not, the most privileged women who are often white and wealthy get to dictate what is best for all women because what is inherently tied to the notion of solidarity is that it entrenches a savior complex. Finally, in order to do things like maintain solidarity, there's a necessity to demonize any women who don't fit into what the collective ought to do. So you on the side of opposition want to push everyone into the same agenda in order to deter individuals who might want to opt out of it, need to do things like demonize any anomalies and that is seen exactly on the side of opposition when the movement does things like stigmatize sex workers by saying that they are coerced into it and they don't actually want to do it. It's extremely discriminatory towards them. Finally, not only the purpose of the feminist movement is to empower individuals, and insofar as the first two parts of the argument have proven that they cannot get that change that is tailored to the individual, their world actually fails women. What happens on our side when we do things that prioritize agency? One, individuals aren't shamed for pursuing things that divulge from what the collective ought to know. But secondly, because we think that individuals are the best arbiters at ascertaining what is the best form of empowerment for themselves, they are more likely going to access it on their side, compared to those when they have to compromise, and some women are inevitably going to get traded off on their side. But before I go on to the second argument, sure."

              "text": "On to the second argument explaining why individual empowerment overcomes the hurdle to a success that women face in the status quo. Firstly, I'd like to characterize the political status of the feminist movement in the status quo. So although it may be controversial to consider yourself a feminist, we have already amassed enough numbers in doing things like voting legislation into effect, garnering baseline protection for women. So what this shows is that any critical mass that opposition wants to talk about that is only achieved via solidarity is no longer necessary for the feminist movement. What we need to do instead is to combat how stereotypes that manifest on a case-by-case basis, which a narrative of solidarity uniquely cannot cater to, because you aren't focusing on the individual, you make all women focus on one thing. Secondly, look at all the labels that incapacitate women are actually combated under our narrative. And I'd like to highlight something here, which is that individual empowerment under a capitalistic system, which exists on both sides of the house, by the way, will always come at the expense of someone else because resources are zero-sum and someone will always have to lose out. So we don't care if the structure is contributing to stereotypes. What we uniquely prove is how our narrative can deal with these stereotypes, but they can't. How are women empowered on our side? Three things. One, when we don't shame women from prioritising individual upliftment, we think that is when they're more willing to accept things like job promotions, without feeling a sense of guilt that the feminist movement says that you have deprived another woman of that opportunity. Shame on you. But suddenly, traits associated with men no longer become exclusive to men only when women are also able to ascend to positions of power. So for example, a woman is no longer considered bossy. She can also be considered a leader when she is the CEO of a company. But thirdly, for those in the most vulnerable positions in society, what we tell these individuals is that the only obligation they owe is to them themselves and they don't need to sacrifice more in order to be considered a good feminist. What we tell these individuals is that the only obligation they owe is to them themselves and they don't need to sacrifice more in order to be considered a good feminist. Here is the comparative that opposition will have to defend. We think their rate of progress is actually far slower. Why? Three reasons. One, whenever a woman has the opportunity to ascend the corporate ladder on their side, the movement tells her she should wait because if she accepts this promotion, she deprives another woman of that opportunity. So certainly, on that, we think there's less ascension to power because resources are spent on attempting to uplift everyone and their inevitably rationed on their side. Lastly, in their best case, when there are women who land into powerful positions, you don't spotlight these individuals because their participation contributes to oppression. Finally, we think opposition forwards an extremely damaging perception of the movement, that we are all the same, we have to fight for the same thing, but we don't suffer from this because our narrative is one that's focused on how all individuals deserve the ability to individually empower themselves."

Two, rewarding giving back to feminism by glorifying activists like Malala Yousafzai. Three, telling people that they should never pursue individual development at the cost of other women. So I want to make something very clear. Our narrative does not tell women to only pursue success when other women would get it because that would be absolutely absurd right if you were to tell a woman that she cannot take a promotion even if she's been given it just because another woman can get it but what it does tell you is that you should not do so at the cost of solidarity so you should never undercut another woman to get a promotion you should never try to act hyper feminine and outdo your feminist sisters to be able to get that promotion it's quick rebuttal before argumentation.

Maybe some face more, maybe some face less, but it's the same patriarchal system that is creating those barriers, but two, even if those barriers are not the same, you need solidarity among women to change their barriers. I'm going to flip their claim. It is their side that cuts out sex workers and people who wear the hijab because there is no incentive for a white woman to feel solidarity with the people on the ground. And fundamentally, you as a person in privilege, when you do not cut across the aisle and recognize that that woman is your sister, have an incentive to buy into that privilege. White women who benefit from the stereotyping of black women as hyper-aggressive continue to reinforce that stereotype on their side of the house because it explicitly benefits them. Our side is more likely to support these people because it is about doing what is in all of your best interest. So doing things like improving the rights of sex workers is something that will happen on our side of the house because you have solidarity to do so. Their second argument is flawed."

It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of money, and in the case of affirmative action, it may take an opportunity away from you, which means that you just don't do it, which means you are unable to push the policy. Second mechanism, people are less likely to identify as feminist because it hurts them. I agree with Arjun when he says we live in patriarchal societies, but what does that mean for you when you identify as a feminist? If identifying as a feminist means you have less access to opportunities, their side would also say it is very likely, and women are likely to believe, that you shouldn't identify as a feminist openly in the instances where it makes your job prospects worse off because people think of you as worse off. So just less people buying into feminism. But three, it marginalises very vulnerable women because on their side they push the burden on individuals. To be considered a valid member of the feminist movement, you need to be successful. On our side, solidarity feels much more achievable because all you need to do is create a community. All you need to do is be a woman and be part of the movement and that is enough. Their side is vulnerable, even if this is not the narrative, it can easily be misrepresented to put pressure on an individual and alienate them from the movement. Second level of this argument, while even if they is not the narrative, it can easily be misrepresented to put pressure on an individual and alienate them from the movement. Second level of this argument, why even if they get by, it doesn't result in meaningful success. Two reasons. One, in a world where you focus on individual development, you are less likely to question the metrics of development in the pursuit of it. What does this mean? It looks like women in the workplace being so focused on climbing up the corporate ladder that they do so by things like playing up their appearance, playing into hyper feminine stereotypes without questioning whether or not that hurts the actions or hurts the needs of other women.

The problem then is that it is these women that become the face of the feminist movement. It is them that we are able to dictate inside policy and ignore issues like police brutality when they take up the vast majority of the talking time that the feminist movement gets. This flips their first argument of why they can care about minority issues. Why then is the counterfactual of solidarity good? One, the feminist movement doesn't just value individual success, but your ability to help other women. This shifts the conversation away from CEOs towards activists and away from girl boss culture. Two, women are less likely to be alienated. Having to do success on your own is fundamentally isolating. This is problematic because even when women are suffering the same amount as each other, their side is one that tells them you still have to compete and cannot confide in each other. It is our side that creates a feeling of community. That means women are less likely to leave the feminist movement when they fail. Three, women themselves feel more valued. Individual development is extremely difficult to access. Now when you are just a member, you are considered far more valuable. The importance of this argument is simple."

I want to note that individual success is extremely hard. Women have been structurally locked out of access to capital because of historical inheritance. They've been locked out of opportunities because of sexist hiring laws and they've been locked out of access to education. All of these are structural issues that you cannot fix individually on your own. Why then does PROC make it more difficult? One, to succeed in the workplace, you cannot rely on other women because they are your competitors. Your only alternative then is to buy into patriarchal norms, which creates a vicious cycle where if you have bought into patriarchal norms, you tell other women the only way they can succeed is by also buying into patriarchal norms and reinforcing the patriarchy. Two, it encourages complacency because you feel that just by being successful on your own as a CEO, you have done enough. On our side, even if you become a CEO, you are told that you have a duty to give back to the poorest of the poor.

              "text": "Secondly, on proposition, we encourage individual sympathy for women to think about the oppression that they are facing as if it were your own. It is thinking, believing that all women are just like you, prioritizing all of their suffering. And this is important because maximizing individuals' benefits means that you want all individuals to be able to reach that kind of individual growth as well. And we think we are then able to protect all women. In a world of diverse oppression, opposition forces the arbitration between subjective and different suffering. And that is where opt-out actually occurs. Because there is no obligation for anyone to identify as a feminist. But if you tell women that the claims to political strength exist, right? So let's say the cost of voting for a party at the expense of your own exists anyway, insofar as the cost symmetrically exists, the difference is about the messaging to push people who want to do that. So we tell individuals everybody is suffering and we make them recall their own visceral suffering to sympathize with somebody else. Our president tells you we don't care about your suffering because you need to care about somebody else instead and it is that messaging that pushes most women away from the movement. But moving then on to the concept of intersectionality, we tell you about the white savior complex, opposition says you perpetuate the patriarchy. We are going to weigh this in two ways based on their own analysis. Firstly, if they say that women are selfish, then they will believe that they themselves know best, which means that even in opposition's best case, even if the women end up helping other women, we say that because they do it from a lens of privilege, it is not an inherently beneficial thing for opposition to claim. So for instance, enforcing things like not wearing the hijab, or forcing women to go to work when they want to be stay-at-home mothers, these are all legitimate choices that women can take. I can self-actualize from being a mother just as I can from being a corporate woman, but it in fact exacerbates oppression and hampers autonomy of individuals when women are the one enforcing that onto other women. So even if they help, they don't use their own resources and that harms individuals. And I think it's actually quite offensive for opposition to say that all the developing nations are like vulnerable women, can't uplift themselves if there is no white woman standing there to help them. Surely they have their own resources, they have their own movement. But this is about the prioritization of those resources, and opposition doesn't allow you to do that because they enforce a liberal form of feminism onto women who don't want it. But secondly, even if they want to help individuals, we think that help only comes when you respect the individuals who need it. Opposition tells you that they already believe in the patriarchy. The women who want to be mothers, they're not real women. They've just been brainwashed by the patriarchy to want to be a mother. They don't actually want these things, but we think it's a legitimate choice for women to make, and we actually respect these decisions. Therefore, we get the best form of intersectionality on the other side of the house. Before I go on point,"

              "text": "On your side, you would say it is bad to sexualise women in all instances when it is empowering for some women to do that on our side. If it is true that there are certain women who are structurally more vulnerable, you need to prove to me why that instance and that solution is applicable to all women, the vulnerable women, the majority of women. We don't think that there's that kind of universal solution, which means that is why you must vote for proposition. But secondly, how does this lead into the purpose of the feminist movement? Two things as well. One, I think when we talk about the internal differences within different women in the movement, we need to know that a pretty woman who ends up succeeding is still a woman, and if they say there's a patriarchal society, then they are still a pretty woman who is being oppressed. Principally, we don't think that the movement should tell you and shame you for being successful just because you wanted to survive. In a society that necessitates your survival, if opposition characterization is true, and the patriarchy is so pervasive and so oppressive, it is still horrible for them to force a woman to give up the positions of power or to use them as battering rams for political success insofar as they are still suffering. Relatively, yes, they might be more privileged, but they are still suffering and the point of the movement isn't to instrumentalize members so that other people can succeed by virtue of the failures of the patriarchy. But secondly, for opposition to assign the success of a woman purely to their beauty is offensive because that just implies that absent pretty privilege, they cannot succeed. Our character education told you that in a meritocratic society, all capable individuals will likely advance and they will likely be successful. If the corporation wants to make more money, they will pick the person who can make them the most money, who will be the most meritocratic individual. Women will succeed on our side regardless of whether or not pretty privilege exists. The difference then is becomes whether or not we can use these women in positions of power to upend the stereotypes that opposition talks about, which means now it's no longer about structural change. It is about making sure that masculine traits or hyper-feminine traits no longer exist. On our side, there is no such thing as a masculine trait because all women who are competent are just women. They are not masculine women. They are not successful women. They are just women. And it is on our side of the house that we empower individual empowerment, not hyper-feminine traits, which opposition has still failed to characterize. But secondly then, on the damaging rhetoric on opposition, I think opposition tells you that there is something universally different about being a woman, that they have a unique obligation to each other by virtue of them being born with double X chromosomes. And that is harmful because insofar as opposition wants to talk about allyship, wants to talk about universality of the feminist movement, that can only happen when we say, feminism is about equality, feminism is about all individuals. Feminism is the most intersectional political movement there is. That is why we are anti-racism, we are anti-transphobic, we are anti-of-all xenophobia, because we respect all individuals as individuals, not by virtue of you being a woman. It is individual empowerment for individuals by virtue of you being an individual, not because you are a woman. An introvert's opposition has failed to respond to the characterization from first about how the most pressing issue for the feminist movement in the status quo isn't a universal system of oppression but rather an individualized one. Our side of the house will fulfill the burdens in a multiplicity of ways. For the most privileged individuals, for the most vulnerable individuals, and for all individuals the feminist movement must represent. Thank you. Sorry, can you wait? So, yeah. Do you think you can continue in this temperature? Yeah. No, I'm going to be fine. in this temperature? Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm absolutely fine. Please continue this. Yeah. Southeast Asia, that's right."

Perhaps because they realise that the vast majority of their material on choice feminism, on requiring different solutions to different problems, falls within the purview of the feminist movement on either side of the house. Given that building solidarity between women does not mean extinguishing their differences, but rather identifying the common threads and problems."

So let's respond to this claim first because it really is the most relevant part of their case. They say that there is a high barrier to participating in the feminist movement on our side of the house because you do not acknowledge sufficiently the suffering of each individual person within the movement. I want to question, firstly, why is this any more likely on their side of the house? Like, their conception of the feminist movement is just quite strange, because they seem to say that you have all the strength of numbers, that you have the critical mass, that you have the feminist movement and its legitimacy, but somehow the movement is atomized between different proportions and groups of individuals, simultaneously pursuing various different facets of sexism and different solutions. I do not think this is the likely characterization, particularly in a world in which you do not focus on solidarity among women and on individual development."

So if they really wanted to prioritize the struggles of the most vulnerable women, why do you give front centre to celebrity culture, to girl-boss feminism, that prioritises the women that make the Fortune 500 magazine, rather than the broad majority of women, perhaps not on an individual case-by-case basis, but as communities of people with common struggles to which they ought to respond. The second thing that I want to do is flip this argument. The ability to access a community is far greater on our side of the house and barriers to entering feminism are lower. Two reasons for this. First, as they point out, when the feminist movement focuses on individual development,"

It is only women who have advanced in their career, in their birthplace, that are able to become feminist icons and idols. It is only women that have achieved significant prominence and celebrity status that are seen as feminist idols and part of feminist iconography. So the zero-sum nature of capitalism bleeds into feminism when you focus on individual development. Comparatively, on our side of the house, when you focus on individual solidarity, each woman recognizes that they are a part of a greater goal, that they are part of a fabric of a feminist community, and that merely by being a member, by holding hands with their family sisters, that they are contributing to that sense of solidarity, which is the primary goal of the feminist movement."

              "text": "The second structural reason why access is more likely is because on our side of the house, solidarity is something that is internal to the feminist movement. So we get to control the narrative, we get to control the metrics. We can tell women when they are acting in solidarity with the movement, we can control, even if capitalism outside tries to make noise, we can tell women that they are valued members of the feminist movement, merely for their participation in it. On their side of the house, they learn the benevolence of the oppressive patriarchal norms. In the workplace, they often structurally exclude women even when they attempt to appease to patriarchal norms because they would rather hire men in the first place. So the number of women that are able to access the feminist movement is far greater on our side of the house as well. This argument takes them at their best. Even if participation is the metric by which we decide support, we think there is more support on our side. Moving on to the second part of this first clash. They say, and this is me again, taking them at their best in their first speech, that there are diverse ways in which sexism occurs, for example, high religious standards and pretty privilege. The first thing that I want to make, which is a very trivial observation, is that choice feminism is not exclusive to their side of the house. Presumably narratives of self-ownership and of individual empowerment are reasons for why women, even if they make different choices, can still unite on the basis that they have the right to make that choice and not men on their behalf. So regardless of whether you wear sexualised clothing or whether you wear conservative clothing, the ability to make that choice is something that all women can agree should exist and should be given to them. But let's take them at their best. Why do we think that there is a greater focus on superficial differences within the feminist movement? It is because in a world in which the feminist movement does not attempt to build solidarity between groups of women, these women view themselves as oppositional to one another and antagonism between these women increases. For example, women that don't conform to pretty privilege and high beauty standards now don't antagonize the men who are responsible for creating those beauty standards, but rather antagonize the women that are exploiting those beauty standards to undercut them in the workplace. This is because anti-feminists on their side of the house get to control how women form their communities when the feminist movement does not try to promote solidarity in any way at all. This is because in culturally conservative societies, women probably have an incentive to form some kind of community with other women, merely because humans are social creatures and because we have a desire for community. In a world in which it's not the feminist movement dictating what kinds of communities that should be, and when you don't unite on the basis of a common feminist struggle, it is far easier for conservative notions that you should identify not with women in general, but rather on the basis of culture, on the basis of race, on the basis of class become far more likely. So this ossifies women into independent groups in a way that cross-collaboration becomes more difficult. Rich women do not help poor women on their side of the house because they view themselves as part of a class first and a gender second. Before I move on, I'll take a point. So it's not that our case it dist district the feminist movement's political collectivization"

              "text": "suffering has a common cause. Your messaging is far more likely to be that your suffering is something that another woman is using to their benefit, which is the argument that we just made. So this responds to that point that there are diverse ways in which sexism occurs. On our side, we can more effectively externalise the blame onto men, because when all women are united, the common enemy becomes men, that set patriarchal standards like high-beauty norms. The second response that I want to make broadly to this claim is that you are more likely to question the basis of individual development on our side of the house. On their side, you're highly focused on the goal of individual development itself, by any means necessary. Maybe it means leaning into patriarchal norms like being bossy and assertive to get managerial positions, or leaning into hyper-sexualisation. But on our side of the house, women are far more likely to take pause. When they don't feel this intense need and desire to compete with other women, perhaps even the prettier women wonder whether they should be really, why they are forced to exploit their physical appearance in order to gain an edge in the workplace where men don't have to do so. So the feminist movement takes pause far more effectively on our side of the house. Briefly on this claim that you shame women for success exclusively on our side, the first thing that I want to point out is that as per their framing, in a capitalist society, on both sides, you will resent women who are successful. Why does this resentment decrease on our side? Firstly, in a world in which you promote solidarity, you feel that you contributed to the success of that woman. So you are far less likely to feel resentful even if you don't immediately get the promotion, because at least you are a part of the community. Secondly, you know that these women haven't resorted to nerdy tactics like leaning into patriarchal tropes to become successful. Deal briefly on which side has better opportunities for women. Three structural reasons as to why even if women enter positions of power, why they will not give back to the community. Firstly, they get into positions of power by leaning into patriarchal norms. When they know that other feminist women won't give them a leg up in the workplace, and the pressure is on them to individually develop, and that there is no solidarity, you lean into patriarchal norms to get the promotion, and you don't help other women, because you feel that doing so, and identifying as a feminist after you have made it to the top, risks your position. Secondly, even if there is some incentive to give back, there is no ceiling in capitalism to how far you can individually develop. Even the most successful women will become complacent and think, even if I just individually develop, if I don't give back to the community at all, when the feminist movement focuses on individual development, by individually developing alone, I am a feminist and that is sufficient, and never give back in the first place. For all of these reasons, sign the proposition. Thank you very much."

I want to note this is in major tension with their claim that women on our side would otherwise be greedy and selfish and would not have any way to extend these benefits to others. But there is no mechanization on their side for how exactly the movement uses this narrative to influence goodwill within other women, how you create the structures of giving back and redistribution, which is why actually at this junction and debate, they basically don't prove anything. It's just a critique for capitalism. They never prove why you overcome those degrees of capitalism. But what we do is we co-opt their characterization. If these women are selfish and greedy in all instances, that is precisely why when you allow them to expand upon their own incentives of self-development, their own incentives of self-interestedness, they are able to participate within the movement because their participation is no longer contingent upon solidarity that requires massive amounts of sacrifice.

They don't explain why you having a girl supports girl's narratives means elitism goes away. In fact, it compounds because you allow women to shape what it means to support other girls. What is the way in which their obligation extends on their side and we are immune from this because we no longer say one person has to sacrifice for another. And this also responds to their new argument of defaulting to metrics like race or class, which is contingent upon fractionalization, but we instead why when you no longer divide people into saying this is what you have to do, you don't get that levels of fractionalization, which is why we're able to better unite them on our side."

First on inclusive empowerment and secondly on social political change. First, on the inclusive empowerment, I think it's ironic that Sri Lanka tries to win on opt-in, because we explain that the major problem with feminism is that people are certain standards that they aren't able to meet, their oppression isn't universal, but it's different. And even if it all comes from the same source of patriarchy, it's about the way their lives are affected that necessitates a different response to these patriarchal scenarios, which is why more people can consider themselves feminist on our side. Because if their narrative is just saying, girls support girls without any trade-off, there's no impact on debate because you just say everyone should support each other no matter what they do, where they go. That doesn't seem very nuanced from their case, especially since they want to engineer certain social outcomes. If they want to engineer those positive outcomes, that means it's a direction you have to steer women towards and any deviation from that direction has to be demonized. You have to say, if you don't come protesting, you're a bad feminist. If you don't come alongside with our policy change, you're a bad feminist. Which is why their side necessitates a heavy demonization of women who want to pursue their own self interests. What do they respond to this with? They say two things. First, their response is not everyone has an equal capacity to get self-empowerment. One, this assumes that everyone has equal capacity to be in solidarity. They don't prove this. But a lot of women can't or don't want to self-sacrifice because it isn't aligned with their own preferences. But secondly, if precisely when the movement promotes individual empowerment, that they want to build a platform where they can be on equal footing. They want to build society to a point where eventually they have the equal capacity to empower themselves. To promoting choice feminism, to destigmatizing sex work so people feel more comfortable speaking up about abuses. To see only their true free choice in opting into OnlyFans. And here's the killer third response. Even if First Op is right and some women are poorer, our narrative doesn't depend on materialism. Because we are saying your circumstances are different. So even if you're still poorer on our side, what our narrative allows you to do is uplift yourself in that case. Because you're saying your autonomy doesn't matter how rich you are, you can still find solace in your family because our side is personalized, their side isn't. Second, their POI asks, isn't it better for women with pretty privilege to not exploit it but instead share it the problem on their side is the person with pretty privilege never even rises to power in the first place because their side preemptively shames them listen to their rhetoric all girl bosses are harmful we should never be able to have them so you never let them rise to power and let them be the icons that can create positive change so if that's what I want to say that we don't want people to be influenced by saying that this is how you break corporate culture, but instead you want them to fight against the corporate culture, but you never have someone being the spokesperson. You never have that loudspeaker in an influential position in society in the first place, which is what we say instead was more likely to be true."

Our side has a certainty of benefit for these women and should not be compromised. Even if the messaging is diverse on your side of the house, you still rely on women being"

That in areas where solidarity intersects with empowerment, they will engage in actions that are for solidarity. For example, protesting for abortion rights achieves both of these goals because you can be in control of your own uterus, but you're also giving back to society. So we frame advocacy on the basis of empowerment, not on the basis that you must always help women because it's necessary. It also empowers your own individual autonomy. So that's why advocacy still happens on our side. And this is a massive amount of cases because if you want to advocate for feminism, then in a lot of cases, you directly protesting is going to be good for you. But when it's bad for you, that's when opposition just turns a blind eye and says these women don't matter. On their side, it's when you have the feminist movement going against the hijab in places where Islam isn't the dominant religion, you tell them that you have to do this because it's feminist. So when it directly disaligns with what they consider to be empowering, they will force them to do that."

That's the deadlock on both sides, even if both sides get somehow hijacked by the rich. But in our third substantive, we challenge how effective opposition's form of solidarity truly is. On either side, women have diverse preferences and lived experiences. They don't get rid of these differences. They mainly tell women to disregard what could be a crucial part of their identity. That's precisely why Diya Sigh splits up the movement and creates in-fighting, where you don't get these women wanting to participate. Precisely why conservatives attack the movement for being homogenous. That you support bad women no matter what, because girls support girls in all instances.

              "text": "Panel, P3 asserts that we do not mechanise while emphasising solidarity means that women will not compete with each other at all costs. They just conveniently ignore all of the mechanization that we provided to women of one. When Aasrin talked about how the selection of leaders within the feminist movement on our side will now prioritize women who give back to the movement primarily instead of focusing on themselves and their own end goals. People like Malala being emphasized over girl boss CEOs that do nothing for other women. That was the mechanization that we provided. Let's look at their mechanization. Because P3 asserts that having a trailblazer is all that matters because doing that means that other women can go through, break the glass ceiling and achieve the same results themselves. It might surprise you to know that the first female state leader in the world was in Sri Lanka. So that was trailblazing. That was breaking glass ceilings. You know how many women we have in parliament right now? Less than 5%. The problem is, when you do not have women in solidarity, collectivising and supporting each other, what you do get is the most elite, the most rich, the most ethnically privileged women breaking those glass ceilings, getting to the top, enjoying those privileges and not helping anyone else at all. Capitalist systems exist symmetrically on either side. We agree with Malaysia. It is that that is exactly why on their side the women who make it to the top never ever help those who are left on the bottom grounds. It is our narrative of solidarity, the communities that you create, the acknowledging that you only reach the top because of women slaving away on the ground that helps or impairs those women at the top to help those on the ground as well. I want to note that their case is extremely unstrategic because the only way in which they can win is through this extremely narrow characterization of what solidarity looks like. They say that solidarity means that you extinguish all differences between women but they never explain why this is true. Like, solidarity doesn't mean uniformity. Solidarity just means that you acknowledge a bigger oppressive power harming all of you, i.e. the patriarchy, and that you should work together to combat it. That other women succeeding means a good thing for you and that you should work towards achieving those benefits as well. So we think that you fight against the patriarchy collectively and that is something good for you as well. P3, again, asserts that we have to support a norm of solidarity that means that you have to sacrifice your own well-being in order to benefit another woman. No, solidarity, the narrative of it on our side says that you should support other women because those women benefiting means that you benefit because those women rising up in power means that they enact policies that help you on the ground. That is the narrative. That is why women show up to protest on our side of the house. I'm willing to bite the bullet. Maybe we shame the women who climb up and do absolutely nothing to help the other women. Why do we care? We would suggest that women who are on the ground, vulnerable, and could be benefited by those women in positions of power should be shamed if they do nothing benefited by those women in positions of power should be shamed if they do nothing to help other women in vulnerable positions. The fact of the matter is, their case might work in Western liberal democracies. Maybe in the UK, women are best able, best placed to promote their own individual development. But in places like Sri Lanka, places like Malaysia, countries I would note are the majority in the world, but also have the majority of the women in the world, also deserve to be able to climb up the ladders to benefit from collective solidarity between women as well. So we would suggest that they need to debate this motion in the world in which women are the most vulnerable, the world in which women need collective action, not perfect Western liberal utopias. I'm going to talk"

              "text": "But like you pointed out, you can still be in solidarity with other women insofar as you don't actively cut out the chance of another woman succeeding. You can take the promotion. Look at what they're suggesting. They're saying that our feminist movement will tell women not to take a promotion if all the other women in the factory also can't simultaneously get a promotion? That's just not how the world works, Pranay. The feminist movement isn't going to tell them that. What they're going to say is that if you get the promotion, do something to help other women. If you're going to get the promotion, do it in a way that doesn't actively undercut the chances of another woman getting that promotion. First question then, which rules are better for the movement? They say, here's why women who succeed on our side contribute to other women far more on our counterfactual. The first thing we pointed out is that our narrative prioritizes and values women who give back to the movement as well and that's how you become a leader within the movement so to become influential within the feminist movement, we would suggest that these women have to do far more in terms of collective action to benefit other women and therefore can use their pulpits of power to speak out about feminist issues. Look at Ashin's unresponded mechanization about why women on their side who work within the patriarchal society without any semblance of solidarity actively dissociate from the feminist movement because calling themselves feminist actively hurts their chances of staying within that power and position of power as well. So why is it that they put women, even if they put women into managerial positions, that they're ever going to do anything else to help other women at all? Absolutely no analysis. But the second thing we pointed out is that when their women succeed and become part of the oppressive patriarchal structure, when poor women start criticizing those women for the oppressive conditions in which they have to work, for example, that creates a division within the feminist movement. And you know who's most likely to win within that division? Who's going to drown out the other part in discourse? It is like the first speaker says, white, rich women have the most power within the movement. It is on their side that those black, poor women have no way to speak out. Because their women, who succeed individually, are the leaders within the movement as well. So the ability for you to shut out vulnerable women who criticize you for being in a position of power and doing nothing to help is worse on their side, which means that for the most marginalized women, the majority of women I will note, they have no recourse on their side of the house. Here's the thing, because their side depends on the benevolence of women that they shoot to the stratosphere in terms of success to help others This is unlikely because I want to do something on probability Chanika points out that they leaned into patriarchal norms to get to the top in the first place Which means that they will likely perceive helping other women as something bad that would make them risk their own position Which is something that they don't want to do. Because if their case is true and they can achieve massive success, that is when you're also very unlikely to risk their success because you've achieved so much already. You feel like you don't have to help other women. I need to continue on with my life and being able to go up there. But here's the tie-breaker. We think that women, even if they wanted to take the risk, will not do so on their side of the house because they know that there is no safety net. If they fail and if they are fired from their job, there is no solidarity among women on the ground. So even if they are fired, there is no safety net. On our side, there is something along those lines, which means that women in top positions are more willing to take on risks to try and help other women as well. Some women benefit on either side. Here's the thing. They might have a deeper benefit for a small minority of women, but those are probably the most privileged women anyway. It is unclear why we should care about the rich white women who are probably going to do well in life anyway, being able to get one more promotion. What we defended was far more women benefit to a significant extent. When women get into mid-level management and do things like better HR policies, these are the changes that change people's lives that we were willing to stand for. So we win on getting better goals. But even if not, we have a range of mechanisms undisponded to as to why we have a stronger movement that is more likely to achieve those goals, a tie-breaking way for you to decide your ballot. First, Ashim pointed out that the pressure placed on women to succeed, on their side, on their own, is far higher, and therefore women are more likely to opt out of the movement. This is important because on our side, even if your life doesn't go perfectly, when you see other women succeeding, you can derive satisfaction from it because you think that you contributed to the other woman's success, which means that you are far more likely to stick out of the feminist movement, turn out to protest and ensure that policy gets passed that benefits women on the ground as well. The reality is, the feminist movement dies on their side. Because they buy into capitalist norms that pits women against each other, we think solidarity is far better. Thank you very much.
