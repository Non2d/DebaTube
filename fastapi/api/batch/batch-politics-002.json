These funds are typically awarded through a competitive application process.\n\n3-0 Japan Wins",

But before that two pieces on framing. Firstly, what does the implementation of this basic income policy look like? We think that this basically looks like providing less than the basic income and only the basic living expenses for these people. The implication of this is that there will be no irrational opt-in from actors who don't really want to pursue art. Because this is not a huge grant. We are providing them with the basic necessities that they need to keep on living. The people who will benefit from this policy are the people in the status quo who want to pursue art. But secondly, what is the definition of artist and who are the artists who will be funding? We think that there are two criteria. Firstly, that these people will basically have to have some, be making some sort of income from art. But secondly, that they have to be making art at some level of consistency. The implication of this is that this person who just made one song like 20 years ago and has not made any songs since is simply not going to be able to continuously get money from this policy."

              "text": "With that then, on to our first argument of increased accessibility on art. There are two layers to this argument. First layer, why under fellowship and grant programs in the status quo, not many people can access art in the first place. This is simply due to the fact that currently the art industry is very, very competitive, and you have to take down lots of competition in order to even get these grants in the first place, which are incredibly limited. You do not know who gets these grants, because, especially so, since in order to get a grant, you need to pass these application processes. What that means is that inherently, people who had access to money to go to art schools, who had money to access good paint brushes, good paint, who had money to be able to have the capacity to have time to even create these art pieces or create great art pieces to send to the application process. Only those rich and very privileged individuals can get access to these grants and fellowships on our side of the house. We think this is also extremely difficult for people to just balance the application process with other things like applying for your side jobs for example. So the implication of this is that poor people, especially those who need to do multiple jobs at the same time, are very very disadvantaged when it comes to applying for these applications because they cannot produce good enough quality art to be the people at the top. Note that there's also no guarantee, again, even if you as a poor person are able to get a grant the first time, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a grant the second time and the third time because it is so competitive. On that side, no thank you, we think that because of this, on that side, many people have to quit art in the first place because their paintings do not go through the application process and they're not even able to get out into the public sphere. We think that there are also people who pursue art because they're so passionate about art, but because they continue to pursue this, they are only depleting money from their pockets and going into the cycle of eternal poverty, not being able to get any money whatsoever. This looks like the people who create mangas in Japan. We think that there are many people who like to pursue mangas but simply cannot get enough income to sustain their basic necessities and they keep but and yet they still keep on going. On the comparative, on our side, under our policy, everyone is able to get money. Every single artist is able to get money. So on to later to them. What is the impact of this? The impact of this is twofold. Firstly, everyone who wants to pursue art can pursue art. And note that this is incredibly important, Josh, because the characterization of these artists are that these people inherently want to pursue art because you wouldn't be an artist if you didn't like doing art, right? So on that side, when we're actively taking away the opportunities to succeed, it's incredibly mentally harming and an inherent contradiction to that entire identity as an artist when we think that we are able to give them the opportunities that they deserve to be given on our side of the house. But secondly, we think that we also are able to give money to those who continue to pursue art. We think that on either side, due to passion, people will continue to pursue art. We think that we are uniquely able to give them the money and give them the basic necessities to be able to sustain themselves on our side of the house. Before I go into my second argument, what do you mean by accessing art? We think that accessing art is basically the ability for artists to be able to make profit from art, to be able to succeed from art, to be able to get self-sustainability from art."

              "text": "Second argument then, why fellowships hurt minorities disproportionately. There are three mechanisms of this. Firstly, we think that in this stage, the government and the people who grant these fellowships is an amalgamation from people from majority communities, right? These people have intrinsic biases that lean towards that majority community. For example, in Japan, that would be the very rich elitist at the top. But you think that secondly, the fact that there's no objective metric to decide whether one piece of art is good or bad means that people can very easily weaponize this lack of objectivity and discriminate against minority artists. This looks like, for example, in a very white-centric community, we think that if you can have a portrait of an Asian with a portrait of a white person, even if the skills and the art style that were used were the same, we think that the white person or the portrait of the white person is more likely to be granted access and to be granted fellowship. But thirdly, we think that even if the minorities are able to get through this application process, we think that they'll still cater to the majority perspective. We think that this is because they're dependent on the majority people for that funding. What that means is that when people want to make movies about rape victims, they will not really depict the full brutality of it, and will not really blame men for it, and we think that they will downplay this to a significant extent. This also looks like whitewashed paintings of racism that exist in the state's core, and can only get publicity under that brutal policy. The implication of this is that minorities cannot get runs, and even if they do, it's only for artists who downplay their social message. So what is the importance of this? The importance of this is twofold. Firstly, on principle, we think that this is principally wrong. We think that this is an inherently arbitrary way you are born, and what status you are born, so it is wrong for the state to actively endorse discrimination against certain groups of people. Just in the same way it is not good for the state to actively fund white schools over black schools or white schools over Latino schools. We think that it is simply wrong to take this policy or to further the continuation of this policy. This policy should be for all. But secondly, we think that minority art in and of itself is extremely important, especially for those minorities, because it is simply very liberating for them to be able to express their anger, to express their oppression. We think that at the point in which the state is not allowing them to do this, we think that we should take this policy that allows minorities to at least be able to self-express themselves and make an income from it. But lastly, we think that there are many societal implications of this. The fact that literary arts like the colour purple or music from artistic choice of art spread huge societal messages to the rest of society, we think that on that side, that is at the point in which you're not able to get the societal narratives out in the open. For all those reasons, proud to propose. Thank you."

When debate brings happiness to me, that's not why and that's not a reason that's why the government would give me money for me to be able to continue debating for the rest of my life. But secondly, they never proved to me why a market, a specific market being very limited and has a very high barrier of entry, the government should give money to those people to produce that. I think there's a lot of sectors in the economy, there's a lot of sectors in the workplace that are very limited and that have very high barriers of entry to the sources of art. And I don't think that the government should be able to give money to all of those people so they can actually enter those type of things in the market."

They are now giving money to all of those artists, independent if their art are good or if their art are bad. But secondly, our rule is about the artist's self. It is about the value that the art can aggregate to the role. Because it is our sign that with more selective process, people are actually able to analyze the art and actually understand if the art is able to produce some social impact to society. So let's understand why would that be affecting our side of the house, and who would be analyzing this art in our side of the house. We believe that our government and organization, why does this mean? When we talk about government, it's not the president who would be analyzing that. We're talking about colleges, universities, professionals inside the ministries of education, inside ministries of art, but we're also talking about independent organizations who also have an interest in producing art, in supporting those artists. We're talking about independent organizations funded by other people. All of that is who is funding the art on our side of the house, and all those people will be analyzing the quality of their art on their side of the house. It's very difficult for them to be able to claim that they will be able to analyze the quality of the art and the social impact that art has, because as the new infoslide says, they will be financing all artists in their side of the house."

They will be analyzing which project this is, how does this project look like, is it a theater, what is the social impact of that theater, how much money will it cost? All of those things will be analyzed in order to be able to analyze the quality of their life. So now let's understand about in our side of the house, we are actually able to generate more social impact. Why? We believe that art in our side of the house and the art that the government is putting should necessarily have a social impact. Because the money that the government is giving to the art is the money that comes from the people, comes from the thanks of the people, and the money that people are giving and the public, the general public, is giving to the government. Therefore, the money that the government allocates must generate some social impact to the general public as well. If their point is based on the fact that art is a passion of someone, and therefore someone is producing art at their house and is producing a paint in their house and is not generating any social impact, I don't see why the government in Australia should give money to that, since the government would not be taking money from the general population and giving it to a very specific thing, yes, except for POI. Behind the guise of social utility is governments weaponizing this word to limit the capacity for specific individuals and their anti-government views to remain proliferated into society. As I just explained, I explained to you why would that be effective. I don't think there's a president that is only doing that. We have a minister of education, we have a minister of art. But not only that, even if you try to portray that those are also used by the government or instrumentalized government propaganda, in our side of the house, as the info slide says, we're still talking about organizations. We're still talking about independent organizations. If a very rich independent organization decides to do a part in our set up the house, they will still be able to do so, and they will still be able to do so with a quality of art, because in our site is that where we have a selective process. So how is the social impact defined? The social impact is about the social impact that is able to generate on people. What are we talking about? We're talking about the emotional response that it has on people. We're talking about, for example, how people would think and how people would reflect upon that art. So therefore we're not finding any type of art. We're finding the type of art that is able to generate emotional response. We're finding the type of art that is able to generate real thinking and a broader thinking in people's lives. How are we actually having better quality of art in our set of thoughts?"

              "text": "Because first, know that art, and for you to be able to produce art, is expensive. Even when we talk about small art, the resources for you to paint is very expensive. The things that you need to paint, for example, something, are also very expensive. The testing, the studying, all of those things that you need are very expensive. But not only that, there are types of art that are intrinsically expensive. We're talking about theater. For you to be able to produce a play that's also very expensive, very expensive to do that plays, you need actors that will go a lot of money. When you talk about movie, that's also intrinsically expensive. So how in their side of the house are you actually taking away this quality? Because in their side of the house, since they're giving that money to more people, since they need to be able to allocate all artists and not specific projects, now they need to be able to give small amounts of money for each individual. Since they have more individuals and since they have more projects to be able to fund, the amount of money that those projects are receiving are smaller when compared to our side of the house, where we have a smaller amount of projects being funded and therefore also being able to give a bigger amount of money to each project. So what does this mean? What is the implication of that? Even though we have less projects, our process has more quality, because now people are able to actually study about art, are actually able to buy the best resources in the market, are actually able to test about the art, but secondly, they are able to produce a type of art that wouldn't be produced in their side of the house. And here we meet with their main stakeholder. Their main stakeholder, those four people that we talked about, those minorities, now they are also able to produce theater, movies. They're in their side of the house, they would never be able to produce because the amount of money that those people are giving, the amount of money that the government is giving, is way less because they needs to fund a whole amount of people. Therefore, what are the actual implications of our settlement house? We are able to not only fulfill the actual necessities of the government that they are having in their settlement house, because they never gave me reasons and now they have the money to pursue me, while the government specifically has a reason to give those people that money, but also we are proving to you how we are able to better produce quality of art and how also we are able to produce, how we are able to have those arts better"

This is not true. What we say we support is artists who have some amount of income from art, whether that be $10 a month or whether that be $100 a month. We don't believe that these artists are making all of their income off of this art. Obviously, they wouldn't need it in that case. We did not say this to clarify. But secondly, I also don't think that opposition has enough fiat to say that the standard by which all of these artworks will be judged is simply unsocial utility for two reasons. Number one, because oftentimes these art programs, as the Incluside specifies, are external to the government through things like organizations, which governments have very little purview over. And also secondly, that there are a lot of uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and governments have very little purview over, and also secondly, that there are a lot of uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and governments. Like yes, the Minister of Art does exist, but you also don't know what the Minister of Art thinks, and you cannot believe that the Minister of Art is always going to maximize social utility.

We don't know what they're talking about, we don't know what the mechanization is. On the flip, what we believe is oftentimes these artworks are chosen deliberately through the incentives of specific actors. If, for example, you are an actor that lead government, you're probably not going to want to proliferate messaging that goes against what your government stands for. Maybe that means that you don't want to promote things like female rights or LGBTQ rights because you're a conservative government. Maybe all that means is that you don't want to depict specific politicians in negative ways. But we do think that in any scenario there are going to be third party, other ulterior incentives other than social utility that mess with the catalyst. The problem and the unique reason why this is extremely harmful in opposition is because opposition allows for governments to do this, organizations to do this, under the guise of social utility. Because what these people can do is claim they're trying to maximize social utility while minimizing individuals who have opposing views. They can do this, and this is going to be incredibly harmful. But the second layer of response is to say that not only is this harmful in a general scale because the maximization of social utility isn't going to happen, but also that this is going to massively harm minorities specifically for two main reasons. Number one, because minorities are unable to create artworks that are probably going to be perceived as good, or as the info slide says, have mirrors in a lot of scenarios. Because as they, to somewhat correctly characterize, artwork to some extent does require a lot of training, and creating good artwork, or artwork that will be accepted by society and therefore create social utility, are going to have to be artworks that have a lot of resources put into it. The implication being that minorities are unable to access the scale of social utility that opposition wants to push, and therefore these vulnerable actors, who one of their only methods by which they can self-express is artwork, are limited. The reason why this is crucial is, just like I said, this is one of the only methods for their self-expression, because they cannot do things like vote in the government and have enough votes to create change for themselves. But ours can be sensationalized, ours can be picked up, ours can be displayed, and this can proliferate their messaging across a broader spectrum of individuals, doing things like a garden and sympathy for votes. The implication is minorities are better at voting. But the second reason why minorities are hot is as I said, there are going to be intrinsic biases that mess with the process, which means that the maximization of social utility is going to be the minimization of minorities. Before my third response, go ahead."

Maybe graffiti won't get any funding in our world, but a hell of a lot more things are going to get funding in our world in comparison to their world. Third and final response then. Social utility is a fluffy impact. It is an impact that is unfair. We do not know what type of social utility is created. We don't know what types of art they're making. We don't know what types of social utility they're creating in their world. We think that a far more important impact in this debate that isn't the second passion.

We tell you that art is a very competitive landscape, that individuals have to fight tooth and nail to make it in any sort of way, and that this is an unsustainable way to run this industry. On the flip end, what we can do is we can guarantee that these individuals have some amount of income so that they can continue to pursue their passions. There are two important impacts of this. Firstly, that these individuals can do what they want. Rather than, for example, having to do things like take on three part-time jobs, you can take on two and you spend the rest of the time doing your hard work. But also secondly, that leads to mass-scale poverty alleviation. But a lot of times these artists are in poor situations and they're unable to live by themselves. And for these individuals, we can alleviate their poverty. Now the outlandish opposition response you get in response about this is basically to say, well, governments shouldn't have to do this because this is the same in any other industry. There's two problems with this analysis. Number one, it is not the same in every other industry. R is actually uniquely competitive and uniquely cut-throat and only the top 1% of earners earn enough income to sustain themselves. R is more competitive than anything else. But secondly, we do think that this utility maximization of things like poverty alleviation, hard impacts that we can get in our world, is something that governments are prioritizing over unclear impacting like social utility.

Artists have some amount of employment, I don't think artists are getting enough money right now. Finally then, I want to, in my last 40 seconds, just deal with this, I just want to finally talk a little bit more about minorities because there was an important principle of the past that was unengaged in this argumentation. That is to say, the governments are discriminating minorities or disenfranchised individuals uniquely in all positions of the world under the disguise of social utility or in the disguise of merit. This is an unjustifiable way to run things. That even if all of these individuals have the most maximal altruistic incentives, and all they want to do is maximize social utility, all they want to do is create a better art history, that the fact that they have some amount of intrinsic biases that clash against that incentive is going to mean that they're going to have biased results. That even if everybody tries their absolute best, it is still going to be biased. The government cannot condone such injustices. This is a principle, and is an impact alone that is debate winning. I would stand for my vote."

Then I will be engaging our minorities, but also I will be bringing a second constructive on how we better the actual careers of the artists they so care about. But firstly, on access to art, notice that they say that art is important within the first speech because it makes you happy, because it's a form of expression. Notice how this isn't contingent on you having a living to produce art. You can still make art because it makes you happy on both sides of the house. We believe that people who enjoy drawing, people who enjoy singing or playing a guitar, people who enjoy writing can still do that on their side of the house, just as they can on our side of the house. That isn't the biggest delta on this debate. We're not stopping people from doing things that make them happy. But most importantly, we believe that access to the industry of art is important for the sake of making sure that things that are being published are of quality and that we have actual people who are capable of publishing things that aren't just the rich white majority who already have access and resources to enter these institutions in the first place. On side opposition, we're actually providing people a ticket to enter this industry because they're continuously locked of on their side of the house."

We believe that on our side of the house, you will have to submit a portfolio, meaning you show the process of your work, the kind of work you produce, how you study work. You're going to provide, at least, an analysis on the work you produce. You're going to provide proposals for what you want to produce your work about. And you might go through an interview with them. This means that the judgment is much more than just a simple loss and a bias. There's a literal amount of evaluation in regards to quality. Remember that these institutions aren't just political institutions, these are literal institutions filled with people who spend their entire lives studying and dedicating themselves to art because they think it's important and because they like analyzing it, they think it has depth. We don't think these people are going to immediately put their bias in the first place, and that they have the incentive and the capacity to care about the quality of it. Now, they see that these institutions have good biases, but notice that institutions aren't singular. You can compose an institution and not hold every single value it proposes. These processes, being so complex, have multiple individuals in each phase, which each have their own personal biases, which will be conducting thousands and thousands of interviews and processes. We don't believe that there is a single bias that is going to outrule them all. And even if I buy that, we still think that there are competing institutions with competing biases. We're going to have different arts being promoted from different places, like different galleries, museums, charities, etc. So we don't think that that's a big point of provision on our side of the house. Now, we much rather have art that is judged on depth and intention, on the level of skill of those artists, and the meaning, so that we can actually produce quality art. But most importantly, we think it is significantly more important to provide people with resources so that that art can actually see the light of day."

Their art almost was completely insignificant and forgotten, and didn't provoke any impact whatsoever because it wasn't published. On their side of the house, you're now providing people with enough resources to actually enter and break into the industry of art with what they're producing. You need significant amounts of money so that you can actually have trials and experiments and studies of a piece, so that you can experiment with different materials, different kinds of paint, different kinds of mediums, so that you can actually, for example, gain access to events where you can promote your own art, or so that you can have larger projects that involve significant more amounts of money, like film. We never need a scenario where art is actually expensive if you want to produce it in the long run. And if you're providing people with just the basic amount of money they need to survive, the poor people on their side aren't producing that art either. But most importantly, on our side of the rules, these people gain access to institutions, like galleries, like museums, but they can actually gain a career out of this because they're gaining connections, because their work, now that it's actually properly produced, can be sold to someone who is a private collector, or can be shown at the local theatre, because they can pay to do so."

              "text": "Now, in regards to minorities, they say that the richest and the most illegal are against them, because of their biases. I already explained why the point on biases isn't true, but notice how minorities contribute uniquely to art through the different forms of culture and experiences that they can contribute, through the different kinds of expression that they can represent, especially in countries with lots of minorities like Brazil. I think indigenous art is going to receive a lot of attention from the Brazilian government because the indigenous people and black people consist of a relatively large portion of the population and they have interest in promoting this. So I don't think that minorities are significantly harmed. But why do I believe art in their state is significantly less accessible? Notice that income from art is already generally hard to get without any form of a program because you still rely on large amounts of money and financial support to do so. On our side of the loss, you're actually providing people with amount enough money so that they can quit their job, so that they can focus on making their art, and dedicate all of their resources to creating projects that can provide them with a career in the long run. On your side of the house, you're providing people with such minimal amounts of money, tell me how the poor artist who is struggling to make a living is actually going to be able to produce art that helps him join a career in the industry in the first place. Second of all, notice that their criteria are also inaccessible. They say that it's not about making full income and dependence on art. But notice that in order to prove that you make some sort of money in art, it needs to be a substantial amount. So if you're selling your art on the streets, it's significantly harder for you to prove that you're getting income from selling your art on the streets because those people from lower backgrounds don't have access to the institutions that can provide them with proof of their income. Or for example, making art consistently. I think people who have jobs and other concerns, like they say, work in two to three different professions, are not going to produce art consistently, and are therefore also not going to pass. So we believe that the most vulnerable people don't exist on both sides of the house. The important thing is that we're actually providing them with careers and the capacity to produce art that is not only reaching the public, but is actually viable for their careers."

On their side of the house, they're gaining very little amounts of money that they can't actually produce anything worth. Now, this is our second construct of our careers. We believe that we can actually maintain people who are low income and enter the art industry in that industry on our side of the house. On their side of the house, they're going to be gaining minimum wage to make little to no money from their art or little to no access to this institution from their art, and they're not going to be able to produce it properly. On our side of the house, firstly, we have prestige and recognition from being able to pass this in the first place, after all, it's selected, and you're associated to institutions. Second of all, you have connections from these institutions. So for example, a gallery picks up my work, that gallery is necessarily more incentivized to keep buying my work or to keep selling my work in the long term, which guarantees me an income. Thirdly, we believe that you're also generally going to receive more money overall to produce better arts, which allows you to have a career because now you can produce art that is of higher quality and therefore get picked up even if you don't have all of those connections. Notice how this is significantly more important than what they bring me. Because when you have that small amount of people, but they can actually pursue their passion and dedicate all of their time to it, to not only produce a social good that is for everyone who goes to the theatre, who goes to museums, who frequents galleries, but more importantly that these people are going to, in the long term, be able to continue pursuing what is so important to them, which is art, which the government doesn't have to only support them for the rest of their lives. You support them for that one project, which propels them, and they can continue supporting more people. On our side of the house, you get better art for more people on the long term. On their side of the house, you're creating the false impression of accessibility. I'm highly proud to oppose."

They give us wholesome analysis and wholesome benefits that you can have once you get elected and you can get money from the organizations. They do not prove why you can actually get these selection process and you can get into the very first place. Our argument that we give you from Giroco explains why these individuals who oftentimes do not have connections to begin with are incapable of actually selecting the selection process to begin with. The reason being that in this art industry, there is a significant high competition in the status quo, which has meant that people who went to prestigious art schools are far far able to out-compete individuals from poor backgrounds. It has meant that you can actually, people with higher capacity and money to be able to create artwork in the first place has meant that you can out-compete others, and that a lot of the connections do matter in this debate, which has meant that they never proved the three requisites of this argument through first-leaf style to begin with. But secondly, let's say they've got their best. Let's say that you can actually get in, they never prove why you can continuously get in.

Our claim that we gave to the first was really simple, that if most artists are internally poor or are really struggling in the status quo, I think Seiji's POI proves this and they can see it when they say that most artists do become artists because they are passionate about it, not because they want to actually make money. Which is why the substantial number of people, most artists and animators in Japan in the status quo, are heavily struggling to make ends meet. Which is why I think their attempt to out frame argument and saying, oh poor artists do not exist is simply ungrounded in reality. When in reality a lot of the individuals are in fact making art but are still struggling to make ends meet. Given that, let's take their focus off this and eliminate all of this. The first thing they say is that welfare still exists. Notice here at all, the welfare exists in the status quo, and welfare does exist on both sides of the house. But still, in the status quo, there are a substantial number of artists that are moving paycheck to paycheck, which is why I think it would be better than life, but welfare is not enough.

But that is because there's a significantly smaller number of people who are debaters, and most people who are debaters don't sustain themselves with debating, right? Which is why this is simply not analogous. There are in this tax bill 10 million artists and quite a lot of them are living under poverty line. Which is why I think if there are analogous things, we are more than happy to do that. But even if we don't take that just independently, we are capable of actually saving the individuals within the artist industry. Which is why I think this is still our task to victory. Why is giving money to these artists actually important when in the round? I have three important ways of looking at this. One, money is oftentimes an objective benefit, and one objective benefit of this debate. Oftentimes you don't have epistemic access to what individual funds, but in capitalist society, you need money to do anything, to buy anything, for instance, which is why money is important. But secondly, money is the prerequisite in capitalist society. Anything requires you to have money to begin with, which is why money is important. But third of all, even if you have some sort of money, which I think we're going to come up here and talk about, I think that does not mean that you have money, like enough money all the time. No one knows when an economic shock will hit you, no one knows if you want to have children, or this might look like you're not being able to have a comfortable life, you're eating two meals instead of three meals for example, which is why having money is the biggest shield against the uncomfortable circumstances, which is why I think our claim in material well-being is significantly more important than any other claim put into the debate."

They are in the film industry and they are in like film making making protests like it's unclear why they are saying that these people are not artists on our side we at least give them the money which is why we significantly help the most vulnerable secondly on minorities what we tell you from like um so what we tell you from the local was extremely simple in the process of actually making decisions, I think there are internal biases, etc. Their claim is that, oh, we should fund something that generates social impact. But the premise of this is that the governments and organizations have the perfect capacity to actually assess which part has more social utility and which part has less utility. And our claim that we give you from P was indirectly, which was directly not responded to, was that the decision making calculus is fundamentally biased to begin with, and their response implicitly from second was to say there are a lot of processes and criteria, and judges and NGOs are in fact involved in the selection processes. But I think this immediately falls under the bait at a few key grounds. First, I think people have incentive to actually do reasonable dealing with it, because I think this immediately falls under the bait of a few key grounds. First, I think people have incentive to actually do like, resident living in the Midwest, because I think unfortunately we do live in a society where residents don't like to cram pens. It was simply an assertion for them to run away and say that there is no incentive for this actually functioning in the Midwest. I think there exists these kinds of incentives. And what we, an important nuance here that Hiroko gives you was that insofar as there's no clear criteria of what is the best part and what is not, it's lacking objectivity, which allows those people who have the incentive to spread racism to actually get away with it, which is an unresponsive characterization. So just having 10 people instead of one is not going to solve the structural problem of racism, which is why you don't let government or any experts actually decide what is good for them, especially when we're using the taxpayers' money. But second of all, even if racism explicitly does not exist, our claims that those things are implicitly ingrained in our mind and that people's decision-making capitalism, what is good power and what is not, is inherently flawed, which is why the art of things like gay men kissing is not going to be actually going to the public in so far as people implicitly have their biases with the gator. But third of all, I think lack of objectivity inherently creates a problem. Even if these are not explicit, I think our principle argument does stand within the debate."

Plus, I think one mechanism that Hiroko explains, which is directly not responded to, is that even if minority people can get in the selection process, they are unable to make a minority art insofar as they're getting funding from the government, and they need to please the government, or they need to please the majority, which means that they are going to create art that is good for the majority, not for the minority. So, two things then. One, we win, because this is principally unjust. It is principally wrong to simply only find white people, and not black people, in the process of, like, let's say, scholarship, right? We think this is principally illusory for the government to do this. But secondly, internally, we think when there's minority art, minority individuals can actually perceive and self-affirm that their art and their gender or their race is actually good. This is incontingent of social change. We think having minority art is in and of itself a good thing. For all those reasons, please, I can't take this debate. When you're there,"

The first thing that they establish is the model that says that people need to have some sort of income from art to actually participate in that kind of job. Why this is also a mid-tariff day or on case? Because a lot of art doesn't profit with art. We already explained how, firstly, art is extremely expensive. A lot of people, even if they like art, they aren't going to sell things and actually receive money for that. But mainly, why this is the most current in a contract or in their own case. Because what they say, a lot of people do this art not because they want to have income from that, not because they have financial prospects on that, but because they like art, because they are passionate about art. So we think that the majority of the population that they are trying to affect actually does art because they are passionate and don't sell this kind of art. So we don't believe that these kind of persons are having income with art. So we believe that if there are multiple passes, these kind of people aren't actually participating in their own program that they tried to create in this debate. So we believe that they are contributing to our system in the beginning. But second thing, they tried to paint in this debate that a lot of people, they are passionate about art, even if they have some kind of income, but we believe that this is true, but they have the burden to prove why, in this debate, governments should finance the passion of people. We believe that a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck in a variety of different professions, and a lot of people have different professions that they love, that they are passionate about, and governments aren't giving more money to them to exercise this kind of profession. We don't believe that just because someone is passionate about it, the government shouldn't say that. But even if we believe that it was true, why this kind of programs that governments financially guard actually exist? Because it gives a social impact to the population. It's not in society that you are giving money to artists to produce their own creatures. We are actually giving money to artists because they will actually give a return to society, and the money that these taxpayers give to the government to invest in this kind of problem, they are actually returning to them because we have a social impact on that. So what they tried, they had to win this debate, is that the kind of practice that they had in their side of the house is actually giving more social impact to the population than what we have in our side of the house. I'll engage with my second point in this debate about quality of art, how just we can have more social impact in our side of the house."

              "text": "But now, the two main classes of this debate. First on minorities and second, on polygraphic art. First, on minorities. We believe that, and we try to paint firstly, that a lot of people that are in the minority, they won't have the capacity to produce art and create all the distribution with art in our self-domination. Firstly, and to the selection process, we believe that first, art is not necessarily political. So if I produce art, it's not because some government is like from right or left, he's not allowing my art to actually impact this government. We believe that the majority of art actually isn't political. Second, we believe that the people that actually analyze this art is in fact the president of the country and actually one party of the country. We believe that there are a composition of a lot of people that are not the right to do that. And third, because governments, they have checks and balances also. We believe that the governments, they really do this kind of process. They actually need the best outcomes from this process. So, they are actually going to receive and to actually analyze the projects, that our generation's social roots and population, that our generation comes to the project that they are reading, and most of them, because if they select just bad things, we think that the part of the population that votes for them won't vote for them anymore. We believe that this government, they don't have the interest to vote for the person who is at the top. But more than that, why do we believe that even the minorities, even if they are from different groups, they still select the next top house? Because the process is not what we paint. We believe that it's not like you send an ad project that is expensive and the corporate likes it and they will sell it. We believe that's much more about the project. That's what the infillality is about. So if you have a good project, for example, having a theater and producing a theater, explaining how it would impact the population and what kind of resources you need to do that theater, these kind of things are passing hours and hours. But when they start to close, what they actually need to do to prove they are an artist is sending artists to the block room. So you believe that the only way that we can financially minorities have good projects, do good projects, and actually improve their capacities in art, have the income to do good art, and actually produce something that has such impact on society, is only in our side of the house, when we actually give them this money to do this kind of things. But more than that, they try to paint old, they suffered biases. Actually, they have a big burden to provide for example, what they tried to paint, only for example white work is selected. We don't believe that this is true and some reasons for that. First of all, the composition of the government. But second, we believe that art is one of the few sectors in the government that is much more progressive than other sectors in the government. We believe that when we are talking about art, we are actually being more progressive to the nature of art that is actually transforming society and giving new perspectives to people. So we believe that the people that are involved with art, even in the government or in the different organizations that are actually in our set of house, as the English language says, they are going to actually give an attitude to the people, not want to try to create their own southern house.

              "text": "have a better quality of art in our central house? First, we believe that the procession, the selection process is actually effective. I already explained how we have a lot of methods to be sold, and how Corbett's have actual incentives to decide the better quality of projects, and how they work, and how this selection process actually is about. But second, we believe that only in our central house, even if we have similar projects than quality in those central houses, the money to realize these kinds of good arts to give them to the population is much better than our central house, as we have fewer artists being selected. We give more money to them, the resources necessary to them to produce that art. So we just believe that even if they have good artists, good selectors, we believe that they wouldn't have the money to actually produce the arts that is necessary to give the social impact. So we can only ask ourselves how we can guarantee that. But how do you try to answer our principle that I talked about, how is not the data to govern the social issues? They have two main answers. Firstly, they say that art is much more comprehensive than any other sector in the society. This is simply not true. It's not to say that women artists are not equal to black people or other women in the financial sector. I just want to point out that we are not trying to say that women in art is not difficult to do, like most of the women in the financial sector. I just think that you are wrong trying to engage with other women. But second, in that art is actually accessible. We are having a role where internet and AI say, I'm actually helping people to produce art. We are in a role where people actually can really evaluate different types of art. And we believe that in their scenario where people are actually passionate about art, even if they don't have a lot of money to be sold, they can actually produce art for themselves. We don't believe that this is incestuous. So we believe that art is expensive to produce very good things to help society, but it's not expensive to do normal things that we're passionate about. But second, the way that we try to answer is that arts are also poor, and governments should help them as they do. We do welfare policies. First, we believe that no thesis is totally true if they are not the answer of the bill. I stated that if they were poor, they are going to be helped by these welfare policies. What you say is, oh, but they aren't that poor, they are actually having a good job and they do art that should complement them. If they aren't that poor, I don't believe that governments should spend their money to make these people that are rejected rich and to receive more. However, there are a lot of people that are actually struggling with poverty and hunger, and they don't receive this kind of money because government has a limited amount of resources. So we don't believe that government should have the duty to just finish the passion of people that are just coming for the options. So you believe that the principle that happened in the Narcissus House, but it is not the duty of the government to have that in the Narcissus House, is to end the lithium-ion. And you believe that there are continuing minorities, and actually, flip it to our Narcissus House, because just in our Narcissus House, these minorities, they actually have the capacity to produce a good high if they are interested in the projects, because only Narcissus House has the resources to do so. And secondly, about the quality of the price, believe that just as high quality of art in the US because of the selection process and because there are a lot of films that are used by artists that produce that, and so we give much more social impact to the population that are actually the most important. So, we are proud to be here."

The only reason you get for artists not being poor on opposition is their existing welfare assistance which you get in POI.

The important nuance, therefore, of artists being poor in opposition is not just that they are poor, but that they are unable to do things like access alternative measures, which my first introduction mentions. As DLO concedes to my POI, it is deceptively alluring. People become incredibly passionate about art. People develop things like sunk cost policies where they've invested too much, and art is an untransferable skill. The implication then is that individuals are unable to opt out, or individuals are stuck in a lack of earning that exists in our opposition. Comparatively then, are these artists better in our world? Opposition will have you believe, too many protested why artists are not better in our world. Opposition, firstly, will have you believe that poor people are unable to pass in our world.

The impacts on opposition are incredibly fluffy. Let's talk about minorities here, and every important response opposition gives. Opposition wants you to believe a lot of things, like this insane idea that art isn't political, though an actual important responses you get from op are truthful. They firstly have you believe that governments are diverse and have checks and balances against minorities. Across the bench we tell you two things. One, not all countries have it. They can't just debate in the most progressive democracies, they have to exist in the spectrum of the context. It is true that in many countries the top of the ladder are individuals who are old, rich and white. It is true that in a lot of countries the top of the ladder are individuals who believe that women rich, and white. It is true that in a lot of countries, the top of the ladder are individuals who believe that women have no place in society. But secondly, that there is implicit biases that cannot be tackled, even if the governmental system in and of itself is perfect. Humans are nothing, no matter how many cumulative individuals you have, they still, for example, buy into the majority. Opposition then has to believe that there's a lot of backlash when minorities get in, but often it's more implicit than that, minorities having significantly smaller chances of getting in, it is incredibly hard to call out. It is a matter of statistics, and a statistic that never gets published. The implication of all of this is that the argument of bias is that this is principally wrong because it is arbitrary where you are, whether you are a minority or not. This is analogously only funding white individuals and disregarding black individuals. I think that this argument is maximally important and the principal metric we take this debate. Thank you."

              "text": "Moving on to the first part of my mention, as to why inter-trafficking to a religion of alt-ism is immediately harmful. The thesis of which we'll admit is that strength secularism is essential to ensure a biased political discourse and equal access to public services. There are two layers to this argument. First layer, then, is why strength secularism is necessary to eliminate the intertwining of original politics. No major. We think anything apart from it results in heavy intertwining of original politics. This is due to three reasons. One, politicians have massive political incentive to capture these votes. And note here that not only open voters, religious supporters still identify with politicians' support because they are the most loyal voters. For instance, today, about 25% of the US do identify themselves with evangelicals, and most of them back Donald Trump in the 2016 election and took the scales in his favor. Two, religious organizations have vote-based incentive to pass change-loving government. We want a first-ever policy, and both been extended with the capacity to lobby government. We want a first-ever policy, and they also have lots of capital to lobby. They acquire funding from foundations, from their followers, and use it to hire lobbyists to form broad-minded campaigns. This looks like NNE, No Me Too, National Association of Evangelicals, Lobbying and Abortion, or the United States Congress of Catholic Bishops, lobbying in Indonesia. Three, The line as to what violence and separation of church and state is inherently unfair. Just consider the U.S. president, placing an ad on the Bible during an inauguration. Justice is endorsed Christianity, or is it a merit ceremonial? Or is it supposed to eat moral and liberal life that anger? Is it promoting Christianity? The implication of this is that the blurred boundary between politics and religion makes it extremely difficult for justice systems to step in. For example, Japanese ministers were accused of holding ceremonies at religious tentacles, but courts have not fully guessed that. Thus, what some think is deemed acceptable is sent to the president, and over time, slowly memorizes the more and more extreme forms of non-secularized political involvement. Thus, strict secularism is necessary because it is only when you bend all forms of religious polling expression that parents lose the power to demand for vital citizens' schools, that religious groups are barred from lobbying, and that religion protests are met. Over time, discourse around secularism will fade away on our side. It will be normalized to not talk about religion and not bring up religion as a polling, which further encompasses the incentive of politicians to pass discriminatory religious policies."

              "text": "On to the second link. What are the impacts of this dysfunctional secularism? The impact of this is twofold. First, it restricts people's capacity to go to public space. When religion and other faiths which is called sex for education get tangled up, it creates a enormous model. This is because the state gives more political and financial support to these religions. This looks like Christians lobbying for LGBTQ plus folks to be banned from school. This looks like gay people being barred from accessing public services in LGBTQ plus regions in Poland. And this is harmful on two levels. A, on a practical level, certain people are barred from the vital public services of just schools and hospitals. Obviously, these are incredibly important people and you cannot live without them. When they are not welcome in these places, they feel like their identity is not valued by the state on a daily basis. On the principle, public spaces are funded by tax money, which is 100% given by all citizens. Therefore, principally, everyone ought to have an equal right to use the benefit from these spaces. I'm studying the impact of world politics. It's prompted two points. entanglement between politics and religion erodes political discourse and compromise. This is because when political parties are implied to register, it significantly surpasses and compromises the issues. This looks like Christians longing for no sex education at all and being unwilling to accept atheist demands to reduce their restrictions. B. Restrictions, related to the extremities, all being empowered by the office sector as well. This is because the title groups organizations that lobby for this are not moderately influenced people. For instance, the risk-holders, such as Christians, who wouldn't even go crazy to church on Sundays, wouldn't go out lobbying government. However, hard-liners, which is even helpful, who tend to have an extreme view in the world, would go and push their policies, such edge, lifting restrictions on page speed, especially in the context of English speech. All of this harms vulnerable people, especially those who find your name in the news. These policies could pass the government, as these followers of the Bible, the Ephesians, and evangelicals perform significant and humiliating policies, strict step by step to prevent the more severe forms of income. And before I move on to a second argument, I'll leave it to you. I think you were just expressing the right feeling about the census. Before I move on to the second argument, I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question."

              "text": "The thesis of this argument is that I reduce tensions which harm minority religions by reducing quality of existence bills. I'll do the first one. As to why a better absence of public space necessarily creates a piece of tight contention between religions. First of all, it's important to note the context of this debate. As I pointed out from my intro, the status quo of the world is my own truth, my own view, and my fear. This shows that religions have a hard time focusing at all the times when quo of the world, my own recent writing, is in a theater. This shows that religions have a hard time focusing at all the times the minority which is feel-pushed aside by the majority in society. In this debate, opposition will lie to you that religion in the current world can coexist from a reason. We tell you that as and always will not work. Coursework for reasons. One, exposure to different visions of the public fuels people's antagonism against minority religions. Religions often have a contrarian view of their ideas and put those in the question of pain. Seeing public Muslim festivals celebrate a new public is a constant reminder of how much the opponents disagree with their religion. Every time you see them, you feel like you are being invaded by these new religions. All you can see is that there is a limit. This won't happen because you will see an event that will call that here to come. 2. The concept of religious freedom in public allows people to attack other religions. The line between faiths which are confined to religious discretion is extremely blurry and individuals have been splintered against other religions. Women who mislook like Christians, going around to the cross-country saying that our country is a Christian country, you can fist at anyone, so you can block their line of rights. Comparatively, people cannot weaponize religion and politics. Three, politicians with a massive incentive to weaponize a negative sentiment against minority religion, whether in all favor, as that often turns different books. It's the same politician calling all Muslims quote-unquote Islamic radicals to instigate fear, or in the worst case, to incentivize the destruction of the Reds, a similar example from Mao. Comparatively, politicians cannot talk about are weaponized religion. Fourth and lastly, minorities feel neglected as society disproportionately favors men-contrary religion. This is because everywhere you go, you see Christian symbols. From the lens of the Muslim, you feel your belief is not represented enough. Consequently, minorities are not shown in the face with the majority and the dissimilar. Our impact of this is very simple. Minorities, the minxies, are able to walk down the street every day like any normal person. For all these reasons, we are very proud of the police."

Okay, why is this untrue? Firstly, we think just because you ban the popular religious expression does not mean that these incentives these people have, that the fact that these people want these policies to want to have the change-based policies in place will still want that, but now they're not able to publicly express this. What does that mean? Now they feel actively threatened. They feel like big ads also tell us that they're going to be the most radical group of people. But this means that now they feel they're being suppressed by the majority, they're being suffered by the state, which means they're likely to be even more anti-independent. What this means is now they're not going to be able to publicly rally, so they're probably going to do these things in hidden places or under the, without the state's control because now the state has no ability to monitor them because it's not being done professionally. What this also means is if these people want these narratives to be in place in the first place, they can still rally for these things under other terms. Like if you want abortion to be banned because of religious reasons, you can still push back on the narratives of the whole life instead of just not saying because of religion.

Well, this means that these minorities will still know that the majority thinks they're not of the same pedestal, and they'll still feel under 90 even if they're not being shot down on the face by this majority of the things. We'll tell you in our case, why majority of the faces like me, and we still become a part of culture, and remain their separate, and secondarily, why these minor faces who have their only act of self-defense, by being able to guarantee their fair view across the world, and they'll get through these harsh times, now do not get that, because the act of you take away that's our own self-defense."

They are a beautiful step give you most of it, and I think most of it is probably look like a ban on wearing hijab or a blue cap, but like, we take one from wearing a cloth or not having a statewide religious culture and generally we can maintain a culture, religion, and a public sphere. In most of the cases, like, a public is a Jewish minority. And you start with, how many is toddler? I think it's like four or six. Four to six. . . . . . . . Okay, are we ready? Okay, starting in 3, 2, and 1. It most likely looks like more extreme forms of practices that some European countries like France are already doing, right? But that is not their second point of setup. How is the imposition of strict states and norms and rules to be done in the first place? In a biased manner, majority of these Western liberal democracies have a long-standing Christian heritage, which is largely seen as their culture back home. These structures will continue to cherish this heritage and its symbols. They are so integrated into the daily lives of these people that these countries would recognize them as merely religious symbols but also as a cultural symbol as they do even in the Christmas. So what will happen is that the balance will be in position because your shanty will be expressed all the time in the veil of culture while other religious expressions will fall under the gluten and gain smash. For example, Christmas is a large part of the cultures of these nations and while most likely continue to be celebrated grandly in public spheres, hence these symbols will most likely still be displayed in public. It is only religious minorities whose ability to express their religion will need to be sacrificed. But secondarily, public servants like teachers, government officials, etc. will enforce these policies and their subjective discretion policies. This is like a French teacher, Jacksonizing a girl because her story goes too long and similar to a book club. This means there is no uniform application of this policy due to the very little permission of these policy-based people because they are so unfamiliar and the lack of exposure to these practices in the first place. See even normal things often appear as unlawful because they just don't know enough about it. But see, the punishment of a violation for this policy can exist on a wide spectrum, including the imposition of bad device. In prison and at times, it may be even beating up innocent individuals. Probably, it has to prove why even risking confrontation and injuring people to defend this policy of theirs is more than legitimate"

This argument doesn't seem the best case of proposition because even if we think and actually enforce that policy uniformly for all religions, it all comes to be done if we can prove it as a direct violation of people's freedom of expression. This religion, which is crucially tied tied to their identity is being attacked. The minister is going as a part of the sum of identity now. It can be temporarily given up because the same way you cannot fundamentally ask a trans person to have to temporarily identify with their birth gender, really because others are offended by or disagree with their identity, right? Why is the assertion of position in the public sphere a critical part of their identity? It inhibits their moral beliefs. It influences their actions in both public and private spheres. It really is a crucial way to access peace and solace for these people. People's religion is an act of selfishness and the act of sort of going to hell for those who really need it. People fulfill their religious duty by being able to express it in the public in their first place. How does straight-state terrorism then violate religious identity? Because firstly, many of the industries that are able to express religion in belief that a way is meaningful to you, they will mostly look at things as an imperative for a firm to be able to work out any type of rejection of that freedom or denial of that ability to practice their religion. But when you can practice your faith in a way that is deemed right by people, you feel like a sinner. These practices are able to... These practices are being... Key math is provided by religion, and we think it's essential to follow this. But additionally, also he's told that hypocrisy of Western liberal democracy is a matter which prides itself on the so-called bastions of freedom and choice. The conclusion of this argument then is one's religious identity cannot just be separated into private and public life. Proposition is committing an egregious moral violation.

              "text": "Firstly, what does the implementation of strict state secularism look like? Opposition tries to come up here and say that strict state secularism will only be applied to minorities. Well, we say that this is simply not true for a couple of reasons. Firstly, please read the motion and the motion's application. We are basically supporting very strict state psychosocial, something that applies to all people living in the state, which includes vans for all religious symbols, including both Christian cross and Muslim head scarves. So the opposition cannot just come up here and say that this will only be applied to workers and jobs. If a Christian cross is used as a religious advocacy, we will obviously still ban it. If parents come to the school board trying to get Christian beliefs into the public curriculum, we will still ban it. And most importantly, if there is lobbying, obviously we will ban it. But secondly, we think that the premise of that entire argument is wrong. They try to say that people just don't have enough knowledge about religions and religious faiths and religious public displays in order to be able to restrict these Muslims from holding these Christians equally in the class space. But I think this is simply not true. The fundamental tenets of religion, the clothing, the accessories, the practices, are largely known by everyone. Everyone knows that the Christian cross is a symbol of Christianity in the same way that everyone knows that hijabs are part of Muslim faith. We don't think that anything stupid like black fanny boots and bells and long dresses will happen. But if that is an expression of religion, we think that yes, we do have a justification to ban it. But lastly, we say, so what? Even if the lines are blurry, we think that we are at least able to apply this policy to the vast majority of things that are generally viewed upon as religious. We are still able to ban the most obvious forms of religious and cultist ways. Sure, Christmas might not be banned, but at least on our side, we can prevent people from using religious classes to get across very, very anti-Muslim rhetoric. We think that the most extreme forms of extremist violence will still be prohibited on our side if those reforms are clear. No thank you. So they can't just point at helping in cross-stabbing us as a whole, they won't. But that doesn't engage with the class of our argument. With that, the implication of all of this is that strict secularism will be applied to an equal extent. But secondly, on religious freedom, no one can guarantee it like us."

              "text": "The opposition tries to come up here and say that public faith and public display of your faith are very important to your expression of religion. We think that this is untrue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we think that the people's conception, or religious people's conception of normalcy can change over time, because once this policy is enacted, once strength in secularism is enacted, every single micro aspect of your life changes. There are no more theology courses in college, no more religious protests, and leave around you cannot state your faith openly. So once you continue this for a couple of years, you get used to this life, simply because society as a whole does not assign religion in public any collective significance. We think that this looks like, for example, after the genocide that happened in Rwanda, the present mass citizens are expressing their ethnicity publicly, and now people are just confined with that, they are willingly expressing their religious freedom under the veil of their private faith. So the implication of this is that when states implement strict state secularism, this is not compassionate because people will adapt willingly to this religion. So it is not a compression of religious freedom if people are going to adapt and express their religious freedom willingly. But secondly, we say that the degree to which public display of faith matters is incredibly limited. For most people who practice religion, the ultimate goal of practicing faith is forming a personal connection with God. The humongous moments of elevation and emotional salvation for religious people come from praying to God and getting salvation from God, which happens through prayer, right? So although we do see that public displays of faith and proselytization may hold some meaning, we do not think that this is the most important consideration for these religions. On the other hand, you can still do a majority of meaningful private things. For example, you can still pray by Thursday and enjoy your communication with God. The implication of this is that you do not feel like you are being betrayed by the state because you will adapt to it and it's not an important freedom that you're giving up. But lastly, we think that the choice to exercise religion in the public is less important when compared to the choice to exercise other things. So this choice of freedom and religious freedom is not absolute. Because religions are contradictory in nature, your right to form religion in public greatly offends and harms the other religions. We think that the state is justifying to limit certain rights of expression when there is a bad party calm. We see this in masks of hate speech. We see this in brands of graffiti. Because although you are expressing yourself, you are telling others that that is not just. At the point of which we proved the economy of Mexico by our explicit back-plotting bombs."

Firstly, they said that even if there is separation, people still practice that we're in hidden places. What we think is that that's exactly why we want to take this motion, right? We don't want Christians to come out of their community and post their religious bands on LGBTQ plus people. We think that that is a good. But secondly, we try to tell us that Christian people can still vote through other means, and through passing off abortion as proclive. But we think that even if we can't conceive that we cannot change abortion, we can still change a multitude of things on our side. So I told you from our last speaker that maybe these policies become less absolutist, because at the point of which you're not assigning your political views with your religion, there's more space for compromise because it's not a clash of identity. Secondly, even if you can still vote for abortion policies through other means, we think that there's still many other huge benefits, such as being able to ban lobbying, such as being able to ban people from getting out of that cross and protesting outside Muslim mosques and making people feel very uncomfortable. We think that this is a benefit that does not exist on their side."

We think that he likes people on that side who want to even interact with Muslim people in the black space. We need to get rid of these public displays of expression.

When you allow different forms of voices to come in, you allow checks and balances to be announced to make sure religious individuals aren't dehumanized and demonized by politicians who have every incentive to do so. This form of check and balances makes sure these individuals can continue to have a magnified life. First then, on the principle. We've given you every single layer of analysis. So why is it morally legitimate? We've given you layers of P.O.I.s. Why? And you ask me this. Would you allow a gay individual to not stay still in their private life involving in the yet-weirder response? No, pardon. This is an extremely semantic thought. The way through which religious individuals express and empower themselves is through being a part of religion. It's through expressing themselves in public and it's through feeling like their God is with them no matter where they go. The moment you die, these individuals are barred from doing so. They feel dehumanized and there's a level of innate human being where you feel like you're less than everyone else around you. Where you feel like your ability to express yourself is for some reason barred by a scheme even though you did nothing wrong. You get to hear any responses to why this is problematic. The reason why all of this is important and it matters within the religion is because the ability to express yourself is the way through which you inform your identity. We believe this debate exists for every single person whose religion, but also for religious minorities as well. No parallel. He said individuals who have left everything in their country behind. He said people who have come to these countries for the sake of immigration because they have had no other choice. The only identity that they are often able to bring with them is their own religion. If they are stripped away from this on their side of the world, we are making it feel that you can't express yourself because the state tells you that you are somehow harmful. Really, this is father-publishing by individuals. When individuals are able to frame you under claims of how you are evil and that's where the government directly bans you. It's part of our virtue in state speech. And this is important. Even if in public spaces it doesn't happen, either forms of aggression don't disappear. If you're born under the name of your name, everyone knows you're a Muslim. Within these communities, it's not that you automatically don't face harms anymore. You will continue to do so. The only thing that then changes is your ability to express yourself in public. Unless they show to you yourself in public, unless they are able to show you why in private spaces you won't be decriminalized, though unlike the Proms, they have tried to keep you from their cases. But at the end of the day, the principle continues to stand. Unless they are able to prove what its egregious forms of fun are somehow justified, we believe they automatically cannot be the same. Secondary. On secondary, the inclusive increases the secular culture. No matter. Under the mainstream, governments can continue to fund these forms of religious groups. They can fund churches and they can fund Muslims. Which is why we have popes who directly go up and generally they think this is fine to be homosexual because you can still end up going to heaven. The reason for why this exists is because religions have been immediately centred to become a path to overtax. However, when you directly mar the community with access on their side, these individuals are left to only cater to the most extremist forms of groups because they want to hold on to them and make sure these people never leave these groups to begin with. Or this is look back, it means you going up to your other church individuals and telling you that look, if you leave these communities, you're not fulfilling your holy duties. These forms of extremist narratives would often turn other people off and they do not have an incentive to do so. But here, this is the only way through which they can hold on to the small amounts of groups which can continue to support them. The problem with this, then, is how it increases the very level of extremism that they talk about. The next thing about this is, and this is the second here, religious ideologies and political ideologies fall under very small grounds. What this means is you can frame a lot of interesting, underpinnings of political ideologies fall under very small grounds. What this means is you can frame a lot of these things under claims of political ideologies as well. Emotion may be religious in nature, but at the end of the day, it can still be framed under the theme of true life. At the end of it all, what this means is politicians, due to having angry levels of religious individuals who want and feel more things because of feeling that you've been marginalized by the state, now vote for these groups that they themselves want to harm against. This means the very perpetual forms of harms and aggression of minority repercussions of making sure your religion doesn't become unsafe for others and the very burdens they themselves feel at the very beginning of their speech. The reason why then all this matters is because when seclusion increases, the ability for minorities to come into power automatically falls as well. People have in-groups that are built into them. People feel like different religions are different and should remain within their own obligated abilites. Muslims fear going out of their power because they feel like the state does not recognize them, which creates more internal groups, reduces the ability for groups to simply interact and grow together with each other, and it reduces the ability for them to then come into possession of power and believe in mistakes as well. Now, it is illegitimate to say that religion is harmful. It brings you peace, it brings you solace, and therefore, to say that religious individuals do not deserve to express themselves is a monogamy, which is..."

              "text": "majorities will define religion as selectively biased and faulty, under the veil of the century. And I like this awkward position right now, because if you look at this motion clarification, the motion clarification does indeed tell you that you are going to be banned a lot of the obvious forms of things, regardless of what culture or religion it is. Look at it, I will quote, a person wearing a cross necklace, or a sick turban, or hijab in the public, all of these are going to be simply banned and are sent on the halls in the public, which has meant that it's on their knee what they are pushing for in the city. And I do agree that it has a core motion, you don't have to simply defend your right to communication, but the motion's definition does tell us that we have to defend the world, and I think the role that they accuse us of defending is not a role of supreme state capitalism, which is why it simply cannot get swayed by the right wing, which is why our impoverished leaders stand for right. which is why we simply cannot get swayed by your rhetoric, which is why our in-public leaders tell you from the first stand already. We tell you that if a Christian cross is used for religious advocacy in the public, we will ban it. If parents oppose the schoolwork in corporate religion and education, we will ban it. And quite obviously, if politicians, foreign religious organizations, coordinate schools, we will also punish them. And if you cannot punish these people, this is not a secular thing, which is why I think our case stands at this point already. Secondly, let's talk about your claim on how the new case put people internally in the private. This immediately told them that they could take rounds. First, it's what they've done less than the R-side of the House. But if it's true that Rosen's one money, do you think that they would not be as excluded because they would no longer be able to follow the path of the public in our side of the house. And notice here, remember, panel, that the religions cannot depend on the current followers all the time, which means that they have to gain new followers, which means that they cannot become excluded in our side of the house. But secondly, it is actually only on our side of the house that it can effectively crack down on them. So when we have the first-rate scouts like Riddham, we have the capacity to police religion because we are the only side that can punish these that are religion-displaced for not being like these leader-coaches for instance. All of this is brutal, is a nowhere. The governments are so pro-religious freedom, and a lot of religious organizations are actually able to block government all in the name of religious freedom. And therefore, at the point of the state, they can see that religion has some sort of origin of exploitation, that is to say, that it's simply worthless on their side without their health. Here's the way, though, two pieces of the way. One, even if it gets more exploitative, there's a limited use of the word health exploitative in that case, because it's uncritical and how much it would use their popular law. So second of all, I think that if it gets exploitative, even if that's the case, at least it's more difficult to join religion apart than it does to all, which means that in the long run, there's less people exploiting a religion for the first place, which is why your path between law and school religion, expulsion, is gone. First of all, what do you put out? Your mind. If it does get more exploitative and more people time-hardened, then most people who are born into this world are not forced to go online and start it. Because the religion has no incentive to be available, because it's no longer publicly exposed and cannot gather followers in that way. How do you deal with that? Sure, but I just said that it cannot be exploitative, it can get forces on their kind of house, so their way is against their family's house. I'm not going to say that I'm not a Catholic. Firstly, let's talk about rights. Two things I want to note here. Firstly, you not being able to wear a hijab is not analogous to you not being able to be a Muslim woman, right? It is simply being mean for all of the Jewish state. If they cannot wear it, they don't feel empowered. Especially, we told you from the Sirocco speech as to what the inherent purpose of God is not to simply actually give posters to people in the public, rather it is to individually let, like, present for God to talk to pastors give posters to people in public, rather it is to individually elect, like, present for God to talk to pastors, which is why in Buddhism in Japan, a lot of the people are actually going to mount into individually elected God. I think that religious conception can impact change. But second of all, I think that the long-term train has meant the normalization of new conceptions of religion are in fact going to be adopted on our side of the house. Because imagine, guys, this motion gives us this magical view that in Western liberal democracies, strict state factors is going to be adopted. What does this mean? UK, US, France, a lot of old-time countries, big countries are going to adopt this policy. They're not religious, like pastors, for instance, and preachers have the incentive to gain new followers. They have the incentive to actually interpret this religion in a new subjective way, which is why the world was announced as going to help religion-neurotic teachings can't keep standing at this point already. The implication here is simple. The reason why it responds to your claim that it is freedom to talk about your religion is that it is not the state oppressing you. When the state acts in a lawful way, people willingly make a choice not to bear the job committed to the forest as their own choice, which is why I think they pursue other things. But even if that's not true, the unfortunate reality of the religion is that there are some coercion in religion that exists in the past. So it's true that many people want to get a job on their own, right? But it is also true that most people don't mean to opt in to religion if they are born into it. And two, the choice to opt out of religion is not a realistic choice when God tells you that your religion is the eternal way of salvation, and when your parents and your families actually adopt your religion, which has meant that there are also some people who are versed into actually wearing hijab or actually wearing hijab in the public, which has meant that all the way, those beautiful, like, choice can adapt, but on their side of the house, those people who are vers worst into wearing it is going to be eternal. Which is why the forms are asymmetric, but those vulnerable people are going to need to be part of their side of the house. But, even if we lose on the right, there's too many better things. Why? What if practical farms, to be frank, I know this is kind of counterintuitive, but we did prove to you why very few people are actually going to give you some sort of practical farm. We can talk about the second part, but we're in minorities. And in the same way, we don't allow people to just go to the leaders of the patient, where we actually, not even thinking about it, but we think that practical farms can outweigh the microlithics that are bluff away from the identity status of the wealthy in the US. Secondly, on those harm principles, we tell you from your book that this advice significantly harms other people, which is why Linus Wright did not sign a new plea for full-ranging. Let's talk about the limits and handlements. There are pieces that are emotionally symmetric, but I think there are a lot of political issues in their reference. One of these is that in Poland, Congress sees religious employment as a dog-piguracy, and LGBTQ freedom in the public. This is basically barring away from those public speeches, these are the harms that will not exist on our side of the house. Then we see, oh, the other one may exist, sure, but that doesn't respond to their impact, right? All of our impacts that we outlined here from first, about how individuals cannot simply go to college, or how things like education are the worst thing on their side of the house, is still of obvious magnitude. On practical way, one, this impacts everyone within the public space. Think about how Darwinism is like, the reject to science in the US Oklahoma. Literally 10 commandments were actually mandated to trust everyone. But secondly, public spaces is a day, like something that affects your daily life. But on principle, public spaces actually create on tax money, which is why I think this has to be accessible to every single person. Finally, let's talk about why it's really their business that they wouldn't be burdened by harm if you go to contact with them. The problem is that they assume that when you contact with them, you will get along. They miss the nuance two things. One, you can also contact with them on R7 and R well. It's just that they're not wearing the hijab, right? But secondly, note that religion is contradictory. Who is God? What is a good believer? Those things are contradictory, which means that when you're talking for them, you are more likely to identify them as a threat to your religion, which is why you can't place verses on their side of the house. So on our side of the house, Muslims and Christians are going to sit in the same classroom and talk together harmoniously. But on their side of the house, when they simply talk about religion, when they simply put up religious symbols, that is an ablution to argue the disproportionate and hard minorities on their side of the house. This is why I think we are winning on my youth as well. Finally, when they speech laws, they ask and always will not work. Because of blurriness, does note how uninputed and moving back what this analogy is, this is not ripping in a sad scope, which is why we have to take a small seat."

Thirdly, which world protects the most vulnerable? But before that, I have two clarifications. Firstly, the main debate about how we vowed to only go against Binoils, that's literally not what we tell you. We tell you that this is likely to happen against all these religions. But the moment in time it happens, in Western liberal democracies, because Christianity is so integrated into the culture, which looks like the Christians being celebrated everywhere because it's their important culture because if they're in this car, because of all of these reasons, it's highly that even if you do banners, if you stay in regard to culture, which is exactly why it's unlikely to work, there's another wrong. Secondly, we tell you that on their side of the road, all their beliefs look like religion is bad, it's just that case, fine. If religion is so bad, why don't we vanish into public spaces? Why don't we be there?"

              "text": "Moving on to my first question, which world better protect the fundamental rights of individuals? They come here and tell you that people's principal right to go outside is barred because now religious people lobby politicians. I have three responses to this. Firstly, understand that this literally cannot be taken away in the first place. Why? Because these governments need these individuals to give their votes. Which is why they will literally not wire them from most democracy spaces. Or on second, these are Western liberal democracies which care about the international reputation which comes from media houses, right? The more time you are lacking in these religious organizations on a national large scale, you will have backlash no matter what. Secondly, they claim that we do not bring the motion, but I wish they did that, because their claim of WLBs having this is literally flawed. WLBs, by constitution constitution literally cannot side with religious organizations to such an extent that they are lobbied to the great extent that it cannot be. Thirdly, even if we take another best-case scenario, even if this principle stands, it still takes away individuals' autonomy. The one thing that matters the most to individuals is human dignity. What do we tell you then? First thing, we tell you that competition's world snatches away your most fundamental right for religious orientation. They attempt to do some evil rebuffles to it, but why does it fail? Because, first thing, their only rebuffle that comes here is that with science, you come to normalcy. Firstly, you never come to normalcy. Religion has been integrated into your identity and into who you are from the very beginning, literally from your birth. All you have known about yourself, all of it, is a part of that religion. No matter how much time passes by, even if you're on your deathbed, you will never come to the market scene. But secondly, even if you take the matter-of-the-space scenario, even if that happens, you still lose your autonomy, which is the most important thing in this debate. Because understand that this principle stands no matter what utility they can show you. Because I, as a human being, my dignity matters the most. My autonomy matters the most. Whether or not I can stay within my religion, I can show my religion to the world, whether I can fulfill my religion is something that I hear about the most. But why is this extremely important in that panel? Understand that religion changes people on an individual level, right? It gives them solace and hope that they need on their darkest of nights. It ensures that it acts as a self-defense mechanism against the afterlife and against hell. But most importantly, it protects you from individuals because your identity is not flawed anymore."

The moment in time we bring their case down, which literally revolves around the idea that now, they are going to have policing in their side of the world. But why does this not stand? Because now, wheelchair is directly doubled down in their side of the world. Why is this so? Because of two reasons. Firstly, because on their side of the world, you literally don't know what's going on in regards to these wheelchairs. Because all of these happen through a closed door. You don't know which extreme group has come up. You don't know what these politicians are doing. Because you literally cannot let them talk in public. There is no check and balance mechanism to ensure that they are true. But on a secondary scale, understand that now on their side of the cross, preachers do not get to bring people back to religion. What is it that they do then? They ensure that the limited amount of people that they have, they double down on these people. How do they do so? They tell them that you are in danger, that you need to protect your identity, which is why they are likely to become even more radical. Why is this bad? Because it leads to even more political tensions within these WLPs, which ensures that these people are acting hard on their side of the world."

I have five responses to this. Firstly, understand that no, minorities are not sage. They are oppressed even further. Why is this so? Because the only form of identity, solace, for these minorities is their religion. Understand this panel, no matter how much discrimination you face as a minority within these WLBs, you still choose to stay within this religion because you actively care about this religion. The moment in time they bar these individuals from literally expressing their faith, that's exactly when they feel even more oppressed. On the secondary level of balance, even in their best-in-scenario, they do say to these minorities, to a certain extent, that comes at the cost of the autonomy of these minorities. Even then, these minorities, even according to them, are the most vulnerable individuals, understand more than they can to take away another layer of vulnerability from them, which is their own economy, you make that even worse. The more time they talk about polarities that exist, understand that polarity is even harder on their side of the world. This is because majority now have communal sentiment to only cater to themselves. We talked about the us and them, us versus them mentality which is why they double down on minorities. What do we tell them then? us versus them mentality, which is why they doubled down on minorities. What do we tell them then? We tell them that on their side of the world, these religious organizations, which cater to the most vulnerable of individuals, are likely to downsize. Why is this bad? Because these are the religious institutions which cater to people within rural areas, who will never be catered to by governments. We tell them that these individuals are the most vulnerable. These individuals are the white who are likely to be orphans, who are likely to have free education or free food. These religious institutions are the ones who literally build the infrastructure against the plurality of gay men from the funding that they get. Because we tell you why we protect the most vulnerable individuals, why we protect their rights, why we protect"

And you still have an ability to opt out of other religions into something else, so we're not sure where this gets. So if their importance is the only medical value in the bank, then we're all going to get every single thing we're forced to do, like getting an education by getting a job, right? Has it made sense? What did we give you? A principle on people's identity being actively taken away and how it's specifically invocative of these Western people that want this to do so, because they think that they're the fat bearers of so-called human rights and freedom of expression. But doing this is an inherited problematic involvement space, because that is where you cannot control how much time you spend. That is where you need protection the most. They never assume all of that. The fact that the state literally has control over everything and now the state is taking away my right to what faith I want to believe in, what clothes I want to wear. That doesn't help you from that now. But what we did in the second round was an increase of radicalism. We tell you how. They keep saying these examples from Chetan's talk of how salt is a driven drive and the food is being delivered. They never state it for its outlaw, which means yes it happens in our world because exposure exists. This does not happen in their world because the moment you cannot expose religion, you can no longer get these forms of exposure, which is why they look at the incentive to belch them, because people who see the way they put the status quo, which means our points of them being radical and holding the front line to the people who are already in the religion, and them being those vulnerable ones, still stand in this debate. The fact that they never respond to our argument on principle, the fact that they are okay with the active right of these people, the most vulnerable people, these immigrants, these people who want to simply live in their faith and want to wear something of the form of supplements, stand with this debate, while simply the principle that they were unable to take it on and how they are okay with this inherent form of harm, we win this debate on a very fair margin, to all of the people that are still in the polls."

We think that the religious entanglement with politics is the most important issue in this debate. Just as we get to pass these, religious entanglement with politics harms everyone. Just notice how in the meeting of the state, Matt aided everyone to teach creationism and to teach the Ten Commandments regardless of what religion they were. So basically, these kinds of policies hurt every single person on the ground regardless of whether you're religious or not. But secondly, we say that religions entangled with politics is most important because it's the most certain impact in today's debate. When strict secularism is implemented, it will substantially lower the ability of politicians to entangle with religion. Because we've told you stuff like public funding, they can't get money from lobbyists anymore. Parents literally cannot go to school boards and request the curriculum to be changed. We think that this is the most impactful impact in this debate. But lastly, we think that the right to religion is not absolute. We restrict the right to freedom of expression all over the time. We think that this looks like, you know, just limiting like, vandalism, limiting like, hate speech, limiting all these forms of expression. Insofar as the right to freedom and the right to religion is not absolute, we have to weigh this below the state responsibility to provide accessibility and accessible public spaces for everyone that is based on everyone's tax money. But lastly, on minorities. We think that we are required to host a host of reasons from our backspeaker that the reason why minorities are being discriminated is because the majority of people feel threatened by more minorities when they see these black, when they see these kids' jobs. That people feel threatened because politicians fan the claims of anti-Islamic sentiment. We think that, uniquely on our side, this is not possible, which is why on our side everyone can sit together, everyone can coexist in a school, at their workplace,"

This includes railways, bridges, and seaports to make two passages that give China infrastructure projects throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. This includes railways, bridges and seaports to make passages that give China direct access to 70 nations. Along the historic Silk Road, as a part of Xi Jinping's grand strategy, what are the key characteristics of this? It is financed through billions in debt that is not conditional on economic or political reform. Debt that is funneled through Chinese state banks and China-run AIIB, making it subject to purely and exclusively Chinese oversight. These construction projects are also exclusively run by Chinese state-run firms with Chinese workers. If a loan is not repaid, China will forgive a part of the debt in exchange for ownership of the infrastructure like we saw in Sri Lanka. What is the context of this debate? Over the last five years, China could have gone down two roads. They could have worked with existing systems of development using their increased influence in the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the BRICS Bank to strengthen the systems of collaborative lending, or they could have gone at it alone where the terms are dictated by their self-interest. We regret that China didn't take the first road and took the latter road. It's not that we think China is malicious, but that they are self-interested. And it makes sense for them to go do what gives them the most soft power. But this debate is about whether we, as the recipients of these projects and the world community, think that they have created a net harm. We say yes."

Two, the Belt and Road Initiative is the road to upsetting the international power, balance of power. And third, the BRI is the road to entrenching in liberal regimes. First, why is the BRI the road to economic harm for its recipient nations? These projects are funded through loans. Given how projects are run by Chinese corporations with Chinese workers, nations should have already been cautious about the debt. But the BRI targets small and economically vulnerable nations that are unable to reject Chinese loans when it comes to mounting pressure. They fear that non-participation will cause that the trade deals that China will have will be something that they lose out of trade deals that China will have will be something that they lose out of, and that they will lose these generous Chinese aid. So when Beijing comes knocking on Mongolia's door and threatens to end their cooperation on tuberculosis in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Mongolia isn't really begging for the bridges that get built in their nation. When these nations take this step, default is the most likely reality. Why? Because the speciality of Chinese loans is that they don't require economic reform. So the governments take on loans, but don't rein in on spending and then struggle to repay them. Their infrastructure, set up under the BRI, also does not pay for itself, because they are often white elephants, vanity projects of leaders that duplicate existing infrastructure. That's why when Prime Minister Rajapaksa builds a second Sri Lankan ad board, which he names after himself with the money from the BRI, he saddles the country with debt and the world's emptiest ad board. What are the consequences of this default? China could graciously forgive this debt and so generously take over the infrastructure but that means they have control over ports, roads and airports."

We've seen debt defaults in developed nations like Greece fracturing the spirit of the people and leaving people who aren't employed. Imagine this in Kenya. Crucially, default in the wake of an unfinished project is devastating to other countries in the BRI. You can't build a road from China to Egypt if Kenya in the middle defaults. That's why this would invalidate anyone's investment because when one nation defaults, it puts the entire project at the risk of default. In the comparison, the alternative is borrowing from multilateral institutions like the Asian Development Bank, Br the comparison, the alternative is borrowing from multilateral institutions like the Asian Development Bank, BRICS Bank or the African Development Bank. Sure, China might have inflated the total amount of debt, but all debt is in good debt. What does multilateral debt look like instead? No one country has exclusive power. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa each have the same equal share of 20% in the BRICS Bank. In the Asia Development Bank, the US and Japan account for 15% while China, India, Canada and Korea have the rest. Maritime lenders each want their money back and use their power to check each other. So even if independently they are self-invested, together they can't design a system that cedes monopoly over infrastructure to one country. So default is mutual loss in such an investment for the investor and the host nation. So in each of them asking for their money back and holding these nations accountable, they lend with sustainable preconditions."

The unifying factor of the BRI is not that nations are linked with each other, but overwhelmingly linked with China. We regret that. The BRI uniquely empowers the Chinese global hegemony. If the projects are successful, it entrenches their military. The corridors are designed to allow Chinese troops to mobilize at the borders of any nation and scare them into submission. But remember, the project passes through territory that is undisputedly disputed, especially border areas like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that passes through Indian territory that's claimed by India. When China is already incursing on this region, it's unacceptable. It allows them to force smaller countries into trade deals. When the giant that you owe a billion dollars to says, you can't join that trade deal, better join this treated area, that's a choice that vulnerable nations can't make. Further, like we explained, the deliberate plan is to allow default and takeover infrastructure. In such a world, China has unprecedented influence over global trade and over Western nations. Because if China controls major trade routes and hubs, controls Pakistan, Sri Lanka and South Africa's hubs, then Nigeria, America, India, all of these regions are economically hurt at the point which they can hold that port as leverage and say we will not allow you to access this. The BRI crowds out regional powers and regional cooperation. We see this when Philippines was pushing for ASEAN multilateralism but then had to cede into the BRI. Now, all without the BRI, the US, China and regional superpowers check each other. China has a trillions in US debt, participates in the BRICS Bank and is committed to the UN 2030 agenda and other in their speeches in the World Economic Forum and even checked the US and international organizations when they took over the Paris Accords. Conventionally, the US has a naval fleet in the Southeast Asian region and has military deals with Japan and South Korea.

              "text": "Before that, three points of rebuttal. Firstly, they tell us this is financed off of risky loans and oftentimes is unwilling to benefit these other countries. Three responses. Firstly, sure, maybe some of these loans are not assessed to be perfect in impeccable risk analysis. But note the fact that on both sides, that there's an incentive to develop these countries. Because China understands that in order for it to have a proper market for its products, the individuals in that market need to have jobs. They need to be able to afford the products that they want to sell to them, and at the same time they need to have products that they can buy from the countries that they create trade deals with. Note that examples like Sri Lanka or the Ghunar port in Pakistan may be specific examples where it was strategically important for China to annex these areas. We think the comparative then is that on their side, China still has these hegemonic and expansionist ideals. But the unfortunate reality is they won't be doing it through the peaceful means that the Belt and Road Initiative forces them to do it through. Secondly, note that the long-term benefits that oftentimes still accrue. It was honestly ridiculous for India to say that these roads are only connecting China with explicitly countries in unilateral fashion, because when you want to make a connection between Kazakhstan and China, you necessarily need to go through all the rural China that lacks development. You go through all of the bordering nations, and you connect all of the countries that oftentimes want to trade with each other, but lack the infrastructure to do so. Thirdly, we think that when they lost this point, the point at which they decided to make their alternative examples like the Asian Development Bank, banks and development banks that China has equal control over and are just as likely going to have the same malicious intent if that is the picture that they want to paint. So ultimately, note that the comparative on their side is that they get the exact same policies, the economic extortion that they talk about, but without the Belt Road Initiative. I'll explain to you what that uniquely helps on our side. The second point of rebuttal is one on dumping. They tell us they economically did a rude disaster because they dumped into these countries. Know why this is patently false. The first reason is because there's an incentive not to do so, because China is trying to create economically prosperous areas around them because it also benefits themselves. But secondly, even when it does come to dumping, note the fact that the things that they're dumping are categorically not the industries that these countries are trying to grow. Things like technological dumping are actually oftentimes beneficial, because at the end of the day, it's not much of a travesty if the individuals of these countries are able to buy cheap products. But importantly, these cheap products are oftentimes the way that they can utilize themselves to develop industry and the future things like Electronics and are able to allow for the entrepreneurship for these countries to actually develop the industries rather than belonging them to succumb The primary industries that they're currently stuck in thirdly they tell us about this sort of hegemonic goal of China Ultimately at the end of the day we think that this hegemonic goal exceeds far past Belt Road Initiative. It's still likely going to exist. We're going to characterize it by its substantive. Why it is so that this hegemonic interest is curbed for the better with the Belt Road Initiative."

              "text": "So then, three points to our substantive about why China is in a unique position to benefit these countries. The first thing to note is the context of Western isolationism. That is to say, populist rhetoric and American first rhetoric in all countries across the West has caused a global pullout. That is to say, they're unwilling to engage within these countries because, honestly, at the end of the day, it's not politically expedient for them to engage with poor, neutral dictators. We think because of this, oftentimes these countries are in a state of destitution or neglect. Why then does this change? Secondly, China has five unique incentives that we say means that they're a better actor than any other competitor. The first one is the context of peaceful rights. That is to say, whilst many Western countries may have built themselves upon war and colonialism, China has always taken a very unique approach that has continued into Xi's non-interventionist principles. That is to say, the focus on things like capital or technological or resource exchange that bolsters the inner economy without taking militaristic or aggressive stances. The second thing to note is the internal priorities of China. That is to say, there's a lot of class struggle and ethnic struggle within China. Because of this, it prevents them from being able to take very controversial stances because they can't have excuses for countries like Taiwan or areas like Taiwan or Xinjiang from annexing or leaving the country. These internal struggles make sure that China has to keep itself in check because that is the only way that it ensures stability on the long term. Thirdly, there's a unique trade incentive that exists in China because China used to be on a model of internal consumption. They produced for their own people, and their people consumed what they had produced. But unfortunately, the transition to a secondary and tertiary industry has oftentimes meant that they have an oversupply, and they need to tap into the foreign markets of other countries. That is why China uniquely has an incentive to trade with the countries around them, rather than economically exploit them like they talk about. Because China doesn't need resources as much as it needs in a market that is able to purchase its products. Fourthly, we think China is uniquely politically flexible. That is to say it has a track record of being okay with dealing with dictators and authoritarian regimes. Because Turkmenistan remains a dictatorship on their side. But on our side, they get to prosper their people and the development that is crucial to the livelihoods of those people can actually happen. Fifthly, the Belt and Road Initiative is a test of soft power. And this becomes extremely important, I'll take you in a second. Because the image of constructing a very constructive economic policy and being a benevolent hegemon is in the interest of both China and Xi. The instance in which Belt and Road is used as an instance of soft power is also the instance to the point in which they're willing to do things like compromising on more moderate deals because they understand they want to protect their image. Sure."

What then do we think these benefits look like? Because they often come in a plethora. Things like the 150 million tourists that have been traversing this belt and road project. Things like the 4.4 million people who are connected in a technological and cultural exchange. Multilateral and long-term deals between countries that are now possible because the roads exist and you cut down time that transports materials by 50%. You increase the production and the ability for these people to access things that they previously were never able to. Access to consolidated markets like the stock markets in china that people in azerbaijan never had access to before but also things like educational importing how the 130 universities have been built across all 70 of these countries ultimately china is empowering these individuals because these countries never had an alternative they were unable to aspire to grow and at all because they had no way that they could have done so without the Belt and Road Initiative.

And secondly, a line about how this benefits China and that's good for the rest of the world. Firstly, the honest idea that China is in a uniquely better position to help these forced nations. A number of responses. Firstly, on the idea that China engages in a peaceful rise to never engage in military aggressions. Great. It's peaceful in that they're not sending their armies in. It's not peaceful in that they're inducing poverty into these regions by crippling structurally disadvantaged countries with massive debt. We think poverty isn't peaceful. We think the suffering of a vast majority of individuals in these countries doesn't count as peaceful. Second, they say China has a unique trade incentive. Yeah, you know what they mean by unique trade incentive? Flooding markets with cheap goods and destroying local businesses. Stealing infrastructure from these countries. The things we told you in our first speech, that's what they mean when they tell you unique trade incentive. Don't let them mislead you with their language panel. Thirdly, they say the Belt and Road Initiative is an instance of soft power, and therefore China will be willing to compromise on other things. Except, one, if China gains more power, as I talk about when I get to the second issue, they're not going to be more able to compromise on other things, no thank you, at the point where they become more powerful. But second, that doesn't engage with the sheer economic devastation that their policy does. What do we say in our speech? We told you that alternatives exist, and these alternatives are significantly better for countries on the ground. Firstly, because each of these organizations which are multilateral want their money back, which means they're less likely to be okay with these countries being in crippling debt. Why is China okay with that? Because they can seize those points, because they can extract natural resources from those areas. The fact that these multilateral organizations aren't exclusively controlled by a single country means they're able, no thank you, to check each other. Lastly, they say the comparatives, China engaging in even worse economic expansion. Firstly, we regret that too, right? On our side, we're not saying that the Belt and Road Initiative is bad, but whatever else horrific thing China might do is good. We're okay with regretting that as well. But second, that concedes that the incentives of China are in pure self-interest. And it is okay with undermining the most vulnerable nations on the planet in order to advance its self-interest. All we are saying is the Belt and Road is an extension of that. We told you that debt default is devastating to these nations, at the point where 8 out of 23 nations in the Belt and Road programme are marked with elevated debt risk. We think that's something they never bother to engage with and that's devastating for most vulnerable individuals on the ground. Then on the second idea, this benefits China, that's great for them. First thing to note is that it's bad for the vulnerable individuals within China when China can no longer be held accountable by international actors. This looks like the Uighur Muslim populations within China. We think that's incredibly problematic. Secondly, insofar as right now, as they themselves explain, the US is undergoing a decline and therefore we don't have a concentration of power in particular regions, we don't want there to be more concentration of power. We don't want the US to be replaced by another superpower who can repeat all the atrocities that the US engaged in. That's what we told you in our second argument, that they crowd up, no thank you, regional powers. When China gets massive control over ports, massive military access to things like military to be able to coerce nations into accepting the Belt and Road Program. We told you that we don't want another country to get the same concentration of power that China once had. If it's just one road, it's a dead end."

              "text": "Two responses to that. Firstly, as I already told you, we regret that too. Let's be clear, this debate is not about what China should do. Ask China what would we do in order to advance the population to the world. This debate is about when presented with that choice four years ago, what would have been better for the world? Whether it had gone with the BRI or whether it had gone with multi-lateral organisations. But secondly, insofar as China wants access to soft power, absent the BRI BRI not wanting to piss existing global powers off, they are more likely to go into the multilateral organisations we talked about in our first speech. The Belt and Road Initiative is a road to entrenching illiberal regimes. We've already shown that the economic calculus of the Belt and Road Initiative isn't exactly healthy. But let's take to use China as their best for a moment and assume that it is. The political costs are still devastating because governments are likely to become more corrupt and less accountable as a result of their policy. If economic development is unlikely to ever come to fruition, we don't want illiberal regimes to be more entrenched. That's a significant thing to regret. Three ways in which the Belt and Road Initiative entrenches illiberal regimes. First, it provides unaccountable leaders access to cheap credit. The Belt and Road Initiative's laws don't place any conditions on political reform of authoritarian countries. That's why they themselves told you, ah, we want money going into these poor dictatorships. One of the biggest incentives for countries to engage in political liberalisation right now is the fact that organisations which provide aid and provide infrastructure loans right now place conditions on these illiberal countries to politically liberalise. On their side of the house, they provide these regions access to cheap credit and there's no cost, no thank you, to staying authoritarian, to checking your power even more. But secondly, the Belt and Road Initiative has directly strengthened illiberal regimes. Why? Because it is in China's interest for more countries to join the initiative, to accept these loans and not constantly change their position on them. When a country is a democracy, there is always a risk that a protectionist party wins the next election and ends their cooperation with the Belt and Road. However, a more illiberal regime, on the other hand hand is likely to stay in power for a long time and is likely to be able to hold a strong stance on the issue of the Belt and Road. How does China entrench governments which are favourable to the initiative? First, things like oil investments for the exclusive purpose of propping up Omar al-Bashir's Sudan, giving massive foreign donations to finance the LDP in Uzbekistan to win the 2016 election. All of this is so that the countries don't back out of the extensive Belt and Road projects. But thirdly, the regimes right now rely on tax money to sustain themselves, to fund things like infrastructure projects. But in a developing country, it's really hard to enforce a meaningful tax regime. Therefore, they pass policies to ensure things like economic growth, to expand the trust that people have in these governments so that they pay taxes. Now that they have an alternate source of funding, they are less likely to have that incentive. Why is this pernicious? Outside of the fact that it's deeply morally problematic for China to erode democracy, we think strong institutions are critical to the long-term development of these countries. because an illiberal dictator doesn't really have an incentive to improve conditions of low-income populations on the ground at the point where they are not voting. We think this is a self-perpetuating cycle when international aid organisations also cut these balances out of the point where they are forced to compete with the Belt and Road Initiative. On our side, those multinational organisations are more likely to reinforce standards of democracy and enable the long-term development of these vulnerable countries. If it's just one road, it's a dead end. We're very trusted."

And finally, I'm going to bring to you a new substantive argument as to why benefits to China and dodging China away from its own internal politics is beneficial for the world. Before that, just a bit of framing. I'd just like to point out that the Belt and Road Initiative, i.e. opening up your borders and pursuing free trade as a means of economic development, is not mutually exclusive to China as well. India, their nation, has pursued economic liberalisation and foreign reform by opening up its borders. The USA and the EU were able to achieve large amounts of economic prosperity precisely because they were able to use free trade agreements to use and get access to foreign markets. But moreover, note that the Belt and Road Initiative was created in 2013 with the frame to say that the large majority of its benefits would actualize in 2042. This is five years."

              "text": "No, thank you. We told you that the incentives of China were not inherently extortionate. They framed the Boiling Road Initiative as purely on economic means as a result of infrastructure, but they didn't engage with any of our analysis as the idea that China has used this as soft power to improve its image. The fact that they've signed more than 300 cooperative deals and action plans and cultural exchanges shows that this is not just for economic means, but also to improve its global image. And we told you that this global image is a moderating factor, that because the Belt and Road Initiative elevates China's economic means and China's image towards Western scrutiny, the scrutiny of Western media, and also the improvement of the image in the eyes of every other button-mode initiative, they have the incentive to improve their image and not be so extortionary on their side of the house. Don't let them get away with the three examples of Sri Lanka and Pakistan and South Africa. Because the majority of the examples which we'll go into later are beneficial towards the people. Their main response was that economic harm leads to dumping and exploitation of these nations. That's not true. But when we told you the context of China, that China's economy used to be based on internal consumption, but as a result of China producing and overproducing goods, we have an oversupply of goods, which means that China's going to sell it anyway. So without the Belt and Road Initiative, you are still going to have China dumping their goods and exploiting local industries. The problem is that there are going to be shady deals that happen behind closed doors. Their only response to this was, we regret China's foreign policy. But you cannot regret China's foreign policy. Because without the Belt and Road Initiative, these incentives will exist on either side of the house. The difference is, it's more exploitative on theirs. The next response was the idea of alternatives, that the ABB and BRICS are better. Well, we told you that China precisely has more control over this. But the next response was to say that the AIIB is not multilateral. But that is factually incorrect. The AIIB includes China, but it also includes nations from a wide variety of demographics, like the UK, like Canada, like multiple African nations, and like multiple EU nations as well. For them to say it's multilateral is disingenuous on their side of the house. But moreover, we didn't understand why there was an incentive to create stable markets. Because China does want to sell its goods. And it seems intuitive to us that if you do want to sell your goods, you should not unemployed everyone within that nation, because if there's a 100% decrease in wages, what else is the fact that if goods are cheaper, people cannot afford them? There's an incentive for stability within these nations."

First of all, note that they didn't engage with the comparative because these regimes will stay as dictators anyway. Given that they will remain dictatorships, we'd rather benefit the people to create thick middle classes. Because you know what the best way to take down dictatorships is? It's to benefit the people, expose them to liberal ideas as a result of globalization, and to take down that dictatorship. Not to leave them in poverty and only enhance the legitimacy of these dictators. But secondly, note that supporting dictatorships is not mutually exclusive to China. Western nations do this as well. The U.S. supports Saudi Arabia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Iran. So unclear to me why China is the only nation that will do this. So these incentives are not inherently extortioners."

Three things that they provide. First, energy. China is a leader in green energy and provide things like useful energy grids that provide nations without electricity and without the grids to power things like basic hospitals and provide some to these nations. That's why Pakistani hospitals finally got power and were not able to be exploited because China provided this energy as well. Secondly, infrastructure. And no, if you want to connect it to China, you also have to connect it to other nations as well. They built railroads in Laos that made transportation within those nations far faster. Thirdly, you facilitate local industries like agriculture. Kazakhstan used to be a nation that could not feed its people because of the winters and the cold season that happened there. That changed on our side of the house when China was able to build a railroad that connected Kazakhstan to Xinjiang and finally gave people food that they inspired better on our side of the house.

              "text": "Now, all right, so my argument will prove to you that benefits to China means that you quell internal struggles. Why is this important? This debate is centered around the vulnerability of certain actors and how we can best help minorities and best help vulnerable people around the world. The Ball and Road Initiative has brought and will continue to bring massive benefits towards the Chinese people. And it comes to you with 1.5 billion people should not be ignored. But more importantly, I'm going to prove to you why because this is good for China, it is good for the West as well. China used to have double-digit economic growth, but that has slowed in recent years. Now economic growth is stagnant, and because the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party is contingent on providing economic growth for its people, it is focused on internal struggles and de-status quo. What are the benefits to China? Three things to say on this. Firstly, you help oppressed minorities within China. So you help people like the Uyghurs, the Hui minority, and the Tibetans, who are surveillanced and systemically excluded from opportunities on their side of the house. But on our side, you give them jobs in Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, because they are able to speak the language we finally give these people stable employment. Second, you benefit poor provinces in China, because free trade agreements and infrastructure go through provinces like Xinjiang and Yunnan, which otherwise would be isolated from China as well. So you get things like new jobs, which has created $2.5 trillion within the industry in China as well. Finally, economic development. So you're able to have greater exports. You're able to create a thick middle class. Why is this important? When you have a productive society and people are in poverty, that's when China is removed from its internal struggles and can focus on bringing aid to external countries. That's what happened with Japan, where after establishing a stable economy, they were able to get a lot of oriental development aid. China is particularly good because they value the peaceful rise to power, they were able to create stable foreign policy and nations, and fill a vacuum to the isolationist context that my first speaker gave me. So, because we benefit people, and because China does not have extortionary incentives, proud to oppose. Thank you."

              "text": "Three questions in this debate. Firstly, how does this affect developing nations? Secondly, how does this affect the global balance of power? And thirdly, how does this affect the most of us? On the first question of does the Belt help developing nations, their main push is to listen to China as an incentive to get their loans back. But we clearly showed to you how it is deliberately planned by China that they don't need to get their loans back. That is, that they can seize the ports and resources that these people have built, when they can actually control the trade flows. When when because of the fact that now they have a railway line running through Kenya they can literally take the mine equipment that they have the mine resources that they have leave them in the retrain and ship them off straight back to Beijing these are huge incentives to actually allow these projects to fail and they are huge because it means that a debt default is not a 100% against their interest. Their only response to this is, oh, well, it's in their global image. Here's the thing. If Kenya fails to build a railway, it's Kenya's fault. China can just push it off saying, listen, this is a project with 70 countries. Obviously, there will be some failures. Like they said, stop cherry-picking examples. It's just a poor developing country. They don't have any harm on their global image. What they do have, however, is a lot of trade and resources now open to them. Not that huge. But then after that, they come up and say the alternative is a Western put-out. But is that true? Did they literally do anything other than just say Trump exists, therefore this argument must be polished? Because the World Bank has given $60 billion just last year. The IMF $90 billion. We also see the rise of the BRICS Bank or the ADB, regional lenders like the African Bank. At the end of the day, there are a lot of regional powers who are stepping up and giving up investment. We accept that we don't have as much. However, it's not that all debt is good. We tell you we have more than enough money to actually tend to the most struggling countries on our side. Their only response to this is to say, well, China's in there, which means they must be evil and try to control them too. But here's the thing, China doesn't control like around 80% of the funding in there. That's where the difference lies, panel. They say the AIIB is multilateral. Here's the thing, other countries exist in the AIIB, but almost all of their voting shares together are still less than China. We told you how the BRICS bank has a 20% distributed across every single shareholder. That's where it was true. We weren't saying that Germany had great incentives and was wonderful because they were white. We were saying everyone was self-interested and we balanced it out by making them act as checks on each other. That's why our alternative of lending was far better. But for what panel? What benefit were they standing for? The only thing they gave us in their first speech was now it's interconnected. But we told you why that's a horrible thing. Because it means that when you plan your finances such that you need the railways to be interconnected to other countries in order for it to turn a profit, if it's actually not interconnected, if Kenya's railway stops, it means that you start paying more for the railways than you actually get from it. That means because of the fact that it's interconnected, the BRI is uniquely harmful to us and it hurts these countries more than anything. And then after that, let's get to assuming that these projects get constructed, what does it look like? They say China has an incentive to not flood it. Here's the thing. There's a difference between acting wonderful to an economy and not destroying it 100%. China has an incentive to actually monopolize the economy over there. They speak of cheap products, and we agree, but those cheap products will only exist for a short period of time. After that, they get a monopoly over the markets of Kenya and Nigeria, and can start raising up prices. At which point, the milk is not cheap anymore in these extremely poor countries, final. And as a result, we tell you, they don't need to destroy the economies of these countries in order to hurt the lives of the most vulnerable over there. At the end of the day, boy, the incentives of China, not because they're horrible, but because they're a single actor, are perverse. And we would rather a world where at the end of the day, different actors check themselves and care for the developing world in a system that we worked. Second clutch, does having all roads leading to China help the balance of power? Final, they literally accepted this. Their little first speech was, yes China will go around annexing a couple of ports and harbours here and there, but that's fine, they'll do it anyway, China will be China. Here's the thing, final, at the end of the day, the BRI is uniquely harmful. Note what alternative methods of oppression they pushed. Nearly nothing. Bilateral trade agreements. Bilateral trade agreements does not get you unilateral controls over the major trading ports all around the world. Something they conceded China would strategically try to do. When China can say, I will not allow the US to trade with the entire Asian continent, that is when they have a skewed ability to control the balance of power. No response to that. Furthermore, what are these alternative things China is going to do? Not only did we tell you we regret them as well, but they literally rebut themselves when they say China cares about its horrible image and so won't be horrible, when they say Xi Jinping is built out of pacifism and actually has that narrative. They themselves in their first speech tell you why the alternative is likely to be co-operating. Because of the global image, they're likely to try to be a leader within the ADB. And we're happy for that to happen because there's a balance over there. Let's impact the South Channel because it really matters in this debate. Because when you have a superpower who has military stronghold over you, who can scare you into submission into any free trade deal, who can control the way your country works politically and economically, it means people on the ground have no control over their countries. It means that people are hurt and waste, that China simply wants them to be. That is not a word that we were willing to support. A word that we gave rise to as superpowers. We stand for a word from Buddy Rappers."

Unless Sri Lanka checks their massive public spending, they're never paying back the 68 billion dollar debt that they have to China. They needed to respond to that somewhere in their two speeches if they wanted to make that response and that point of information. AASAI is the one with sustainable loans which actually work for countries. On the third flash, does the belt help the most repressed in the world? Quickly, let's deal with their funky argument on benefits to China. In an interesting way, this hurts India. Three reasons why. Firstly, because we're really scared of China having military control all around us, which means we need to spend a lot. Which means money doesn't go into healthcare. Which means money doesn't go into education. Also because of border violations we told you about, it hurts our ability to keep our soldiers not dying. Furthermore, on weighing, India will have more people than China will after the BRI is over. Which means also, the more work. Which means we'll means more vulnerable. We took that argument at its best, panel. Now let's get on to the actual debate on the comparative for illiberal regimes. They told you, oh these will be illiberal all the time. Here's the thing, panel. This is a debate about countries like Philippines, countries like Kenya. It's not true that you're either a dictatorship or Denmark. There are people in the middle who actually can change if you incentivise them to do so. What their side does is literally give them an incentive to become worse when Duterte sits next to Xi Jinping and gets no condemnation for slaughtering 20,000 people in a war on drugs in his country. That is a world where you incentivise them to go further. Not that they don't benefit the people by giving them loans either. Because the loans aren't going to the people if it's truly a strong man who doesn't care. We are the only side that helps the most repressed in society. We are the only side that looked at developing nations, didn't coerce them into half-billed deals that would rob them of their resources, and actually allowed them to prosper. We were the only side that maintained a balance of power. If it's a one loan, we think it's a dead end."

And because it is a form of soft power, soft power cares about publicity far more than extortionary economic deals that happen behind closed doors. That was the comparative of this debate. Their response to this was, China always wants to seize maximum power, right? We agree. But in this particular instance, China is far more willing to trade off economic profit with cultural perceived advancement. So without the BRI, China would be likely to negotiate bilateral deals that focus on maximum financial extraction. That's far worse, and that was the comparative they had to deal with. Then they came up in third and had this weird response that countries can negotiate better in bilateral deals. I'm sorry, but I don't think Kenya has very much leveraging power against the country that has the second most GDP in the world and will threaten to get rid of it if they don't agree.

They responded to one of them. They responded to the one about how they are in a uniquely good position. Their response was, poverty isn't really peaceful. I think that's premised on the idea that these countries are already prosperous. We don't think that's the case. Because if you look at countries like Kazakhstan, like Tajikistan, those countries were already in poverty before the BRI came around. It was only after they came in, they connected them to the world, that they were actually able to prosper. But more importantly, we told you about the trade incentives on our side of the house. That because China wants to trade with these countries, it means that they simply gain nothing from bankrupting them and putting people into unemployment. We told you about how to test of soft power. We told you how oftentimes they have internal priorities. We told you about the flexibility of their loans, no response to any of these reasons. But more importantly, there were tangible benefits on our side of the house. And it's not enough for them to say we had no examples, because we clearly did. We told you about the inter-country trade that had happened on our side of the house, because of the roads that link Djibouti to Ethiopia. Because contrary to what they say, you don't need to simply be linked to China for your roads to work. As long as you're linked to nations around you, it still lets you trade with other nations. No response to that. But secondly, we told you that it allows for the integration of economies. What does that mean? It means that even parts that are created in China are assembled in places like Kazakhstan because these types of countries can coexist and use their competitive advantage. What did they tell us?

Number one, that China has an incentive to keep industries afloat because you can't buy cheap goods if you're unemployed and have zero income. But secondly, you enable countries and industries to grow because roads systematically work both ways. And that means that when the country's on their side of the house and they compare it where no roads exist, it's far worse. But thirdly, because the products that China dump are categorically different from the products that these countries and industries produce, what does it mean? It means China primarily dumps things like cheap technology, things that these countries generally don't produce. But fourthly, we told you, consumer access is particularly important. Because when a smartphone is actually accessible for a poor man in a rural community, it means that you can now, for the very first time, allow them to improve their standard of living, no response to any of that. Their only response was, well, first China tries to monopolize, and then it raises prices in the long run. Here's the problem. When you raise prices, local industries can now compete again. This means that China, if it raises prices, will make sure that local industries can grow up. No response to that."

Number one, if loans are so extortionary, if there were so many clear-cut examples of loans, countries clearly wouldn't voluntarily sign into this type of agreement. The reason why is because countries benefit themselves and they're clearly able to benefit. But secondly, just because you default on loans doesn't mean China benefits. Because China clearly still loses millions of dollars on a failed project that they cannot recoup even if they claim a port. But thirdly, let's say defaults exist on both sides of the house. Defaults are far better on our side. Why? Because China is far more lenient under circumstances of default. Because when you default on our side, China will just say, it's okay, we'll just claim this port. On their side, what default happens when you go to multilateral banks, is they do things like impose austerity, which is far worse, which hurts citizens the most, and means that normal people are hit the most. Before that, sure."

Number one, we told you that in the context of an isolationist West and an insular EU, investment would have never come to landlocked countries of Eastern Europe. Secondly, we told you that even in places where multilateral banks were available, that it was simply infeasible, because they impose things like stringent environmental regulations that make projects economically infeasible. Secondly, we think they're far worse. Why? Because they seem to claim that condition A is far better. Unfortunately, condition A is a euphemism for structural adjustment. It is a euphemism for austerity that hurts citizens the most and cuts welfare spending. But thirdly, they say it crowds out other people without really explaining the mechanism. Why? That is simply not true. In places like Southeast Asia, Japan still outspends China. In Central Asia, the ADB and the Asian Bank also compete alongside China. And here's where we directly respond to what they said. Because they tell us the World Bank funded millions of dollars. Yes, the vast majority of that funding only occurred after the Belt and Road Initiative. Why? Because on our side, there is now an incentive to compete. Because if you don't give loans out, it's seen as losing the opportunity to gain that land. So what happens now is there is a race to the bottom. People make loans far more accessible. Because on their side of the house, the places they're talking about never get those loans. At the end of the day, what otherwise would have happened to these types of countries is they wouldn't have loans. There would be no incentive to outreach to them and people would be stuck in the very conditions they were born in. Conditions of abject poverty. We provided the ability for people to get out of these areas and that's why we were proud to oppose."

Tourism, technological and cultural exchange to over 4.4 billion people. Access to consolidated markets like stock markets that countries like Azerbaijan would never have on their own. Electricity and cheap technology to the people who otherwise are never able to gain access to it because the infant industries within their own countries are never able to develop it.

But the comparative on your side is that they default on AIIV loans on themselves, but they don't get the support from China because China doesn't need to rectify their own image. Secondly, they told us that China was extortionist and hegemonic. Problem is, they are too on your side. And importantly, throughout this entire debate, the comparative needed not to rely on the BRI versus the best possible case scenario of any sort of loan from some magical institution that is multilateral and going to give you the best of deals. Because even if we took them at their best case, when we engaged our grounds like the SAPs from the IMF, we told you that the exploded economies of Chile and Greece probably mean that those are not suitable for most countries. Their response was, this is minimum standards. But we think that just laughs in the face of the people who are dying within those economies because they were ruined by even the most best and glorious actors on their side. Then, they told us that dictatorships are going to be perpetuated. But the unfortunate reality is dictators exist on both sides. And this they told us that dictatorships are going to be perpetuated. But the unfortunate reality is dictators exist on both sides. And this is very simple. Why? The thought calculus of a dictator goes as such. On one side, I get loans, but no power. On the other side, I get no loans, but I get power. They always choose power, and thus dictatorships existed on both sides. That was why it was extremely pertinent that our side was able to bring the development, to actually help the individuals within these countries. And we told you that even when it comes on the metric of dictatorship and democracy, the best way you get democracy is when you can bolster the middle class, one that on their side is impoverished and starving and never gets access to the benefits of the Belt Road Initiative."

On our side, China has unique incentives, because the Belt Road Initiative is a soft power that they need to retain. It is an image that they have crafted that they want to keep. On their side, that image dissolves. But the economic interests stay the same, and they're likely going to conscript the countries around them and turn them into the destitution that India had pulled us about. Ultimately, their case in itself, because the only alternative or comparative we saw was one that was much more bleak and one that never cared about its reputation, we were very proud to oppose."

Secondly, on opposition, the westernization of elites looks like them traveling to the UK and to other western states to live, to work, to study, all because they prefer the culture in those areas and because they prefer those societies. Lastly, we say when we're talking about post-colonial states, these are often states that are still rebuilding and they have the active incentive to build a functioning state. We would say Western institutions aren't the only ones that work. We can have institutions that are specifically tailored to these individuals, to those cultures. For example, we still have public education, but instead of 40 students all reading pro-colonialism propaganda in one classroom, it is tailored to the multicultural setting of these countries. Democracy in the United Kingdom, for example, was based on a racially homogenous society versus our kind of society is one that's built on having multiracial identities within the society."

              "text": "Two arguments then to forward from proposition. Firstly, on why it's principally egregious to be compliant in a system of oppression. Secondly, on how this leads to the degradation of development of state institutions. The first argument, the principle, three parts here. Number one, colonialism was an oppressive structure imposed onto every post-colonial state, involving ruthless divide and conquer of our society, pillaging our land of resources, our potential to build cultural erasure and erasing the identities we hold true to our hearts. This is something that's objectively wrong and we should objectively oppose. But the rhetoric on opposition is that these Western ideas are fair, that these institutions are good. They excuse all of the abhorrence when we welcome those institutions as something we should mimic and something we should replicate. In the status quo, it is already extremely difficult for developing nations to get compensation for the horrors of colonialism. Opposition makes it far worse. Secondly, we say elites are a culturally normative force. They hold positions of power. They hold wealth. For example, when they're political or financial leaders within the country, people automatically associate them with success. Therefore, in opposition, individuals associate these elites with success, with Western culture, with Western languages, with Western religion, like Christianity. On opposition, you idealize everything associated with them, idealizing then these Western ideals. Why is it so principally abhorrent, the third layer of this argument? Because what opposition does is idealize Western cultures at the expense of our own by putting Western culture on a pedestal. We say the purpose of independence post-colonialism is autonomy over your identity and over yourself. But what opposition does is impose this idea that many post-colonial states lose the basis of their culture and the key to self-actualization, the roots of their identity. When you view your mother tongue as unimportant and when you view, for example, speaking Chinese as something that's not going to make you successful, you have internalized feelings of inferiority under your side of the house. This empowers the colonial colonizers' rhetoric that they came to our countries and civilized us by bringing us humanity devaluing our value as individuals saying we only have importance because of the west this argument is independently principled i should be allowed to feel proud in my mother tongue and my religion of western imposition without feeling failing because i am not subscribing to their ideals of what successful is. But before I go on, I'll take that point. Given that elites tend to overwhelmingly come from one ethnic group, why is it that your likely comparative is one of multi-racialism rather than promoting the narratives of the ethnic group the elite come from? We think that when elites stay within the country, there's a higher probability of them interacting with different racial groups. Under your side of the house, we'd be bringing an elitist and a kind of view that doesn't take into consideration any of the suffering of anyone within the country on a scale we are far better for people within these countries the second argument on how this leads to the degradation of the development of state institutions also in three parts firstly we see the westernization of elites in the past and trench western norms for decades for example we see our final goal as replicating their system and their system to be the one that is best. After assigning ideas of success with the west for generations, we always feel our system is inferior. This leads to harm and impacts the institutions of states in two ways. Firstly, how this harms local education systems in two ways as well. Firstly, we say the reason why local education systems in post-colonial states like ours is developed so slowly is because elites leave and they don't come back. They don't build up local institutions because a bad local education system doesn't affect them when they know they're just going to move to Harvard because they perceive that to be a more successful institution. On our side of the house, when they stay within the countries, when they invest their time and money into it, this creates investment into the local education system. If you attend local universities, you will give endowments. Your success as an individual in a position of power, for example, an elite is more likely to be successful, gives credence to the success of the university, which begets even more smarter minds to enter these universities. It is a vicious cycle that elevates the intellect of everyone in society that opposition never gets. Local universities are important to make education accessible to everyone. Opposition exacerbates the wealth gap, for example, when wealthy individuals can achieve education and can achieve quality education when local institutions are never meaningfully developed under their side of the house. Secondly, they have brain drain on opposition. This looks like post-conflict. They need the brightest mind and the highest capital in order to develop. These nations have nascent government structures. They don't have wealthy coffers, for example, to kick off innovation and new industries. Therefore, you're relying on your local talent pool in order to develop and grow as a country. On opposition, this never happens because these individuals leave and they don't return because you don't even develop the local institutions. But if opposition wants to say that these elites will come back and they will bring with them ideas that help the country grow, we have two things to say. Firstly, we don't think the West is the only way for you to be able to achieve success and development. But secondly, we say that these individuals are likely not to return. Your wealthy individual will go to, for example, the UK, form connections overseas, have memories and lived experiences there. And after the entrenchment of Western ideals that say that those societies are superior, they're going to stay there, they're going to bring their wealth and influence there, and you will never meaningfully develop your countries. This is why education institutions in countryside hours like Malaysia are so underdeveloped because of this idealization of the West. The last part of this argument is about how this impacts the political system. And this directly clashes with your POI on how we get more inclusive systems. We see that your political systems will never fit the people on the ground for three reasons. Firstly, because those in charge of nation building, for example, the elite, don't know the context of the people there. For example, you went to boarding school in the UK, you have no idea the racial tensions in the country. You have no idea that people need, for example, welfare. You just want to bring ideas of like fiscal conservatism from the country that you came from. But secondly, we see the imposition of things like the common law, for example, from the UK is not fit for locals. The system of land ownership with indigenous individuals versus that of the United Kingdom was vastly different. Imposing Christianity over local cultures, these are things that individuals don't want, don't need, and we think that you should not support under their side of the house. But lastly, we would rather have, for example, quotas under our side"

If this is not true, then all of their argumentation about the harms of cultural hierarchy, the imposition of one culture upon all minorities, apply to them as well. Notice they give you absolutely no reason why this multicultural society is a likely comparative, and given that this motion is retrospective, they have no fiat to do so. There are a few reasons why this is unlikely to be the comparative. First, because the elites in many of these countries are ethnically homogenous. As a result of colonial divide and rule tactics, where colonizing powers designate one ethnicity to rule in their place after they leave or during the period of colonization, these elites on their side of the house that shape society and shape governance overwhelmingly come from an ethnically dominant and majority class that is not representative of the entire society."

Who are these elites that we are talking about? Elites, as I mentioned, are traditionally concentrated among one ethnic group. For instance, the Sikhs in Indian civil service or the Indonesian Chinese under Dutch colonization in Indonesia. This means that privilege is largely inherited along racial lines."

First, they tell us that western ideas are seen as superior to those of your local country. This is not true because this argument assumes that western culture is only concentrated among western people and their descendants in these post-colonial countries. As I'll show you later in my first argument, this is not true and therefore this idolization does not occur. Second, they say Western ideas inherently propagate colonialism, whereas local ideas don't. This is just untrue. Many of the anti-colonial narratives that led to the downfall of colonialism were propagated in Western societies and Western universities. For example, Ho Chi Minh was educated in Paris and brought those anti-colonial ideas back to Vietnam. Finally, they say there is cultural inferiority on out of the house.

If these elites want to move overseas, Isagenix is likely because they think they can lead a better life overseas, regardless of the kind of culture they have. Moreover, their comparative assumes that there are no poor, rich geographical divides in local countries. The likely comparative on their side is a brain drain from rural areas to urban areas, where these urban cities are overwhelmingly developed with their local universities and rural areas are still left out. So their comparative is not any better. Second, they say a brain drain is likely to occur. No, these elites are unlikely to stay in the West precisely because they are elites in your local context. Within your local country, they have overwhelming social and economic influence, which they don't have overseas. If, for instance, no thank you, elites from Nigeria move to the UK, they don't have that kind of overwhelming social influence in the UK, thereby creating an incentive for them to remain in Nigeria. Finally, they say, well, the political system is different. Firstly, because these elites will impose ideas upon the population which they don't like. First of all, these are probably not the people who are going to be voted in, insofar as these people continue to support things that they support rather than these colonial impositions. Second, on their side, it is likely a comparative of private schools and gated communities, meaning that the same harms of being unaware of the local community abound.

The premise of this argument is on team proposition side, the culture that they propagate must be the culture of the dominant social group. I've already given you an incentive as to why this dominant social group exists and why they want to propagate their own culture. Before I move on. Yes. When elites go overseas and say that they are superior, they have education and they have knowledge that enables them to entrench their racial superiority over others. What is the comparative on your side? I'll prove to you later in my argument why there is an incentive for these elites to spread English to the rest of society. Listen out for that. On this for the house, therefore, there is exact kind of cultural hierarchy that they decry in their argument, especially because it is incredibly difficult to create the kind of syncretic multicultural narrative that they stand for, particularly given a history of ethnic conflict between these different ethnic groups in many of these societies. The upshot, therefore, is that social opportunities are unequally distributed on their side of the house, because members of minority groups find it far harder to access any opportunities. On their side, when you go to school as a minority person, you are confronted by a language that you have no exposure to, which your classmates have been learning since birth. In job markets or in politics, you have to converse in a language or observe customs that you are foreign to, compared to your colleagues who have been speaking them since birth. This ossifies a race-based social hierarchy, where members of the majority race are overwhelmingly dominant in politics and society, which is not only unjust by their metric, but also leads to a large amount of discontentment on the part of minority communities. This discontentment could result in a spectrum of responses. On the milder end of the spectrum, it could lack social stereotypes and discrimination, a self-reinforcing cycle, because when minorities are locked out of opportunities, they are perceived as inferior because of their failure to rise to the top of society. On the more extreme end of the spectrum, it could look like outright ethnic conflict, where members of the minority feel that they're so discriminated against, the only way to resolve this issue is to rise up against the society. The comparative on our side is Western culture used by elites. At the very least, accessing these elite rungs of power is now equally easy or difficult to all because no one has preferential access to English on our side. Moreover, elites do have an incentive to increase access to Western culture for the rest of society. First, in order to increase their economic competitiveness, to ensure that the broad majority of society, for instance, can work in your civil service or your MNCs. And second, because there's often no way to prevent it due to the globalized spread of Western culture. For all of these reasons, these harms are mitigated on our side of the house.

Without Western culture, governments can coach their governance in traditional values. So for instance, the national culture of your country. The harm is therefore that this empowers governments to silence critique in two ways. First, because authoritarianism is justified based on twisted interpretations of your national culture. For instance, the Asian values discourse in Southeast Asia in the 1960s, which said that authoritarian political systems are Asian values, and hence these kinds of Western liberal ideas are foreign imports, and democracy is something foreign to our society. This also looks at India, for instance, where criticism of the BJP is coached as criticism of Hinduism, and therefore silenced and cracked down upon. Authoritarianism, therefore, abounds on their side. On the comparative, Western culture is not seen as belonging to your nation or your government. Governments cannot use Western culture to shield authoritarianism, not only because it doesn't belong to your society and therefore you feel no harm in attacking that particular culture, but also because empirically most Western countries today are strong liberal democracies without these authoritarian tendencies. Therefore, on this grounds, we ensure that authoritarianism is strongly devalued on our side of the house because we support racial equality rather than racial hegemony we are proud to oppose. All right, wonderful. Thank you very much, First Opposition, for those very fine"

If this is not the case, then their case only applies in a set amount of instances. Compare this to our side, where our case applies to all developing states that are post-colonial, regardless of whether that was the case or not. In fact, we think it's likely to be worse under their side of the house. What we told you in APOI was never actually responded to, even though they told you that they were going to flag it out in their argument. Instead, now these elites are able to entrench their superiority because they're using Western elitism to say that I am better than you. I have gone abroad. I've gone to superior institutions like Harvard and Oxford. I know better than you, and I've accessed all these academia that they say are so good. Therefore, it actually becomes worse under their side of the house. If there's interaction locally, if I'm part or we revert to pre-colonial structures in which we have localized governments, governance, or people being able to interact with each other, we say that it's far worse rather than actually exacerbating this harm to begin with.

They say that the reason why they leave is because they would leave under our side of the house as well, because they consider it to be better elsewhere. This does not deal with the nuance of the argument that Nganing brought out to you from first. First of all, because the only reason why we believe there is a better quality of life coming abroad is because of the fact that we idealize Western states. So if we were able to pour money into our own institutions and develop our economies they will also be able to attain a similar or even better quality of life this is what we told you if we make our educational institutions better if we pour money into them into their endowments or if we just stay here as elites like in totality this means that we'll be able to access that very same quality of education this means that uniquely this only happens under your set of the house where you're brainwashed into thinking i may get a better quality of life in New Zealand, for instance. It's not symmetrical as well. I'll take a point now, if there's one. Why would a local elite move and stay overseas when he is an underclass in a Western country and an elite in his own country? Look, have you read the motion? Like, this is literally about elites going to other places and going to attain Western like educations and institutions. Also, if that is the case, that is simply not the case and it's empirically untrue. We also see that, for example, in Malaysia and Singapore and tons of countries, you do have these business and politician elites going to British boarding schools and going to migrate to other countries as well. That essentially deals with everything that you're saying."

And the only rebuttal that they have towards our case is to say, number one, that elites won't be elected anyway. This is empirically untrue. We think that first of all, the reason why they're able to be elected is because they capitalize on this idea of being better than other individuals because of the fact that they have gone to these better institutions. That is what we told you from first. Additionally, because of the fact that they are elites, we need to say that the colonial institutions already entrenched you within that, like entrenched you within those structures of power because of the fact of due to things like divide and conquer. That means that you're able to tell them that you're better than them already. But also what they tell you is just that it's about the fact that instead of staying in my own communities or being able to stay in this country, I've gone abroad. I've gone to British boarding school. I'm never able to understand the kinds of struggles that people go through on the ground. This is a huge difference that they never wanted to deal with. They didn't tell you that you're silencing critique. I would note that first of all, this uniquely happens under your set of the house where they're able to entrench the idea that they're necessarily better. If your characterization is that there's tons of multi-ethnic groups in this society, I'm not able to draw upon my own religion to tell them that I am better than you because of the fact that they are multi-ethnic. So this argument automatically does not stand. We think that actually it's far worse under your side of the house where they're able to install this prejudice when it's exacerbated, when wealthy people go abroad, get better education, come back and able to monopolize not only all these opportunities in terms of things like jobs and essentially lock other people out of being able to access institutions, but also just monopolize things like positions of power to begin with. What do they not deal with from our case? Number one, we told you that you're able to sanitize your obligation of colonial powers to people. Instead of doing things like reparations, apologies, and cultural objects and repatriating them to societies, you just give commonwealth scholarships and they say, look, I've already benefited you, and because the elites necessarily buy into this, and they tell you this as well through media, through the political institutions, that is something that is necessarily perpetuated."

Second of all, but before that, I'll take another point. You tell us that only a small minority of countries have racial diversity and racial hierarchies. Given that many colonialists wanted divide and rule tactics, why is this not the majority scenario in this debate? Look, first of all, the point of pointing that out was to suggest that your case is highly circumstantial, meaning to say that it only operates within these contexts. If you do not want to deal with all the other cases, you necessarily lose the debate. Second of all, given that this is the case, I've already told you why you exacerbate all of these things. If it was true that they were going to draw upon their own culture simply to tell people, look, I am part of this culture and therefore we should follow all these rules, it is highly unlikely that they would suffer harm to the same extent as to when you have Christianity and Catholicism that are entrenching these power structures and people can draw upon them to say that I am better than you, and to implement all of these things. What else did they not deal with? Second of all, we told you about how they impose moral compasses onto you, whether this be, for example, through instituting common law and British law, which is, by the way, in the info slide, so they literally have to deal with it, how they infiltrate civil service societies to impose values onto you that you never wanted to deal with. Third of all, they only wanted to focus on outliers, meaning to say that they did not want to deal with how textbooks are telling you that colonialism is okay, that it was okay that you were being oppressed. Instead, they only focus on the small minority of foreigners who resist the West in the West, like Ho Chi Minh. Look, panel, this is clearly not the majority of cases. And in fact, in the majority of cases, in fact, they are telling you that this oppression was legitimate. They say that it is beneficial to teach all children English. I am not sure why this is was legitimate. They say that it is beneficial to teach all children English. I am not sure why this is the case. They want to sacrifice us being able to connect with our culture for the expense of the oppressors. Finally, at the end of this debate, what was he recognized? That under their side of the house, they uniquely idealized Western culture. It is not true when they tell you that it is symmetrical, because they, in fact, entrench the power of the elites that they say are so bad."

First, I want to take out their claims about the elites going overseas and not coming back. This underpins all of their argumentation on brain drain. First, we told you why they have no incentive to go overseas, because they are already very influential in their home countries. We heard no direct response to this claim. Their second speaker said they would respond. They never did. Second, honestly, I think they can probably maintain a comfortable standard of living in their local country as well, given that they can do things that have gated communities, given that they can live isolated from the types of slums and poverty that everyone else lives in. Third, it's worse to live overseas because people overseas are incredibly racist to you. If you are Nigerian and you go to the United Kingdom, I suspect you would have a lot of racist backlash towards you, making your life very uncomfortable because of rising xenophobia and people believing that you are tribal and primitive. That's why they will come back after going overseas. That's that dealt with. The next thing they try to retreat to is a claim about how elites will not know anything about the national context because they've gone to Oxford and therefore they're not going to know about what's happening on the ground.

              "text": "by majorities. We told you this was because elites were ethnically homogenous. We gave you two reasons. First, because of divide and rule and how historically this has meant colonizers prefer one type of ethnic group over the other. I'm going to give you another reason now. Often when governments exit these colonial countries, they want to ensure stability. That's what the British wanted when they exited all of these colonial countries. Here's the problem. In order to get stability, you cannot give power to different ethnic groups because this leads to a lot of conflict. Therefore, you only give power to one ethnic group, again meaning that elites often tend to come from the same ethnic group. See, for instance, how political elites in Malaysia largely come from the dominant Malays. Now, the only response you get is an assertion. They say, we are running a very small case because most post-colonial states are not multicultural. One, this is false. The reason most post-colonial states are not multicultural. One, this is false. The reason most post-colonial states are multicultural is because when you exit a colonial country, often colonials tend to blend, for instance, the kind of borders that previously existed. They tend to do away with these borders, just like they did, for instance, with the Indian partition initially. They tend to draw borders arbitrarily, they do, which means that often there is a lot of multiculturalism. So this is why structurally most of these states are multicultural. Second, they actually conceded to this in first. When they set up, they considered that by and large they would support a multicultural identity. What I've proven thus far is that this multicultural identity is structurally impossible and does not apply in the majority of cases. Why then is this homogenous identity from the elite worse on their side of the house? No. Here's why they said that all the harms we gave were symmetrical. No. We give you two unique harms that apply to them. Number one, accessibility. The culture of the elite, for instance, the language of the Burmese, is significantly more inaccessible to an ethnic Rohingya than English for two reasons. First, in terms of the amount of resources, there's significantly more resources available to do things like learn English because you have hyper-globalization, meaning you can watch English shows. You often have far more articles in English on the internet, meaning it's far easier for you to learn these types of things. No response. But second response, let's be very charitable. Let's say it's true that it's very difficult to learn English. Do you know why we still prefer this? The reason is because English is something that is equitable. It is equally inaccessible to everyone. And outside the house, the thing is, no one is explicitly privileged because this is something that is hard for everyone. It means at the very least, we have a principle of equity. On their side, this is one of rampant inequality, where if they teach Malay, you know who is privileged? It is the Malays in school because they've been speaking it their whole life. They create a system of inequality when you are a Chinese boy in school and you don't know how to do the exam paper, but your Malay friend can because it's written in Malay and that's the language he's spoken his whole life. On their side of the house, they create rampant inequality. So even if English is inaccessible, at the very least, we create far more equality than that. This is important because the lack of equality in this context leads to massive social backlash, which brings me on to my second question, or rather my second part of this, the harm of resentment. On the other side of the house, people are going to feel resentful because minorities feel like, at the very least, on the other side of the house, everyone has lost their culture. Everyone has benefited or has been harmed by westernization. Versus on their side of the house, we heard no response, especially because this is very harmful. Here's where I'm going to clash directly with their principle. Where is more resentment caused? Is it caused when you adopt the colonial culture or the culture of the majority? I'm going to break that principle here by proving why more resentment is caused on their side of the house. The reason is because majorities were also oppressive to minorities. So look at the difference. The difference is that on their side of the house, they allow the oppressors, which were the majority, who have oppressed these minorities for millennia, to benefit off of this system. On the other side of the house, even if minorities are still oppressed, at the very least, we don't allow majorities to benefit off this principle of oppression. So that's why on this clash, they lose. No. I'm now going to move on to the second question. Even if this is not a narrative and they stand for multiculturalism, no. I'll explain why they still lose. Here's why. Because thus far, the only thing they've given us here is they say importing Western ideas is just very, very bad. That's all they've been telling us thus far. Number one, they've not given us a lot of analysis for this. Why is it that these Western ideas are necessarily bad? No, thank you. But oftentimes they tend to look like things like democracy. But second, this is outweighed by our second argument, which we heard no response to. Our second argument told you that even if that comparative is a multicultural national identity, these identities are very difficult to criticize because often when you criticize the government, then you are castigated as a traitor. You are castigated as someone who's criticizing the new national narrative that was created, which means often on the outside of the house, governments become very autocratic when you cannot criticise them. Comparatively, on outside of the house, you can criticise these governments. Why does this outweigh their argument on all the harms they want to tell you, for instance, specifically about common law? Because you see, right, under outside of the house, when we have more democracy, this means that people can shape the types of policies that exist. So if these policies are very harmful, they can vote them out. Rel to the death of the house, where you have no ability to do this. I'm not going to move on to my argument on improving foreign relations. No. The premise of this argument is that westernization often occurs across regions. For instance, look at how the United Kingdom colonized entire regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. We argue that this means there are two unique harms to the death of the house in terms of foreign relations. I'll take you in a moment. First, this means they often bridge historical enmity because both countries tend to share similar local cultures in our world. On the other side of the house, countries like Vietnam and Cambodia that have been historically feuding share a similar culture because they were colonized by the same country. Versus the other side of the house, where they resort to the prior national identities that existed, that reinforce past fault lines. Before I go on, I'll take the point. If it was a system of divide and conquer, then Malays are majority groups that have already learned English. If they have more money, they can obviously still get more westernized education. How are you saying that westernization is not gatekept? No, but the point is that on our side of the house, first, I've given you reasons for why it's more accessible. And secondly, and more importantly, many of these Western cultures often have an incentive to, when Western colonizers have an incentive to spread English as a language, because when they came in, that was the explicit purpose they said they were coming in for. Back to the argument. This is important because it means that these local countries, which in the past might have feuded, can now reunify, or rather at the very least, not be at loggerheads with one another. Copy the death of the house, where this is what they resort to. Second, language barriers are broken under our side of the house. Countries are far more willing to trade when they have things in common. They're far more willing to engage in economic blocks"

Because if it's true that these are individuals that are elites that have been segregated by society, these are the people that were in the higher ups, that did go to English-based schools in the time of colonialism. So who are you giving advantages to the most when you did go to English-based schools in the time of colonialism. So who are you giving advantages to the most when you're going to be instituting Western-based education models? Not the individuals on the ground who are in their rural areas who were oppressed. It is the racial elite. It is the elite of individuals that were given privileges arbitrarily through drawn lines by oppressive states. That is exactly why their side is perpetuating the inequality. And notice how it's just untrue that, oh, the majority race, therefore there's inequitability. Notice how a lot of states, even if they're multiracial in their context, have a unified national language. For example, within Malaysia, even if it is the majority race is Malay, the national language is the Malay language. It means even Chinese and Indian individuals propagate and practice this language previous, prior to colonization. It is untrue for them to just say, if you're Chinese, therefore you don't learn Malay. They need to understand how a country actually functions.

Panel, do we literally build trade blocs because we all speak English or is it just an economically salient policy? I think it's the latter. Individuals in post-colonized states all suffered plunder and therefore work together. You don't need to speak the same language, panel, in order for you to have the benefits.

              "text": "proven why this was any better. I'm going to look at three areas in this speech. Firstly, on the culture and principle, which to be fair is the bulk of their case. Secondly, on which side reduces conflict. And finally, on which side increases development. Firstly, let's talk about culture and principles. This is essentially what they default to in third speaker. They say we should not accept colonialism because this is a thing which is extremely abhorrent. We probably agree, colonialism is bad, but this does not mean that we should erase everything that colonialism has brought. For instance, Western ideals of democracy was precisely what was used to criticize colonialism, and therefore I don't think this necessarily means an erasure of the pre-existing culture. Simply because you choose to accept some motifs of Western thinking does not mean that you become completely Westernized. So for instance, although 40% of Filipino Chinese might speak English, many of them are still Buddhists and celebrate Chinese festivals, so I don't think that this is something that wins them this debate overall. Moreover, they have this small line about reparations, but given that they have not proven why it's likely that you can extract those reparations on their side, they cannot claim this as a substantial benefit. So many of the one-liners that they give us fall out of this debate. Moreover, they tell us there's an idea of a moral compass that is imposed by colonialism. For instance, the idea of sodomy and divorce laws. I'm sorry, but those things occur during the colonial period, not during the post-colonial period. So given this, many Filipinos are already Catholic at the point of decolonization, and thus it's very likely that it will still impose those laws regardless of whether or not they were more westernized in culture. Therefore, there's something that's probably symmetrical and does not win them the debate in terms of ethical systems. But where I want to make the sharpest attack is the idea of their comparative. Because on their side, they have colonialism as well, but simply through other means. Culture is still taken away when it's the majority culture that gets to decide whether or not you go to school and learn a specific language that you want, or whether or not you get to read certain magazines or books, because you can simply ban those things. So if they want to hang their case on the idea of kowtowing to your oppressor, I think this is a pirate victory on their side. On their side, the minorities in Burma have to choose between Burmese erasure and British erasure, and they have not shown why the first or the second is preferable. But in fact, AUSA actually told you explicitly in second speaker that it's worth to have this imposed by a majority culture in your country. This is because the minority elite benefits when that occurs, and we think that it's a bad thing that happens. This is not something you responded to in the previous speech. I think it's a concession that perhaps our side is better in terms, even on the case of that principle. But moreover, that principle is also hinged on the idea that it is inequitable, that only some people speak English. So, if we're able to prove to you that there are incentives to diffuse this culture throughout the entire population, we win. But we've already shown you this since first, when we told you that some people oftentimes want more people to speak the same language so they can work in their company, so they can staff in their civil service. Therefore, the elite has the incentive to diffuse those languages and norms, which means that on our side of the house, it is very likely that the entire population will have access to this rather than simply a small sliver. What I've therefore proven in this first clash is that their principle is out of this realm. And in fact, there are huge incentives for this diffusion to occur."

They say it's highly circumstantial that there's racial diversity and hierarchy, but it's simply untrue because the way that borders were badly drawn because of divide and rule tactics employed by colonizers, which we told you in first and second in which they had no response. So we accept this is the majority burden and DESA has to defend that majority. In this comparative, no thank you. The homogenous elite group is likely to seek everyone else to assimilate. There are a few reasons why there is a homogenous elite group. Firstly, because of divide and rule, and because colonisers wanted to establish a permanent elite they could work with. And secondly, because when colonisers left, they gave it to a specific group to ensure a degree of stability. What this therefore means is that there is one elite group that is able to push their culture onto everyone else. Their only response, and this came late in Third Speaker, is the idea that a path to independence requires racial harmony. This is in fact untrue. First of all, racial homogeneity in the army tended to be a good thing. So for example, in India, it mostly tended to be people of the Hindi race. But moreover, many colonial powers"

For example, in Philippines, where it was hoisted upon them rather than something that was actively fought for. Therefore, a homogenous culture is imposed on their side of the house. What does this mean? This means that on their side, they have this homogenous culture that belongs with indigenous roots rather than something imposed by the West. This in fact has huge differences on the way in which people live. In Malaysia, where you impose Bahasa as a national language, the Malay and the Chinese boy go to school and the Malay boy already has the head start. There's I can say Malay might be easier to learn, but this is cold comfort towards the Chinese boy who sees that his classmate is already so far ahead of him at a point at which they reach the age of seven. But on our side at least, it is a language that both cannot speak, a language that perhaps they can use to learn together, to build a new history rather than base themselves on those divides. English, a language that you can probably learn far easier due to globalization. Well, compare yourself to living in a Karen city, Burma, where it's very unlikely that you get that exposure to Burmese at the end of the day. So, what I've proven in this clash is that we greatly reduce racial conflict. Perhaps there might be still a 1% who speaks English better than everyone else, but we think that having a 1% versus 99% divide versus a 50-50 divide between races is something that is at least preferable. At the end of the day, we get that far better racial preferences. Before I move on to my final clash, I'll take your point. Why are these individuals who care so much about racial lines on our side, after westernization, still not going to be imposing the same kinds of things? How does teaching English to an entire population mean that they're not going to divide and conquer as well on your side? Because the fact that they want westernization means that they want people in their company who are able to do their job, who are able to speak English. Therefore, they have an incentive to educate people across the board. So I think that there's in fact less of those ties of kinship and patronage on our side of the house compared to on your side when this is how you get money, when this is how the way your system works. And that is the only way that you have been able to move up the social ladder. Moreover, Desai had a very flippant response to my second speaker's argument. He told you that there's actually more conflict on their side of the house at a point at which countries against each other fight because of animosities. They cannot simply reduce this to language, but it's also about animosities, for instance, between Vietnam and Cambodia, which they"

So, elites tend to be in those countries permanently, and this is probably not something that wins them the debate. But here they hang their idea about fitting things to the local context. We agree that this happens, but they have not shown us why structurally it is likely that they'll fit into the local context in a way which benefits the local people. Common law, in fact, might be a very good thing in many countries where there isn't this idea of property yet. But I suspect that when you mean fitting to a local context, they mean what my first speaker already told you, that a state is able to impose authoritarian structures at a point at which criticising that is seen as blasphemy. On their side of the house, it's far more difficult to criticize a particular structure when it's seen as epitomizing what your country stands for, rather than if it's a westernized system that is seen that can be critiqued. For these reasons, we believe that it's our side that ensures racial equity and protection. We are proud to oppose."

Their world must be one in which the majority culture abounds. We hear a very late response in the third speaker as to why this is not true. He claims a cultural alliance is necessary to end colonialism, therefore there is multiculturalism on their side. My third speaker already proved why this is not true, but we also preempted this, because even if this is true at the point of decolonization, a lot of these cultural alliances fail immediately after, because these elites see no reason to work together after the colonial enemy has been defeated. Therefore, their world is one of cultural dominance and hegemony. There are a few harms of this. First, they harm democracy. We gave you this argument in our first speech, and they largely did not respond. We showed when your governance is tied to your national culture rather than the universal culture of westernization, as on our side, it becomes increasingly difficult to criticize those policies, because criticism of your government is seen as criticism of your race, or of your religion, or of your culture. We gave you examples like India, for instance, where criticism of the BJP government is cast as criticism of Hinduism and therefore easily shut down. This strategically outweighs their argument on bad Western policies. Even if it is true that elites on our side impose policies that are not tailored to their societies, it is easier to change those policies on our side of the house when you have a stronger, more functioning democracy that can get rid of those particular policies. On their side, you have authoritarian rule that guarantees that these policies can never be rooted out. Second, their side is one of regional conflict. This was the argument I second speaker gave you to no response from them. The pre-colonial era was not some idyllic time of universal peace. Many of these pre-colonial cultures have long histories of conflict with one another, and when you force them to default to those identities, these conflicts will re-emerge. Finally, proposition collapses to their principle. They say it is wrong to impose the colonial culture. We say it is no better to impose the culture of people who have been oppressing you for millennia before colonialism, like the Burmans to the Karens in Myanmar, for instance. So that principle is not something they can default to in the reply speaker. What about our side? The key attack they make on our side is the argument of brain drain. We showed, contrary to the accusation from their third speaker, there are structural reasons for this brain drain not to occur, precisely because these post-colonial elites are viewed as underclasses of society in the Western countries that Proposition claims they will move to, and therefore there's a structural incentive not for them to move.

Self-defense can look like bloody wars or cracking down on protesters could look like maintaining control. These are situations that are fair game in this debate. Second point of setup, this debate is not about things like peacekeeping, joint training ventures, or intelligence sharing mechanisms. We are perfectly fine with these things, so we are not leaving these countries alone. We just oppose the unaccountable and inflammatory method of international military aid. And then finally, this debate is not just about the US giving aid. Countries like Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia give a ton of international military aid too. Opposition must contend with the states who don't necessarily have the best incentives. On our side, we prefer a world where no states give international military aid."

              "end": 633.88,
              "text": "On my first point then about more war. So there are two reasons why the states who give military aid often give it poorly, even if they don't actively have malicious incentives. Firstly, these states often prioritize consolidating their strategic alliances, not necessarily focusing on good or humane military objectives. And this is because the donors of aid are far away from the conflict. They're very insulated from it. So they don't necessarily have a direct interest in whether people who are a thousand miles away or very different from you ethnically and religiously are dying. Instead, this aid is often prioritized to strategic locations because that is an impact that actively manifests in your country's politics. For example, the U.S. funds Israel because it's the one democratic country in a sea of Middle Eastern countries, or Russia and Belarus are quite close because Belarus is a staunch ally of Putin. This means instead of caring about humanitarian ends, as opposition might claim, this aid is often effectively unconditional because that alliance matters more than the result of the conflict. Secondly, on economic interests. So the Israel lobby in the US, oil interests in Saudi Arabia, Turkish control over the Black Sea and wanting to have access to the Black Sea often means that you give aid to some countries that are strategically important to you over others. You want to curry their favor and establish control within those areas. So instead of this aid going to states who are actually vulnerable, you prioritize the countries that can help your country the most. Why is this aid going to escalate conflict then? There are four reasons for this. Firstly, because there's a lack of accountability. So the recipients of this aid are often quite unstable just by the nature of the motion, like they are in a conflict, so they need the aid in the first place. This often translates into there being a lack of democratic checks or legitimacy to the government, things like ethnic divisions within the country. This means that the government that uses this aid is both unaccountable, but often uses this aid poorly and has the incentive to use it to entrench its own power. So this looks like Israel using US aid to bomb Palestinian villages, Maduro using Russian aid to roll tanks down the streets and quash protesters. The second reason why this aid will escalate conflict is because you give them more sophisticated weaponry. This is just definitionally true, given that you're receiving money from rich countries and you're now able to buy weapons from their companies. So instead of pistols, you now have machine guns. And even in opposition's best cases with things like terrorism, terrorists are notoriously hard to find, especially with the lack of intelligence gathering mechanisms, which is often the case in these poorer countries. The only addition with international military aid then is that you get more bombs to throw around that kill civilians, that rip families apart, that turn hospitals to rubble. And those are far more sophisticated and destructive. The third reason this point is true is because this funding is two-sided. So there are international rivalries that often manifest in proxy conflicts. China and the US butt heads in the South China Sea by funding opposing countries. The US and Russia fund opposing sides in the war in Syria. This means that it's not just giving money to one side that they can then use this money to just stop the conflict. You are highly unlikely to end the conflict at all because both sides get bankrolled. And so they just clash against each other and that conflict gets worse and worse. The final mechanism here is that you have no incentive to negotiate and actually have an end to the conflict. To come to the table, both sides need to be vulnerable. They need to be unable or unwilling to withstand the economic costs of that conflict anymore. So both sides are like, let's come together and put an end to this. But when you are both being bankrolled by different wealthy countries who seemingly have unending reserves of cash, there is no cost to this conflict or not as great of a cost. So you are then just showing weakness when the other side is being paid and you are saying, let's negotiate. This means that countries have no incentive to come to the table and conflicts go on and on. International military aid merely adds fuel to the fire and causes more death and suffering. But for my second point, I'll take the POI. The premise of your argument is that these countries only care about strategic partnerships when giving aid. If that is true, why are they likely to give humanitarian efforts or share intelligence in a mannerism that helps the most vulnerable on your side of the house? No, no, no. Don't let opposition make this debate into either you fund entirely one thing or entirely the other. We are saying that states incentives primarily align with strategic objectives. So the states that are strategically important to you will receive more aid and receive it more often, which means the scale of the harm is greater. Of course, there might be isolated instances where there's humanitarian aid, but this debate needs to be one of weighing. Second point"

              "text": "then about why military aid leads to harmful leverage. The prior point talks about cases where the aid is given by countries without malicious incentives, which is opposition's best case. This point is about the very real cases where countries want conflict. So these are different situations. The two arguments aren't tense. Opposition must contend with this point as well, instead of engaging in a very narrow framework. The characterization here is that the states who have the money to give military aid, while the recipients become dependent on that aid because they need that aid to resolve their conflict, have huge amounts of leverage over the countries that receive that aid. There are two problems that manifest here. Firstly, that these states often have an active incentive to create conflict. This looks like religious incentives, like wanting to expand the influence of your particular sect of Islam, or wanting control over strategically important regions, such as being able to get more control through creating instability, which precludes other countries from getting involved or just knocks other countries out of the area. So this looks like Qatar, who funds the central government of Somalia, while the UAE and Saudi Arabia fund other regions like Somaliland instead, because both actors want control over the Red Sea shipping routes. This means that these actors end up clashing within the country, where Qatar's military aid goes towards bombing other regions of the country for their own power trip and to kick Saudi Arabia out while entire villages go up in rubble. The second problem here is that aid often creates loyalty, which is harmful. So elites are given power and often enriched by the aid that they receive. Corruption is common in these countries, and there's often little accountability by a state that is embroiled in war, especially when the other side is bankrolled too. There's no incentive to back down. These actors actively want to keep being involved in the conflict because it benefits them. They're receiving a continuous stream of cash. So this looks like Russia funding the Belarusian government's ability to buy arms in order to get closer access to Crimea in order to resist NATO influence in Eastern Europe. So when Russian troops are now able to move more freely within the Belarusian border, this increases the chance of conflict reoccurring, and it extremely harms pro-democracy efforts around the world. On proposition, we believe that military aid can be abused and is actually counterproductive to its aims. International military aid donors claim to be firefighters, but in reality, they're the arsonists. I'm so proud to propose."

              "text": "to say about the characterization of the comparative in this debate. That is to say, proposition cannot make out arms deals so that guns and bombs can still be bought on their side of the house. What that means then is that when they talk about actors such as authoritarian governments, when they talk about actors like terrorism, it is very likely that these individuals and groups will still be buying arms on both sides of the house. Why is this the case? Because authoritarians are rich. They often have a huge amount of resources, which is why they're able to put down their oppression towards their people because they have, for example, money that they spend on the military. Authoritarians have control over industrialization, which means that they can start producing guns and arms instead and start buying guns instead of having them as aid. And terrorism, for example, can have money through the black market, like the way that the Taliban sells heroin, or they can employ child soldiers and other ways of grassroots levying arms on their side of the house. So they have to tell us necessarily how these dangerous actors are stopped from getting dangerous weapons when individual aid pulls out. That being said, the comparative in this debate is about vulnerable actors who don't have the money, don't have the capital, don't have the resources and infrastructure to have military assistance when that aid pulls out. Firstly, then, why do we protect vulnerable actors? What do these actors look like? Firstly, it looks like in post-conflict societies that are ravaged by insurgents. It looks like South Sudan who deals with Janjaweed, who are killing innocent civilians. It looks like Ser post-conflict societies that are ravaged by insurgents. It looks like South Sudan who deals with Janjaweed, who are killing innocent civilians. It looks like Serbian extremists in Kosovo who want to kill the Albanian ethnicity group there. Secondly, it looks like oppressed minorities and stateless groups, like Kurdish individuals inside of Turkey, who for every day have to struggle for their right to sovereignty. The Chechnyan freedom fighters who have to stand up to the entire military of Putin. Thirdly, it is those countries that are surrounded by hostile actors are incredibly vulnerable positions. South Korea after the Korean War, Israel in the 70s, when America came in and supported them with the Iron Dome and THAAD, that necessarily means they have the creation of that state. So they have to tell us necessarily then uniquely how they help these actors. What do we think the incentives are to help those actors on our side of health? And note, if they want to mech for things such as humanitarian aid and peacekeeping, then those incentives are symmetric, that there is a strategic resource. But listen, why do strategic incentives and altruistic humanitarian incentives usually align?"

To that extent, then, you have an incentive to make sure that terrorist groups and insurgents don't run amok because that hurts your bottom line. Secondly, when you want to secure actors, when you want to secure allies, you have an incentive to make sure that those allies are not rogue nations. You have an incentive to make sure that they are not looked down on the international stage, that they have a say in the UN because they don't oppress freedoms of human rights. So if you want to build strategic allies, then it probably means you have an incentive to democratize, liberalize, or make these actors more reliable because that means you have a better ally in the global stage. But thirdly, it is about global perception. The hegemons in the status quo are fighting for a perception of trust. When you look at comparatives between American aid and the BRI, China and America are trying to bolster their PR in terms of helping these nations and helping these stateless groups to the extent that they have an incentive to make sure that they want to secure long-term allies. It has to be done in a good way. So everything I tell us about strategic reasoning is correct. Those strategic reasonings often align with altruistic incentives."

              "text": "Why is the comparative insufficient then? And why is aid uniquely the only mechanism to help these vulnerable groups? The first thing to note here is that the political capital in the status quo means that if you cannot send them aid, you usually send them nothing at all. Because these issues are too macro for voters to care about. When you worry about the dynamics in regional areas and the conflicts that are happening in places far away from the world, it is very unlikely that a politician can belittling say that we are going to send troops on the ground, we're going to endanger the lives of young Americans, young American men and women, and send them over there. It is a much more unreliable way to support these individual countries because there's an irrational reaction at the point in which you become much, much more involved, which is the comparative on their side of the house. That means they probably do have to support a world in which these people aren't helped at all, or in the case in which it's like UN peacekeeping, it's helped to an incredibly ineffectual extent. But even if they have other alternatives, why are they not as good as aid? Firstly, because aid has the flexibility of cash. The solutions are incredibly different for different countries, and that cash is the best way to empower those nations to make that country. They can invest in different things like artillery shells if it's for defensive, or for AK-47s if they have to do more guerrilla fighting. These are things that are different when you look at the individual context. But secondly, aid uniquely upholds the sovereignty of the places that these countries are going to. But secondly, aid uniquely upholds the sovereignty of the places that these countries are going to. The fact is that these countries understand the specific plans and context better than American soldiers. It means that they themselves can have their own control over where that money goes to and over where those arms are controlled. But thirdly, it's about long-termism. That upon their side of the house, they support things such as military intervention through sending in troops. Then eventually, at some point, you have to pull out, and when you pull out, you leave a vacuum. When aid doesn't do that, because instead it builds up a slow amount of infrastructure that can continuously be used. So right now, if America were to pull out all aid from Israel, they'll be allowed to survive even in the most hostile settings because of the fact that they'd already built up that infrastructure when they're an incredibly fragile state. What is the impact of this? That you need these military arms in order for these countries to survive. Because while they talk about things such as building infrastructure, buildings and hospitals don't do anything when ISIS is running around killing civilians. When you need that military aid, then establish the humanitarian aid that they want to protect the peacekeepers, to protect the contractors, to protect infrastructure development, only we get that. When we bolster the defense of young nations and vulnerable groups, it means the Kurds can stand up for one more day against ISIS and Erdogan. They can hold their village against these foreign actors. It means that the territory captured by Boko Haram that kidnaps and tortures young women can get pushed back and those people can finally be liberalized. It means that people in Korea in the 70s can sleep safe at night knowing that they do not have to worry about an imminent evasion coming from North Korea. All the things only happen when you empower those governments to have the arms to protect their sovereignty before i go and i'd be happy to take a poi so i don't think you listen to our model we had joint training ventures intelligence sharing mechanisms to find the terrorists that are far more sophisticated than throwing cash at the problem why do you need machine guns and bombs that end up mowing down the civilians you want to save okay firstly like that's symmetric that's symmetric, right? If you can have intelligence sharing, we have that too. But secondly, what good is it knowing where a terrorist is if you can't shoot them?"

They make proxy wars worse for three reasons. Firstly, it is more escalatory because instead, when these governments still have an incentive to, for example, meddle in the politics of the Middle East because it's incredibly important for their oil trade then they'll have to do something about it like american jews will still push for the lobby to do something about the issue of the palestinian antifada to the extent that it is much more likely that you send individual troops which even further worsens all of their problems of proxy wars because now if you kill an american soldier that in and of itself is a declaration of World War III. But secondly, they have less accountability, because if these nations instead turn to other forms of military assistance in terms of funding their own militaries, it means that there's no way that America can ever reel them back in the point in which human rights abuses get too bad. That is why, for example, Saudi Arabia has been curbing their human rights atrocities inside of the Yemeni war because of the fact that there is international backlash from America. But thirdly, you have less control at the point in which you pull out at any point means that these countries turn into a vacuum. We would say that it's better to have necessary interventions at some point when that inaction leads to the death of a million of people. They need to provide us how they help vulnerable actors and why proxy wars don't get worse on their side of the house. Very proud to oppose."

But crucially, funding leads to conflict for all the reasons that we provided you, that funding leads to increased tension and funding fuels conflict between sides. But furthermore, it means that states are unlikely to make the calculation in the first place, that obviously there is a substantial cost to the AU deciding whether or not they would like to send in peacekeeping troops. But if it is easier and more possible to send in hundreds of millions of dollars, then that is the more likely thing for them to do. The question is, which solutions do they make more available to these actors?

North Korea is a hostile actor who is funded by the USSR, and that suggests that this very nature of military aid is what is leading to these conflicts in the first place. So crucially, then, there are cases where there isn't that symmetric incentive to be humanitarian. So it is the case that Russia has a unique incentive then to do things like fund Maduro to allow him to quash protesters or do the same thing in Belarus. So what that means is that this example doesn't apply in the vast majority of circumstances where there's huge amounts of funding that occurs through pernicious actors. But thirdly, we agree that is unlikely to happen in most cases. But peacekeeping is what we think is likely to occur in lots of cases. And the reason is we think that these types of conflicts are likely to secure widespread buy in. And the reason is because there is spillover. In the context of Africa, for example, there is spillover between Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea. And that suggests that there is huge amounts of incentive on the part of peacekeeping actors to engage because society writ large is being affected by these conflicts. This is true of the UN as well, where the notion that a multiplicity of states within that union are being affected leads to international pressure to engage in the first place.

People have access to weapons, they have access to money, and that is used to fuel things like terrorism, which is why we've seen the emergence of terrorism in the aftermath of huge amounts of engagement on the part of the United States. But I do want to bring back some of the analysis that we suggest. There is a collective action problem because the problem is that states are funding both sides of the conflict. Therefore, the need for defense is raised by this policy. So our states might otherwise be more protected and more capable of dealing with these problems, they become less able to do so because we fund the conflict on both sides. So that means where the United States and Russia are funding two opposing sides of the conflict, that you increase the risk to either country, and that increases the need for defense. If you eliminate that in the first place, these countries are much safer and much better off. Our argument then is on more war. And this is important to note that oftentimes, even where this aid has conditions attached, that it often is functionally unconditional. And the reason is because there is a reactionary funding mechanism and a huge strategic interest to provide these countries with huge amounts of aid."

So that suggests that vulnerable actors have two things. One, they are made worse off because of the long-term effects of having these weapons existing in the country in the first place, where you have machine gun now where terrorist organizations otherwise wouldn't have access to them.

On to the second area of this speech on how states exercise leverage and on our argument or on the arguments on comparative. I'll take a POI quickly. In the status quo, what is your comparative for assisting the Kurds and stopping them from being genocided by the Turkish government? So we think there are things like in the status quo that currently exist, like joint training missions, which are already accommodating for that. Okay. On to how states exercise leverage. So their argument is broadly that you will go in and you will engage. And that will be negative, although this is slightly tense. But I assume there's like a they're operating in different circumstances, like taking it as our best or something. We think that foreign intervention is unlikely to happen in most cases because there are substantial incentives not to do this. First, because the substantial human and economic cost of war. This is particularly true of all actors in the debate, particularly a side like Russia, which doesn't have the domestic capital to be able to engage in wide-scale war. But second, because the cultural trauma associated with interventions like that of Afghanistan and the huge amount of failures that have resulted from them. So these are unlikely, but where these conflicts do happen and intervention does occur, we think it is better. First, because often funding through aid precludes positive intervention like AU peacekeeping forces, and this is especially true when funding increases. But second, because greater accountability checks exist through media attention and public scrutiny when war is a massive cost to your image as a leader. But lastly, on their notion of backlash, we think that it is far more true of money because accountability checks are far removed. First, because it often occurs through private contractors that are separated from the state. But second, the governments are far from the actions. It isn't actually their troops committing the human rights atrocities. And so in that sense, they are far more immune from all the damage and all the backlash that stems from that. So that suggests that comparative won't arise. But our argument on leverage is much more important, that there's a significant desire to create tension in these regions. But more than that, even if the money is going to these vulnerable actors, it isn't being spent correctly. Instead, it is going into the hands of elites and it isn't being used to benefit vulnerable people. For that reason, then, proud to propose. I thank second proposition."

That's a problem, because if their problem is with people checking each other, even if not through the form of humanitarian aid, they're going to do so in other ways. So if I send peacekeepers in, you will send more. I send tanks in, you will send more. It still escalates conflicts in the same way that they want to describe."

But two, I would argue to you that it is a good thing that this tracking mechanism exists because there are natural incentives to trade with strongmen like Saudi Arabian MBS or Assad because they rule a country and you want to get on their good side. But versus small groups like Kurds, when it's just about a humanitarian stance to stand for their country, they're likely going to be very weak later on and there's no practical benefit of us helping them there's lack of incentive to fund them so in their house they'll just trade with Assad or trade with Saudi Arabia because it makes a lot of money and gains of an ally but no one is there to like help the Kurds this only exists when you think there's a necessity to check the other side and you can easily do it by giving them some money and people wouldn't fight back against you because you're not sending in troops and troops of people and sacrificing your own people so if anything we help the most vulnerable of individuals like stateness minorities second of all let's talk about the actor of terrorists because what they said is that we will give them better weapons on our side of the house firstly again they need proof to why this is exclusive when they can go to the black market and get things but two even if they are given better weapons like we also get more information when we can set up alert systems we can have better weapons to target them so we don't do lower the collateral damage of when a like grassroots government is trying to target them you have a lot of collateral damage because you have to go through the civilians versus when you have proper arms proper alert systems proper gps tracking devices you target the terrorists without all that collateral damage that exists on their side of the house but thirdly regarding the like inflaming of these terrorist sentiment it's worse on their side of the house. But thirdly, regarding the like inflaming of these terrorist sentiment, it's worse on their side. Because when American troops are sent in on these peacekeeping missions, then American soldiers are bombing your houses. You will demonize the West and buy into the terrorist narrative.

One, all they give to you is that incentives of global hegemons are bad because they will only focus on strategic regions. First, same thing for peacekeeping and troop training. You will only go into strategic regions because you can't send an infinite amount of commanders to go in there and train individuals. But two, if they see that incentives of the global actors are bad, these effects will actualize in a worse way on their side of the house when there are actual troops being sent in, actual commanders sent in, and actual tanks sent in. And this is why. Because ultimately, the tanks and troops answer to Russian command, answer to China command, versus when money is transaction, I can't just wire it back to my own bank account with my own will. You get obsolete control over what you want to use it for. So in the example of Kosovo, for example, their goal is to establish their own country and protect Albanians from ethnic persecution. That's what the government is going to use it for, because that was their goal with the money their own country and protect albanians from ethnic persecution that's what the government is going to use it for because that was their goal with the money versus if russia gets to control the troops that are trying to achieve this mission they'll focus on their own strategic regions as they want to talk about and focus on protecting only the resource rich areas the oil rich areas instead of protecting the albanians because we're not a government trying to establish coastal well we're just trying to take care of our strategic regions so that control on their side is a very bad thing that undercuts all their positive impacts.

And that's the assertion from the proposition that the second world end is not prolonged. That's an automatic good. But that also just means Assad's steamroll over its people and therefore war ended really quickly. Or Nazi Germany suddenly won World War Two because no one stand in resistance. What we're doing is we're bridging that gap. The people with power, with money, they're going to launch wars on either side of the house because they see a window of opportunity. Aid doesn't come in those circumstances because aid are like these two countries are ready to fight wars when they've accumulated that wealth. Aid comes to counteract that. When you allow Britain and the US to mobilize and stand against Nazi Germany, it will give us a fighting chance. Vulnerable actors are ones counting on aid, whereas authoritarian regimes will strong-arm their way out of situations we're so proud to oppose."

              "text": "rebel groups for fear of alienating other more powerful state actors like Turkey, who would be very, very mad if you do so. This is why the overwhelming characterization in this debate and the overwhelming amount of military aid that is actually given is given to countries like Syria by Russia, to Belarus or Israel or Saudi Arabia. So let me engage now with the example, and the overwhelming amount of military aid that is actually given is given to countries like Syria by Russia, to Belarus, or Israel, or Saudi Arabia. So let me engage now with the arguments they give us to why states have good incentives. Firstly, they say states have an incentive to create political and economic stability and reliable trade partners. There are a couple things to point out. Number one, geographical distance means you do not bear the cost of instability. The U.S. does not bear the cost of buildings being bombed in Gaza. Congressmen in the U.S. simply say it was just self-defense. Second, the state being backed may want economic stability in a vacuum, but you have to consider two additional features. Number one, oftentimes it is possible to use instability to actually rile up your base politically. Take the example of Israel. It's people who are closest to the Iron Dome in Israel, closest to rocket attacks coming in from Gaza, who are most likely to support Netanyahu, because the instability and fear of their lies actually emboldens strongman leaders like Netanyahu. So it's not even clear if those strongmen themselves that an opposition is necessarily backing have an incentive to de-escalate for those reasons. The next thing I tell you is you don't want allies that are rogue countries. Like, I mean, I just question this on face, given that the U.S. effectively partners with Saudi Arabia. And my prior response on accountability, I think, deals with this argument. All right. Then what we told you is that the actual incentives of states giving aid are this, that it's a way of consolidating strategic alliances, not a way of accomplishing inherently good objectives with respect to minimizing human casualties. One, because you don't face the consequences of war very far away. Second, because you often have strategic incentives to consolidate influence. For example, Gulf states face the consequences of war very far away. Second, because you often have strategic incentives to consolidate influence. For example, Gulf states in the Horn of Africa, where Qatar, for instance, has an incentive to kick out Saudi Arabia and the UAE, because whoever controls Horn of Africa controls the Red Sea and therefore can shut off shipping routes to the rest of the world for their enemy in the Gulf. So often vital strategic interests, even if it causes instability to necessarily consolidate your influence and back other states. Thirdly, because we told you there are often political and economic incentives like the Israel lobby in the United States or oil in Saudi Arabia, no analysis with this whatsoever. All these reasons suggest that on balance, you're going to be funding worse actors rather than the good ones. The next thing they claim they give is you need money for vulnerable actors. I already outframed their example on the Kurds, but a couple of additional responses I want to give. Number one, this doesn't engage with our collective action problem analysis, which is that one country might back a region whose aims are desirable, but if that country's enemy funds the opposing side in a quasi-proxy conflict, on net, this simply leads to more conflict. We gave you the example of Saudi Arabia and the UAE backing semi-autonomous regions in Somalia, and Qatar backing the central government of Somalia in opposition. So even if in theory you can back good groups, the only reason you need to back good groups is because your opponents are funding and backing groups that are oppositional to them. This is why we'd be better off with no aid whatsoever in a world where you wouldn't have these military conflicts at all. Secondly, because in cases where there are existential conflicts to the region and threats abroad, like jihadists or piracy, there are active incentives for other forms of assistance. For example, like AU peacekeeping or coalitions to crack down on terrorist efforts. Note, in these cases, there is a sufficient mass of other countries interested in preventing these harms, and that is why you actually end up getting the positive forms of interventions we talked about. But finally, we told you that oftentimes preferable alternatives like peacekeeping are actively crowded out by the amount of conflict that exists within these countries, an argument that was given in second and that was unengaged with. That when you back countries to actual military aid, you are less likely to get the types of humanitarian interventions that we talked about, which oftentimes happen effectively due to the amount of multilateral efforts and accountability that you have in these cases. They could try to wash out the entirety of the debate. They didn't engage their actual analysis as to why these states have poor incentives. Second theme, irrespective of what the donors incentives are, here's why conflict gets worse. Before I go on, I'll take the POI. How do you resolve the underlying causes of wars that happen before military aid comes into the picture? That happened before military aid. Well, we gave the analysis in second, which I'll get into now, but why there's an active incentive to deescalate on our side of the house, which is eliminated on your side when you get bankrolled. But I'm going to get into that in a moment. So on their argument, which is now proxy conflicts are going to get worse. We told you this is massively unlikely, given that there are strong incentives not to go to war in the majority of cases. It means you're losing your troops. It means you're losing your soldiers. It means you're enduring massive economic costs. But in the relatively few cases where there is broad international support for humanitarian interventions, we think those cases can be desirable. And crucially, this is the link. States have realized that self-interested wars are never in their own interest, given the massive cost of their own soldiers, given the political costs where it's more desirable to spend money at home. This is why the wars that are fought are actually the good ones. They end up looking like PSC peacekeeping missions in Africa. Because what we told you is that for the most part, states don't have the vicious proxy war incentives to go into war and fight terrible conflicts because they realize in the long run that will come back to bite them and it won't be politically palatable in any way. This is why in most cases, it's unlikely to be the alternative. But in cases where it is the alternative, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Finally, our analysis on why conflict gets worse. They never actually engaged with our analysis, which is that if both sides are being bankrolled, you have no incentive to mediate. Their response was money allows for de-escalation, but this was literally just a counter assertion and second opposition. I have no idea what the analysis actually was there. Our argument was very simple. Two sides only have an incentive to mediate, to negotiate, and to de-escalate when they can no longer endure the economic and military consequences of staying in and prolonging that conflict. They are able to do so when both sides are being backed by international aid that they are capable of receiving solely on the basis that it has aid and that it does not arms deals. And that is why on their side, you completely undermine any prospect for negotiation and de-escalation. Third theme then on leverage. And I don't leave much time for this because we still have not gotten a response after 16 minutes of opposition. What we told you that sometimes aid is unconditional, but sometimes where there's huge asymmetric leverage that a country holds over other countries, there is the ability to implement conditions on the way that is used. But crucially, that allows rich states who don't necessarily have the best incentives to use this leverage for malicious reasons. One, we told you about how often states give aid as an incentive to create conflict, to consolidate control over strategically important regions. We gave you the example of Qatar and the Horn of Africa. Second, we told you in the first speech about how this creates a sense of loyalty, how you feel as though you owe Saudi Arabia favors as an elite who's being enriched by the aid that they are giving you. And as a consequence, you are willing to spark military conflict in your region. Now, crucially, authoritarian regimes abroad that are funding you, like Saudi Arabia, do not care because they do not face the actual consequences of instability because it's far away and geographically isolated. But the people on the ground do care when they face the massive cost of economic instability, when they face the massive increase in human casualties that occur, when faraway actors are sparking conflict at their expense. We're very happy to propose."

              "text": "the two types of conflicts we have talked about in this debate. First, on proxy wars, and second, on the protection of the most vulnerable actors. First, let us discuss the point about proxy wars. Understand the characterization of proxy wars, which is usually regime to regime conflict. So this is Saudi Arabia versus Iran. This is Ethiopia versus Eritrea. The proposition claim we get under here is that you create an escalation of warfare to the point where the US and Russia found opposing sides. The first thing to understand is that those proxy wars will still exist on both sides of the house, right? Because Saudi Arabia wants to be the Sunni protectorate. Iran wants to be the Shia protectorate. Those religious fault lines still exist. Those wars will still exist on both sides of the house, right? Because Saudi Arabia wants to be the Sunni protectorate, Iran wants to be the Shia protectorate. Those religious fault lines still exist, those wars still exist. But second, we mitigate this argument to a huge extent when we told you that states like Saudi Arabia and Israel do not need American military aid. They are rich enough to buy the weapons themselves. Saudi Arabia can just buy from Lockheed Martin directly instead of using American military aid. Then proposition comes back and says, well, the difference is that they are more armed to the point where America is giving military aid. But the deadlock breaker in this clash isn't the amount of guns Saudi Arabia has, but rather it is the way we use them. And we proved to you from the offset that Saudi Arabia would use them better, the point in which America was involved in the conflict. The first thing we told you was accountability. That yes, first proposition is right when they say that Saudi Arabia is not a democratic state, but that rogue Saudi Arabia is still going to exist on their side of the house. In contrast, we have a leveraged bargaining chip on our side, the point when the United States is giving aid to Saudi Arabia. That is a point at which we can use the threat of pulling out that aid as a threat to get Saudi Arabia to come to the negotiation table. Is this threat perfect or is this threat huge? It's not, but it's a leverage and bargaining chip that simply does not exist on their side of the house. This is why you got the Abraham Accord signed, right? The reason why you got the Abraham Accord signed between Israel and Saudi Arabia was because the United States had some leveraging power there because they funded Saudi Arabia. But second, I think like Western weapons are good, right? Like the India-China debate three years ago. Like I think that those Western weapons mean that they're more accurate and it means that you're able to kill the target that you want to kill. In contrast, if Saudi Arabia doesn't have Western military assistance, that's a point at which they make chemical weapons. That's a point at which they make barrel bombs. That is when they use child soldiers and suicide bombers, right? Because those mechanisms and those weapons are cheaper, but those weapons also cause a lot more collateral damage, the point where they're unable to be regulated. Whereas in contrast, if you're giving them money to buy advanced US weaponry, at least you can target the right people. But third, let us talk about negotiation and peace talks, which is why we win this debate the clearest. The first thing they say is that you don't want to seem weak, and therefore you don't want to come to the negotiation table. Yeah, like weakness is a symmetrical harm, right? Like on either side, you don't want to seem weak. That's a symmetrical reason as to why you won't negotiate. But then they say that the point where both sides are bangful is also the point where there isn't an incentive in the negotiation. No, we think precisely the opposite is true. Because if state one in the conflict is being bangful by Russia and state two in the conflict is being bangful by the United States, then neither one of those two actors sees an end to the war. The point where they think that their enemy is very, very powerful because they're being banged by the other superpower. The point we're in that you create wars in which the U.S. funds one side and Russia funds another side, that's a deterrence as to why they'll come to the negotiation table. That's a deterrence as to why they'll be more likely to have peace talks. That is why there were peace talks in Vietnam panel, because like American troops realized they couldn't push on anymore because the Viet Cong was too wealthy and funded by Russia and China. So if anything, they only want to come to the negotiation table when they think that the other side is equally as powerful as them and therefore there isn't an imminent end to the conflict. Thus, that is when they can no longer see any positive gain of the conflict and why they're more likely to come to the negotiation table. In contrast, that incentive doesn't exist on their side of the house because the point we're in, your opposition isn't being funded by a superpower. That's a point where you might think that, hey, I might be able to take them out. But furthermore, on their side of the house because the point we're in, your opposition isn't being funded by a superpower. That's a point where you might think that, hey, I might be able to take them out. But furthermore, like the losses of the war are just bigger on our side when you're being funded by Russia and the United States. An incentive as to why you have to go to the negotiating table to prevent that from happening."

              "text": "In conclusion, we think proxy wars isn't going to win this debate because Saudi Arabia is still rich on both sides of the house. The bigger delta in this debate is when we talk to you about the protection of the vulnerable groups. Understand that there will always be an asymmetry between the powerful authoritarian despots versus the vulnerable minorities. This is because of numerical strength, so there are more Muslims than there are Kurds. This is also because Assad controls vital resources that the Kurds don't, and this is also because there are historical fault lines. Therefore, Assad will go after the Kurds with or without Russia. Saudi Arabia will engage in Sunni conflicts throughout the Middle East with or without the support of the United States or other actors. The difference then isn't whether or not those wars exist in the first place, but rather how you protect the vulnerable minorities. Because here's the thing. The marginal increase of Assad's capacity when Russia funds him is a lot smaller proportionally than the increase of the Kurdish capacity to defend themselves when America funds them. Because the difference between making a powerful actor on their side of the house more powerful and making a powerless actor in the status quo have some power on the other side of the house. So the Kurds on their side are going to be destroyed because those Kurds don't have the resources and the money to buy military supplies. Their response is, one, you're going to have joint training exercises. But what's the point of teaching them how to shoot a gun if you don't have the money to buy a gun, right? And furthermore, if you want to talk about humanitarian aid, humanitarian aid can only occur when these regimes trust you and you build that trust through giving them military aid. And you can only have humanitarian aid when you know for a fact that your peacekeepers won't be attacked. You can only get that security when you give them military aid so that they're able to have a powerful regime there, right? Therefore, the comparison isn't a world of peace, but rather a world of genocide on their side of the house. Peace, our proposition is a masquerade for the suppression that the Kurds will go through on their side of the house. There's a world in which Israel would be dead after the Six-Day War and wouldn't be a state today. This is how you should weigh this clash. Their highest impact is that conflicts will be prolonged the point we're in the US and Russia are paying for opposition sides. Here's the thing. The majority of people who die in those conflicts are combatants, right? They're the people who are using guns. In contrast, the people who would die on their side of the house, the point where Kurds stand stops getting funding. And as a result, Assad goes in. The people then that would die on their side of the house are not combatants, but rather children, mothers, and the entirety of their culture. So we think if you're the Kurds, it is preferable to fight a war against Assad than for Assad to literally suppress your entirety of your population. But lastly, let us talk about the question of incentives. They say that Americans"

Because those humanitarian missions are also far away. They also say that America has a strategic incentive and this strategic incentive is an altruistic. This is an assumption. Why are strategic incentives inherently a binary between what is good for the people? By their logic, they would oppose trade as well, because all trade happens through economic self-interest. So by their logic of strategic incentives was that bad of a thing that they would oppose trade as well. We told you that in many instances, the strategic incentives that side properties and things are problematic often align with what is good for the people on the ground. America has a strategic incentive to have stability and democracy, and because they want to have a good reputation, because they want to prop up actors that are predictable, which you only get when you prop up democracy, because authoritarian leaders can do whatever they want with or without American impunity. Therefore, that is the reason as to why America will prop up the right regimes in those areas. And furthermore, you have an incentive not to prop up terrorist groups because terrorist groups are unpredictable. So the choices between funding a terrorist group and funding a democratic actor, you would choose to fund a democratic actor. So their idea of strategic incentive is only a masquerade. They have never proven to you what a strategic incentives are inherently diametrical. There will always be the powerful and the powerless. But on all sides of the house, we give weapons and the support the powerless need to defend themselves. I am very proud to oppose."

When they don't answer these questions and just flippantly say, well, these people are insignificant, we on-site opposition stand firmly on the grounds that these people's voices and stances still deserve to be protected. There are three questions in this speech. One, their case is entirely symmetrical. And this is what you have to recognize behind the rhetoric that we are confusing or behind the rhetoric that the world has many problems. Because their problems is that global hegemons have poor incentives that exist on either side of the house, that they will only focus on strategic regions, that they want to stir up conflict, they want to outfly each other in geopolitics, that they're opportunists, they're selfish, that exists on either side. So when they support these global hegemons still doing something, like rolling in with training programs or peacekeeping troops, all of these incentives will still actualize on their side of the house."

The only thing they proved to you is that some bad authoritarian actors are currently funded by a military aid. Yes. And a status quo, they are. They've done thorough impacting on how this aid is bad. But what they didn't prove is if aid is removed, they will still acquire the same weapons through trade because of a few reasons that I did not disprove. One, Saudi Arabia is rich. They can use oil money to get the arms they need. Two, these are strongmen who control states, and therefore they have an incentive to build alliances and therefore still give them arms. And three, they can literally build their own weapons. North Korea is not rich, have a low GDP, but it can force people into building nukes anyway. So that is parallel when it comes to harms and the human rights impacting they thoroughly do about how they want to start wars with authoritarian regimes. What they don't answer to is like Kurds and Albanians issues. They're very, very much in the minority will be popular enough that Americans will support humanitarian aid or their own men, their own son, their own uncles going into fight wars for them. That if they themselves say this is a very distant issue, very small issue, why they will do anything at all to peacekeeping these regions. Exactly. Because men, exactly. Because Americans don't want to sacrifice their own like soldiers, their own people. That's why they will do nothing for the Kurds and the Albanians want to establish Kosovo and like stateless minorities, terrorists are not fought and new states are not protected. Lastly, on proxy wars, they assert that ending wars are good, but the risk of prolonging war increases on their side when one accidental injury of an American soldier sent in versus just American money means you have to declare war on their side. But two, when do negotiations happen? Negotiation doesn't happen when one side is destroying the other side. They'll just eradicate them completely. It happens when two sides are close in terms of ability, equally funded, and therefore we want to find a way out before it gets out of hand. It comes when there's mutually assured destruction, that USA and China are both involved, and we don't want to erupt into World War III, and therefore we come to the negotiating table. They don't mechanize everything they want to talk about around negotiating wars. But lastly, it's that opposition says short wars are not necessarily good. Because short wars exist when the powerful destroys the powerless, that they don't need to negotiate. They don't even have a fighting chance. The existing structures of imbalance actualize in the fact that they will destroy those who are powerless. Those who are powerful will find their ways to start wars and get weapons. But aid is the last helping hand we can lend to the Kurds"

But also, this was a weird burden for AAP to push on us, because if we prove that military aid creates and escalates conflict, we won't need to see millions of people die before we can ever resolve it. Secondly, then, on the nature of conflict. They keep talking about the Kurds, ignoring the fact that we framed out their main examples about things like rebel groups by explaining that military aid often never goes to non-state actors, as we said in third, because of the same accountability mechanisms that they explain in first off, and because of the risk of alienating allies such as Turkey by funding rebel groups or funding the Kurds. They're powerless, the powerless here that remain powerless, but the oppressors, which are the governments actually get strengthened. Like even if they say that they will somewhat go after minorities either way, like they have more accurate machine guns, which is the example that opposition gives, but also billions more dollars to purchase bombers. So people get killed faster and in bloodier ways and to a far larger extent. We also give you structural analysis as to why the primary givers and recipients of aid would be problematic. Firstly, on strategic interests, that's why we give more money to Israel than the minority groups in Africa being persecuted by Boko Haram. It's because the US cares about one and not the other. Secondly, on economic aims, we have more to gain from Saudi Arabia or Turkey than by funding the Kurds, so we end up funding the actors that are oppressing them instead. But thirdly, we said that these conflicts often don't end because countries fund opposing sides, which means you don't end the conflict, you just escalate it and make it bloodier. So the end of the day, you escalate conflicts and you fund the oppressors, flipping the opposition case. We also brought up a claim about negotiation, which is when both sides are continuously bankrolled and enriched by state actors, you have no incentive to come to the table. Conflicts end far more slowly. I'd also like to bring our second point back up, which has still not been refuted after the entire opposition case. This is about leverage. We explained that some states like Qatar and the UAE fund opposite sides of the conflict in Somalia. You find the government, for example, and the other side funds Somaliland. These actors both want control over things like shipping routes in the Red Sea, so they actively fund the bombing of the other side. The same thing happens with Russia and Belarus, where it means that Crimea is far more vulnerable. They need to engage with our actual analysis about how we are only strengthening conflict and strengthening oppression onto vulnerable groups. Donors claim to be firefighters, but in reality, they're the arsonists."

Secondly, the people framing these new constitutions or framing revised constitutions would consist of bodies of legislatures all the way up from the federal to local level, judges, executives, all members who make up a government. They'll propose, and if they're reasonably popular, they will agree upon and hand a new minted constitution for it to be ratified.

Firstly, then, why are amendments insufficient in the status quo? Three important reasons. Firstly, because the perceived sanctity of constitutions in the status quo make it incredibly hard to create structural change. There's a societal belief that constitutions are holy, and it shields legitimate discourse. To say that whenever there is a mass shooting in America, we never have a discussion about whether or not it is actually right to enforce things such as gun ID laws because of the fact that there's an intrinsic resistance to changing the constitution or removing the second amendment. But on our side of the house, the comparative is that we employ higher standards to the constitution. We say that it isn't just you have to have a really, really huge reason, a huge social impetus as to why we should change the constitution, but rather you need to be able to actively defend the amendments and the clauses within the constitution. So it isn't just a thing about allowing to subside forever, but allowing it to be actively defended. But secondly, there exists a political trade-off in the status quo, which means there's little to no attention placed by politicians in terms of changing the constitution. There is no incentive to push amendments because politicians are inherently short-termists and they have other issues to care about. Their voters probably won't care if they can get a constitutional amendment through in the next like eight to ten years. And because of fact, there's a collective action problem. They find it incredibly hard and daunting that it's probably infeasible for them as a singular politician to be able to push through amendments or be able to push through some sort of proposal for that amendment. On our side of the house, what we do is we force discussion. We guarantee that at some point there is a reviewing and checking mechanism to say that even if there is no political incentive that exists, this is something that's important for the procedure of a country. And for that very reason, there is constant checks and balances. But thirdly, it's that the amendments in the status quo are incredibly tunnel vision. They look at specific clauses. They look at specific things. They look at specific issues rather than a comprehensive investigation of the Constitution on a whole. That means that when you have structural problems in the Constitution that make up not just like a singular clause, but about the structure of the government as a whole, for example, the Electoral Congress. These things never get looked at because they don't encompass the narrow scope of what happens in the status quo. On our side, we have a much more comprehensive vision to look at. Before I go on to why the constitution needs to be more representative, I'd be happy to take a POI. In case that these conventions have local particular issues, would the current provisions be preserved or would the current provisions be lost? Yeah, we think that maintenance is like a perfectly reasonable thing to happen on our"

              "text": "side of the house. If there's a conclusion to come by, there is there is nothing that should be changed firstly why do constitutions need to be more representative what is the intrinsic point of a constitution it is the framework that establishes the social contracts that governments and citizens abide by it establishes the values that your country support establishes the laws and procedures that establish a trade-off between individuals and the government implicit consent the tacit consent that you have in the status quo of being born into a country and paying taxes and following laws, is simply not good enough for the high burden of proof the government has to meet in order to make sure that people are consensually agreeing to that contract. Because at the point in which you give up your intrinsic rights to own, for example, land or to have, for example, anarchy, then that is the point in which there needs to be a much more active agreement from the citizens to the government, when that relationship needs to be much further cemented, because it is such a high-browder point in which you take people away from the state of nature. Why, then, do we have better generational consent on a whole? The first is that it's continuous. Every single contract has a term. Every single contract has an expiration date. The reason why this is the case is because values are constantly updating, because individuals do not foresee what they're going to care about in the next 10 to 30 years in the same way that a country cannot foresee what their values will be in the next 50 to 100 years. So to that extent, then, it is incredibly important that every single person who is born into society at some point in their life has the ability to have a say in how the government works virtually by voting in their congressman and legislator who support these sorts of bills and support these type of proposals. To that degree, then, we better uphold that generational consent when every single person, no matter where you're from, no longer has to rely off of the arbitrary framings of some people who were born 200 years before you. But secondly, it's demographics. The people who wrote the constitutions are just implicitly, like,"

But thirdly, it's that people's ideologies update, and to that very degree, that needs to be represented.

              "text": "But secondly why do we make the constitution more modern? The characterization here is incredibly clear. The constitutions are intrinsically archaic because they are written hundreds and hundreds of years ago. They're much more likely to be conservative because the values then were less progressive. Their language likely to be outdated because people back then literally could not predict the types of social contexts that we live in now. Why do we make this better? And why are these issues so important? Firstly, because we incorporate a modern context of modern issues into the new signings and new frames of the constitution because framers could not foresee the change in context, which is why, for example, when you look at the second amendment, it might apply for if you have muskets, for example, but the dynamics are completely changed when you talk about automatic weapons like AK-47s and how that changes the relationship between a militia and a government. When you look at the right to search and seizure, for example, that might be incredibly clear in a world in which the only thing you own lived inside your house. But now when we have a digital space, how much right do you have to your own information and How much right do you have to your own privacy in that digital setting? These terms all need to be updated because in the absence of that updation, you get an incredibly ineffective constitution on a whole. When we have new concerns that we have to worry about, things such as global terrorism, things such as cybersecurity, these fundamentally question the nature of the state and what the responsibilities are in the protection of individuals. To that degree, then, these new issues need to be taken into consideration when looking at the way that we frame our society on a whole. The comparative is, on their side of the house, what they do is force broad interpretations of the Constitution. It means they give the judiciary a lot of power in this sense because of the fact that there is incredibly inspecific clauses in the Second Amendment about how we should deal with the modern context of firearms, for example. To that degree, then, it is incredibly unrepresentative because it's nine individuals who you never voted for, who you never elected, who have no incentive to please the popular demand. But secondly, it means that they get to make their decisions in the ivory tower based on what they feel the current situational context is without us having a say in it. But secondly, it's also the semantics of it, right? The fact that the Constitution is written in incomprehensible language sometimes, and you cannot resurrect Thomas Jefferson and ask him what he meant. The fact that the Second Amendment literally changes depending on whether or not you thought a smudge was a comma is in and of itself a terrible thing to do. Because at the point in which we're worrying about the individual decisions that people made back then, these grammatical errors that change the way that we live, that's an incredibly arbitrary metric to base a society off of, which is why we don't allow those individual errors and those individual mistakes and clauses to be cemented forward, but rather we individually come to agreement every generation to say what is best for them. We would say that tyranny is allowing a contract you never signed to be beholden to, incredibly proud to propose."

Their model seems like the perfect recipe at best for a deadlock, at worst for political chaos the media can make a spectacle of. Laws that are only valid for four years already create mayhem in the status quo. Imagine how much tension and polarization will arise from something that will last 20 to 30 years when it's something that's constantly happening.

The reason they haven't done this is because progressive policies in the status quo benefit from the solidity and egalitarianism within the constitution, like bodily autonomy to maximize the right to abortion and egalitarian principles that allow LGBTQ plus members to sue people when they're discriminated against. More importantly, they never proved why people who will make these constitutions every 20 years will be equitable representative people.

I don't understand why they cannot suddenly claim that the people who will make this are going to be progressive people who will create good policies.

              "text": "up to that. Now, moving into my first argument on why most constitutions are good as is, and on their side, you achieve nothing but risking the loss of what we already have. But firstly, why are the vast majority of current constitutions very egalitarian? Four independent mechanisms to this. Firstly, historically, all constitutions have been written by liberals. There are structural reasons as to why this is true. Constitutions emerge in newly established democracies. That means they are written after the overthrow of absolute leaderships like monarchies or like dictators. Think about the US founding fathers or Thorbecke in the Netherlands. The ones establishing the constitutions are the ones who were successful in disempowering absolute leaderships in favor of democracy. They are the ones who believe everyone is equal, everyone is worth the same, and everyone should receive the same opportunities. Given the context in which democracies are formed, their clauses are there to ensure the equitable treatment of everyone. That means people who shape the constitution on our side are more likely to be representative than arbitrary people on their side. For example, the European liberal revolutionists of 1748 across Europe, liberals took control and created broadly egalitarian constitutions. Think about Spain, Prussia, Belgium, a bunch of places. Second independent mechanism. In the historical context of new states, where a political elite has just been disempowered, there was simply not an elite that could simply empower themselves because no one had the political control to do so. Thus, to actually have a constitution be passed, these founders need to appease many groups and thus end up with broadly egalitarian laws that are representative. But thirdly, given the high threshold of changing a constitution on our side, the only clauses that are changed are the bad ones that have allowed democracy to fail. They represent how we have learned from our mistakes. For example, after the Holocaust, Germany established eternity clauses to ensure the same thing doesn't happen again. Bad clauses lead to bad outcomes, which is why they are already eradicated, given these constitutions are ever-growing. Anything new you implement has not gone through that growth and that checking barrier, which is why they're more likely to be worse, especially when they don't have the time to mature or grow because they're constantly being changed. Fourthly, these constitutions are built have the time to mature or grow because they're constantly being changed. Fourthly, these constitutions are built up over time to represent universal moralities and not subjective preferences that come and go with the momentum in the political landscape. Therefore, they are much more a product of universal morals that apply throughout time and not only what is convenient in a certain snippet of time. The reason Trump was never able to blatantly discard minorities the way he would have liked to is because of clauses in the U.S. Constitution that states everyone gets equal rights. On the proposition side of the house, if the fixed change period happens during a radical presidency with a political right-wing majority, you risk losing important constitutional values that ensure human rights are followed. Think about every time you elect a Supreme Court justice, but it happens to be during a red presidency, right? Especially with the rise of populism and growing polarization and animosity, it is vital we do not allow the momentum of radical movements to override the one barrier we have that overthrows non-egalitarian policies. Given these constitutions are good, it's good that they are difficult to change. It's good they can't be overthrown, and it's good we cement them in our society. Every LGBTQ plus lawsuit has leaned on this constitution to gain legitimacy, to be enacted, to receive justice. Through these reasons that firstly, the people who set up constitutions are egalitarian people. Secondly, the flaws in bad constitutions are organically amended and improved through time, which you lose on their side when it's that short term. But thirdly, that they are more inherently more representative of universal moralities like human rights, rather than what would be decided at arbitrary times in politics. How does this affect this debate? Firstly, the arguments rely on the assumption that most constitutions are bad. Given we've proven they're good, their case has no tangible merit. The better the constitution is now, the less you achieve by changing it. Secondly, given the constitution, it's currently creating positive impact, you risk losing that, in the chat please, on-site prop when you can allow temporary surges and like xenophobic political majorities to overturn good clauses we already have. Those risks of unwriting are not likely to be worth it. Moving into my second substantive on how constitutional development over time is crucial. What does this look like? We think in the current amendment structure, the constitution adapts itself and improves itself, and more importantly, strengthens itself. This happens in a few ways. Firstly, the institution centered around it. Think about parliaments, courts, executive officers. They define themselves as well in relationship to each other. There's only so much a constitution can do when it comes to dividing power in the government or limiting the power of each office. The strong division of power is largely set up by limited constitutional provisions, but by court precedent, internal legislation, and unwritten principles. For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court Madison case in which they established the principle of judicial review, i.e. the right and duty of federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws. This was a power not defined or constrained in the constitution, but one that developed over time and is now central to keeping other branches in check. Secondly, we tell that their provisions of the constitution also develop as courts interpret them and set important precedent. This is why many countries in the provision that was passed as a means of establishing equality between all white property-owning men is now the provision on which equality for people of all genders, races, sexual orientations is based. That means even if the constitution itself doesn't change through amendments, people interpret them differently, which is vital for setting precedent. For all these reasons, we urge you to oppose. Thank you."

And lastly, why we are principally winning this debate firstly on the comparison because basically their argumentation is that longevity is good two things one most things are universal morals as they characterize which means these politicians wouldn't go through the unnecessary process of opposing it if it's something that's universally recognized like for instance we should have votes one person one vote everyone has an equal voice. Everyone gets free speech. If these are such universal morals as they characterize that are good, then no politician would go through the effort of going against something that's widely recognized and change the constitution. So the very backbones they talk about, like electoral processes, won't be messed up on our side of the house. But two, if longevity is so good and the original constitution is so well written, they need to tell you why they support amendments in the status quo or proposing laws to counteract things in the constitution. Because if they think it is so perfect and like permanence is the most important thing, why do they also have mechanisms to change the constitution? They need to resolve that contradiction on their side of the house. The next day they talk to you, I would say that there's going to be a tyrannical abuse of the system where politicians like Trump are going to shape politics. There are a few things I want to note. Firstly, that is a contradiction to their case because they shape politics and characterize politicians in vastly different ways. On one hand, on their side of the house, politicians wouldn't be abusive at all and will use the legal system to forward positive change. Versus on our side, they're suddenly so abusive that they're going to institute undemocratic measures the second they're given this chance to change. So they need to choose if politicians are good or bad on their side of the house. But two, they don't respond to the two accountability mechanisms that came out of our model. Firstly, that is a very, very balanced bipartisan board. And therefore, it's not going to be abused by one side when they politically win. Because this includes the legislature, which currently the House is held by one party. And the Senate is literally held by the other party. They include the judges, which is literally split on a 5-4 mark in the status quo. And they include the executives as well. So in aggregate, it balances out the two parties influences and therefore no quote-unquote bad it's going to be too great but two the threshold of passing something is so high it's not just a simple majority it's an overwhelming majority and the status quo where it's a two-third majority and therefore it's not going to be abused just because you won one election but moreover what"

So that means this is a tenuous thing that could be challenged by the right wing any time, that it's easily broken down because abortion is clearly not directly justified by searches and seizures. Versus currently, if there's a constitutional convention right now, they're going to receive pressure from the social movements that currently exist, not just the ones that existed in 7076. And therefore, the hashtag MeToo movement will make sure that they make the politicians realize you have to include something explicitly about gender. That's where the link to Roe versus Wade is going to be something that's way more concrete. And it's about women and men deserve equal rights. And therefore, it's unlikely to be overturned. So with regards to changes like probability and permanence, we win when we get more updated constitutions in this sense, and it's influenced by social movements. But we already proved to you why their mechanisms of change all get better on our side of the house. They want to rely on the legislature. They want to rely on the judiciary. But the problem is when you only have one issue being voted in an amendment process like the conservative senators are unlikely to swing and help you because that means they're literally showing their devotion and commitment to the democrats versus they're more like a left-wing slide when it's an overall convention like revising and re-examining everything because that means it's a necessary part of compromise or they're hiding in a crowd and therefore they can like even more easily sway that moral responsibility when it's not a tunnel vision of a single issue and therefore let these conservative progressive policies pass but secondly there's a mechanism they do not rebut under this argument which is discussion just got way better for all social movements for all activists for all progressive individuals because currently the right wing can easily say gun rights should be upheld because it was written in the constitution that abortion and everything just saying it's that is quote not get progressed because it's written in the constitution we don't push them further and demand for extra justification or actual reasons as to why they oppose for women having their choices all they need to say is this document is very very like holy because it's say the same since the foundation of histories of our nation and because of the heritage we don't need to explain to you anything else we get rid of that sanctity when we like regularly revise this constitution and show you it's a living document, which pushes the right wing to say more. This at least makes the left wing way more compelling and gets rid of a positive tool used by the right wing to shut down discourse with the left wing, and therefore discussions for progressive politics get much better."

You need to go through the complete process of a constitutional convention, rather than oftentimes most of the ideas are things that deserve to be preserved and are things that are timeless.

              "text": "because you want expert opinions, et cetera. The reason why it takes time is because you have proper procedures in which you are fundamentally changing the principles that everyone follows within your country. We think these are things that don't need to change every now and then, and there are good reasons for that. But onto their second argument on how they're just more representative. The first layer they give to us is this idea of how this, of the social contract and how it's unrepresentative. I'm just genuinely unsure why they are better to fulfill the social contract on their side of the house, given that it's still a small group of politicians that are likely to be elite writing this sort of new constitution. I'm unsure how this is any more representative, and given that it is still going to be elite writing this sort of new constitution. I'm unsure how this is any more representative. And given that, it is still going to be arbitrary forever if it's always still this random group of politicians writing it every couple of years. I think especially given that if you didn't elect those politicians ever, if you didn't ever consent to them writing it, I'm not sure why they're better able to fulfill that social contract. But secondly, on their idea of how this is written by very elite people in the past and aren't representative now. I think, sure, some, it may be written by very elite people, but oftentimes the principles are still timeless. Sure, like many years ago, the constitution was made for white men who owned property, but I think as time has progressed, the fact that these fundamental basic rights still went on, but now just apply to different people, regardless of your race, regardless of your sexuality, regardless of your religion. But the fact is, it's still preserved and things like the freedom of speech is still something that everyone deserves. Even if it was only like targeted to a small group of people, the fact that we have adapted now and change means something. So now what did we prove to you in our speech? Our first speaker, Anna, told you two things. Number one, the constitution is already good. We gave you structural analysis as to why this was. We told you there are trends of liberalization, oftentimes liberalism, in which these constitutions are created, but also that you just need to cater to a wide group of people when you're writing it. So oftentimes it is something that is already very equitable and nice, but even in the worst case, we told you we have checks and balances, such as amendments. The fact that all the time, most of the times, these are things like universal moralities, means these are just fundamental ideas of equality. And we think that's fair. What did they respond to? They said, firstly, if constitutions are so good, you just don't need amendments. I think this misses the nuances of our arguments, right? We told you a majority of the times, you don't need to change much given that they're already good, but that is especially the reason why you just don't need constitutional conventions. In their worst-case scenario, in which you might have a subclass that is still somewhat, like, problematic, I think that's something we can simply change with amendments on our side of the House, but the point is, this is generally good, and it's just unnecessary on their side. But the second thing they said to us was, ah, the constitutions are just problematic in general. I have a few responses. Number one, know that constitutions are not the only law in these states, right? So the enforcements are not always problematic. For example, the European Human Rights Convention can invalidate any European constitutions with inequitable clauses pertaining to human rights. That is to say, most of the time it's not invasive and it's just simply unnecessary that you need to go through this entire process of rewriting everything. But secondly, note that even if we debate on their grounds, it is just simply not worth it to change this. Political chaos is what you create. The fact that you prevent constitutional provisions and you weaken democracies are all things that are net harms on their side of the house, which is unnecessary given that like on their side, the small changes you need to make are something that's so"

              "text": "unimpactable. So then what was the second argument we told you? We told you that constitutional developments over time is crucial because on provisions on their side of the house will just change much more and therefore you have less checks and balances. But also, constitutions just get less strength when institutions know that they're going to constantly change. We told you what this means is that overall, you just lose out on these crucial developments that are needed for democracies. We never heard a response to this. I think this still stands. Before I move on, I'll take a point. Do you think it is likely that moderate Republicans would vote to repeal the 14th Amendment that gives equal rights to all citizens in America? Look, here's the problem with that, right? If you're talking about problems that would never change on either side of the House, I'm just not sure why you would fix that either. But I think what's unique about their case is when you do make constitutional conventions, you just create political chaos in which you lose out on the fundamental checks and balances we currently have. You lose out on the fundamental basic ideals. And overall, it's just unnecessary to begin with. So what is our third argument? We tell you this creates a dysfunctional media spectacle. We say currently when you compare conventions to amendments, they're very different in terms of the attention they get. We say constitutional conventions attract far more attention. Even in the 18th century, when a constitutional convention was held to establish the Bill of Rights in Philadelphia, that was already a huge media spectacle. Given nowadays, in the current day and age of sort of like social media and digitalization, we see the size of this is going to be a far bigger spectacle. Note that this is a group of politicians gathering together from all over the country, and therefore, realistically, the convention will not take too long, a couple weeks probably at most. But this is also something in which you're making big changes, where you fundamentally change the principles that a country governs with. We see comparatively, amendments gather far less attention, because these are changes made over a period of time that is usually quite a long period of time, meaning it's less exciting. But also these are committing theories that just don't get attention because you involve a lot of experts and you talk a lot and discuss about these changes. We say what this is likely to create is a media spectacle on their side of the house. This is reporters waiting outside of your discussion room. This is cameras televising your decisions. This is media recording and writing down your every move. And we think the effect of this is twofold. Number one, simply just more political polarization. When the media makes a spectacle, they tend to write the most eye-catching headlines and twist words so that the stories are shocking. We say this is likely to worsen the divides between two political parties or two sides, given that the media now forces themselves into this discussion, and therefore you're able to heighten a lot of the conflicts and tensions that already exist but secondly we say politicians start acting the way they want to be televised not the parts they create not necessarily how they can create the best constitution so you pass things based on appearance rather than how it functions because note that if you stand against a group you will be blamed and seen as controversial if you vote with the group you're just unlikely to be blamed. An example of this is the Stolen Valor Act, in which someone in the U.S. wanted to pass a law that criminalized people becoming veterans. This clearly violated an individual's right to free speech, yet was passed because politicians didn't want to seem unpatriotic. We think this is problematic on their side of the house. When you constantly involve the media, this is something you don't get with amendments. I think we win this debate."

First, opposition spends three minutes telling you why the original constitution written 200 years ago is good. Great. If that constitution is so good and that constitution won't be changed at the convention, people will agree with it. The politicians will say, you know, this is a good constitution. It's representative. Therefore, we want to maintain it. So even if the original document is good, we can have that benefit on all sides of the house as well."

One, those issues are nonpartisan. The Republican Party in the U.S. is conservative, but they don't say Black people should have a right to vote, right? That's not what this debate is about. But second, given that you have a plurality of politicians, amendments against the most extreme policies won't happen on our side of the house as well. So this debate isn't about like the freedom of speech, but rather it is about the more controversial parts of the Constitution. There's like the Second Amendment, which is the right to bear arms in the United States, or the Eighth Amendment that used to be an Irish constitution, which banned people's right to an abortion. But thirdly, there's a contradiction in their case, because on one hand, they say organic change is good. But on the other hand, they say that politicians are subject to short-term whims. If their case is true, and you believe their response to our case, which is that politicians are short-termists and that politicians will do crazy radical things, it's unclear as to why that they can stand for amendments and organic change on their side of the house as well."

              "text": "Two clashes end in this debate. First, in principle, which side is more democratic? And second, how do we better make the political process? No. First, which side is more democratic? They say that the original constitution is great because the founding fathers of almost every single country are liberal. Three responses. One, if it's great, then we can maintain it on our side of the house. Two, we think that we don't reject their premise that all founding fathers are liberal and that all revolutionaries are liberal. Conservatives can also find countries in the same way that liberals can. If conservatives think that the status quo is too liberal, they can revolt for the same reason that liberals revolt, which is that the status quo is too conservative, right? Use their own example, the revolutions in 1848, right? The precursor to those revolutions in 1848 was the Asia-Mediterranean, in which you had a conservative backlash towards the French Revolution, in which like the European monarchs got together and basically said, when do you curtail future revolutions? So it just isn't true that all revolutions are liberal, and therefore all constitutions are liberal. But third, and this is the most important response, is that the liberals that they want to talk about that wrote constitutions 200 years ago are incredibly, incredibly conservative by today's standards. The reason why is because political beliefs and preferences shape or change over time, right? We are exposed to more information, our opinions change over time. This is why the founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson were slave owners. And this is also true in Ireland, for instance, in which the Eighth Amendment prohibits a woman's right to an abortion. Because of their mechanism as to why constitutions were good 200 years ago, is that they have to appeal to the broader members of society. That broad society 200 years ago was defined by white property owners. In the status quo, that broad society is defined by a plurality of people from different creeds, from different races, and from different ethnicities. So if anything, our constitution was more representative. In short, in their best case scenario, this constitution is great. That constitution will be maintained through conventions. In their worst case scenario, if this constitution has problems in it, we're able to fix it on our side of the house. But let me now attack their counter proposition."

One, what I said earlier about there being a contradiction here. If you think that politicians cannot be good at a constitutional convention, it's unclear as to why politicians will be good when they do organic change on the US side of the house. But second, this organic change, if you really want to talk about it, is empowered on our side of the house. Because on our side of the house, the organic evolution of the constitution that they talk about is a guarantee, the point at which you have to renew the Constitution every 30 or 40 years at the Constitutional Convention. Whereas on theirs in the House, there might be organic change, but there also might not be. Because Eddie tells you that politicians care about the short term. They care about passing laws. They care about imminent issues. They're not thinking about the Constitution in the short term, which means that the organic change that they talk about is empowered on ours in the House, and we can guarantee it by cementing periodic constitutional conventions."

              "text": "But here is a big tiebreaker in this debate. The tiebreaker in this debate is the one on representation. Because here's the thing. I am happy to accept that in our worst case scenario, politicians will get it wrong, right? That politicians might do stupid things to the Constitution. Insofar as that is the case, and insofar as politicians can also do great things to the Constitution, that tie and that deadlock is broken when you look at the question of representation. Because our status quo is a lot more representative than theirs. The point where politicians in the status quo have the power to the interests of the voters in the status quo was in contrast, the people who founded the Constitution in the past did not have the power to the voters and the interests of the present. And furthermore, I would also note that people who like vote constitution were elected, right? They won a war. They weren't elected. So it's unclear why they had the approval of the people then as well, right? What does that mean? Is that even if you have bad change or even if you have good change, that is regardless because we have better representation in the House. Furthermore, we also told you how the social contract is only legitimate in the House, but people continuously sign and approve it instead of it being a once and for all generation in conclusion our system was more representative and therefore we ensure democracy second on a political process the first thing i want to do is engage with the argument they say that will cause a media spectacle like that's an argument against everything right it's an argument against supreme court cases because they report on supreme court cases it's an argument against elections because every election is a media spectacle like i would say that like media spectacle isn't that bad of a thing because the media was designed to keep politicians in check if the media is recording their conversations politicians are likely to conduct their mannerisms in a way that is popular with their voter bases because the media is checking on them unclear why that is a bad thing but they just don't respond to all the practical benefits we give you down the bench right the first thing to say is that even if change doesn't happen you get better discourse on all sides of the house the we give you down the bench, right? The first thing to say is that even if change doesn't happen, you get better discourse on all sides of the house. The reason why you get that better discourse is because the Constitution is seen as less salient and sankient on all sides of the house. When the right to bear arms in the United States isn't seen as an entrenched right that is holy, but rather as something that is subject to constant debate and discussion, that is a point at which Republicans can't just say you should have guns because of the right to bear arms. That's when they have to give you logical, concrete reasons as to why they should be right to bear arms. And those reasons have to be given at these constitutional conventions. So even if there isn't change, you get a better political system, the point when politicians have to present arguments defending and refuting each part of the controversial constitution. Before I move on, yes, your POI. In your world, how can you protect individual rights given that you don't have sufficient court procedures and legal certainty? We can, no, we can protect individual rights because in order for you to pass anything in a huge legislative body, you need the appeal of the vast, vast majority of individuals. But like court procedures aren't exclusive to your side of the house as well, right? Like the judiciary can still exist on our side of the house if they want to do things, they're able to enact against that. of the house if they want to do things they're able to um they're able to um like enact against that but the other thing i want to know is what exactly is the comparative on their side of the house because on their side of the house as society progresses the constitution becomes increasingly vague so the right to free speech that was written in a context in which the social media age did not exist the right to bear arms was written in a context in which assault weapons can't kill a whole school of children, right? Therefore, these rights, because they're so vague, they leave the interpretation up to justices, which are sometimes good, but are also problematic because those justices were simply not elected. So yes, the justices in the Supreme Court did support Brown versus Board of Education, but they also supported Plessy versus Bogus in 50 years prior, which legitimized and legalized discrimination based on race in the first place. So justices might get it right or wrong, and justices might get it right. Those benefits are inconclusive and symmetrical to both sides of the House. But a unique difference is that, one, we're able to check those justices in a democratic manner, the point in which the people as a whole are able to say yes or say no to the Constitution. So even if we don't get positive change, the system on our side of the house is a lot more democratic. But furthermore, we also tell you that those justices are inherently biased because those justices come from very elite backgrounds. Those justices, because you need to be rich in order to go to law school, that is also a reason why the minorities don't get represented in the justice system. Whereas in contrast, politicians need to cater to minorities because the vast majority of society today is not racist. In order to win an election, politicians need to cater to minorities because the vast majority of society today is not racist. In order to win an election, you need to cater to a coalition of people. So white farmers, Black, I don't know, Black middle class and the white middle class, right? That coalition of people you need to cater to is the reason as to why the Constitution is likely to be more reflective. Our side will get things wrong and our side will get things right. But the reason why you vote for us is because you get the continued consent of the government. I am very proud of our post."

Therefore, I think that would at best be uncomparative. But we also don't think this is a standard we hold any set of laws to. We don't review treaties every 20 years.

              "text": "falls out of the debate. Let's look at the quality of constitutions in the status quo. The BM says that constitutions are often archaic because they've been written by old people. We say, on the one hand, it ignores the historic context in which they were written, which we'll get to later, but second, it ignores the way that constitutions are written, in the sense that constitutions often write about principles rather than very specific provisions. So even if they aren't as specific, and in that sense not as specifically applicable to the status quo, the principles that underlie these constitutional provisions often don't change. Often these are broadly good principles, and therefore we support that. Then we say, in our era, that constitutions are broadly good, because these constitutional democracies, the constitutions that were written, are often good, because first of all, they're often liberal authors. Notice the people that overthrew a monarchy and created a constitutional democracy because this debate takes place in constitutional democracies. Therefore, these are often liberals. Well, they say, well, but these people aren't liberal by modern standards. But that again ignores the way constitutions are written. Sure, they still believe in equality for all people. Yet they wrote classes that ensured equality, and these principles were later extended to more people. Given that constitutions are written about principles, given that these liberal others were broadly based on liberal principles, therefore we can simply extend those principles to more people. Second, we say that it was often, and that's something they were unresponded to, that after these absolute monarchs etc. were overthrown, there's a lack of a political elite that could simply take power. That's why the constitution had to be written in a way that broadly appealed because the political elite was just defeated. There was no political elite to take power. Thirdly, we can simply, the really wrong clauses can be amended. That's why broadly no wrong clauses exist anymore because they have been long amended. We also say there's development over time. That's why we uniquely have more universal values than just the values that the current political majority agrees on. And fifth, there are simply treaties that even if a constitution has a really bad clause, there are broadly treaties that would take care of those. By the way, I think that this is the most important clause because one, it broadly marginalizes proposition case. Insofar that if the current constitutions are actually quite good, then any potential benefit they have of making them better is much smaller than they frame it to be. But second, that it increases the inherent risks, I see your POIs, it increases the inherent risks of conventions. Insofar that the moment that these constitutions are already good and you lose parts of those constitutions in those conventions because you create a media spectacle that's the moment that you lose incredibly benefits that we have on our side they say well but all these very important classes are bipartisan but i think it ignores the fact that there are broad that are broad political groups that don't actually agree sure no one's going to reinstate slavery that's not what the debate is about but i think there are important things about gender equality etc that are often written in constitutions that are certainly not the sort of broad political support for in all countries. Therefore, we say that's a risk they take at their side. But I'll take a PY. Yeah. So if constitutions are as good as you say, is that a value judgment you can make or if it's something that people should vote on and decide"

I think they ignore, we say, if a majority of people want to reinstate slavery, we say that's wrong. We say constitutions uniquely exist to restrict the will of a political majority because we recognize that representation is not the only value that should underpin our judgment on laws. Individual rights exist even if the majority believes that certain individuals are not entitled to rights such as freedom, such as equality. Therefore, we say the constitutions shouldn't be as representative of current political will, but that it is fine if they restrict. That's uniquely why we have a constitution rather than just only regular laws. Okay, let's talk about the change of constitution. They say that amendments are insufficient for two reasons. First, they say there's a belief of holiness around these classes that prevents us from changing them. We say that we don't necessarily disagree, but we're actually seeing it as a good thing because it works both ways. Sure, there might be some provisions that they dislike that become harder to change because of the belief of holiness. Similarly, there are a lot of constitutions that we very much like. In fact, we say most constitutions are probably good that are more unlikely to be changed the moment there is the belief of holiness. And then you say it's simply too much effort for politicians to change a constitution.

And politicians can work together, co-sponsorship also happens with regular laws.

Look at the Madison case of the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted themselves the right to constitutional review, thereby holding other branches in check. We also say uniquely precedent of courts develops itself. Look at Brown v. Board of Education in which the educational segregation was ended. They say, well, judges are not representative. First of all, we say, as I explained, the representative is not relevant. We're talking about protecting backbone rights. But second, we say that judges are the way of more likely to protect individual rights than politicians. First of all, judges are often well-educated people that tend to be more liberal, tend to be more protective of individual rights. Second, they are not subjective to populist ways. Note that that uniquely targets the most vulnerable, because even if you're incredibly vulnerable and people don't want you to have individual rights, politicians won't grant you judges' will. But they're not simply a feeling of duty. Broadly, judges feel a duty to protect the Constitution. That's why even the very conservative Supreme Court now rejected an appeal to Anne Drophy Raid by Luciana just like two months ago. But even if you don't believe any of that, we saw a third argument you explained because of media surrogates. We say if you look at how elections are surrogates now, that's what you get. Political polarization, where you don't pass any of the reforms they want, it becomes show those politicians that pass bad laws because they think that makes them popular, that they don't have to take a stance against those laws, we say incredibly proud to oppose."

But there are more so, when it is your self-voting versus your ancestors voting for representatives, when you can foresee just the next 20 years instead of making a decision that foresees the entirety of your life when the Constitution is going to be permanent.

              "text": "But moreover, we told you why the constitution is different from first and was never addressed, that this is the basis of your social contract versus laws or outcomes of the social contract where you already give up your power. Constitution outlines most basic rules as to how you surrender over your autonomy and your freedoms. And if that isn't even up to the scrutiny of yourself and accountability, we don't know what should be. And that is the difference that they do not engage. So just on the fact that we don't impose things under the consent of the governed, we win. But secondly, let's talk about politics. The first thing I want to note is that all problems they identified undercut their very own case about organic change through courts, organic change through legislature, because if they say politicians are bad and abusive and racist, that's exactly why the legislature can just pass the Muslim ban, or Trump can issue decrees equally on their side. When they say there's going to be pushback from conservatives, when 51% of people wake up and want to persecute minorities, they can do so by imposing laws of segregation again, and they want to dirty the house as well. It is all equally symmetrical. So why does this problem actually not apply to our policy and not apply to the Constitution? It's exactly because of the lack of POI response we got from second speaker that would the Republicans nowadays just get rid of the 14th Amendment that gave everyone equal rights. They said it wouldn't change, which shows you that because of the fact that constitutions outline very universal principles as they characterize, that it is usually going to be sustained in most cases as well. So if it's good, if it ain't broke, we wouldn't fix fix it either but the difference is they can see that there are some cases in which things should be fixed and therefore they have amendment practices in place as well to propose amendments so if we prove to you that in these cases where things need to change amendments are insufficient we get those better changes that are actually needed and that's why we win we told you why it's into fiction one because on their side of the Constitution seems too holy, seems too permanent, and therefore amendments will get huge push-packs automatically. Two, the fact that the political efficiency of proposing a single amendment is not worth it versus we force them to do this on our side of the house. These are reasons why amendments are not enough. But moreover, they don't address our mechanisms. They just say LGBTQ individuals or women can sue. Yes, but when they're suing, they get a more direct amendment if current day social movements can pressure to include women in the Constitution and not cite a very tenuous link from the right to searches and seizures that can be overturned any day. Suing and all these mechanisms get better on our side of the House. We think that on their side, this is not just about progressive policies either. There are archaic questions that don't answer. Why the Electoral College is still relevant? Why are gun laws still should be the same when AK-47s came about? and why is the current legislature on privacy in the constitution enough when the internet exists they're all cake things that I do not address and we need to keep up with the times lastly on discussion like they think it's going to be made a spectacle because of televization and therefore polarized one very symmetrical to passing laws in the legislature that they support but two it is good because if we get spotlight onto gun rights and abortion debates, it is good because debates become better on our side of the house as well, and we actually lend spotlight to these good debates. They don't respond why the right wing can't just cite the Second Amendment like they do in a status quo because the Second Amendment is not an automatic good. We're revisiting the Second Amendment, and therefore we present real arguments, not just assertions from the past. Constitutions have always been the political will of the people. On their side, it is the will of anyone who happened to be in a tennis court in the French Revolution and the will of Virginian politicians during 1783. Versus on our side, it is the will of everyone. We can scrutinize and check it every 20 years. So mistakes will be inevitably made at some point. At least we have the time to fix it. We're so proud to propose."

At the top of my speech, I want to note four points of framing. First of all, what do we think that this is likely to look like? Note for A, that this is going to be amendment-like changes to the Constitution, whereby they are rewritten periodically over time from 30 to 50 years, and the comparative that they have to support is frequent minor amendments that change them semi-frequently. Note then that the Constitution forms a guiding principle toward the way that laws are formed. On our side, we think that that ought to be updated frequently. Secondly, that this happens on like a three-fourth basis, similarly to how it does under status quo. On their side, they have to defend things like Supreme Court justices and constitutional courts being the individuals that make these kinds of decisions. Thirdly, that this is likely to be done through delegates of certain bodies, i.e. religious, political, or regional bodies, similar to how constitutions were originally drafted in the past. Fourthly, note that most people are happy with the foundation and they're not likely to support constant change. So instead, we think this is likely to be minor things like enshrinement of past laws or creation of new things to keep up to date with newer social standings, i.e. things like technology,"

              "text": "i.e. changing racial quotas, and so forth. Note then the second point of framing as to why this is unlikely to go horribly wrong. Two reasons here. One, that politicians are somewhat interested in the good of the country. This is because they as individuals are incentivized to be good so that they can, A, upkeep somewhat decent legacies within their specific political parties, but secondly, many of them want to run in the future and they need that good reputation, that good perception from the public to be able to maintain and get by. But secondly, that you're likely to elect good people because it could go horribly wrong in future. This is why the US did not change the number of Supreme Court justices in their state, because they were fearful that this damages the existing democratic structures in such a way that leaves the country some sort of failure as a state. Secondly, thirdly and finally, what does this mean for our case? One, we think that opposition cannot run a case talking about how we get no change and radical change at the same time. We think if they do that in terms of responsive work, then they're largely going to contradict and undermine the mechanisms. But secondly, it means that our stance is simple. We think democracy on our side is most functional, not only for the people, but also for the principles that it ought to abide by. We want to forward three arguments in support of that. One, that we get better constitutional creation on our side. Two, that we get better democratic engagement from the people. And thirdly, that we create less reliance on things like precedent. Before moving on, I'll take your point of clarity. You're at the same time saying that you're only going to change commonsensical things that most people agree with so what what is the fundamental difference between this and just changing them on our side when most people already agree so one i'll explain to you why an argumentation but briefly we think that you're going to do more than just change like minor things that people agree on because it's quite difficult to do things like make amendments that create entirely new clauses in the constitution or do things like enshrinement within the constitution and outside becomes substantially easier and i'll explain why in my substantive first argument then on why we"

              "text": "I want to observe three problems faced by the Constitution on the status quo. One, that it enshrines, that it upholds largely old values because of the times that they were made. The U.S. Constitution is roughly 100 years old. The reason this becomes problematic is because the kinds of problems that they faced at the time were nowhere near to the same as the kinds of problems we face now. Now we have to ask ourselves questions about things like AI and whether or not tanks constitute as weapons of arms, whereas at the time they had more simplistic things to worry about. Secondly, that we face new societal or economic problems because the economy has become substantially more complicated as we've progressed, the way that it interacts with society has changed and the needs that we face in terms of social progress have changed. Thirdly, let's note that there are different cultural contexts within which manifest themselves in terms of a language and ambiguity within that. So you have things like really difficult to interpret things. But secondly, note that when you frame and talk about the problems within the constitution, you oftentimes change the narratives and notions surrounding them. And you cannot ask these individuals who created the constitution whether or not this is what they meant. Thus, you land up seeing really inconsistent applications thereof. Note this is harmful because it creates control. This is the thing that controls laws and rights on all sides. So when you have the underlying premise of how your country is functioning being set up on a somewhat wishy-washy system, we think it's quite difficult for you to progress going forward. The way we change this goes twofold. One, we think that we get more constructive rewrites of the constitution because single amendments, as they have to defend on their side, are controlled by individuals like"

              "text": "is you manifest a culture whereby this is something that takes place on a regular basis and it's a necessity to the function of democracy because it's mandated to happen every 40 to 50 years. What that then means is when people are trying to create change, they're likely to be more accepting of these things and more willing to adapt. But secondly, we think that this idea of constitutional change, so just infrequent because they stole government function, this is because you need to do things like consultation or win over bipartisan voting on their side. On our side, what you do is you create things like committees or delegations that are dedicated to these things. But secondly, because it's an expected slowing down of your government, you give people the capacity to prepare for these things. So we think that you're more likely to be able to say, let's default back to the old one whilst this is changing. This isn't something that stresses us out. Thus, we're more open to the old one, whilst this is changing, this isn't something that stresses us out, thus we're more open to the notion of doing it. Why is this important? One, we think that self-defense in terms of democratic functioning occurs through the constitution, because it's an individual's primary mechanism of holding the government and the lawmakers accountable. Insofar as we weigh that up against any form of stability, we think giving people access to the idea that their government is something that can protect them from border state and the fact that they can engage politically far outweighs that. Thus, we get better constitutions on our side. Second argument then on democratic engagement. What we say is that democracy is largely problematic. People aren't buying into it as it's on the state score. We think it faces problems like populism and all sorts of things. We make that better three ways. One, we get a better connection to the constitution because things like language, things like We make that better three ways. One, we get a better connection to the constitution, because things like language, things like the time that it was made in, and the cultural context are now more directly connected to individuals. In South Africa, our constitution was made roughly 25 to 30 years ago, yet individuals already see problems as to how things like property laws are enshrined by them. They feel they disconnect the very thing that is designed to create a connection between them and the government. Secondly, the constitution feels more flexible and modern. This appeals to the trend that people think politics are an elitist or outdated and never changing space. Insofar as you show in the picture that this changes and their political vote means something, we then think that you create the idea that they can't buy into this. But secondly, this gives them the idea that they can now change the focus of the nation and make it determined on what society and the state wants. I.e., do you want your state to be focused on freedom and acceptance or other more dated ideals? What are the impacts of this? One, we get more individuals represented within our constitution. That means that people themselves feel like they can engage more frequently. Two, we reduce apathy because people no longer feel like democracy is determined by arbitrary things which were decided by old people hundreds of years ago. And they feel like they can make a change. But thirdly, there's less populism because now when people feel angry at the state, they no longer feel like they have to go riot and become radical towards one end or the next. They understand that these are things that can change over time. This is important because, A, we get more stability on our side, given the fact that people are more likely to buy into democratic systems. Two, it impacts every citizen within these states. And thirdly, the quality of change is great. On proposition, we think that changes in society need to be represented by changes in the Constitution. Never been prouder to propose."

This makes it very difficult to make longstanding regulation. This is particularly exacerbated when we see instances like the US, where you have two-party systems or even multiple party systems, who are actively attempting to undermine the legacy of other individuals. We think that lasting practices, binding individuals to specific laws is necessary. Secondly, let's also understand that amendments and also their alternative are not sufficient. Why do we think that that is true? Because we think that at the point of which you're consistently amending something, you're still struggling to replace, and you said actively remove the harmful legislation, right? This means that even at their best, that their best harmful legislation, such as This means that even at their best, harmful legislation such as gun rights, allowing people to continue access, are still going to exist. They haven't shown us how that is going to exist, how that's going to be changed on their side, or how that's going to be changed on their side of the house. They literally contextualize why they haven't responded to us and why that's harmful. Because what we told you coming out of Proposition 1 was that it's essential for a representative society to occur with an ever-changing constitution note here at our worst we accomplish absolutely nothing except rewriting that constitution in itself this means that making it more accessible to the public maybe and making it much more conversation of discourse where people can see that the foundation of law that exists within the country is one that's built within your lifetime and actively feel represented within the government increasing buy-in to the ultimate government structures increasing the maximum output we get into democracy because people see themselves in the founding principles of their country but they don't actually understand how we get better institutions on the outside because they don't actually respond to what we told you in terms of the removal of harmful practices we think our rebuttal has also shown.

First response, let's mitigate it because we don't think that all these values which they say are completely beneficial are going to be changed on our side. If anything will be reworded and made better on our side to look at specific contexts as how society evolves so this looks like merely saying that freedom of speech is a right to stating how freedom of speech is a right existing in the age of social media and how companies who are then in charge of that right would need to monitor it as a guiding principle then let's also understand panel most of the case is literally hung on constitutions being good why i don't understand because most of the case is literally hung on constitutions being good. Why? I don't understand. Because most of the time, these constitutions are written by people who are out of date with society, people who have values such as being racist, such as actively bigotry and trying to make principles which might not actively harm those groups, but are literally preventing them from being able to access basic fundamental protections on the basis of their identity not being accounted for within those constitutions. Then in terms of these politicians let's take them at their best if politicians are going to some level of power all they tell us here is that politicians won't get scrutinized the voters can't access the laws. Now either they think people are extremely stupid under their side where you can't understand that if a politician is literally making an infringement to change how gun laws work, that you won't be able to access a certain amount, how that changes. We think that people do have that basic understanding of the law, but we think that there are more than enough news sources from different sources to account for the bias that they claim will be present in order to make sure that that large amount of public scrutiny, which is essential to hold politicians accountable, will change. We think that we achieve that on our side. Before I move on into how we get a significantly better precedent and how a better functioning legal system under the constitution, yes, I'll take it if you like. At this point, you wash down your case to some rewording and some limited changes here and there.

Because no, most of these presidents, considering the people who wrote it, are likely to have some form of bigoted practices, have things that people draw from that constitution or draw legislation which is permissible under a certain constitution under that, using that precedent as a way to back it up.

We don't know if there is any democratic process within that. But furthermore, note that this is fundamentally relevant in flawed democracies, in countries like the Balkans, which are democracies. But really what happens is that the politicians in power can actually incentivize them or pay them or threaten them to make the changes that they want. This means practically giving more power, changing organic laws, like giving more power to the prime minister or the president, dissolving parliament and stuff like this. These are not risks we are willing to take. But secondly, they bring a point about how people are going to be more engaged in politics because now suddenly there is civil society within these councils. And they say that that's really false. Because on the same logic, people should be really involved in politics in the status quo because politicians in the status quo give laws every year. But that's not true. In Romania, we have voting presence about 40 percent. In Norway, it's 80 percent, and that has nothing to do with how things are, but rather it has something to do with the level of democracy in those countries and how happy people are or how much trust they have in their governments.

We tell you that the U.S. Constitution, based on it, Obergefell was drafted. This is the on it, Obergifel was drafted. This is the legislation that actually awarded gay marriage to gay people. Roe v. Wade was awarded because it was based on the right to privacy within the U.S. Constitution. We say there are methods to spill things around, especially because the Constitution has the basic of things in it.

That's fundamentally flawed because you now really can't or don't have if the constitution is revised every 30 years or every 50 years or whatever time they might be they really have no incentives to actually look upon those laws or people for people to actually um to actually tell to the court well"

But still, panel, South Africans less than 30 years after the inception of their constitution criticize it for being too heavy-handed on protecting property right laws, which means that it has been impossible so far for the South African government post-apartheid to redistribute land that was stolen from black people in the 1950s because the constitution enshrines white people's rights to that land in its property clauses. It would be much better for South Africans if 30 years after the end of apartheid we could reroute our constitution in a way that is more relevant to struggles that we didn't even know we were going to have 30 years ago. Apply that logic panel to a government that wrote their constitution 200 years ago when they couldn't even conceptualize things like data as a mechanism by which to evaluate privacy. Things like whether AI are considered sentient or deserving of human rights. Even things like the fact that my first speaker tells you that the founding fathers couldn't possibly have known what it would be for modern Americans in the South that they said they are allowed to bear arms.

Note, all of those impacts on people feeling represented and voting more often and not succumbing to populism and not taking that POI are not contingent on us actually having to change the constitution is fine from the outset and the only thing that happens every 50 years is that you review it and you decide that it's fine and you move on with your life which is plausible on our side you still get all of those benefits independent of their best case scenario the impact of this cash is huge because the constitution as they as they concede from the outset governs everything to the extent that it is necessary that it's changed often and become representative to the extent that they have lied to about this consistently throughout the debate, this ought to be where it is important and ought to be winning immediately. Go quickly."

And that's why, from the outset, a lot of the claims about politicians being politically motivated and evil aren't going to stand because they don't even have the power to do this. It would be absurd that they suggest that we have to defend the politicians who will be held to account by the Constitution, the treaty being the ones that write it. But even if they did have some power, number one, we'd say that bipartisanship probably means that there will be a balancing out of incentives and we're not going to get things like gross human rights abuses. Because like we say from the outset, constitutional agreements on our side during these periods of rewriting are going to require enormous majorities to be passed. So we're not going to see outlandish policy. But secondly, if we get conservative policy sometimes, that's fine. Number one, it's symmetrical. They probably get conservative amendments and laws on their side as well my second speaker tells you why things like precedent are likely to be better on our side which minimizes the impact of conservative things number two even if even the most conservative politicians in the usa today are less conservative than the founding fathers who literally wrote women and black people out of the constitution even if that's our only impact we'll take it but thirdly panel there's this narrative and debating that conservatives are always evil and we just don't think they are think conservative policy because it existed before it will exist again probably isn't going to cripple human rights on either side given that this debate ought not happen in autocracies that in either world would would abolish term limits and destroy human rights this debate ought happen in autocracies that in either world would abolish term limits and destroy human rights. This debate ought to happen in places where it is actually likely to happen. Given that they have misplaced this debate entirely, given that they haven't understood what it ought to have been about, but given most importantly that they don't know the importance of the constitution for the people, we are unique in that regard, this debate goes to proposition.

Well, we could have a constitutional court which actively reinterprets what the constitution is saying so that it is more in tune with what we have. And the only thing that still stands from team proposition is that the founding fathers never expected AIs or AK-47s. Okay, but they set up some principles that we should guide ourselves from, which means that the constitutional court can then think of those principles and figure out what we should do about AI or AK-47s or any other thing in society. Moreover, if the constitutional court is actually unable to do all of these things, we still have amendments on our side of the house. So we don't see why they have such a huge benefit because we can always change the constitution in the small points where it actually matters."

Now, before I enter the clashes, I want to do the wing at the very get-go so you see where I'm going. Why you should care more about stability and avoiding risks than about their marginal changes on their side? Because if you're not changing a lot on their side and you only do it 30 to 50 years, the impact is essentially zero. But you are increasing the risk of something terrible happening to the entire democratic process, to breaking checks and balances, to breaking people's freedom, something we said from Op 1, that marginalized communities can be actively targeted and it can be enshrined in law. You're creating all of these risks with not a lot of impact. So if by the end of my speech I manage to prove that, one, the motion is not the only way to do this, and secondly, it is a high risk that we destroy the of our society within this debate. You can hold me accountable at the end of my speech. Before I move on, please. Do you think that news organizations and human rights groups are simply going to allow human rights? Yes, thank you. We already dealt with this from op one, when we explained that there are a lot of ways through which politicians are able to introduce things that are not accepted by society, although we should be outraged about it. We already talked about the $2.3 trillion bill that they passed in the U.S., which included a lot of money for the U.S. Army, which no one wanted. We already gave the examples from OPCON. This latest response from PROP doesn't even stand to our first OPCON. Let's first enter the area of clashes. And here they try to know of changes, and here they try to tell us that they are necessary. And although we agree that maybe some changes are necessary, the fact that they diminish their points to we won't change a lot, only some things, essentially destroys their own argumentation. Because we managed to prove that we have, one, amendments that can also do the things they're doing, which is the small, sensible changes that they want, because that's what the case is resumed to. But moreover than that, we explained the point on OPTU that was uninterrupted with about a constitutional court losing legitimacy, because now people don't see it as legitimate to reinterpret the constitution the moment that we constantly change it. This is important because the constitutional court is a big mechanism for change, especially for disadvantaged groups. This takes down the entire point on precedent because the constitutional court, if you want to play on America, has done a lot of good for these minorities. But moreover than that, in all countries, it is generally the one that keeps people in check. So regardless of whether things are changed or not, if politicians have incentives to change the constitution to benefit themselves, the fact that a constitutional keeps people in check. So regardless of whether things are changed or not, if politicians have incentives to change the constitution to benefit themselves, the fact that a constitutional court loses legitimacy is very important because that means you lose a mechanism of checks and balances in democracy, which is very important and would have provided a lot of changes for the people that we want on our side. That's why we win that clash, because we still have this legitimacy. But now let's talk about stability. And Prop is very scared of this point, because that's why they keep diminishing their impacts panel. That's why they keep telling us that you only have small changes, that people are not going to do a lot of things, and only the commonsensical ones, because they're scared that politicians might have incentives to change it. And there is a risk panel, because one, there are active incentives to do it because you have people that put you in that position. Even as a delegate, you have people who put you in that position, who pressure you to create small advantages for their side. That means that you are likely going to succumb to those pressures. Moreover than that, you might want to maintain power. You might want to have advantages for your social class as well. Not only that, you might think of a future prospect in politics, so you want to please the electorate. This is especially important when we're talking about minorities, because if you live in a conservative society, you have all of the incentives to enshrine into law that minorities should be subjected to discrimination, because that gives you electorate for the rest of your life from all of these political parties that are very conservative. All of these mechanisms have nothing to do with corruption or the bad will of people. They're just incentives. The only thing that stands from opposition, from proposition that we can weigh this against is that people are more engaged and there is less populism because you feel connected to the constitution. And I don't know, personally, I don't think of the constitution that often because it is a document we write so that the society can work. And from then on, we can do everything else. Laws are more into people's focus than the constitution itself. But moreover than that, I think that people are not going to feel represented when a group of delegates that they have no idea who they are,"

And oftentimes they come out being relatively bad due to bipartisanship. Their only response is just asserting that, no, this is really, really bad for democracy. I've already pointed out why this is contradictory. What they said underneath this is that politicians will be bad because they have perverse incentives. We gave you four layers of response. One, that they desire good PR for the future of their careers. Two, that they value democratic principles for the future of their parties and democratic alignments. Thirdly, that they fear public scrutiny because they are reliant on that for their mechanisms to change. But fourthly, that the likely comparative is not politicians making these changes, it's just delegates whereby politicians form a small part of the group but lastly in terms of like framing and set up there's only three quarter rules so they can't just run around saying oh we're going to change everything but at our worst case it's we have to ask who represents these individuals"

Second question on democratic engagement we told you a people get better connection because they can change underlying premises of democracy and b that it feels more modern because 30 years is less than 100. The idea that it is happening in your lifetime and that you can set the focus of the country. Their response was rather shallow. They said 30 to 50 years is just way too long. That's non-comparative because 30 to 50 years is just less than 100. We think that was the premise there. They did not dispute this. Their argument was that constitutional courts worsen and lose legitimacy. A, my second speaker's argument is largely dealt with. I don't explain why precedent is better on our side. B, we explained to you why this is difficult to get to pass. Thus, you lose viability on their side.

              "text": "in which social change and democracy is inhibited by the fact that it is just too slow. That is why we propose this motion. On counterfactual, how does the world change? There are two key differences that both sides are going to have to concede in this motion. Firstly, the immediacy in degree of change is higher on-site proposition. The reason for this is that amendments can only amend a specific change to the constitution. In that, you either put up a new amendment, you change the wording of an old amendment, or you strike that amendment entirely. On-site proposition, what you are allowed to do is rewrite the entire constitution. What this means is that the people in charge, that is to say delegates, have to go through every single part of the constitution and either have to approve it, strike it down or make an amendment to it. So the immediacy in degree of change is higher. Two, frequency is higher. Because in order to have a discussion of amendments, you need a large degree of public pressure because of the lack of a fixed time that everyone adheres to. When we on our side have a fixed time, the public knows when the change is going to happen, and thus it is regular. Opposition has to do both the actions of getting people into a convention and then also getting that amendment passed. Those are the two big differences that will occur once this motion goes through. Second thing then, in terms of delegates, we're talking about elected representatives or individuals in legislative bodies. The important thing to note is that these are people that individuals have consented into the representation of them because you vote them in to power. The most preferable option of pushing for constitutional change than in our world is likely to be that of the Constitutional Convention because it is the most frequent option. We recognize a trade-off in this debate in that we are likely to have fewer ad hoc amendments, but those come in favor of pushing those same ideas through in the form of constitutional change in the Constitution. For my arguments, sure. How often will these fixed periods be in effect? It will be roughly every election cycle. I don't know whether it will be on the election cycle, but roughly once every election cycle. First argument then as to why we are better able to get constitutional reform and why we get better forms of constitutional reform on our side. The context in this argument is to recognize that there is a significant time gap between the writing of a constitution and its implementation. Because in many, and thus in many instances, constitutions do not reflect the social attitudes of status quo. They reflect the social attitudes of when they were written. In the United States, the Constitution reflects the views of white rich men that own land in the 1700s. And because society is constantly changing, there is a necessity to reform the Constitution. The problem right now is that there is a massive barrier to entry in achieving that reform, because you need both political capital in order to call a vote, as well as the ability to overcome bureaucratic barriers to exist. Thus, on site opposition, there is a higher threshold needed to enact constitutional change. The problem is that that is disproportionately used by powerful parties parties because they are the ones that have agenda setting capacity, not just because they have the most votes, but also because they have things like incumbency advantage, because they are able to have other bureaucratic factors that give them a greater degree of power in being able to set up barriers to entry. Comparatively, we are better because we can see that in either world, opposition parties are going to be a minority. But at least in our world, we are able to get discussion of these issues in the first place. Thus, the marginal change you are able to receive is greater in our world. This is a debate-winning argument because the core reason you have a constitution is to enshrine the ability of people to represent themselves through change. secondly it's comparatively better because voters themselves feel better able to change the constitution when they realize that they have a greater degree of change in being able to do so when it becomes a voting priority that you are able to elect people that directly change the constitution second level under this argument is as to why we get greater public scrutiny of amendments because the problem with ad hoc amendments is that there is often a sense of urgency when they are proposed and thus they because they come about as a swell of public pressure thus there is very little time for the public to either understand the importance of it or for parties to rally sufficient support of it. Thus, even when you do have amendments, there's often very little scrutiny of them and thus they end up either being vague or shallow. Comparatively, we are better because the constitutional convention creates a greater pressure to make change when you are forced to take a stance on every single amendment and thus we are able to force for greater degrees of change in the amendments. The problem here then lies in social movements and that is the third part of this argument because in the absence of being able to read the constitution, the social movements in society are forced to defer to other methods of getting change. The main way they do so is through the legislature and doing things like passing law. This looks like the passing of Roe versus Wade. The problem with this is that it is very unstable because they can easily be reversed through other votes in the legislature."

Comparatively, even though minorities have no guarantee of success on either side of the house, on our side, when they have the political capital to be able to get that change, instead of channeling it into the legislature, they channel it into a constitutional change, which means that when we do get change, it is more stable. Second argument is why we get better political accountability. Two levels. Firstly, because we are better able to correct for institutional weakness, because in many constitutions, there are old documents that are open to interpretation, and thus are interpreted in ways that are beneficial to the political establishment. This looks like the interpretation of free speech laws as allowing for almost infinite amounts of campaign spending. The problem with this is that it creates a collective action problem in that these forms of clauses are beneficial to all parties and thus the issues do not become, are not even discussed in the first place. Thus, politicians can skirt accountability by never even discussing the issues and thus are never forced to take a stance. Comparatively, we are better because when politicians are forced to vote on every part of the constitution, they are forced to take a stance. This is more transparent to voters who now know exactly what part of the constitution their elected representative supports. Thus, if they do not want their representative in favor of things like extra campaign funding, they are later able to actually vote in an individual who opposes those ideologies. Secondly, is that we create an image change in that the constitution is no longer seen as a sacred document. Right now, politicians leverage the perception of the constitution as one that is a sacred document to prevent change in putting it up on a pedestal. In our world, the constitution is not only a document that can be changed regularly, it is one that should be. This means that individuals have a greater capacity in fighting for their rights through the best method of doing so. Because we make sure that constitutional democracies and democratic constitutions propose."

              "text": "So first on some stance, we prefer amendments instead. The difference between amendments and constitutions is twofold. Firstly, that amendments organically arise via political preferences. So for example, an MP proposes an amendment, you are not forced to relook the constitution every couple of years. But secondly, there's a much higher bar to get those amendments passed. For example, in Canada, it is a super majority in parliament and then a referendum vote. When you are talking about whether individuals have rights, we don't think proposition can say bureaucracy is bad in this case. Presumably, there should be a ton of barriers when you're talking about whether or not people have the right to live. We stand for a constitution that serves its purpose to enshrine rights without being susceptible to abuse. On rebuttal then, so firstly, proposition makes a differentiation between amendments and like this convention via the frequency and scope of change. I don't think this is sufficient differentiation. Like, I don't think it's a good thing that when the like, sure, the amendment might be outdated in some respects. But why not just make an amendment towards that specific clause than looking at every single other clause that happens to be good when the next guy can easily change it back when they're also talking about the frequency of change. Them justifying this by saying the Constitution was written by rich men is insufficient insofar as, yes, there might be some clauses we change, but we amend those when those rich men also enshrined our right to life, to a fair trial, to liberty and the security of person. I don't know why we need to look at everything else. Then they say that constitutions can be changed and that's a good thing. Four responses to this. Firstly, constitutions are fundamentally not supposed to be democratic. Laws are supposed to be democratic. The constitution is supposed to challenge the rule of the majority. If the majority wants to take away your rights, if they want to vote for a politician again and again and again, that's where term limits come in, in the constitution. That's where you say that you can't discriminate against people. We don't think that democracy should be the fundamental point of the constitution. Secondly, though, on scrutiny, this point is just a lie. Like if the constitution has existed for 200 years, why is there urgency now? If the constitution is so important, why don't you take your time? The Meech Lake Accord in Canada that attempted to change the constitution took months. And that's because you have far more scrutiny when there's only one amendment that happens only once every couple of years. People pay more attention to it. We went on scrutiny. Thirdly, constitutions and laws are for different purposes. This isn't a trade-off. The constitution, it's the structure of the government and the limitations. Laws are for specific things. Lastly, I don't know what this thing about politicians being forced to take a stance on issues mean. Presumably you learn what a politician's stance is through debate on votes and the part where they're actually running for office, where they have to explain their stance to get elected."

              "text": "First point then about politicization of the Constitution. Firstly, I'd like to frame that constitutions are already quite good at enshrining basic rights. Note that proposition couldn't give any illustrations as to why, like, a time that we need to change the constitution to improve the rights of the minority. That's because they're already quite good at it. Three reasons for this. Firstly, structurally, they're designed to enshrine limitations on the state's power to protect minority rights versus the majority by putting a cap on what the powerful can do. Secondly, amendments require a lot of support. So when you amend the constitution, it has to be extremely broadly popular and cross party lines. That's why amendments aren't just all shot down because of the bureaucratic system that prop hates. It's like past amendments such as women being able to vote in the United States or the 14th Amendment that created anti-discrimination in the Constitution. Those types of things were passed through amendments or things like the selfish aims of politicians aren't. Thirdly, there's something called analogous grounds in constitutional laws where existing rights imply other rights. So even if we don't specifically have a right to water, the right to life implies that, and the right to food and all of the right to life entails. The right to security of person was used in the debate in favor of abortion, meaning that even if we don't have specific things in the constitution, they can already be accessed through court interpretation. This breaks the deadlock in the debate then. Constitutions are good at protecting people, but these rights can easily be taken away."

              "end": 1271.02,
              "text": "Three mechanisms as to why states can abuse the constitutional convention. Firstly, there's a pressure to make changes every time this convention happens because politicians want to do something. Like even if you inherit a good economy, you are still expected to pass things. Parliament getting held up for a month, like debating the constitution and not having anything to show for it will lead to huge backlash, meaning politicians will make up issues where they don't exist. Secondly, this is subject to short-term democratic cycles. They talk about Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade could be overturned by like a conservative politician. This is because politicians can rile up their base around constitutional issues. The sentiment of the current political party can be applied to the committee that they appoint. So a tough-on-crime administration or a transitional democracy with a power-hungry government can change the constitution in its favor. Thirdly, on political horse trading and lobbying. So of course, this is everywhere in politics, but it's worse than the Constitution in two reasons. Firstly, constitutional law is more consequential as proposition concedes. But secondly, the stakes are much higher for lobbyists because the Second Amendment is existential for the NRA. And this is because the only way to get things passed is to make concessions in Parliament to other parties. So the Constitution will probably be a big deal to lots of political parties and will become the focus of negotiations, which means there's lots of political horse trading, lots of lobbying, which means that it's actually not as democratic as proposition states. What are the impacts of this then? Governments can abuse the constitution to do things that they want. This looks like changing political rights, term limits, or campaign caps on, sorry, donation caps on campaigns can be changed to screw over minority grassroots candidates in favor of the wealthy majority who can get a lot of donations. Things like legal protections, like discrimination against gay people in a homophobic country, or protections for indigenous people when the government wants to build a new oil pipeline, all of these things can be overturned. But thirdly, on legal rights, in a country that is fighting against terrorism, striking down protections against torture or access to a lawyer can easily be changed. All of these protections that currently exist can be undone. It is better for constitutions to be rigid. But for my second point, I'll take the POI. Given that if in a specific country, supermajority is the threshold that is necessary to change the constitution that remains symmetric, why don't all of these harms equally apply to ad hoc amendments? Well, no, it's not symmetric because you are saying that changing the constitution is far easier. We're saying that when there's a supermajority, people generally only amend things that are based on the fundamental rights of people. Now you allow politicians to do whatever they want. Second point on the convention, this convention is a political opportunity cost. It will take up a significant amount of time. Firstly, because constitutions are incredibly long and interpretable, every single word has to be examined. It has legal implications. Supreme Court cases take weeks to argue over the application of one clause. If proposition wants this to be thorough, imagine how long they will take, especially given its once-every-election cycle. Secondly, this will take up a disproportionate amount of political attention. Politicians will talk about the Constitution instead of other issues. It will take up a huge amount of time in the media. The impact here is that it will overshadow other political issues that will actually change lives for people on the ground. The impact here is that, firstly, it slows legislative change. We're going to be debating about a 200-year-old clause instead of passing essential infrastructure bills that will give jobs to people on the ground. We'll be trying to interpret whether the right to healthcare exists instead of expanding Medicare and Social Security. If Prop wants things to be thorough, they must sacrifice these things. But secondly, it clogs up the courts. The government is essentially paralyzed leading up to the convention, because once you change the constitution, everything just gets appealed. This means people have to wait months in jail waiting for a trial. The essential laws, like legalizing abortion that they want, wait for months as the government tries to put a stop to it through the constitution. Ultimately, we think polarization makes constitutions worse, but even if not, this opportunity cost is unjustifiable. The Constitution should be a basic outline of our rights, not an extension of political fights."

We have already done things like abolish term limits or abolish, not term limits, but in the vast majority of the world are existing issues that exist due to constitutional interpretations for which there is a collective action problem where no reform is likely to happen.

Notice that even things like political debates are controlled by the established elites, which means that if neither side is pushing each other to be able to talk about these issues, then the probability that you get politicians taking a stance on these issues is far less likely. They wanted to talk about analogous grounds, but that is precisely the problem.

              "text": "Here's where I want to bring back my first speaker's material, because we proved two things. Firstly, that in a world in which there is a fixed time to discuss these issues, you are far more likely to have politicians need to take a stance on these specific issues. This is because voters want to know how politicians will vote when there is an opportunity to examine specific clauses within the constitution. This is why it is necessary that you discuss every element of the constitution, because in a world in which you only have ad hoc amendments, politicians can simply deflect on the fact that they will never have to discuss an issue because a vote will never have to be passed in the first place. So their side of the house is one in which politicians evade accountability. The perfect example of this is the US. Many politicians probably want to seem like they support reforms of the existing system, but they are never forced to take an independent stance on things like campaign financing, and they often leverage the fact that there is an opportunity cost associated with discussing these issues in parliament and that this comes at the cost of attending to the more immediate needs of individuals as a way to deflect accountability, as a way to say that these issues don't need to be discussed. That is something that we can uniquely correct for when there is a fixed time and there is a guarantee of a discussion. Finally, they say that they have greater political accountability on their side of the house because they will be held captive by the fact that this is an ongoing constitutional assembly. In those instances, that is simply a regulatory barrier that we can correct for. Given that we don't have to hold people indefinitely in prison until the constitution is passed, we are happy to try them under the pre-existing constitution in those instances. There's largely technicality that we can avoid entirely. This is a debate winning argument because importantly the need for reform is something that is immediate and compelling and cuts across all political parties. We recognize that partisan politics is also an important part of this debate and both sides need to talk about"

That is uniquely possible only on our side of the house, where we trigger a discussion of these issues. Before I move on, I'll take that point. So what should politicians spend their time doing? Spending hours thoroughly discussing their stance in all 200 clauses, or actually drafting and passing laws that will help people on the ground and also allow voters to react? Okay, so depending on what stance politicians take, the time sensitivity of the constitutional assembly will change. We recognize that there are many fundamental parts of the constitution that neither side really wants to change, like the right to life, for example. Politicians would just immediately pass a vote to maintain that part of the clause,"

We began from the premise that constitutional reform is a necessity in any constitutional democracy. They concede to this fact when they support ad hoc amendments as the alternative to be able to reform constitutions. The question in this debate then is that given that politics is inherently majoritarian and that there is majority capture of political institutions that is likely to exist on either side of the house, which side is more accommodating of the needs of majorities? The first thing that they say here is that constitutions exist as a cap on what the political elite are able to do. The first thing that I want to note is that just because there is a greater frequency of change for the constitution does not mean that people are alluded to what the importance of the constitution is. So I think in instances where we do call a constitutional assembly, people will be aware of the implications that that might have. Uniquely, this is something that we access on our side of the house because ad hoc amendments allow individuals to not take a particular stance on these issues and not preemptively prepare for when they want to vote. This is why our analysis on voting preferences was so important because on their side of the house, ad hoc amendments will still happen. But when they happen, they happen without the consent of people or even without their awareness because it is unclear whether a politician will have an opportunity to vote on an ad hoc amendment."

On either side of the House, conservative politicians are probably going to be against furthering things like minority rights, but that is a harm that is entirely symmetric. Politicians that self-identify as progressive, however, are now forced to take a stance on these issues in such a way that it is beneficial for minorities. The second quibble that they make here is that supermajorities prevent capture of political institutions. If it is true that in Canada, you require a supermajority to pass an amendment, that will probably happen on our side of the House as well. It is only that that supermajority is achieved in a constitutional assembly. So that was not an independent mechanism that they could claim for their side of the house. The second thing that they talked about was political horse trading. But this becomes worse on their side of the house because the NRA and other organizations that have deeply motivated members are able to leverage that fact to push for change outside of the public eye. This means that backdoor channels and political negotiations become far less transparent in a world in which it is not the constitution that is changing, but an interpretation of the constitution for individual laws, for example. If we are able to centralize change into the constitution, the ability for opposition parties to be able to rally support against the NRA and other organizations is far higher. The final quibble that we get here is that politicians want to do other things. The first thing that I've already covered is that these assemblies are likely to be time sensitive. But secondly, it is uniquely on our side of the house that minority parties have an agenda setting ability. In order to have a discussion of an amendment, you first need to pass a vote in order to get the political elite discussing this issue in the first place. It is uniquely on our side of the house that minority parties have an opportunity to leverage their stance on particular amendments. On their side of the house, majority parties retain an agenda-setting ability. This breaks the deadlock in this debate because it is on our side of the house that we better cater to the interests of minorities for all of these reasons side with side proposition."

              "text": "First of all, on the material on scrutiny and accountability, I have a few sets of responses. First, I want to point out just how laughable a claim this actually is. Politicians take thousands of stances in any given election, break thousands of promises over the course of their career in office. It seems ridiculous that people genuinely hold you to account on these promises and that they will do so on their world. But second, you get a huge amount of scrutiny on our side because singular issues have, because we are supporting singular issues, getting things like amendments and they have overcome a support threshold. This is good notably because it prevents things like conservative abuse, the abuse of minority groups who are extremists and are trying to implement negative policies. And this is key. Notice that on their side, it is easy to escape responsibility because of the reality of party politics, that it is not the case that you can control a single electoral outcome. And for that reason, you aren't blamed and you aren't held account for when it fails. And this is precisely why you don't need to be held to account on your stance, that politicians can take any stance that they want and that they aren't actually held accountable and that doesn't fall through. So what that means is even if politicians are actually holding and taking stances on their side, that doesn't provide them with anything meaningful at the end of this debate and it doesn't lead to any particular sets of changes being made. But their claim is also ridiculous, because everyone isn't going to memorize every single clause in the Constitution and won't be able to make an informed vote accordingly. Like, realistically, people do not have the time to memorize economic policy, which affects them on their day-to-day life, much less the Constitution, which has hundreds of clauses. More. Why aren't laws an acceptable alternative in the absence of this? Note, they understand that they don't actually access any asymmetry here because they end up trying to win on discussion in their first argument and even more so in their second speech. And the reason is because we already get immense political will to access democratic reforms as far as amendments. What that suggests is that there is a huge amount of political will that we can access to achieve amendments, but when these social groups are in the minority, it is highly unlikely in their world that they will actually be able to influence any forms of amendments in the first place. Lastly, the question is then, where are laws easier to change? Is it in a context where the constitution can be amended and changed and rewritten every four years, or is it via an amendment which is permanent, or even in a law that is constitutionally protected by a constitution that is again permanent? What that suggests is that the best protection for the groups that they want, irrespective of any considerations of accountability, end up coming on our side because of the permanence of the constitution that we create. Let's weigh this up against our second argument, which suggests that negotiations and the process of creating these constitutions aren't actually a referendum on people's will. What it is, in fact, is the process of mass amounts of course trading end up not realizing people's democratic preferences in a meaningful way. That suggests that when policies and constitutions do not look the way that individuals actually thought they would, that A, politicians are not held to account, but B, that it doesn't realize any of the benefits of their accountability argument, because in the end, it is not a democratic representation of people's will. On to the second theme on the abuse of politicization."

              "text": "There are a couple of things to say. First, this is incredibly unlikely. Your job as a judge who has studied the constitution is to follow that constitution and interpret it in just ways. That is why even someone like Neil Gorsuch can support things like constitutional protections for LGBTQ individuals because of the fact that it abides by the constitution that he has been trained to study. Second, there is a long-term disincentive to act in political ways. And the reason is, if politicians manipulate the Constitution in our world or manipulate the courts in our world, there is an extreme likelihood that their successor will do the same thing, that they will overwrite and override every single policy that they ended up passing in the first place. There is a massive disincentive to have that because politicians want their policies to stay in. But on their world, there is an expectation that you will actually manipulate the Constitution because you are given permission to do so by the four-year cycle. And they suggest that there's a huge amount of public pressure for you to make changes in the first place. All of that means that politicization is much stronger on their side, whereas there's an active disincentive against it on our world. And let's talk further about their mechanism on establishment. A couple of things to note. First of all, you can actually aggregate people's preferences meaning is a collective action problem because politicians want to benefit themselves. That would suggest that they will continue to want to benefit themselves in the process of creating stances for these constitutions. So then let's break the deadlock as far as the worst types of policies that actually happen in this round. Our two thirds majority does a better job of protecting against the worst excesses of the constitution. But furthermore, the fact that our frame, which isn't challenged, is that constitutions are broadly quite moderate and protect good liberal rights, means that we can get liberal policies that are passed on our side legally, but you can't get harmful conservative policies passed on our side because they are constitutionally illegitimate. So then, our argument on politicization wins this theme."

This is an independent principle of good, but it is also something that is structurally meaningful for a huge number of people in society. But second, our claim on horse trading is incredibly important. And the reason that it is worse, as opposed to what second proposition suggests, is that it has a much greater effect. It is the constitution that affects every single legal case, every single law that is written. That is a massive effect. And so if horse trading is going to result in bad outcomes, which they do not challenge, by the way, it means that it's going to be much worse for people. On the third argument on reducing international certainty and cooperation. In order for cooperation to be possible between international actors, there needs to be certainty over how they will act. This is because otherwise countries can be screwed over, alliances can be broken, etc. Because there are information barriers now, countries become fearful. This is, for example, constitutional democracies potentially demarcating greater territory in the South China Sea, or Japan potentially repealing Article 9 and having a military. This raises tensions because countries are worried about these changes and don't know what to expect. Further, this creates an incentive on international actors to influence these processes. So China threatening Japan in the lead up to a constitutional decision to prevent changes that threaten China. This means negotiation and cooperation becomes much harder, but also that by reducing certainty, this increases tensions in the world because there's a huge amount of uncertainty between international actors. Alliances fall apart, information falls apart. On that basis, I'm proud to oppose."

But the uniquely pernicious harm of this motion not passing is that you only have ad hoc amendments to pass these constitutional reforms. There is no ability for other parties to even enter this discussion, and that's what we think is so uniquely harmful. The second observation I want to make is about the ludicrous third argument that they want to present about foreign relations within countries.

But thirdly, in terms of the impact this has on broader policies pushed by political parties. First then, on which side is more conducive to constitutional reform? And we told you one key thing that they have yet to respond to, that there's a necessity to act because of the way that constitutions are formed. Because we told you that the unique problem with constitutions is because of the historic inability to make them change. They still have extremely archaic, racist laws encoded into them. This looks like eminent domain clauses that allows you to seize minority properties as political parties seize fits. This looks like right to refuse clauses that haven't changed since they were entered into the constitution. They can see that the barriers of entries to change the constitution is high because of things like bureaucracy and an inability to muster political will. We told you that this was uniquely pernicious for two reasons. One is because we recognize that if the harm that they wanted to peddle today is your ability to subvert minority rights, I think they're being far too charitable with what constitutions actually look like as of status quo. Because I refute the claim and the premise that constitutions as of status quo balance minority rights well. If it is true that minority rights are catered to at all under existing constitutions, this is probably going to be the same in our world, because they're primarily based on popular will, as they tell you. And if popular will exists to care about minorities, that is something that will still exist in our world. So that phantom harm of you reversing all of these progressive politics, progressive amendments, is a harm that only exists in their mind and in their prep room. The second thing to notice here is that if pushing your own pernicious agendas is a harm that exists, this is a harm that exists more perniciously in their world. Because think of the political parties that actively do have the power to change and include amendments, right? These are political parties that have huge amounts of political capital that can sufficiently put through ad hoc amendments. So if their harm is things like exceeding term limits, this is a harm that is made more pernicious in their world."

The second thing to note here is that we have voters that are able to hold them accountable, because they might tell you that politicians need to justify their stance in either world, but this is false. This is because inso far as you can change amendments as in when you see it, and this is not something that is seen as a important voter priority as they can see it, the ability for voters to even know what is happening with their constitutions is relatively low. We think that this is crucial. But the last thing they push us on is the frequency of change. And I'm just going to bite the bullet here. We're completely fine with the frequency of change being relatively higher in our world. Why is this true? Because even if there's an ability to change constitutions, it does not mean you always act on it. In instances in which you do change the constitution, it is probably because those constitutions are repressive and oppressive and do not accurately measure your needs. So even if we have to bite the bullet of constitutions changing more, we think that this is perfectly fine. And this is something that we're actually winning on in today's debate.

Doesn't that suggest that things get worse on your side because coalitions randomly form which don't end up actually reflecting people's democratic preferences, so the things get worse on your side because coalitions randomly form which don't end up actually reflecting people's democratic preferences so the abuses get worse? If your counterfactual is ad hoc amendments then political coalitions will exist in your world and push their majority will. In our world we have the ability for minority parties to have their own political coalitions so thank you actually for the good analysis. Second metric here on political accountability. First thing to note is that they didn't respond to any of our analysis on how this creates a collective action problem that you cannot subvert. Because in that world, if you benefit off of things like loopholes in constitutions, you can simply brush this off. Insofar as this becomes a voting priority and voters are aware of this, you have no ability to do so. The second thing that we told you is about greater scrutiny. In that world, it is only uniquely ad hoc amendments. You cannot predict voter awareness and you cannot even direct their attention to when these things occur. When there's a specific date and time, the ability for you to recognize when these issues are happening and for you to divert media capital to them is far greater. The last thing they tell you here is that in response to this is that political parties can break promises anyway. We think that this is a completely symmetric harm. This is why we have voters voting you in and out of political parties anyway. We think the comparative of constitutions that was formed eons ago is simply non-comparative. The last idea that I'm going to push them on here is that having broad constitutions is a good thing. We think that this is absolutely problematic because if it is true that broad amendments means that there's interpretative ability on part of judges, this is probably something that is going to hurt minorities themselves because if the benevolence of judges do not align with what is necessarily in line with minorities, this means that you can use interpretative measures to actually oppress minorities. In our world, when there's more clearer understanding of what amendments are, which is the point of our debate, we told you that you have better constitutional reforms. Third and last clash that we clearly win on. And this is the impact on broader politics. All they told you here is that there's an opportunity cost in pursuing this, and this means that politicians make something up. Two responses here. First, politicians won't arbitrarily make up stances if it's something that cuts across their interests, but two, political parties have an inherent incentive to remain popular and pass things like infrastructure bills if there is something that actually does help them and brings more voters to the ballot box. The deadlock breaker in this particular metric is that they can see that in the absence of being able to change the constitution, all of your political efforts are going to be focused through local governments pushing laws. The reason why this is pernicious is all the harm that they wanted to talk about, because if their problem today is that the frequency of change is too high, do you know whether that is the most pernicious? It is precisely in local governments where individual courts can overturn laws, when there's less political capital needed to actually overhaul the laws in place. So if their problem was frequency of change, it is something that is worse off in their world, where local governments are their only alternatives. We told you that democracy is not perfect in either world. The only way to correct for this is when you have more voter accountability. For all these reasons, propose."

But second, it's just not true. Like conservative parties do benefit more from donations because their because their electorates are richer. So there is still an incentive on liberal parties to push against that. I'm going to talk"

So firstly, on politicization, I want to point out the new strategy coming out of second problem, which is to wash out the entire debate by saying that politicization is symmetric, that there's still going to be majority capture by political institutions, and the only difference is scrutiny. There are a few things that I want to point out, aside from the fact that if it's true that majority political institutions and majority parties have power on our side, it's probably true that they have power on their side as well.

              "text": "in many countries, there are strong safeguards against politicization, where judges have gone to law school and spent their lives committed to the Constitution and are unwilling to abuse it. We point to the example of Gorsuch in the United States, who frequently votes across the aisle on textualist and literalist interpretations of the Constitution. For example, ruling that protections against trans discrimination follow logically from protection against sex-based discrimination. But second, we told you that presidents don't want to appoint their ideological allies because then the same could happen with later political successors and opponents. So, for example, Democrats saw the cost of doing this when a few years later, Amy Coney Barrett was nominated by Republicans. The difference is now on their side. You have to politicize it because it's now an expectation and other parties are doing it as well. On our side, we do have a resolution of that collective action problem where parties do not want to engage in politicized nominations because it'll come back to bite them. So that takes out the first part of their path to victory, which is that politicization is symmetric. Clearly it is not. The second part of their path to victory is if politicization is symmetric, the biggest deadlock breaker is on public scrutiny. Two things we point out on public scrutiny. One, there are so many different clauses in the Constitution that it's unlikely you have strong democratic pressure or input into any given one of them. This is how parties can very effectively escape accountability placed on them in campaigns. But second, we told even second op that it's easy for the ruling government and ruling parties to escape accountability and campaign promises to modify the Constitution on the basis of political realities within the legislature. This is analogous, for example, to Joe Manchin refusing to do basically any good thing on the basis that, well, it wasn't bipartisan. So we don't think just because you introduce something to the political spectrum, that necessarily means there's going to be massive accountability and public scrutiny and parties are actually going to be held to their promises of how they promised to modify the constitution. Then the response from second prop is, well, the real difference is no one understands the importance of ad hoc amendments. Really? No, thank you. When they are so infrequent and when they are considered most important and when they happen after significant national reckonings, for example, in the case of Article 9 in Japan, I find it massively implausible for them to suggest that nobody understands the importance of these massive changes to the constitution, which both sides concede are extremely important. Then they say politicians won't take a stance on our side. Obviously, they have to because supermajority is needed. So by necessity, they end up doing so. This eliminates both assumptions underlying their path to victory. The final claim we get from them is constitutions are super outdated. The first thing I want to point out is they never engaged our mitigation about why constitutions generally enshrine broad rights and protections. The reason is because they were drafted with supermajority amendments and agreements are only made on broad and generally accepted phenomena like the right of women to vote, for example, like enshrinement of basic rights of equality or the 14th amendment against anti-discrimination. Constitutions were also designed as a form of contract, a way of ensuring that states have reasonable expectations of their citizens to pay taxes and citizens have expectations of their states to give them benefits in return. So we think broadly they enshrine broad and respectable principles that cannot be manipulated in the way they set. The second thing I want to point out is on the weighing here. They might point to a few cases where outdated protections on things like free speech, for example, lead to difficulties in limiting political lobbying. But this is marginal for a few reasons. One, we demonstrated an important normative claim about the function of constitutions,"

              "text": "which is to guard against government abuse and enshrine broad protections. So regardless of left or right or which policies are passed, there's an inherent good in protecting against government coercion and ensuring that human rights of minorities aren't trampled on by majority rights. Second, for every outdated clause that they can reform, there is a politicized conservative clause that they can implement. On the margins, we told you bad policies are more likely to be implemented on their side because constitutions enshrine broad notions of equality that are compatible with liberal values, a response given in second opposition that still has gone unengaged with. But thirdly, any benefits they get to social movements are short-term and can be reversed. For example, Roe v. Wade when the next Republican government comes to power. And that's especially true if there's going to be huge political pressure on each government in each election cycle to reverse, which is necessary if you believe any of their arguments on political scrutiny to happen. So any benefits they get are inherently short-term, which is why in this debate, you should prioritize protecting against the abusive power of governments and the ability to subtly manipulate laws that are A, bad in themselves, but B, regressive because we've proven that on net, broad values enshrined in the Constitution allow for liberal values to be promoted. Before I go on to the second theme, I'll take the POI. Beneficial rights like universal suffrage are unlikely to change through Constitution in either world. What ability do minorities have to introduce amendments if they do not have popular political will of majorities? Yeah, so I'm getting to that now. On the opportunity cost theme, their argument seems to be that minority parties now have power. I really don't understand this argument because they are still minority parties within the legislature. So they lack the democratic control and influence to pass policies that appeal to them anyway. I'm completely unclear as to where the asymmetry is. And this is a gaping hole in their argument that they've still not proven. Our argument on the political opportunity cost was essential. We told you that constitutional amendments are likely to capture media attention, are likely to be very long in terms of reversing and changing and modifying every single detail within every single clause. There are two important implications to this. Number one, that politicians can distract from pressing issues by pointing to trivial fights over the constitution in a lead up to elections. But number two, the legislation that is crowded out on their side is actually better. Note that campaigns aren't good from a perspective of public scrutiny when it comes to constitutional conventions, because there's too much fights over specific wording that aren't prone to democratic input and to an expression of values in the same way that you have when you're voting on broad legislation like infrastructure bills, for example, that are passed in the United States. So if this crowds out legislation, which is comparatively more capable of being prone to public scrutiny because it's less prone and less susceptible to these specific battles that necessarily capture political attention on their side of the house, it is better in that respect in respecting public will. Thirdly and finally, I want to put certainty on the terms of engagement internationally. The response from third prop is foreign policy is decided by governments anyway. But what we pointed out is that they need to operate within the scope of constitutional requirements. For instance, where the lines of your land are demarcated, which islands you control in the South China Sea, or even important changes like Article 9 that are enshrined in the Constitution. Our argument was very simple. Constitutions enshrine broad things that states need to respect in the way that they engage with other countries. When there is now massive uncertainty over that, you risk inflaming tensions within the international sphere because there's no guarantee that you're going to respect, for example, your territorial expansion. For all those reasons, we oppose."

They bring this up in a POI to Matt as well, and we'll just change everything else. Great. Why not just amend the bad clauses? We broke this deadlock in three ways. Firstly, that amendments already only pass things that are extremely popular, such as basic rights, such as your right to not be discriminated against, while there's a far lower bar on proposition if they wanted efficacy and if they wanted to hand power to every political party that ended up in office. Secondly, when you normalize changing the constitution every four years, when parties are given permission to do it every political cycle to change and strike down constitutional clauses, even if we have an equal ability to make good changes, our changes still last for far longer because theirs will just be flipped in the next political cycle.

Like, I don't know how your right to having security of person can be interpreted in a bad way to oppress minorities. But we can certainly narrow the constitution and strike down important things, which is what happens on Proposition's world. We can undo all of the good progress that has been made. We explain two mechanisms here. Firstly, on political cycles, some politicians are corrupt. They're tough on crime. They're racist. They're homophobic. Proposition hands them a golden ticket to enshrine what they want in the constitution. This wasn't taken down by third prop's thing about lobbying being symmetric. But secondly, on lobbying and political horse trading, constitutions are important and politicians will compromise for support in legislature, meaning that it actually ends up being unrepresentative. Third prop says it's symmetric to amendments. This ignores all of our analysis about how amendments only happen once in a while, how there's a far higher bar to change them. So nobody would support one politician trying to improve their own standing or violating the sanctity of existing rights. They never analytically refute our case. They need to deal with these impacts. A tough on crime party getting rid of restrictions against torture and modifying access to fair trials. The Republican Party overturning campaign funding limits to drown out minority candidates. A government who wants to build a shiny pipeline and getting rid of land protections for indigenous people.

If the government and the people of the world have a word to speak for the salvation of the world, now is the time and now is the last time when words will be of any use, for it is wrong in its direct effect, and it is wrong in its prospective principle to allow lethal autonomous weapons, from now on referred on our side as killer robots, to be developed. Let me elaborate. First of all, our definitions. We define autonomous as robots that search, find, and execute a target on its own, essentially a robot or a drone that is pre-programmed to make decisions instead of human controlling it. Lethal is something that is used to attack and kill and we must ban development and not just regulate. I will demonstrate why in three layers of analysis. First of all,"

Therefore it is easier to replicate these and therefore it is necessary that no nations develop this technology whatsoever. And see, why solve a problem when you can prevent it? Less money and effort to control it, less money and effort to control something that hasn't even been developed yet in the first place. Let me introduce the model that I'll be working with today. Firstly, I will show you three precedents that have already taken place where such bans have worked. The 1983 Convention on Conventional Weapons, the 1995 Protocol on Blinding Lasers, and the 2004 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 on weapons of mass destruction. These bans, yes? In these kinds of situations, we think it's far more likely that a robot will follow things like the laws of war because that can be programmed. The same guarantee does not exist for humans. I'm not sure I exactly understand how that point comes here, but we'll actually get to robots following the rules of war in my first argument, which they cannot do, and I will demonstrate that."

              "text": "Even if only one of these layers holds up argumentation, any and all use of killer robots is illegal and a crime against humanity. Now first, let me get to proportionality. The international humanitarian law prohibits disproportionate attacks in which civilian harm outweighs military benefits. These concepts are abstract, not easily quantified, and highly relative to specific contexts of subjective estimates of value. Humans are better suited to make such value judgments, which cannot be boiled down to a simple algorithm. Military necessity dictates that military force should only be used against the enemy to the extent necessary for winning the war. Imagine a scenario where a killer robot has already shot a person once. How would they know that it is necessary to shoot them again? For safety reasons, it might shoot them again when it's not necessarily humiliating the dead body. Now this will have impacts I will get to later. No thank you. But first let me get to distinction, the bedrock principle of international humanitarian rule. It says that the Geneva Convention states that combatants must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants. Attacks that fail to distinguish are indiscriminate and unlawful. It is as simple as that. Fully autonomous weapons will not have the ability to sense or interpret the difference between soldiers and civilians. Especially in contemporary combat environments, asymmetric conflicts in urban populations has become the norm. They offer no true distinguishing uniform or insignia. Firstly, insurgents could trick these robots by concealing their weapons, but most importantly humans understand one another in a way that machines cannot. Cues can be subtle and there are an infinite number of circumstances where lethal force is inappropriate. For example, imagine a frightened mother may run after her two children and yell at them to stop playing with toy guns near a soldier. A human soldier could easily identify with the mother's fear and the children's gain and thus recognize their intentions as harmless, while a fully autonomous weapon might only see an angry person running toward it with two armed individuals. Now the first level of impact is that this would break international law, but even more importantly, that innocent men, women, and children would be killed unnecessarily. And a third level of impact would be that it is shown that if civilians are killed or even humiliated, then there will be greater retribution, greater resistance movements, and thus prolonged conflict."

But this is especially important in war, where the stakes are so high. If someone does something bad, they must be punished and their mistake must be corrected. Now, not being physically close to a person you're harming makes it much easier to do harm. The Milgram experiment in the 1960s showed that people are willing to incur surprising levels of harm on others if they are separated by them and ordered by an authority figure. Programming killer robots is also rather impersonal. You work with criteria, algorithm and lines of code, but that have the same impact as pulling the trigger. Now, first of all, programmers this way will not experience PTSD, which otherwise would force people to think twice. Furthermore, just like in video games where you can die repeatedly, you can act irresponsibly without fearing the consequences. A programmer might be reprimanded, but they're not going to feel the guilt of 10 years prison or the guilt of having killed two innocent lives. Now, the impact of this argument is that it breaks the UN Chapter 7 and the Geneva Convention because it causes unnecessary harm on these people, which is especially important because, well, we may never stop warfare. We can make it more humane. And that is what we stand for today. Thank you very much."

It means that all of their argumentation about robots being completely incapable of judging these sorts of things fall because we would extensively, extensively test this technology to the point where it is able to do this and would not deploy this technology if it failed to do so. With that, let's introduce some rebuttal to all of their case. Before, they had two main arguments about humaneness and increasing distance, but they also had this one-off line about increasing arms races. We think this is true of all military technology, not unique to LAWs, and not really important in this round. Well, let's talk about their first argument about improving humaneness. Let's just point out, we have a number of responses. First, that humans have violated literally every single one of these standards. They say that if LAWs violate even one of these standards, we do not deploy them. This is just kind of an inevitable consequence, and we think it's actually more likely in a world where humans are engaging in this warfare. That's the comparative. Second, we already talked about our model. If it is inconsistent with any of these ideas, we wouldn't deploy it. But third and finally, let's just talk about what humans do on the battlefield, right? When you're under fire and are under super stressful conditions where you're having to make split-second decisions about whom to kill and whom not to kill when you're fearing for your life, you're very unlikely to be able to think in split seconds about proportionality and military necessity and distinguishing between civilians. We think that LAWs, because they just are technologically superior, are able to account for all of this much better and actually adhere to the laws of war far better. We'll explain more about this in our first argument. On to their second argument, they told you that by increasing distance, we increase violence. This was kind of a bit assertive, and we think actually the opposite is true, that when we have programmers deciding about the parameters under which LAWs are going to operate, they're much more likely to be more conservative and avoid things like civilian casualties and the like, decreasing the irrational decision-making on the battlefield that we think is so problematic. But our second response to this is basically their argument civilian casualties and the like, decreasing the irrational decision-making on the battlefield that we think is so problematic. But our second response to this is basically their argument is that we need soldiers to feel ridiculously traumatized after they kill someone in order to reduce their ability to do so. We don't really think that that is principally justified. We don't think that subjecting millions of people to mass amounts of PTSD is a legitimate way to reduce conflict, there are other ways to do it that our side does better."

              "text": "With that, let's introduce our first argument about how LAWs reduce wartime atrocities. Two ideas under this. The first is that they prevent human atrocities because they don't have human fallibilities. Again, the comparative here is humans, who are worse for two reasons. First is fear. In life and death situations, when there are bullets and bombs whizzing by your head there is overwhelming incentives to act irrationally. This leads to soldiers doing things like flinching and shooting a civilian and projecting that fear into other situations. One of the main reasons that sexual assault is so high in conflict zones is because soldiers attempt to regain power and control after feeling helpless and terrified in violent war zones. The second problem with humans is with retributive rage. Governments use nationalism to motivate soldiers to demonize the enemy, to get them to do all of the horrible things that are necessary for soldiers to do in war. This explains how soldiers come to see eventually their enemies as effectively non-human, leading them to commit some of the worst atrocities in warfare. This looks like the atrocious torture that happened in the Abu Ghraib prison during human engagements in the Middle East. Could bad governments not use this technology to kill siblings the same way they do now? We think that bad governments are going to exist on both sides of the house, and they're going to use the same dehumanizing tactics for their soldiers to get them to commit these atrocities and worse. We think it is incredibly unlikely that a cool-headed room of programmers, military officials, and civilian leaders who all have to buy in to the kind of programming that LAWs have to have in order to be built are going to do things like program robots to rape or torture civilians, which are incredibly unstrategic things to do. All of this buy-in limits the possibility of that happening. In contrast, when one terrified soldier on the opposite side of their home country, who literally does not think that a Vietnamese woman is human, decides to rape that Vietnamese woman, all it takes is buy-in from that one terrified soldier. That is much less likely in a world where we have to have all of this accountability before deploying LAWs. Let's Vietnamese woman, all it takes is buy-in from that one terrified soldier that is much less likely in a world where we have to have all of this accountability before deploying LAWs. Let's get to the second idea under this argument, that we record and report atrocities that happen when human members of the military would otherwise stay silent. Platoons of soldiers are often incredibly intensely loyal to one another, they're in conflict zones together, and they really don't want to inform on one another, even when they do horrific, atrocious things. We think this is less likely in a world where LAWs are directly monitoring the situation. We'd even be happy to send this footage directly to civilian leaders to ensure that accountability happens."

              "text": "But our second argument is that LAWs enable militaries to better protect all people. Two ideas under this. The first is that they increase defensive capacities. Remember that this debate is not just about offensive military robots. It's also about defensive things like, say, the U.S.'s Phalanx system, which is an LAW that automatically shoots down missiles without any kind of human intervention and does so way more effectively because of technological limitations surrounding humans than they possibly can. These defensive mechanisms are really important because we think it's government's obligation to defend their soldiers in a way that human operators technologically can't. They have an obligation to protect the citizens who pay taxes to them, follow their laws, fight and die for them, and we think improving defensive capacities in addition to offensive ones is very important. Our second idea under this argument is that we improve choices about when to use offensive capacities. Intervention without LAWs is worse because we fail to intervene in humanitarian cases because there are political risks from soldier casualties. There are already plenty of incentives to go to war for geopolitical reasons or things like resource extraction, and we already see governments doing that on their side in the status quo. What we don't see governments doing is intervening in things like genocide in other countries that don't pose a direct threat to their own security and means you're in protected time and means that it's really hard to justify politically for soldiers to intervene. This looks like things like missions the US not deploying troops to Rwanda where there's a horrific genocide happening because they fear political backlash akin to political backlash that happened in the 90s when a humanitarian mission was shot down in Somalia. We do not have these risks on our side of the house. Saving millions of people like Tutsi minorities that were massacred during these genocides, we're very proud to oppose. Thank you. Thank you.

Basically they came up here and tell us that actually they will only deploy these killer robots since there's extensive testing and that we can be 100% sure and actually we will just shut them down if they do something bad. First of all, they hugely mischaracterize their whole case. Basically, what we know about killer robots is that they can search, find, and execute, right? So they are basically thinking on their own, acting on their own, meaning that they cannot only just develop their own language and act on their own. The people who are actually over them, we lose, actually, in the end, a certain kind of control over these robots, right? So we tell you that this is only an ideal world where this can actually happen. And if team opposition tries to make this case, they're actually conceding from their burden where we are actually arguing about lethal autonomous weapons which are actually 100% AI, who can actually think, do stuff for themselves, and actually harm citizens on their own and think on their own. So what did we hear as a rebuttal from them? So basically we had this first argument about how we have right now three pillars of international law in the current international framework about proportionality, necessity, and distinction. And they just disregarded our whole argument and said that, no, these will actually be better because we'll have killer robots which will be 100% sure and doing everything what we do. But ladies and gentlemen, the main issue is that even if we have those very good killer robots, we are telling you that they cannot really fit into the current international model of law, right? So we tell you that there's proportionality, that there will be actually certain cases where these robots won't be able to determine that when to actually shoot someone or not shoot someone, is it actually needed to win that certain war, or is it not needed? And we tell you that it's very hard to distinction in these cases where we don't have this, right? And lastly, our first speaker already told you that we see that the main issue here is not only that this does not fit into the current international law, and we need to reform that before, but also that we will lose a certain kind of responsibility because we don't know who was the person who actually didn't make the distinction before that competent or the soldier, right? We won't know that who will be the one who actually harms citizens unnecessarily because there will be only programmers sitting behind the screen. No, thank you."

They are characterizing humans as savages, basically, who just go out because there were certain atrocities in certain wars, and therefore they characterize humans I will take you, as savages all over.

So what do we see? I will give you three levels of analysis on lowering the barriers of war. So we'll tell you why is it easier to start a war when there's actually these killer robots in place, why there will be civilians disproportionately suffering after this motion is in place, and why there will be a bigger backlash on especially developing nations. So what we see is that right now in the status quo, actually their states are not starting wars because they see the human casualty, right? We saw that in the Second World War, in the Vietnam War, and in war that people will, states will first think about how many humans can they actually kind of sacrifice for this cause, right? So if we won't have these casualties, then it will be much easier for states to just start the war, right? Because there won't be anything to think about. In the Vietnam War, as I already told you, people were protesting because their brothers were dying. So we tell you that if there's not such an issue for a country it will be much easier for them to start the war and they will, and they will actually. So what we are telling telling you that there will be civilians actually bearing the consequences right because we tell you that war is bad in itself even if it's fought with robots even if no so to speak combatants or not so to speak civilians are dying why because there will be devastation in the area where the war is happening right infrastructure will be damaged and all shipping will get into the certain era businesses will go out of operation as a result, people won't be able to have access to water, food or anything, the environment will be damaged for years, the shells will need to be collected and landmines will be all over the place. So we are telling you that even if in the long term we see that these areas where wars were happening, even with robots, CBNs will actually bear the backlash because they will be the ones suffering. Lastly, developing countries will be the ones bearing the backlash because countries who are rich won't be fighting on their own lands they will just go out for proxy war for example to Syria and have their own robots fight there because it's much easier and their infrastructure and their own civilian population won't be harmed that's why it's much easier for the US to start wars in the Middle East because there's no harm on their harmed. That's why it's much easier for the U.S. to start wars in the Middle East, because there's no harm on their side, and that's why Europe was devastated after two world wars, because it actually happened on their land. So because on our side, there are ways for more humane warfare, we are so proud to propose that. Thank you."

              "text": "I hear a lot of mechanistic quibbles about international law and quote-unquote killer robots that only are used offensively for massive destruction. This is not what the debate is about. We think they have completely missed what the heart of this round ought to be about. We think we're already ahead. In this speech, I'm first going to be engaging with all of the material that we've heard so far, coming out of the proposition, before secondly delivering our third substantive argument that analyzes the human cost of going to war. But now let's get into this first idea. They talk about how lethal autonomous weapons violate international law. We have a number of responses. First off, note that in their last speech they never once engaged with it. Ella tells you and makes very clear in her first speech that actually having lethal autonomous weapons decreases conflict overall. Why is this the case? We talked to you about the idea that lethal autonomous weapons can be used in specific instances and more surgically to actually have better identification of what actual targets are. For example, if we think a soldier comparatively is on the battlefield and they see someone approaching them, they're much more likely to actually depend on things like fear, anger, and self-preservation to act retributively instead of actually defensively. We think that on our side of the house, we actually help civilians more. But the second thing that we told you underneath this pragmatic point is that weapons will still be tested before they're deployed, meaning that we can actually test to ensure that a robot can distinguish, for example, between a farmer holding a pitchfork or a rebel holding an AK-47, or a child holding a rock and a militant holding a pitchfork or a rebel holding an AK-47 or a child holding a rock and a militant holding a grenade before deploying it. We think that all the mechanistic quibbles they have are just that and we don't think that's the actual comparative in the debate. But now let's really get into this issue about violating international law. We think that first, similarly to any time international law is violated in war, accountability can still exist for lethal autonomous weapons. Note, the proposition never gives us a reason for why lethal autonomous weapons would not be held liable to the same international law. In the highest ground, we first tell you the idea that lethal autonomous weapons are less likely to commit these kinds of crimes, but if they were, we assume that in some cases, lethal autonomous weapons might malfunction. We still think we can hold two actors accountable that in and of themselves prevent these kinds of crimes from occurring in the first place. The first actor that we would be happy to hold accountable is a programmer who caused a lethal autonomous weapon to perform an operation that violates international law. Similar to how one can track individual edits on a Google Doc, programmers can individually be held liable. We think that for that specific code they contribute. The second is the war general who chooses to deploy an LAW. I think we already talked about this enough in our model in our first speech, and we think that generals have an incentive to be selective in deploying LAWs, meaning they're less likely to put them in situations that warrant these kinds of international law breaking in the first place. But let's really engage with the comparative. If a human soldier breaks international law, what do we tell you in our first speech? For example, with the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, where U.S. soldiers murdered and raped 500 men, women, and children, even in spite of the fact that they believe that humans are all benevolent actors that are capable of complex decision-making whenever they feel threatened. We think accountability relies entirely on fellow soldiers reporting on their friends. Human loyalty prevents accountability. That wasn't our first argument. They failed to engage. But now let's compare that to lethal autonomous weapons and prove why we went on this point. We think lethal autonomous weapons create a concrete trail. If you believe their argument is true of accountability, that's a reason to oppose. But now let's engage their second argument on distance."

              "text": "We don't think PTSD has been a good deterrent. Rather, their argument is at its core that people need to suffer in order to know just how terrible war is. We're going to think, first off, we think that's very illegitimate in the case that we think war still happens. And secondly, on this example of the Vietnam War, it did not stop because of protest. We think that rather it continued in spite of the will of the people. But now, engaging with their third argument on this idea of decreasing the threshold for war. First off, we think that the threshold for war is already pretty low. They give us no distinct reasons why lethal autonomous weapons will distinctly actually lead to this impact. But secondly, we think that in some cases, yes, it does happen, but those cases are actually beneficial to the extent that we actually see a conflict, that we actually see intervention be more likely. It actually looks like what we tell you about in our second argument with things like humanitarian intervention. Why is this the case? Because nations that did not have an incentive before to intervene to conflicts that didn't actually threaten their own national security, now are able to do so without putting the lives of their own civilians at risk, for example, in the Rwanda genocide. But we think that on this final argument they give us about developing nations, it has internal tension with their armed race argument. We think that yes, wealthy countries probably will always have an advantage but if their arm-wrestling argument is true we think that having greater production of lethal autonomous weapons then means that countries that are developing are able to access them even more. But finally on these two other arguments they give us about tech about about the actual machines being unreliable we think they can be tested in the first place programming resolves the problems. And on this issue of lethal autonomous weapons being costly, we think comparatively it's less costly to have an entire military training and deployment. If anything, LAWs protect the economy trade-off that governments otherwise have to make with the military while still being able to actually help to preserve the lives of their own soldiers and civilians."

Before I go on, I'll take a point of information if you have one. Yes, so... Go on. Go on. So in such a case when there is a self-learning device, how could you hold a programmer accountable and responsible for such an act? Because we think that you can track specific pieces of programming that individuals do. That's why I gave the example of the Google Doc. We think it works in a much similar fashion. But now let's get into our third substantive argument about how it's immoral for governments to deploy humans. We think first off that these autonomous weapons limit the situations where governments have to put their citizens at risk of substantial harm in the first place. Obviously, war has massive costs. Sending soldiers into a field with potential landmines is unjust whenever we could be sending an autonomous armed robotic vehicle. Additionally, soldiers that do survive often face massive trauma, such as PTSD, shell shock, or actual anxiety and depression that can last them a lifetime from either having to see their own fellow soldiers die or nearly be threatened to kill themselves. We think that that has not one deterred war, but secondly, these costs are augmented by the fact that the most vulnerable people are often likeliest to become soldiers. People who face extreme adversity in their lives and often have less to lose by going into the military or have no other option for financial reasons or because a court has given them the option of military or jail often choose to join the military. We think militaries around the world deliberately attract high school age teens. For example in Britain they had a deliberate campaign to attract teens from low income communities. The wealthy often can avoid military service entirely, such as whenever the Peruvian government reinstated the draft in 2013 that allowed for a $715 fine to skip military service. Given that a person's life is their most central right as a person, because it's a precondition to all other rights, it should only be sacrificed whenever it's absolutely necessary. We think lethal autonomous weapons eliminate the need"

But the second is subtle coercion, including recruiting heavily from vulnerable communities, but it also means engaging in misleading nationalism and actual misinformation campaigns. We think this unduly coerces individuals into fighting, depriving them of the ability to make rational and informed decisions.

So first of all what they said just in the first speech, in the developing speech, is that they are going to monitor this monitor technology, they are monitoring these weapons and these little autonomous weapons so humans can shut it down. I would like to really shortly say as the motion said, that's all you can read in this room, that a clarification with the motion was these weapons operate without human intervention. This means humans are out of the loop and not on the loop as the side opposition has presented it. So this means that no humans cannot even shut these weapons down. We let these weapons down on the street and they can decide what to kill and they can decide what they want without any human interaction or shutting down. And second of all with testing these devices because it was something that they continuously brought up and we just want to make a comment on that. No thank you you. No, thank you. I'm going to take it later on. With neural networks and how these systems actually work and how it makes testing actually impossible because any interaction with this environment means unanticipated interaction with this environment and new data implemented in these self-learning machines. What it means basically in practicality is when we put right data, they can identify right targets. For example example the other enemy's military devices or the soldier's clothes they can identify them because of the good data however when we test these devices they can implement wrong data such as a civilian's clothes and no thank you and the next time what they're going to do is because we do not have control because this is how this stuff learning of external intelligence works they're gonna identify these civilians by these testing methods and they're gonna shut those one down and this is something we cannot prevent and even the highest professionals within this industry say that this is going to be one of the biggest problem with this AI so second"

Let's take two scenarios in this point. A, what they are saying, there are two possibilities. We let robots out on the street and also few soldiers and humans. Let's say it is a short-term solution. So what it causes is that there are these weapons that we are not sure we can control and also these human soldiers, so the brutality will not be solved. The second scenario, Scenario B, is that there are no soldiers in the long run, only these robots. So what happens is both countries only use robots and not soldiers so we can prevent brutality more and more. That's why I'm going to explain with a short analysis now to you dear judges. So why, let's imagine in a word what they are saying that there are only robots and protecting. This works on the short term until one side has these robots, no thank you, and can protect their citizens to be friends. However, imagine when both sides have these robots and because we can actually make these robots very friends because they're not humans and not giving birth, we can reproduce these robots and they simply just be bombed. So what is the next value in our society that we must attend? Civilians. Because we cannot reproduce human rights that fast. So the barriers of war and the meaning of war are only robots, no thank you, is first of all yes we might bomb others robots. But does it lead war anywhere? No. It's the resources that lead war and what the sides are war. The societies, the members who pay taxes, who actually go and have the economy. And this is what is going to be at risk by their model. Now I would like to move on to the amount of debt that I said. First of all, it's short term that only one side has these weapons. It is okay. However, we in our case would not allow even the development, so it is impossible in our case to have even one side of these robots and this is why we solved the problem at the very beginning."

This is what this debate is about. No, thank you. This is what is in the definition. We cannot say that, oh, okay, the full responsibility is theirs, because they just created something that gets self-learning and no self-discipline, and we cannot simply prevent it. And this is why we do not want this, because the basic foundations of our society and our criminal and civil lobby will be harmed by their model so now i would like to also go to the uh un point want to know thank you the other fundamental part is that no necessary harm should be done in our society and this in our scenario also works for our side because we cannot predict yet these AI devices however even if we will let suppose this is a false assumption by their side though that these are super intelligent testing weapons even if this is the case how we first of all we cannot yeah all of these it's really hard to imagine but even if we did what I said to you there is this first scenario with barriers of war when only robots are fighting and now I'd like to go to another clash however it was unfortunate not a clash because they did not respond to this all however the"

When it comes to strategy, programmers and war generals have no incentive to deploy LAWs only to kill civilians, especially if international law is such an effective check. First of all, the first problem with this POI was that self-learning part that I've already elaborated on, that we do not know exactly how these weapons are going to work. And second of all, yes, programmers might not have this belief, however what happens in real life is really different what they are trying to say. So what happens is that first of all, I'm not saying that these weapons are gonna attack civilians because they are programmed to. I'm saying that in a world where robots target each other and kill each other, the only value in war is gonna be taking civilian lives because there are no human soldiers on the battlefield anymore. And it is not going to be the weapons that should kill them because they are programmed to do so. It is supposed to be a really positive future. But then the whole scenario of a war will change because the only matter will be resources and human lives. And this is what Ornstein's proposition would like to prevent. And even what they're saying is that we should not solve this problem because humans have fear, but they think that it is good. We are saying they're for their side, but they are saying that it is good for our side because it prevents actually people from killing more and more people. And what we have provided to you is that our scenario when someone is really distant from someone being killed. Imagine a video game."

It's hard to believe that an intensely programmed piece of autonomous technology that can siphon through information within a matter of seconds is supposedly a worse actor than, say, a 19-year-old kid drafted into war, holding a gun, watching their friends die beside them, having bullets grazed past them because they, quote-unquote, have compassion. They belong there. We don't think that that's a justifiable response to being able to pull millions of people a year into war scenes because supposedly they're going to act rationally. We think down the bench we've proven that that's not the case, and I'm happy to do even more analysis of that in my speech. But in this speech I'll be doing a few things. The first is I'll be going over one major clarification for today's debate so we can truly address the true comparative before moving on to discussing two key questions such as to summarize it. The first, on which side does what's best for the protection of people? The second, on which side does what's best for the advancements in war? But onto the first thing that we really need to clarify in today's debate. We think that Psy's proposition has given you a complete mischaracterization of what the usage of LAWs truly looks like. What have we heard from their side? LAWs are simply slaughter bots that raise havoc all over areas, they simply kill innocent mothers and children, they want to ultimately harm everybody, and the worst part, they can't be turned off. There's no way to be able to place a check on them, there's no way to hold them accountable. We don't think that this is necessarily what the reasonable ground is in today's debate, insofar that we've given you two very, very rational responses. The first is that when they efficiently, we think that LAWs are designed to efficiently commit lethal autonomous actions that would have been committed by human beings in the first place, so much so that they're programmed to act and under certain jurisdiction that has already been announced from certain countries. All the laws and regulations that they speak of is something that would be programmed within these lethal autonomous weapons, not something that you can simply program within a human being who is simply trying to save their own life. But secondly, we do think that there's certainly a clear reason as to why we can shut them off. I think it's completely irrational to think that people would create this killer bot that would go out there and find a third being, but simply wouldn't be able to be turned off."

That's completely fair on our side of the house."

              "text": "Now, on to the first question in today's debate, which is which side does what's best for the protection of people. Two major central ideas emerged under this point. The first idea is under soldiers. Now, under this point, we gave you a very, very crucial argument that Emily delivered to you very well in her second speech. We told you that when governments are faced with the choice between a piece of technology or hundreds of thousands of soldiers living within their country, they should always have the obligation to choose the viable alternative to ultimately do that. What we heard from side of proposition was no response. They completely dropped this in third substantive that was very, very crucial to today's debate, especially because soldiers are sometimes the most vulnerable people within society. One, because of drafts, we think that a lot of times deferrals for drafts only go to the privileged in society, keeping them protected. We're the most vulnerable within the nation or have to go out and fight these wars. Furthermore, we think there's a lot of coercion that's involved within these military campaigns. It looks like poor people going to war so they can escape poverty. That's what their war looks like. Ultimately, we think that the choice for LAWs guarantees two key things. The first is a massive reduction in the amount of casualties. Why is this the case? When LAWs are actively replacing human combatants, that means that there's less human combatants out on the battlefield to die. That's very simple and intuitive here. We think that we're ultimately saving massive amounts of lives. But secondly, we told you that you're actually able to prevent massive amounts of mental disorders from people that do escape these wars. They often suffer from things like PTSD and shell shock. It speaks volumes to these disorders that only after wars or atrocities were occurred, people discover what these true disorders really were. We think that ultimately, when side proposition tells you that you need these in order to stop war, that's not the case. War would have stopped years ago if people truly stopped wars when people got PTSD or when people got depression or anxiety attacks after leaving the war scene. Countries will always go to war. We think that that's something that's inevitable. We have to evaluate who's going to be beneficial. But the second central idea that emerged here was based on civilians. Ultimately, we gave you a lot of analysis on why there are discussion about human descent can be able to stop wars altogether. We told you Vietnam War did not end because people protested in the streets of America. No, it ended because America lost and wasn't supposed to be there in the first place. Secondly, we think that all the atrocities of rape and violence are unique to human beings being in the battlefield because of the three key reasons that we told you down the bench, but I'm going to get into that further in the next question. Lastly, we got this new argument in the third speech talking about how civilians will simply become the new target because there's less LA dogs, because there's less humans like soldiers in the first place. Three key responses. Firstly, we think that human soldiers don't completely disappear in our world. We think they just substantially decrease, meaning that there's still going to be engagement with human beings. Secondly, we think that the target is not going to become civilians ever because LAWs are programmed to act under international law, where international law distinctly says that civilians will never be the target. Furthermore, if we truly want to talk about saving civilian lives in wars, pull humans out. Humans constantly target civilians in wars. We've seen it in the Syrian war right now. We've seen it in the Vietnam war, which they would like to talk about. We've seen it in the Korean war. It's always been a target. We think that humans distinctly don't have a problem with doing it because they always see them as the enemy. But now, before I get into the second question, I'll take a point. There will be no humans actually involved anymore. Don't you think that it will be easier for states to start the war? We don't think that the necessary argument about people not being going to war is really a reason as to why there will be a decrease in the amount of war. Ultimately, people go to war regardless of whatever the thing is going to be that's holding them back. We don't think that human cost is the true reason that holds people back from going to war. That's why there's still massive amounts of war on a day-to-day basis."

The first is the amount of time that you spend in war. The second is the amount of time that you spend in war. The second is the amount of lives that you lose in war. And lastly, the destruction to the regions caused by the war, right? How does LAW uniquely solve these kinds of things? We think that they process information on military operations extremely quicker than humans ever could, making sure that things get done quicker, ultimately saving the amount of time that people have to spend in these regions. That's how we're actually truly able to prevent this in the long term. But furthermore, we are happy to engage with the true comparative in today's debate. We gave you three key reasons as to why humans are always going to be a significantly worse actor in times of war. Fear. They told you that simply, no, they'll dissent. No, in my country, 18 years old is too young to be able to go out and drive a rental car or to have a drink,"

This happens through massive amounts of propaganda, messaging, how they're trained. They're literally trained to look at the other side as not human beings. That's where you actually see irrational decision making. That's where you see a decrease in mercy. Why do you LAWs uniquely work better? We think that they have no emotions. Simply what they're programmed to do within the confines of what standards have already been given to them. They autonomously act with the constraints that have already been given to them. But secondly, we think that there's massive amounts of accountability. Every LAW has a paper trail. They're always going to be able to see every single action that LAW has made. That means that you're going to be able to hold them accountable in the long term. At the highest ground, we say LAWs are risky and they don't act humane.

              "text": "proud to oppose. Two questions in the speech. First, which side decreases atrocities? Second question, which side betters conflict? First on atrocities. Again, this was their argument about humaneness and distance. We've sufficiently proved that neither of these things really happens with humans. We tell you that LAWs that are created by an army of civilian programmers, in addition to civilian leaders and military leaders, are far more likely to be cool-headed when they're removed from the conflict and they're able to just program LAWs to operate strategically to perform missions to the best of their ability. They're not going to program LAWs to do things like rape or torture civilians at the point where that's really unstrategic. But even if the technology misses and fails on the battlefield despite extensive testing and does something bad, here's the difference. I can pull the plug on that LAW and take it off of the battlefield. When Soviet soldiers are massacring 350 civilians and disemboweling pregnant women, we can't pull the plug on them. We can with an LAW that is monitored by an officer. And we'd be happy to hold that officer accountable if they watch while an LAW commits all of these atrocities and stand by and do nothing. Furthermore, we can take that technology off the battlefield and reprogram it to make sure it never does that again. You can never do that with a human. On the point of decreasing atrocity alone in a world where conflict to some degree is inevitable, we take the debate. But second, let's talk about which side betters conflict in both worlds. Their main argument here was that we decrease barriers to war. We had a lot of responses to this that didn't receive practically any engagement. We told you governments already go to war for massively problematic geopolitical reasons like getting resources and things like that. But second, we told you in our third argument, it is the most vulnerable populations in these countries that are sent to war. Those who can't afford to pay the fee to escape the draft. Those with no other options. Those that governments explicitly target to pull them into war. Those with the least ability in society to stand up and say, hey, please don't send me to war. These are people that are disposable to the government. We think it is, first of all, wrong for the government to deploy them when they have another option. But second, it's unlikely that rich people in society are going to stand up for these individuals. But third and finally, third, we told you that protests of the Vietnam War weren't the sorts of things that ended it. And finally, the cases where we do go to war because we have to reduce the threshold are things like humanitarian interventions. But they also told you that we're going to increasingly target civilians because some futuristic machine-on-machine exclusively war is going to happen. We told you in Layla's speech that for the foreseeable future, this technology, note, in a lot of cases hasn't been developed yet. There are still going to be human soldiers on the battlefield. But second, we told you that if it is the case that these technologies are just being programmed to shoot down civilians, we obviously would not deploy them. We still believe in humanitarian standards. Third and finally, let's talk about civilian casualties in the Vietnam War, in World War I and II, and any other conflict. They are massive. Because soldiers, scared for their lives, don't care about civilians, we think it's far more likely on our side of the house that LAWs will, very proud to oppose."

Both of these options are horrific, and Team Estonia is very proud to regret the Belt and Road Initiative. But let's let the filter into this Belt and Belt and Road Initiative. Most of these nations are emerging economies, and even without the Belt and Road Initiative, are experiencing economic growth and moving towards a positive direction. Ethiopia has 10% and Pakistan has 7% of GDP growth. And the same is in most of the nations that host the initiative. Now the growth means that they are fighting without Chinese investments in the long run and will likely build the same scale infrastructure with their own capital without taking loans and giving away their infrastructure just after 50 years or so. But notice that there are also other alternatives like international government banks or private capital that has always incentive to help the cheap workforce. So now our whole case for today is why the initiatives of HARP are much worse than waiting for these nations to get on their feet by themselves or with the help of other actors."

Before we move on to my first argument, do you think Donald Trump would provide better trade opportunities for Pakistan? We believe that, of course, Pakistan has other trade opportunities rather than with China. We don't believe that China is the only one who is able to provide trade opportunities for the belt and road initiative.

States care mainly about two things, their sovereignty and their economic prosperity. Here are three reasons how the host nations' economies will be damaged. Firstly, China offers predatory loans to these nations, which means the high interest rates that drain these States' budget are in place. Now, China gave Sri Lanka a low interest rate of 6.3%, while the interest rate of the World Bank and the National Development Bank were only 3% for similar loans. So the unfair loans make states directly poorer in the long run. Second way how it harms the economy is that China takes hold of their infrastructure and hence damaging them. Sri"

Furthermore, China now dictates what products flow through its ports, roads and railways, so it prioritises China's stations and current interests instead of bringing these states benefits. China is currently bringing in her manufacturing groups, while the Sri Lankan economy actually needs raw materials so desperately. China also does this in other countries like Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and the states are earning more benefit from the infrastructure that they will build, hence leading them in debt just to serve the interests of another nation. Now, the very last reason of how their economy will be damaged is that the initiative influences local markets and manufacturers very negatively. The Belt and Road Initiative makes it key to Chinese growth and more accessible in these nations, which means that these nations' own products often can't compete and local sectors and companies are pushed out of the market. Madagascar's tech side industry suffered after China's company started exporting their own product into Madagascar through the Belt and Road Initiative. So their impact is that if you come close to China, the local people are left poor and jobless, even more than they were before the initiative."

States are dependent on China and foreign governments and this limits their own decision making.

There are more of them due to the increased business of China now with the Belt and Road Initiative. In Kazakhstan, the only kindergarten in the area was shut down due to Chinese government lobby in order for Chinese workers working on a Belt and Road Initiative project for building them a hospital so the kindergarten was closed. And it was also the Chinese size of other issues in foreign policy. China can now influence other nations to support its actions in the territorial disputes because they are economically dependent on China. China offered development aid to Brunei and Laos so it could support its controversial actions, militarily seizing other nations' territories and assault China's sea in order for them to get development aid. So this means that small states are afraid of lagging behind China and hence they obey. So this allows more parts of China to exercise an aggressive foreign policy that before you had an incentive to do that right now."

              "text": "But now, let me move on to my second argument that describes the global impacts of China expanding their power. Military expansion is an inherent part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The reason why China is willing to execute a project that's so expensive and yet likely to fail is because it enables them to expand their power militarily. China needs to protect its economic rights and guarantee the stability on the way. So China has already said that in order to afford the Djibouti that they build to work, they need to keep their military present in order to protect it. They have already put this in Djibouti, they have brought into Pakistan 150,000 special security division to protect the road. They have plans to build military bases in Afghanistan, in Poland, and they are likely to build more bases all over the world once the initiative advances. Two very destructive impact from that when China builds these bases. Firstly, it raises tensions, and secondly, it increases the risk of a direct military conflict. Firstly, it raises tensions because political tensions and worries of other nations are very unlikely to support China's military expansion. My sons, America has over 800 military bases stationed all outside its own territory, including in Guam and South Korea. So why should America be allowed to do that and not China? Sure, I got your point. We believe that yes, the USA has already very many military bases. However, the less military bases you have in the world, especially from conflicting powers, the more secure to have. And this is exactly what I'm talking about right now. So firstly, political tensions are likely to increase because other nations are not very happy with China's real estate basis. Vietnam and China already have tensions due to China expanding their influence in the South China Sea. So that means less cooperation between the states, economically and politically, possibly meaning sanctions and inability to solve regional problems together. But furthermore, it increases the risk of a direct military conflict, something that the POI is answering to. In South China Sea, China often sends its warships to counter foreign forces. USA is protecting their bases in Guam, and China is likely to do that with other bases also. The more military bases next to each other with armed soldiers, the likely is a skirmish or a military accidental conflict between them. So, panel, the Belt and Road Initiative is only beneficial for China and very destructive for our little nations and also the whole world if it doesn't bring security. For all these reasons, I beg you to report. Take a deep breath. I would like to thank the first speaker of the commission for their speech, and we'd like to invite the first speaker of the commission"

We say it's time for a 21st century Marshall Plan led by the 21st century's preeminent power, China. Developing countries in South and Central Asia have for decades been left behind by a Western economic order that has only prioritised developmental aid for those countries which they have a strategic interest in.

              "text": "Because what they wanted to tell us was the alternative for these countries was some sort of natural growth, and these countries were doing fine anyway because Pakistan's GDP is on the rise. The fact of the matter is Pakistan is only experiencing GDP growth because China has been investing in it in the Belt and Road Initiative. And the fact that it has a GDP of less than 1500 US dollars per capita shows that there is an inability for them to do that on their own. The alternative for these people is subsistence farming and abject poverty. We don't think that's something you can stand from today's debate. It was quite telling when they said there were other trade opportunities which they could have. This is simply false. No country wants to trade with, like, Tajikistan except for China because it has a road to Europe. There is no incentive for the West to develop that area. Their first argument about regionalized impacts. Firstly, they wanted to tell us about predatory loans. We think that the conditions set by these loans are particularly fair, especially when reflecting the risk China has put in, into investing into these countries that might not be all-pronged. Their argument about debt-to-equity swaps. We tell you firstly that this is a small minority of cases. The studies have shown this is only at risk in 8 out of the 63 mountain road countries. But secondly, that these countries still get the benefits from these things. So say there was a hydropower dam that China did a debt for equity swap. Citizens in that country still get the power from that dam, even though China owns it. The third sub-point in this point about China dictating which products go to the ports, like in Madagascar, we say that this is not usually the case, such as in the Guadalajara and Pakistan, where Pakistan is able to put its own first through. But even in software, it is that Madagascar gets raw materials from China, and that's good for them as well. Their second argument is about global impacts. They told you that these countries wouldn't have much, would be aligned with China and all their foreign policy, and that's fair. We think the reality is these countries don't have much territorial power anyway, and perhaps it's probably good for them to have an ally that is powerful in the first place. But then when they told us that that raised tensions because of military bases, we think it was quite telling that in response to our point of information they supported the US global hegemony over international military alliances. We say that on the counterfactual, China will still always pursue strategic interests. It is not that by removing the Belt and Road Initiative you get rid of all the incentives for China to devalue militarily. So they don't solve that anymore. And we will prove why we do the way we actually de-escalate tensions in the South China Sea later in my hour."

Recognise that these nations often find it very difficult to attract investment from the West, because the West's investment is tied purely to its geopolitical goals. That's why we saw the United States investing in South America, because they helped reduce the global war on drugs, and that directly helped America. But states like Kazakhstan are of no relevance to America whatsoever. They're on the complete other side of the globe. But even in the rare situations if they did invest in these countries, we think that governments and organisations like the International Monetary Fund often attach policy changes as conditions for these loans, and these are terrible. You see rapid liberalisation and privatisation of markets. This allows for the West to sweep up the resources in these countries at a fraction of their true value. You also see policies made with that to cut government spending, which has literally destroyed healthcare systems in Africa. We don't think that's something the opposition has found. But the West is also turning increasingly in. We see Trump pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, and the rise of nationalism in Europe, meaning these people are unable to provide an alternative for these countries to attract and place power."

For example, as I talked about in Kazakhstan, because it's their geographical route to put a trade route to Europe. But secondly, because the West has different allies, then it won't invest in transformational infrastructure in Pakistan, because Pakistan has a conflict with India, and the West will never invest in the enemy of their ally. At the end of this point, what do we get for the people actually living on the ground in these countries? We get employment for these people. So when we saw the Carrot Hydro Power Project in Pakistan, the Chinese company building the power, building the dam, hired thousands of local workers from rural areas and created spin-off jobs in local industries and maintenance jobs on that deck. This meant that the Pakistani farmers that previously wouldn't have any opportunity to better themselves now do. I'll take a few more now. These people have no use of these created jobs when their own economy, their own sectors and manufacture are pushed out of the market due to these cheap Chinese food. You better answer to this question. Okay, firstly that's not a reality in today's space. It's not like their economy is suddenly shut down. But secondly, that they can get employment in Chinese industries as well. We also provide industries, so that Pakistan's poor areas now no longer get 20 hour blackouts, and now people actually have an ability to get to power and live their economies of mind."

China is increasing its military power and not trying to give the world itself. We don't think that this is equivalent to the Martian camp. The typical war jobs will be created in those countries. Two responses to this. Firstly, the extent that many of the construction workers that China is currently using are actually Chinese. China has an over-the-top service of people that they are trying to get working to other countries, so that people are in the city idly. Moreover, other investors could also go into those countries because they have profit incentives because of the cheap workforce in those nations. They would be using the people in those places and they would actually create more jobs, something that China doesn't actually do because they can use their own cheap workforce, something that's more beneficial for them.

Firstly, I think that this argument simply doesn't stand because of the fact that economic benefits from China under the Belt and Road Initiative inherently come with some kind of military impact. China goes to those places and builds bases in those countries when they are trying to make some big economic capital in those places. There was a recent announcement from a company, by building bases in Turkey, by getting 150,000 troops into Pakistan, they go in with military not to make an economy, so I think that this argument is more satisfactory with its assumption. Furthermore, now it has an incentive to protect all of the things that it has with military. It has an incentive to try to protect them at all costs and try to use this military, something that it didn't have before. But finally, this is not an inherently true theory. China already has a very good response to economic relations with Vietnam, for example, but it's still bombing their ships in the South China Sea. The economic dependence has always been that military conflict is going to exist, and they need to prove to the whole world that the status quo, that logic, have flaws."

              "text": "Moving on to the next. Firstly, let's think about the regional impact on economic development. We get a few answers from side oppositions. If I was to tell you that they don't always go to China and that the infrastructure projects don't go to China, those are the main instances they do. Also the fact that these loans are predatory. Even if it doesn't happen in the first years of the infrastructure project, then in the end, if you don't have enough money to pay for China, you're forced to do your part, for example, because you can't pay back the loans. So it's a predatory result, first people told you, and they don't give you're forced to give your poor twin, for example, because you can't pay back the loans. So it's a predatory result for us people to go to, and they don't give you a response to do that. Secondly, the Taylor Society is in spate from the fact that we're saying hydroelectric in the country. They've established that they're not going to take the side, they might do that, but eventually they simply don't have the funds to maintain those things. The laws that China's given them are enough of the law to keep that stuff working, but in the end, those loans simply run out, those countries can't afford it anymore, because they're so far in debt. In those instances, those people don't get those benefits anymore, and they want to deal with the long-term impact. Finally, they say Japan also gets raw materials from China. They are already responding to our argument. We take it home, it's not beneficial for China to give raw materials, and they only want to give products. This means that China needs what these countries need, but only what they need, because these countries don't actually get any benefits. In the long term, all of these things will be worse for these countries, because this infrastructure won't be beneficial for them, and for future sustainability, you always need China, which is not going to be that in the long run. Australia is going to take these things away because these countries can't afford the loans that the Chinese need out of them. These countries are simply wasting money they could have used for local development as we are telling you that they have this money to some extent already. They are wasting money to make money from these creditors loans the Chinese are doing to them and the Chinese are enslaving them in some kind of debt trap. Second point to reveal, how these countries have less sovereignty. They don't actually provide you an argument of any rebate or concern in this argument. They don't tell you how these countries can maintain illegal sovereignty. How they can still make their decisions for themselves. But so, China is using their lobby power to influence the decisions these countries are making, to force them to give their infrastructure to China, and to make foreign policy decisions that really benefit China. Because they are forcing countries to make harmful economic decisions for themselves. And in the end, it will be worse for these countries that they are so hard trained to protect. Before we move on to my point, I want to review the government. There's still a choice for these countries to accept these loans, given that they still have internal domestic pressures, not to accept the types of crippling debt loans that simply sell their sovereignty away. Why is that not enough to provide a counterfactual for the vast majority of countries in this space? It's easy for them. They can take these loans and make something better for themselves, but they are taking into consideration the fact that these loans are predatory and won't be able to pay these liabilities back. They don't have to provide for any human rights service, for example. They can take this money and run with it. Final point about global military expansion. It's fair to say that China still have those incentives, then we might agree. We think that the Belt and Road Initiative has provided an excellent opportunity for China to make all of those military incentives become true. Furthermore, it answers the point about tensions, how the U.S. has more tensions under their sovereignty caps. They take heart with how the United States currently has hegemony in the military sphere, and we can agree to that. But within its class, we have two competing powers with very competing incentives and agendas"

All of these countries will harbour the fact when the whole world is in shambles because of the fact that we have two major superpowers competing with each other. Now, I'd like to be ruling on tomorrow. This has been proved to be how the Belgian-Jewish initiative is likely to fail. It's a huge risk and the negative impact that that's brought from the Belt and Road Initiative actually fail. Lastly, a few reasons why it might fail. There is no cooperation from Western nations. Nobody from Europe turned up to the Belt and Road meeting and there is a strong US opposition to the whole plan. There is also a lack of cooperation from many non-Western nations. Bangladesh, for example, chose a Japanese to be over a Chinese one when it really did point to their capital, something that's really important for the Belt and Road Initiative to succeed. These countries are often corrupt. Afghanistan is fortified in the Corruption Index because of the war between 2014 and 2010 Finally, there is massive backlash from the people. In China, small processing plants were set on fire in the south of Kurdistan because of the fact that these people know what's happening to their countries and how it's harming their economies and their sovereignty. This is harmful for the Belt and Road Initiative, which means that it's more likely to fail. In the instance where China can't build the infrastructure necessary for the Belt and Road Initiative, this means that they can't actually make one of these economic trade routes happen. They also can't have cooperation with the West, thus the main objective of China accessing the Western market won't be achieved with the Belt and Road Initiative. This proves that the Belt and Road Initiative won't be as successful as they want it to be, thus won't actually benefit China and the host nations. Why? Firstly, China is going to go into massive voucher recession, and we have given out many non-reforming loans, and thus billions of dollars in plus-advis. The companies that have previously settled their price, thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative, are stuck with the surplus of products that China currently has. They will be economically stagnated because of the fact that the products are inflowing out of the country, but staying inside, and China won't be able to keep up with the economic recession that we're in. But moreover, the partner nations will have huge loans with no benefit. For example, huge volumes of Chinese food will be put to retirement in origin. They will rely heavily on Chinese loans to make their country work. But these loans are given out to the world because China can't afford it. The Belt and Road Initiative is relatively unsuccessful, and in that instance, none of these countries that they are trying to protect will benefit. Asian text on the Belt and Road is predatory, the others in this country are in any tune of policy. Thank you. Team Estonia made the line"

I'm going to bring a single argument about why the BRI facilitates increased competition which assists developing countries. But firstly, I have two points of clash to address. Firstly, the impact on BRI countries, and secondly, the impact on global community intentions. So firstly, let's look at the impact on BRI countries. Because we both agree in this debate that China isn't simply doing this for altruistic reasons. So then let's talk about whether or not it actually benefited the countries in this debate. Because what we talked about first was that the difference in this debate is that countries like Pakistan and like Myanmar literally have telecommunication lines. The people who were previously living in blackouts for 20 hours a day now have electricity which can power their farmland. Now they have electricity which can merge their industries and actually mean that they can have forms of employment outside of simply rural agriculture or all the types of things that have constrained the land issue behind all of these other countries. So what did we hear from Team Estonia in this debate? They told us that there were predatory loans. I mean, they couldn't really decide whether they wanted these countries to build infrastructure themselves or whether they wanted to have them get loans from the IMF. Firstly, in terms of whether they wanted to get loans from other types of actors in this debate, we want to say that this is a regressed debate, which means that Temastonia actually needs to engage in realistic counterfactuals. And the counterfactual in this debate is that the IMF has not invested in these countries. That the IMF invests insofar"

              "text": "as that it is important and it is strategic for the West's geopolitical incentives. We told you that there was no incentive for the IMF to ever invest, and even if they did, it is often accompanied by the things such as economic liberalisation, through which the West can crowbar their way in and enter into the economies of their countries. So we don't think the IMF is this perfect actor in this way, that they can stand behind under their side walls. Third of all, we told you that these loans in actuality were very fair, that many of these countries do enter into the types of loans where they know what they're getting into, and the majority of the countries, in fact, over 55 of the 63 countries, have actually not entered into these seats to have any risk of not being able to pay those loans back. So what do they want to tell us? They want to tell us that they want these countries to build their infrastructure on their own. Let's be clear, when Pakistan has a GDP of less than 1500 per capita, that is a sign that they can't build their own infrastructure. The types of massive economic growth that Pakistan has seen, it comes to the direct result of the type of investment that the Belt and Road Initiative have brought. The types of high speed, like transport and high-end ports that have allowed them to get their goods right throughout Asia and across the world. The types of ports like Guadal, that have allowed them to actually access European markets. Because unlike what you might believe if you were listening to Tim Stoney, it is not an exclusive right for China to use these ports. They can be used by the entire economy. So secondly, they told us they enter into debt-to debt to equity shares, and this is bad for those countries. Firstly, we tell you in many cases China doesn't do this, they actually enter into debt relief, thanks to such a strict shmoe to these countries. Secondly, there is large internal domestic pressure not to accept that rule. There are local politicians who are actually seen as being selling their sovereignty away if they do indeed grant China access to these goods. The fact that they have to lean so heavily on one single example where one Sri Lankan politician was able to be coerced by China into giving that quarter where they couldn't make their loans isn't indicative of the wider picture of today's today. Why do countries do a conceded to maintain their own sovereignty? Finally, even in the worst case scenario, if we take them at their best and tell you that they do exchange things for equity, these countries still gain benefits, right?"

It's not like China that controls the hedging of that dam and prevents the benefits of that from ever flowing down to the people that we want to tell them this is bad. Finally, they told us that local workers are published out. They're often in terms of these conditions and negotiate so that local workers do actually build the infrastructure in the first place such as the dam in Huggastown. Secondly, they tell you that there are additional jobs brought to that country which fire away the actual number of people building that dam or building that infrastructure in the first place. So if you think about it, when you build a dam, especially the builders that may be going from China, it is the local concrete industry, it is the local people who have been employed to maintain that dam, it is the people who can build industry off the back of that. Finally, I wanted to say that local manufacturers are pushed out. Look, we're happy to say that there can be anti-dumpin' laws in that scenario, but furthermore we tell you that often in these countries they're able to have a comparative advantage in what they do produce, and that can contain and maintain into the future. What did we hear from the second speaker? He wanted to essentially say that there was backlash, and we were going to make it way, way worse for China and Spain. They were going to enter into voucher recession. Look, we're actually very happy for China themselves to be able to weigh up the risk. We tell you, we benefit people, especially in West China, who are able to now get that close to the structural business. Secondly, let's have a look at the impact on global community intentions. Because let's go on what was brought to us and our first speaker about the tensions in the South China Sea. Because the reason that there are tensions in the South China Sea is because it represents the only trade route that China can get all of its goods to European and Asian markets. What does this mean? It means that above all else, it needs to have military tech and pressure to try and exert its control and influence in that region. We told you that the types of things that can prevent that are in China as alternatives, where they can ship goods through other ways. They wanted to say that they wanted to build bases and they thought that China wanted to build bases and that was really damaging. We told you at the point when they were supporting the US global hegemony in this debate, A we see that it was perfectly legitimate for China to pursue its own strategic interests, and that it would continue to do so under either side of the house in this debate."

China is building a highway in Montenegro, the cost of which is 80% of that country's GDP. Montenegro have to pay a majority of the cost of that highway themselves. How is Montenegro going to essentially duplicate that GDP, and why would that money have been used better? Firstly, I disagree with your claim that it is 80% of GDP, and simply we tell you that even insofar as it is a large percentage of GDP, quite clearly A, Montenegro knew what they were getting into, and B, the types of investment and infrastructure that they can have in terms of actually being able to access outside markets is far better than the alternative in this regard, which is no investment. So now let's move on to my point, because understand that Western aid, or the US aid, constantly seeks to advance its own geopolitical objectives. However, this is often accompanied by onerous conditions such as policy reform or opening up the country to Western investors. Right now, Western powers have essentially no one else to compete with them in giving loans to these countries. This"

This is because the West does not want to exert the type of diplomatic influence that it can if it does have exclusive rights. So as a result, countries that previously didn't get aid from the West will now have access to aid. This looks like the USA actually paying attention to what happens in places like the over-starting Central Asia. But secondly, the West must also give better conditions on those ones. That means instead of having these types of incentives where they have to liberalise their markets, the West now has to give better conditions, like not high interest rates, not trying to change the policies of those countries to compete with China. For example, when Bush came to shove recently over an internet cable linking Australia to the Solomon Islands, the Australian government, instead of allowing the Chinese company Huawei to invest in that,"

We were told that we were given this characterization that Asian countries have been left behind, and that Pakistan is only growing into China. Well actually, foreign direct investment in many countries is greater than the Netherlands, then China. This is true in many of China's neighbours, China is usually the fourth, or like the seventh largest vendor in these countries. Which means it is obviously, isn't true, their characterisation. Before the Belt and Road Initiative, China was also like still trading, and a number of countries were still trading, but all these countries still had some sort of autonomy over what this trade should look like, and China couldn't tell them, like what sort of trade they should be doing, and they didn't have control over a large and very important infrastructure in these countries. There obviously is spending, and in the cases where there isn't some sort of spending or some sort of loan giving, it is obviously because the risk is too large for more legitimate investors to actually take. No one decides not to trade with China because of certain neo-colonial spites. Private investors don't want to take that huge risk. What are these loans? However, China is willing to take that loss, as they will just take over these infrastructure projects. It is a loss for China. No, thank you. This is also the reason why predatory loans are so beneficial for China, because at best these countries will just have to pay off these loans and have incredible debt, and if they don't, then China fair. Now, when they talk about the fact that it's true when Madagascar gets more trade, then we think that this is a very good analysis, like, obviously, we talk about the fact that the textile industry is disrupted in these countries, which is much worse. For example, Madagascar's textile industry was completely disrupted and almost lost because of China's incoming imports, which Madagascar now couldn't say no to, which means that obviously Madagascar's own economy, or at least the people in Madagascar who are also involved in this debate, were suffering and they were the ones being harmed. And people who only like to like larger companies in China were getting their benefits. And we don't think that it's very justifying. Yes? Do you think it will actually help grow Madagascar's industry to the point where they have a port that allows raw materials from China to go into their country? Well, yeah, but the problem is that Madagascar can't dictate what sort of materials it needs. We talked about this in our first speech, about the fact that Sri Lanka wants to rely on these raw materials, but it's getting manufactured goods which isn't actually beneficial for Sri Lanka, and if the other dictates can have more autonomy, then they can get more benefits, which is obviously better under our side. We'll also give you a lot of analysis in our second speech about why the Belt and Road Initiative is likely to fail, about how there's no cooperation from Western nations, and there's also lack of cooperation from non-Western nations, or that partner nations fail to pay back loans, corruption and also local backlash because sovereignty is being infringed upon in all of these cases. We also don't really get a response to the fact that why it is justified also for China to infringe upon these countries' sovereignty so much? This is a huge problem that they haven't really answered to, that these countries now can't dictate what their overall foreign policy is, and we increase the amount that Chinese lobbyists can actually use, and this is an incredible harm also in itself."

We don't really agree with this, and we don't think that the overall people can get as many jobs as they're talking about. But then they talk about the fact that, now let's talk about military and show you why actually China is more likely to become militaristic. They bring out two reasons why it isn't. Firstly, that now China is more economically tied to all sorts of different countries. This doesn't work in the South China Sea. China is still tied to all of those countries, but it's still willing to be militaristic and show that own military power, because this way it's more economically beneficial for them. They don't need to go to war for them, they only need to like bully these countries with their overall much larger navy, just so that they can have more beneficial overall training and get more power over the South China Sea. We also think that our own argument talks about why economic ties always lead to increased militarism, in the case of China. We've brought you three examples of that, how there is a military base, how Pakistan has 150,000 troops and that there are farm bases across China's farm and Poland. When they say that China still has the incentive for all of these things, then this isn't true. How will China justify a military base if it doesn't even have any sort of trading routes there, or if it doesn't even have any sort of trading business there? We don't think that they can justify it. We don't think there's an incentive for China to increase their nitrogen around the world. We think we've talked about this quite a lot. But the second point that they talk about nitrogen is that now the South China Sea is less important. I mean, this just isn't true. The South China Sea will always be a huge trade route with unexplored oil and gas also. We think that this is true, that China now won't care about and we think that they'll have to deal with those statuses same. No thank you. But now on their extension that countries that previously didn't get aid now will, we don't understand what countries they're talking about. This is a hip-hop characterisation. No thank you. But we think that now these countries are less likely to accept aid, which often comes with human rights conditions with them, because now they can get very easy loans from China, which means that it's more likely that they don't have to accept the aid. But we think that if these loans do fall down, no thank you, then our own harms of these countries are getting worse. They are going to be heightened. But let's look at the comparative of what is actually happening."

If you don't have some of the Chinese investors telling you, or lobbyists telling you that you have to lower your taxes, for example, or you have to make your kindergarten into a hostel because then humans If you don't have some of the Chinese investors telling you, or lobbyists telling you that you have to lower your taxes, for example, or you have to make your kindergarten into a hostel, because then it's just a transaction to human benefits. Or we talk about the economy, they would say that money at the moment, with these loans, it would be wasted on paying back Chinese debts, which could have been used for sustainable development, for example. Or they also would have lessened the ability of these countries to, in the future, invest in much more better infrastructure projects that might not be so risky, or that this disrupts the overall local economy from production with the large impacts of Chinese trade, which means that in the long run, it will be much harder for these countries to actually bounce back and actually get to sort of a more clean path, for the fact that these Chinese lobby power forces states to undertake unfavourable economic policies, which will also in the long run make it harder for these countries to actually have good economic policies and actually benefit from the overall growth of the country.

Because the only line that we heard from Estonia was the assumption that politicians took deals blindly, that they just shut their eyes until whatever deal came their way, because they weren't accountable to everyone. We say that given the fact that Estonia conceded that these nations are burgeoning democracies and burgeoning economies, we say that there's an intense amount of internal domestic pressure not to accept those terrible deals. Insofar as they want to talk about predatory loans and accepting horrible deals that mean it's all Chinese workers, we say that there's huge incentives to not accept those loans. So how does that work? Well, what we say is that in these countries like Pakistan, the money of many of the politicians actually run on an anti-corruption, anti-steal and sovereign platform. That's what we have with the Prime Minister of Pakistan in Ramkhan running on that platform. That's what we have with Malaysian President Mohammed running against their sovereignty being stolen. What that means is that those politicians are disinclined from taking horrible deals, especially given the fact that those countries are still recovering from having their resources ripped away by British colonialism. It means that that public is particularly pro-sovereignty and particularly going to push away from the deals that they feel threaten them. What does that mean? It means that they're unlikely to accept those deals. Furthermore, we see that China cares a great deal about its international image, which means it's unlikely to offer those horrible deals in the first place. What we say is that it's not enough for them to talk about a single country where China forced a hospital to close, though that's an extreme minority of cases. Instead, we see that China has huge incentives to look good on the global platform, given the power backing created by the declining West and the EU. What that means is that given the fact that we have far-right politicians like Jaroslaw Kaczynski in Poland and Viktor Orban in Hungary, what that means is that there's a huge position for China to be a good actor on the world stage. What that means is that they have incentive to make those deals less terrible. Further, we see that there's a huge media market in these countries when there's a huge amount of infrastructure being put on, which means that those countries' deals are under a huge amount of media scrutiny that's shown to the entire world. What that means is that insofar as they accept foreign deals, those politicians look bad and China looks bad. That of all that it's actually very expensive for China to import all of their workers to all of these other countries in terms of maintaining maintenance for the next 20 years. We say it's unrealistic for China to put their own workers to work with that. It's a lot easier actually going to put pressure on their local politicians to only accept the deals and actually employ them. That's why countries like Malaysia, they were able to turn down military bases that didn't employ Malaysian workers, but were able to accept the deals and provide the jobs to those people. At the end of this point, we see that countries do not accept terrible deals, and even if they did, were able to get these sorts of industries that are actually valuable to lifting people out of poverty. So what then is the impact on developing economies?"

              "text": "Here I want to say the huge tension that existed in starting this case all down the line, because they told you that they were happy to have private investors. They were happy to have the IMF, the Western pro-bar, and buy up the institutions that were so valuable to those countries. But then they also wanted to say in the same breath that the most important thing was the sovereignty of those countries. We think that they cannot support private investors buying up valuable institutions. We'll also say that the most important thing was sovereignty. We think that is something that they cannot accept in this debate. What we told you is that this gives these economies an opportunity for development. Interferes, they wanted to say that they can simply build themselves up. They need to engage with the reality of the space. Because the fact is that if they did want to build up those industries, the fact that these countries were formed 20 years ago means that they have extremely limited capital to afford to develop those industries. What that means is that maybe they do build a port. Maybe they do build a single rail line. What that means is that it comes at the expense of a huge amount of social services that everyone will be providing at the same time. So what we say is that it's very difficult for those countries to develop their own infrastructure, so it's much preferable to rely on China. We've done enough down our line to show you why the International Monetary Fund is obviously not a viable option for China or for these countries to take. What did they then tell you? That China is going to control everything in certain ground industries. Let's be very clear on this. China may have a steel surplus, right? But the issue is that Pakistan is always going to have a comparative advantage in some fields over China. It's not the case that China can simply import every single thing that they want out of those countries insofar as China obviously relies on a few industries that countries like Pakistan and Myanmar do not have. What we say is, well, this actually opens up countries to importing their goods and exporting them. What we say is that in Pakistan, the railways actually gain access to Asian markets as they would before. It's not enough for them to simply say that they can just trade, because the issue is that you cannot trade in Asia if you have no infrastructure to do so. If you have no trade to literally bring your goods to the rest of Asia. We are the team that actually provides those rail lines and opens up their economy. Further, we say that ports give access to European markets. Is that it isn't the case that Europe is simply going to buy things from China as if they did. They'll be doing that in the status quo. But comparatively, is that we actually give access to European markets because Europe wants to buy goods from Pakistan, from Myanmar. What that means is that Myanmar can rely on their own industries and get a huge amount of development there, yes. China's not building any industries or jobs in these nations. Rather, when they produce the goods still in China and sell them to these nations, pushing local manufacturing and industries out of these nations. Okay, that factory-operable, modern manufacture and industries onto these nations. Okay, now, it wasn't a question, that was just a statement. But further, we say that the Guadalquart actually employed 3,000 Pakistanis to do the work, because China saw that it was cheaper to simply employ close, local individuals. We say that they do have trade, that they are able to work on those fields. And so far, it's as if they want to talk about the Madagascar court. The problem is that China dictating the sole purpose of those courts isn't actually how trade works, right? Countries choose what they buy, which means that those countries, like if you choose to buy from the European markets, you say that they do get growth. No thank you. But let me say that we actually heard no sufficient response to Nick's split, which is that the"

They told you that China will still become reliant on that. What we say is that that's literally incorrect. We can point out that the Eurasian land bridge and the Arctic route are the biggest infrastructure things that China has ever played in the last 50 years. What it means is that it's obviously clear that China doesn't necessarily have to rely on the South to act as they did before. And so far, as they do have increased militarization, we see that a lot of these countries are actually nuclearized, right? Which means that it's not likely that China is suddenly going to go to war with India. And so far as they both have nuclear weapons, and they see it as a lose-lose game, what that means is that it is okay for China to have military bases. We say that it's not enough for them to simply say that less military bases is a good thing. It's not realistic to simply demilitarize the world. What instead is realistic to do is provide infrastructure to the communities that need it most and actually help these developing countries crawl their way out of the ground."

Because the question was, how else would these countries actually develop this infrastructure? And if they couldn't do enough to actually prove that they could develop that infrastructure, they lost the debate at that point. First we told you on whether they could develop it in themselves, we told you that they simply cannot afford it at the point where their GDP could no longer, is so low that they simply cannot afford it at the point where their GDP per capita is so low that they literally cannot even service their own citizens, let alone build an entire telecommunications system that comes to the entirety of the country. That was not realistic. At the point where their case was reduced to saying, well, maybe in 50 years, if their economy does develop, then they'll be able to do that. We told you that their economy develops when they have the infrastructure that facilitates the development. And that was what you got under our side of the house. So then they wanted to support the IMF and things like other international institutions. They wanted to support the West. The West, with through leaders like Orban and Trump, has constantly been turning inwards, which has become more isolations and less inclined to give a care about these types of countries of which they have no strategic interest in. Why would they want to align with the West that tries to profile their way into these countries and tries to liberalise their economies and allow for private investment in a way that is not beneficial in any way, shape or form? We told you that the types of loans that are accepted are those which are gratified by these emerging democracies. The local politicians have incentives to accept the types of deals which will actually benefit their types of economies. When you have people literally running on anti-corruption platforms in Pakistan and Malaysia, that is an indication that these countries do care about their sovereignty and aren't engaging in bad deals. At the point where we told you that the vast minority of countries weren't ever actually engaging in it, we were quite happy to stand by these laws in this way. So the benefit that we got is that we created jobs. We created jobs in the infrastructure of these countries, both directly through the fact that many of these countries employ these workers, but also indirectly through the fact that there are many industries which build off that. Their only counter was quite a gloom characterisation saying, oh well Pakistani farmers can't be civil engineers. Well quite obviously not all of them can, but there are people who have to work in the concrete industry. There are people who have to service that line with quite a lot of people, like quite basic jobs. So quite clearly there is a range of skills which can be needed by a range of people."

We're going to decide to see, when we give China alternative trade routes, both through the Arctic trade route and through ports in Guadalupe, that's how we prevent that from happening.

They never truly answered the imperative that we set from the state of opposition. We tell you that these loans are going to catch up with them at some point. Even if at the beginning they get these amazing opportunities, then at one point these loans are going to stop. These countries are going to have to start paying back the debt that they have, and they won't have the opportunity to do so. They won't have this because their own economy will have been taken over.

Finally, the point is that even when good infrastructure comes, they say that it's good when it comes from other places, but you don't have to pay for it. But each of this is answered by our own case. We tell you that you can provide these services even if you have less amounts of these huge loans. One or two members could have provided their education with more money if they hadn't taken that highway deal and they couldn't make that second part of the service. China forces them to take these huge loans they're never going to be able to pay back. Finally, these countries don't exist in isolation. Kyrgyzstan can only do trade with respect, and other countries around them, they have other opportunities besides these loans. Finally, even if these economic benefits are true, three things. Firstly, we don't know how they are going to be short-term. These loans end at some point, and countries won't get those benefits anymore because they can't maintain the things that they have in ports or in hydro plants. All of these things will run out of the money because these countries aren't getting loans from China anymore, which was the only thing keeping those infrastructure projects alive. Secondly, these benefits never go to the people. The total of China is using its own local power to influence the political decisions in those countries. And even if they have economic benefits, these economic benefits will use better China. Finally, the Hebei Humanities has to find why my extension is true, and why these economic benefits will exist, and why China will be able to make military growth so successful that it works to the fullest extent that China wants to.
