It will cut ties but will still have diplomacy and consulates. On the economic level, trade deals, import and export can still exist. But French majority ownership of African national companies, particularly in raw resources, is no longer possible. Our alternative is to privatize, which implies the entry of foreign investors. The West's CFA franc must be dissolved as a currency. France's exit has to include exiting from Africa's monetary policy. On the military level, all French troops get withdrawn. What likely happens on our side is that West African countries have similar monetary needs. They're export-based economies and are already in an extensive trade union like ECOWAS. This likely means that these countries band together under the same currency as regulated by their own central bank."

              "text": "First argument then about the economy. How is France damaging the West African economy? Primarily by imposing the CFA franc. It is a currency adopted by West African countries that is controlled by France. Printing, distribution, reserves. It is pegged to the euro under fixed exchange rate. There are two detrimental characteristics of it. First, the artificially high exchange rate. It favors imports to the detriment of exports because when countries with strong currencies would trade with the West African countries, they will gain money by switching currency, whereas when CFA fraud is pegged to the euro, a strong currency, other countries lose money by trading. The implication of this is when they have a lower exchange rate, they are a more attractive trading partner. On op, African countries cannot use their own currency as an instrument to boost price competitiveness. Second point, the reserves of West Africa are in France. Half of the money that West African countries have has to be in France. West African countries only have access to 20% of the revenue they generated in the prior year at any given time, which means that any project government wants to do has to be within the bounds of the revenue they generated in the prior year at any given time, which means that any project government wants to do has to be within the bounds of the budget. For example, when building an electrical grid, governments are unlikely to have the capital to upscale the grid to a size that would meet the demands of its most residents in the capital city, let alone areas around it. Furthermore, West African governments lose liquidity. Most money that they have is tied up in ongoing projects and government expenditure. Liquid money remains in France. This means governments have a much tougher time dealing with crisis situations or unforeseen expenses. Droughts, natural disaster, crises like COVID-19. Responses to these events are too slow and inadequate because France needs to determine whether the claim is legitimate and how much or when to transfer money. The impact of this, of both points, is seen in the example of Ivory Coast, the largest CFA franc country, whose GDP per capita is one-third lower than before the implementation of CFA franc. Our comparative here is that first, when West African countries don't have CFA franc, they can adjust their own currency to be more appropriate for international trade of raw resources. Secondly, West African countries get their own money directly. They get their half of GDP from reserves back, which means they have more money on hand. This means that West African countries now have the capacity to invest into things that people need. Agriculture, hospital, I'll take you later, manufacturing industries, water systems. This is especially important because none of West African citizens deserve a lower quality of life. They're stuck here due to birth lottery. Given that their lives are unbelievably difficult, fixing this injustice is a priority. Now a point. Do you support America's basic moral values? I don't see how this is relevant to this. I will just continue. I don't see how this is relevant to this. I will just continue. I don't see how this is relevant."

              "text": "Second argument then about the development of ECOWAS. What is ECOWAS? This is an economic community of West African states. They have aspirations of trade liberalization and creating a common currency between member states. It is currently not very influential or active because of France. Because first, most of ECOWAS' goals are much easier to accomplish with a common currency, such as fair trade between nations. Secondly, ECOWAS member states are afraid of pivoting trade to each other. Right now, France is a big provider of local economic projects. Over 10% of Burkina Faso's foreign economic aid comes from France. They're afraid if they devote more resources to each other, France might backlash by pulling back support. This also creates a further disadvantage for initiating trade liberalization projects. Why is ECOWAS more active on crop? When France pays out, first, it presents opportunity to create common currency if CFA franc is gone. West African countries benefit from having a shared currency as it makes trade between each other easier. They will likely want one after the CFA franc is gone. West African countries benefit from having a shared currency as it makes trade between each other easier. They will likely want one after the CFA franc is dissolved. ECOWAS is the only body with the ability and political legitimacy to implement this. Note, the only reason these incentives don't manifest in the status quo is because of CFA franc's presence. Second point, how this creates export value. African countries are very likely to recognize the need to depend more on each other for trade. Because first, there is going to be an interim period before complex economic ties or deals are established, which can last for years. Economic growth and supply are still necessary then. Secondly, on suspicion. These countries are not likely to risk full trade and investment dependence on another foreign power again."

              "text": "bargaining power. Like any large economic union, big trade deals are likely to be mediated through the union rather than individual countries. Common resources like oil, uranium, or cocoa will likely be pooled between these nations and bargained with as a group. Grouping resources gives West Africa control over the majority of a certain product on the market, giving them bargaining power and control over pricing. More money for products sold means more money to the individual countries. This is very important that these are export-based nations, which will bring a significant boost to the GDP then. B, uncirculation of capital. Instead of consumers' money going into the developed world, it gets spent on African products and African industries staying in West Africa. Second point about security reasons. ECOWAS also functions as a military union of all involved nations. It pulls military power from West Africa and either directly involves itself in conflict or gives armed support to countries which need it. In the status quo, its security function isn't relevant because it is insufficiently funded and lacks authority. Note how our argument mechanizes why this changes. ECOWAS would be more successful in perpetuating African stability through fighting back internal insurgencies and terrorists in member states. Important examples of when ECOWAS was more influential and succeeded in this is when ECOWAS led the office mission in 2013 to destroy an almost successful coup attempt on Mali. ECOWAS would also be more successful in fighting back against terrorist forces than individual French or Chinese military bases in West Africa. ECOWAS would have insights into connected terrorist cells between countries, access to military generals who have been active in the region since Islamic terror or insurgency groups rose. This is the exclusive benefit of ECOWAS, incentive and capacity for all involved countries to share security info. On top, African militaries can outsource responsibility to the French military as it is perceived as the most legitimate military in the area. They do this due to scarce resources that need to be allocated elsewhere. Overall, if ECOWAS was given an opportunity to grow, first, African economies would grow alongside it. Secondly, through creation and growing legitimacy of ECOWAS, African states would be far more likely to reduce tensions and de-escalate wars between each other. And thirdly, African states would be significantly more successful in fighting back of terrorists and insurgents. Both sides here aspire to give Africa a better future. Only on our side we can show you how we do this. So I beg you to propose. Thank you. How's that? How's that? How's that?"

It looks like becoming a transitionary government and negotiating, similar how it was done in South Africa with the apartheid government, which guaranteed democracy for the people on the ground. But thirdly then, it looks like putting general greater resistance to combat the narratives that France's presence was inherently neo-colonial and therefore harmful. Because note how this allowed for propaganda through Russia and proxy groups such as the Wagner Group, which mobilized individuals to actively push the French out. But secondly, we have the ability to then ensure that coups are unlikely to happen on our side because we remove the mechanism of misinformation. We actively combat that, meaning individuals aren't necessarily to be mobilized. But even if coups happen, we still think there would be a strong French presence until democratic transition and consolidation of democratic norms within the region is likely to happen."

But secondly, note if West Africa had its own currency, the instability within the region would have likely just tanked the currency. We don't think they'd give them a viable solution. ECOWAS, secondly then, panel, is not about defending military forces. It's an economic trade law. So all their stuff on security doesn't fall because it's about economic trade. But secondly then, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso pulled away from ECOWAS, currently within status quo, which means that there's no capacity to effectively engage with ECOWAS, and the reason why they pulled away was because of their unwillingness to be democratic. Before I go on, I'm sure I'll take your POI. You're wrong about the formulation of this motion.

There's been a 126% increase in terrorism within Mali that's led to mass civilian harms. The Mora massacre in Mali, a military operation between the Malayan government and the Wagner group, led to a massacre of 300 civilians. We think these instances are likely to happen significantly more because of the preserves incentives of people like the Wagner group. This happens for three reasons. First, one, you create a power vacuum as there's no forces actively committed to combating terrorism within the region. The absence of the French has led to peacekeeping operations such as the G5 being non-existent, as African nations and the French have both opted out. Secondly, there's less resources to combat insurgency. There's been a general decline of military aid within the region, as the anti-West sentiments within the region have been growing concurrently, note how the USA has stopped supplying $2 billion worth of aid in West Africa, which means that the most vulnerable are left without a solution, left without protection. They don't have the capacity to opt out or to be protected. No thank you. Thirdly, let's just engage the Wagner panel, because the Wagner group has led to even greater casualties within the region. There's an indiscriminate use of force due to a lack of accountability measures and an incapacity to separate terrorists from civilians. Individuals are quoted as saying that often they attack people who try to escape. If you run, they're going to kill you because they don't necessarily know who you are. But secondly, when the UN panel investigated what was happening in West Africa, they recognized that particularly the Wagner group has violated human rights and committed things such as rape and sexual violence, which are just the latest accusations that have been associated with the group."

This is to say that they're likely going to co-opt the United States as they did prior to 2020 in engaging military operations. The impact is that you significantly reduce the impact on citizens because they're not forced to leave as a result of the increased human violence. We've not put pressure on neighbouring countries to house refugees with the potential of leaving citizens vulnerable to abuse. Note, in March and April, it was noted that 7,000 new arrivals of individuals arrived at the UN refugee camp of the Malayan citizens who faced Wagner Group abuse.

I think they gain more from making more influences, for pushing more of their influences on there. Why? Because they're likely to push their own guys onto positions of power. This is what they're literally doing in status quo. They're pushing French people in approach to their governments. They literally make elections not fair, but they only elect French people. Why? Because it is easier to establish power that way. It is easier to make your politics grow. It is easier to make trade deals you want to make for the likelihood of France and for France to make more money. Secondly, we tell you also we tell you a comparative on our side, which we have still UN, which is likely to push democracy into these countries, but also like ECOWAS which is doing this in status quo. Their only response to ECOWAS is oh, Niger, Burkina Faso pushed away from ECOWAS. Okay, these are weaker democracies, weaker economies that we do not need for ECOWAS to succeed. He tells you we still have Nigeria and other countries and even though Nigeria and Burkina Faso pulled out, they also hold their own coalition. That means they're likely to trade between themselves and also make the economy stronger in that way. And secondly, he tells you once ECOWAS is more established because now we have less French influence because we provided to the likelihood in our second argument, he tells you at that point where ECOWAS is more powerful, more countries are likely to engage because of that. Do you regret the apartheid government negotiating a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa? Often there was major pushes for the government to leave Australia in 1970. Okay, I don't see how this is relevant in any way. You cannot just throw examples out here. They're literally giving you likelihood and incentives why France is bad now, why France is bad in West Africa. We do not get to the point of relevance of this argument whatsoever. We tell you that on our side, French presence is the cause of erosion of democracy because they put their own people, they cause unfair elections, but also because populism on their side rises because the French is present on that. We tell you that we fix"

              "text": "democracy with our third argument, which is about scapegoating. We tell you there is a now to argument about scapegoating. There's a large anti-French narrative in West Africa. This looks like regular riots and protesters, people burning French flags on the street, massacring French old businesses. Literally, we tell you that Mali banned the activities of an NGO funded by France for kinatars to suspend its broadcast French radio. This is the climate in which they want to put more French power and cause more instability. This is because, firstly, West Africa was heavily exploited by French during its colonization. People are aware of this, and they hate it. Secondly, citizens see France meddling into their policy, feel their patriots got money invested easily, drinking it down by saying in the arms of French and they hate it. Secondly, citizens see France meddling into their policy, feel their patriots got money in the streets, and trickle it down by staying in the arms of French-opposed politicians. The French-opposed president of Gabon was worth over $130 million where his country was one of the poorest in Africa. People are tired of the French withdrawal and more the de facto independence. What is the problem then? The main incentive of politicians are to stay in power, as they said. They are aware that suggesting specific policies is a risk. It implies spending money and time for policies that might not work or backfire and push you out of the office. So they are always trying to take the path of least resistance. This looks like capitalizing off the anti-French narrative and hate and just being French for all the problems that we have. This is detrimental because, firstly, remember, countries in West Africa are emerging economies. In order to develop, West African governments need to be efficient in terms of planning, infrastructure investments, welfare, tax breaks, etc., economic stimulus bills, etc. The politicians selected by scapegoating haven't come to their positions by merit and effectiveness, which is crucial in developing countries. This means less development, as no effective policies will be made."

Similar things recently happened in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, where the citizens welcomed the coup because they promoted themselves as a revolving French decolonization, which proves more integrity on their side. Sure. On your side, if people are putting on a veto, how do you strengthen that? We told you, we literally told you that three most weakest, most less democratic countries pulled out. We do not need their money, we have other countries who have their own money. Now, because on their side you no longer give 50% of your money to French reserves, that is the money that we have directly on our side. You get your own money from your own exports, we do not just give it to France. This is the money that the French stole, now you just put it in your own economy and use it for your own people. It's like very, very logical. What is our comparative on this argument? Once France is born, so is the common enemy that rallies people to vote for these politicians. Nothing else can rally people to the same manner because African people are very ethnically and religiously diverse. Nothing else is as unifying for every African person to hate as hating France. This means that politicians cannot center their rules around hate because people are no longer successful with that kind of messaging. The way they differentiate themselves on proposition is by becoming solution oriented, actually finding whose fault is for problems and checks. This is extremely important because only with proposition we get the development these countries need, but they only prove more instability on their side because they don't have like any counter mechanisms whatsoever.

              "text": "liquidity, etc. A couple of responses. Firstly, the CFA franc is still used on their side. Literally, the military leaders that took over the coups literally said, hey, we're going to keep using the CFA franc because it's a stable currency and that's the one that we're able to use. Secondly, there's no actual alternative. ECOWAS has been trying to instill the ECO for many years, like they've tried it two times and they say that they only estimate it will be installed in 2028, right? And the reason this is structurally true is in order to have a monetary union, it is a prerequisite to have a fiscal union. And that is something you can't really have nicely in West Africa because these are all very different countries that are all facing different instability union. And that is something you can't really have nicely in West Africa, because these are all very different countries that are all facing different instability causes. So it is very unlikely that even in their best case, they'll be able to form a monetary union. But even if it is the case that they can form a monetary union and they don't use the CFA franc, notice the CFA franc is actually good, panel. It's not that bad on our side. Two reasons. Firstly, because it allows you to import with a strong currency. So when West African states want to import things, they're not using their weak currency, but they're using a stronger currency so they have a comparative advantage. But secondly, it is not a floating currency. It is pegged to the euro, which is fairly stable. That means that MNCs and other big countries can't buy out that currency in order to get, like, lower exports from West Africa so you get higher margins of benefits from the exports on our side. So even if we do have the CFA franc we think that's still comparatively better. Second thing they tell us, they tell us that ECOWAS is better with them because they can do stuff with a common currency, they can trade with each other, they can pool resources for bargaining power. Let's notice that firstly they didn't prove why a common currency was possible, I took that out. Secondly they can't pool resources for bargaining power. Let's notice that, firstly, they didn't prove why a common currency was possible. I took that out. Secondly, they can't pool resources for the very fundamental reason that Wagner is still there. Yes, the Afghani progression died, but he's not the only person in Wagner. We think that there are plenty other people, plenty other executives that are continuing to stay. Think about the fact that they just took over new gold mines in Burkina Faso. They are taking over these mines. Because the deal that these governments have with the Wagner Group is you can take over our resources as long as you protect us from jihadist extremism. So that's the idea that's happening there. So they are losing their minds and they are unable to pool resources because those resources go straight to the Wagner Group. On the comparative, they think we're probably better. Because if you're still trading with France, at least you get some sort of marginal economic benefit, because France pays you for their resources. They don't just give you a service that's inherently unliquid. But a second response to this, let's just notice that there's probably better trade on our side for two structural reasons. Firstly, you're not isolated from the West. On their side of the house, when France pulls out and these countries are seen as undemocratic, everybody pulls out too. The Netherlands stopped supporting them. The USA sanctioned them and stopped supporting them. So that means that all the support they would have had on their side is no longer existent. So we think that they're more isolated from the West. But the second reason this is true is because we just don't have as many people pulling out. So we think on our side, you're more likely to be a part of ECOWAS because ECOWAS is inherently somebody that wants democratic regimes. Think about Nigeria, who was the biggest contributor to ECOWAS and the fact that they have opposed all of the coups that have happened and they've opposed the undemocratic regimes that have happened. So the point at which we told you democracy is more likely on our side because France can facilitate it, we think you're more likely to stay in ECOWAS in a stable way. But the last thing they tell us is that you can just make your own agreements. So, like, it's fine if they're out of ECOWAS. We think they've tried this. They tried with the AES, but it's been proven to be very unsuccessful because they just can't get on the same page. You're dealing with military coup leaders that just have a military focus, not an economic focus. So inherently, that just doesn't happen. So the reason we're weighing out and we're winning this economic slash is because we've showed you that on our side, you have more control over your resources and you have more ability to dictate how that happens.

Yes, they've exited, but they haven't told us that after France has exited, military leaders and coup leaders that are currently in power just want to give up power to the people. Like, even in their best case where that is the case and they can speculate future benefits, they still haven't told us why the military leaders that took over in Mali are just going to give up their power to the people. The reason we can comparatively claim that is because on our side, France doesn't exit in like 2023.

Two responses. Firstly, we think ECOWAS just like doesn't do this. ECOWAS is not a very big military actor for very structural reasons because of the worry that there will be inter-country conflict within ECOWAS. It's the same reason why the AU doesn't have a military because it's very hard to know whose interest to prioritize when implementing that military. But secondly, even if it is the case that ECOWAS can implement military initiatives, they will always be comparatively worse than the initiatives we can have from France, because it is far less centralized and there's far less control compared to France. Because ECOWAS is a whole union. On our side, it is just one government, so it's far easier to get more precise implement implementation. And that's particularly important when fighting terrorism, which is something very flexible and inherently constantly changing, so you need something that can have fast implementation. Second thing they tell us is that politically now, they scapegoat France, which is just like really weird, because Wagner on their side has a disinformation campaign, so that continues worse on their side. So panel, the reason our arguments are still standing in the debate is we told you on their side of the house there is more violence. On their side of the house you have individuals like the Wagner Group that are fighting against the people, you have instability. And on their side of the house democracy just doesn't happen because you don't have France to facilitate that process. So the reason your vote goes to opposition is because we ensure that people on the ground have a stable government. We ensure that France doesn't rapidly exit side opposition. Thank you.

O2 realizes they're not really debating the motion so we only get some real responses from her for the first time. Firstly, on the CFA franc. She says three things here. Firstly, that it's impossible to really establish this any currency which would rival the CFA franc because it had to be a fiscal union, not just a monetary union. First of all, this is just completely wrong. The CFA franc countries right now are not in a fiscal union. They just have the same monetary, they just have similar economic goals because they're both export-oriented countries and can exist in a monetary union. And we can see other examples like the European Union. Is that a fiscal union? No, it's not. It's literally a union of completely different countries. They're just united in monetary policy. Very simple. Secondly, they claim the CFA franc is not really that bad because it eases exports for these countries. We believe this is true to an extent, but it doesn't actually matter because on Wang, these are unique countries in that their entire economy is based on exports. That means the way they make the money by which they pay for the products which are supposedly cheaper to import is by exporting most of their economy and that's how they gain revenue. This means the most impactful thing we can do for them is increase how much money they get per unit of export. And thirdly, she claims, aha, but the euro is much more stable than this currency, which is likely to be implemented. Firstly, we receive absolutely no analysis as to why this new currency is unlikely to be stable. We think this is actually very, we think the opposite is actually very intuitive. Insofar as France leaves and you need to attract investors, you need to make sure that you have signaling stability in your country to attract people to replace France's investment. We think it's very likely you try very hard to have a stable currency. They can't just assert that yours is more stable. Even if it is, it's stable in the worst way possible. It's stable at keeping your country not having a good monetary policy. And I want to flag in this clash, they did not respond to our point on these countries simply having more money on our side. They have to defend a comparative in which African countries only have access to 20% of the net income they made last year. Even if we get no impact on the CFA franc and like growing their economy, we still get a lot more money to be used for projects in the status quo. How do we weigh the autonomy these countries have over their monetary policy? In crisis situations, I want to flag this is not very uncommon. Things like droughts, terror attacks, etc. Other situations that might lead to supply shocks are very common in West Africa. These countries need to be able to adjust their monetary policy to recover from these crises. Otherwise, their exports might be unfavorable for months on end, and the country won't be making any capital. Notice this is important, because even if opposition proves a long-term pathway towards development on their side, these crises, which happen quite commonly, set the country back severely and often enough so that any long-term development is mitigated."

              "text": "Okay, second clash then on ECOWAS. I'm going to split this clash into two parts, the influence of ECOWAS on trade and the influence of ECOWAS on security. At the top, I want to clarify our mechanism here. We claim that, yes, ECOWAS is not very powerful in the status quo, but that is because countries do not need to rely on it. Once France leaves, ECOWAS has to fill some of the shoes that France left behind. For example, we've told you why these countries do have an incentive to have a shared currency, since the CFA franc is now gone on our side. ECOWAS is the only body with the political legitimacy and capacity to implement this currency. Because of this, it becomes much more powerful and much more influential on our side, ECOWAS is the only body with the political legitimacy and capacity to implement this currency. Because of this, it becomes much more powerful and much more influential on our side. They say, aha, but countries left in the status quo. But exactly, they left because they could leave in the status quo. On your side, any trade and security benefits that ECOWAS still has are likely to be destroyed once everyone leaves from ECOWAS because it's not important. On our side, once it's a more relevant institution, firstly, countries are likely to return, and secondly, even if countries do not return, we're glad to bite the bullet insofar as the most relevant politically and economically countries like Nigeria are still here, and only the poorest and least populated countries have left. Okay, how do we get then to the trade part of this clash? They did not actually respond to anything we've told you on trade in this clash because they just said that ECOWAS is too weak so I'm going to weigh what point here is so important. Notice it is uncertain and difficult for either side in this debate to prove the economic growth or diversification of West Africa. That's why this point brings the least risky and most plausible and most proximate impact to these countries, right? Because with ECOWAS they can extract the most value from the status quo system, from these exports that they currently have. We've told you this in our mechanism. This means that even if we don't prove any better monetary or fiscal policy on our side, the export point still stands and they can get more money from the same thing that they do in the status quo. And also, again, notice the scale of this impact insofar as these are export-based economies. This means even a marginal increase to the value they get per export on their side is a huge GDP we get on our side. Okay. Secondly, then, to the security point, they've told us two things here. Firstly, they've told us, aha, your security point doesn't really stand because ECOWAS doesn't function as a military union. I think they've considered this is just wrong in the status quo and not going to spend any more time on this. Secondly, they've told us, aha, security on your side is worse because of Wagner. Notice after Prigozhin's death, Wagner is completely under the control of Vladimir Putin. Insofar as you have a war in Ukraine, which shows no signs of slowing down, and Vladimir Putin is certainly not like landslide winning, troops are currently being pulled out, and more so they're likely to be pulled out way more in the future, or at least no troops are likely to be added. So I think Wagner is really not an important part of this debate. And further they claim, aha, the security point really isn't good because it's important for security to be centralized. We think it's precisely the opposite. In West Africa once you have split terrorist cells in between all of these nations we think it's very very important to have decentralized cooperation with information that all countries can offer so that you can root out terrorism from the bottom. And I want to point out within this point, we received no comparative on what they can actually do about security. They've told us, aha, France can help, but we see France not helping in the status quo since they only have a monetary incentive insofar as they only prevent like they only protect factories, they only protect mines, we've told you why it's exclusively important that like"

They never demonstrate any reason why the future is going to be better, why Abdu'l-Armaham is going to reduce his control in this military junta under status quo, why this democracy is likely to take shape under their side of the model. They have to support the exit in the way that currently exist, which means there was a minimal incentive, unless they pulled out, for this transition to take place.

You don't get much of a benefit if African solutions to African problems still involves the French being majorly invested in everything. But let's talk about this. Let's talk about the Wagner Group and the creation of chaos within West Africa. The first question is, is Russia and China actually going to fill this vacuum?

They didn't regard then the idea that you're leaning on the Wagner Group. And this takes out the majority of their analysis on scapegoating, because that scapegoating was actually caused by France relaxing its control in the region, by France allowing for disinformation to occur. But secondly, note all of the political impacts they give you are completely symmetrical, because what they tell you is people are no longer able to lie on anti-French sentiment, and because we're so diverse in these countries, we are going to just stop championing politics based on hate. That's stupid. Because what we do instead is champion politics based on hate for each other.

What they say is jihadists are just here because of France. Three responses. One, jihadists are here because of opportunity. And so when France pulls out, they have an opportunity to entrench their power and continue their fight against the West from an established base. But note secondly, that jihadism is actively worsened on their side, because the Embera refugee camp that's caused by Wagner violence is something that actively radicalizes people, because people have had their homes destroyed by Russian activists with minimal accountability. All of that opacity analysis was given in Lisa's speech, and that's something that further radicalizes people and makes these problems even worse. But secondly, I'd like to talk about the French incentives for stability on our side. Firstly, there's an old republican wing within France that holds democratic ideals very close to their heart. They feel very possessive of old colonial territories, and they don't want to see them backslide into that idea of complete and utter chaos. And note, that's neo-colonial in its nature, but it's far preferable to the comparative. Secondly, note that France is fixed to democratic norms, which means you've signed on to UN charters, you abide to those charters, you're not going to roll around protecting mines at the expenses of civilians. But lastly, note there's this active refugee crisis that's created by terrorism. Marine Le Pen and the Popular Front have been pushing against that, which means when noiseless people flee from Mauritania into France as a result of terrorism metrics, that creates a direct incentive for the French to look out for them. On comparative, the Wagner Group is the vested incentive for resource grabs. And this takes out the Ukraine analysis, because Putin isn't going to pull troops from Africa to Ukraine if those troops are actively giving him money to fund the wars. That looks like the unmarked military vehicles that walk around the Central African Republic to protect the gold mines that the Wagner Group directly benefits from."

Before I move on to the second conversation about the economy, sure, I'll take your point. If I ignore this new response in 03, it's still borderline insulting to claim West African theater propaganda post-France's exit to hate it. On your side, they hate it still for being France, and when France says this allows, you know, to rejuvenate us. Yes, they hate it for being France. That's very much correct. But what does that hate do on your side? That hate is actively weaponized. That hate is used as a means of support for authoritarian regimes, whereas on the comparative, that support for authoritarian regimes, whereas on the comparative, that support for those regimes wouldn't exist. That's why Russia is championed while the French flag is burned, and that's that active coup, that active grab for power that you incentivize on your side. That's insulting. Second conversation, the idea that economically speaking, this isn't beneficial. What they tell you is that African states are able to develop on their side, and this is something that's enforced by France. Five responses. Firstly, note the differing incentives that exist between France and the like powers that they support. France is a slow-growing economy. It's something that has a direct incentive to create capacity, to shift the labor-intensive jobs to these states to allow for them to develop. On the comparative, China gets active benefit from pulling oil from Chad because it has a very developed manufacturing economy intensive jobs to these states to allow for them to develop. On the comparative, China gets active benefit from pulling oil from Chad because it has a very developed manufacturing economy that can still benefit from that. Secondly, the idea of asserted stability. You don't have property rights, you have resources that are given to elites, it's unlikely that they demonstrate this investment is something that's going to come in. Thirdly, let's talk about the fact that their sole benefit is flexibility. You can allocate money here or here dependent on need. Note that currency unions don't give you that capacity. Think of the eurozone crisis. Think of all of the inflation that's generated when you have to support a weaker nation. That is something that actively reduces the flexibility they want to claim. But fourthly, note the asserted similarity of positions. Nigeria is a lot more developed than Burkina Faso, and as a result, that's going to alter the incentives they have when it comes to these unions. Fifthly, though, where does this trade happen? Are you shipping raw materials from one African nation to the other? Where is the active investment or development that's created? That's worsened by the fact that they cut off relations to the places where you'd be shipping these resources under status quo. They reduce capacity, they worsen the economy, they allow terrorists to run rampants. Put your ballot with the green and gold where it matters."

Two of their weighing metrics as to why just on benefits alone we weigh out. Firstly, because it's about being centralized versus decentralized. On our side, even if we have decreased effectiveness of ECOWAS, we still can claim the West. So, in the worst instance in which ECOWAS becomes unstable, we still can claim the West. So in the worst instance in which ECOWAS becomes unstable, we still have other actors we can depend on. Their entire case is hung on the idea that ECOWAS just starts working really automatically so they don't actually have security. But secondly, notice their case is just far too long term.

They were able to decapitate one of the leaders of al-Qaeda. Secondly, we have higher resources on our side to combat insurgencies, but thirdly, the Wagner Group harms civilians. But a second argument we give under this clash is to say that there's increased democracy on our side because military coup leaders reject democracy on their side, and France has an incentive to implement democracy for their reputation. What they give us, then, panel, is they tell us that propaganda is really bad, which we find very strange, because the Wagner group is the one pushing disinformation, but secondly, they tell us that ECOWAS can fight back. Three-way metrics, why just unvalue, we weigh out on this clash. Firstly, because on our side there's just a greater pool of resources. So even if they did have good organisation, we can fight GEDIS better because we just have fundamentally more resources because more countries are involved. Secondly, we prevent harm from getting too extreme. So on their side, they have to defend a world after the coups happen. We defend a world in which those coups don't happen. So the harm we're trying to mitigate is less. But thirdly, we're able to rely on people who we can trust. They have to rely on groups like the Wagner Group that are known to harm civilians.

How does French help on their side? Because they steal all, people only left when they speak in French, once France exited. This is literally absurd. France only left because Africans back-lashed. Back-lashed because France did nothing about terrorism. So how does France help about terrorism, which is their strongest solution, which they've closed down, spent most of their time talking about? It doesn't help either.

And because of their argument about scapegoating, which now you cannot have this common enemy, oh France is bad, this is their fault, or this is happening, either. Because you can't really tell the politicians what to do. They also have the capacity, usually to point to you in an argument, to like share your info, et cetera. Certainly like in the backroom, we told them they pulled out most from Africa. But even if they didn't, we tell them how our comparison can deal with this. How they can still have less incentive. Because on our side, the economy is greater. Why? Because French only have incentive for their own money, for their own resources. This is literally why they have the colonial tax and the social scope, only to make money. They do not want these countries to remain a democracy, they do not want these countries to prosper on their own. They are implementing their own people in the head of government, they are not giving the money to develop.

We told them that on our side, people have the capacity, that now they have their own money, they can own coalitions, and on our side, they are actually coalitions, they are actually part of our people, that means they can make the most, the best decisions for their people.

One, we say individuals that don't believe even in that politics that they lobby, that the people are lobbying for, are vulnerable to being kicked out of office. So they're likely to be receptive to the people that voted them in in the first place. They're likely to be receptive to the outside pressures because they don't have any connections to satisfy first immediately. But secondly, we say that there's a higher proportion of progressive politicians that are going to influx within the politics space. We think this is going to create a very huge amount of people that are going to manipulate that political space. What are the impacts here? One, we say we have better laws that are more supportive to minorities, which looks like gender-affirming care to trans-human individuals. This looks like reproductive supportive to minorities, which looks like gender-affirming care to trans-U individuals. This looks like reproductive rights to women. This looks like anti-discrimination laws being more robust for people of color. We say that we even get better military allocation of resources. This is to say, instead of spending all your billions on access to military budgets, at least we've got much more being put on economic and environmental policies, such as unemployment benefits for people, or protecting the environment instead of like putting things like the Willow Project in Alaska right secondly we say that way this one is vulnerability we say that we help the youth in poor circumstances this is to say that the trans people that can't care they get the access to care that they need to live the women who died because of lack of access to abortion because of men that don't exist in those spaces and can't relate to that because they're old and senile and stay within those spaces for long, is something that gets to at least change for the better on our side.

We think it's easy for people to then sympathize with the party, as the perception is the problem with this was for those particular figureheads, for the figureheads rather than the party itself. This then allows them to be very violent in the way in which they push harmful things like funding Israel, because they know that they're not going to attain the proportional blame, right? The proportional blame is likely going to go to those particular figureheads. This becomes very difficult for the people who determine the delta, because they don't understand whether it's a problem of politics or that political figurehead. We say, hence, there is no accountability. Why this is particularly true is because the people this policy affects is not necessarily crazy leftist debaters like us. We think it affects normal liberals that just look at Biden and think Biden is the one responsible for everything. And this is a very great group of people that are getting affected by this, right?

No, we could use the similar or less amounts of political capital that exists on their side to ensure that all candidates pass a mental cognition test and have the results be published publicly.

But B, even if you do campaign, we think that voters like candidates who are sprightly and lively because this pushes the image that you are capable. For instance, this is why JFK likely won over Nixon. Moreover, we think political parties also have an incentive to win, right? And in this case, they're likely going to push you out if they think you are not, like, cognitively enabled enough. So for instance, Biden losing tons of democratic donor support after his performance in the presidential debate and literally pulling out thus we think the majority of candidates who will who will run will likely be competent at 60 what do we think are your mental capabilities we think that most people at 60 are still pretty competent most people still work a lot of our judges here are still are like over 60 so we think that this is a very low upper limit.

              "text": "The biggest flaw on their side was never actually proving the link between age and good policy. Let's look at what actually influences politicians' behavior. First, we think their primary incentive is to be re-elected. To do this, they need to cater to voters who could potentially vote for them or who are potentially swing voters. So for instance, the gay constituency is a huge constituency that could possibly come out and vote for you, right? For instance, the Turkish people in Germany are a swing vote between the SPD and the CDO. So in this case, and in these cases, you're likely going to want to pander to, for instance, the gay people they want to protect, because you want them to come out and vote for you. So we don't think that representation is dependent on age as they claim. Second, they say older people have more connections. But we would argue that lobbying only works if it helps you get re-elected. You're unlikely to push policies that would presumably not get you elected. It only works if you have that platform. So we think that given that there are things like campaign finance laws and loss of scrutiny, this is unlikely to be something that is a huge problem or something that they can solve. Lastly, they say that young people are inherently good. Sure, they can be good, but this is not always the case. What matters are their policies, right? They need to prove that this is inherent to age. Lastly, they say unscapegoating, in that you can blame the cognitive decline of Biden instead of the Democratic Party for pushing for Israel. I think that this is quite of a stretch, right? Biden was literally kicked off. You still have backlash against Israel. I don't think that there is a clear connection here. Before constructive, yes? This is not the debate, and usually lower age limits are either 18 for lower houses, but if you're talking about the presidential, this is only about the presidency. This is not the debate. This is about all political office. First argument,"

              "text": "then, I want we maximize democratic choice. The value of democracy lies in the fact that voters are given a range of choices in candidates so they can make the best approximation as to which candidate best fits into their values. In this argument, we will prove to you why when this choice is taken away from voters, the consent of the governed in a democratic system is eroded. First, what is the value of democratic choice? No one would believe it would be democratic to choose from a tiny set of similar options, where your range of opinions is less likely to be representative of your interests. This is because the state has huge control over your life, whether that be your earnings, when to put you in jail, where you are educated. Hence, we justify this by allowing people to choose such leaders. Of course, there are constraints on who ends up being on the ballot on either side of the House. But we are the side that overly gets to the closest practical approximation of this principle on our side. Why does proposition overly limit democratic choice? First, let's talk about capacity. We think that being 60 is a very, very low bar in most instances. So for instance, Modi is literally in his late 70s. Kamala Harris herself is 59, right? People over 60 in the country are probably about 20% of your population. So on their side of the house, they constrain huge amounts of the types of people who can run by a significant amount. And second, but this also deals with their mechanism on less people entering politics, right? We think actually on their side, less people are likely to run for democratic office. This is because the process of moving up the politics chain is often a very arduous one, yet this sets a very stringent limit on where your journey ends. So we think the decision to enter politics often has costs, right? And most people often only enter it when you can get high rewards off it. So most people going into politics in their early 30s or late 20s don't think that they'll achieve their goals right away. It often takes quite a lot of time. If you think and you know that there is a set limit, you're less likely to think that you can achieve your goals and hence may not make the decision to enter in the first place. The end point of this is that you get a far smaller pool of candidates that you can even pick from in the first place. That is far less democratic. Why is this important in an independent path to victory? First, let's talk about voters and consent. We think there are sufficient checks in place already that ensure people can approximately consent to this. First, you still need to win the primary and the municipal elections to be on the ballot. Second, you still need to win the general election and get people to vote for you. You need to cater to people's interests in order for you to do this. So we think that there are sufficient checks already in place. Proposition overly corrects for this. Second, this is about the process of democracy. It doesn't matter if there are one or two cases where this can't be good. It doesn't matter because of A, we think there are already natural incentives that have such people self-select already. But B, the process of potentially blocking representative candidates is a far worse precedent to set. So on our side, we extol more democratic principles."

              "text": "Second argument then, on why we improve the quality of governance. Politicians make decisions based on what is most likely to get them re-elected in the short, medium, and long term. In most circumstances, political incentives means that politicians balance all of these while crafting policy, creating a balance of long and short-term policy. This argument will prove why an upper age limit on politicians makes their incentives far more short-termist, leading to worse policy for the long term. What do we think are the incentives of politicians? Let's look at them during their office, right? You often want to be re-elected in the future and to advance your own political career. For many, being in politics is a long-term game. Many mayors want to become senators, who then want to become speakers of the houses and have aspirations of advancing their career, just like any other job sector. Thus, many politicians have hopes of continuing their political advancements even past age 60. But let's look at your exit options and what happens after politics. Depending on when you leave the political field, you will often either A. Retire out of politics because you are old, or B. Go into the private sector to make money. If you are young, you have a significant network of CEOs and regulations, so this is very lucrative, you have a very specific skill set, this is why you often move into the private sector. What are the implications of this on prop? When you cut the political careers of many politicians short, this significantly changes their actions. First, let's talk about policy. You get far more short-term policies. This is because politicians have less ability to advance their political careers into the future. They look less at how their policies will impact their careers in the long term, 20 or 30 years down the line. You care about the next two elections, not the potential election 10 to 20 years down. This is when you pass policies that benefit the economy now, but may harm it in the long term. So for instance, climate policies, mass spending right now at the expense of future debt, lower interest rates to curb on our lower interest rates in the short term, but leading to very, very high inflation in the long term. On our side, politicians pass far more long-term policies. This is because it looks good on their CVs 10 years down the line. When they try to advance their careers, they don't want to be blamed for being the ones who mess up the economy. But second, on the revolving door, this means you get more politicians who exit politics earlier and enter into the private sector. That is when you worsen the impacts of the revolving door significantly. For instance, how Macron's chief of staff, Ismail Emelian, currently works at Total Energy after moving out of politics. This happens to a far lesser extent and degree on our side when politicians are less likely to leave early. We ensure democracy is better protected. Thank you. Thank you. All right."

Firstly, it's on the idea about political short-term using, right? We think there's a slippery slope to this argument. Why? Because we think that they don't allow candidates to run for even more than two terms in most instances. So we think even if these individuals are in government, they're most likely to focus on the short-term benefits that they acquire within such political office. We think there's a slippery slope that if they believe that politics can only focus on long-term goals if you allow people to stay within politics for longer, then we think that they would also be willing to extend the political terms to something like 10 years within each political term. We think that's something that's particularly un-themed because we think that is something that's particularly unfair because we think that leads to individuals not having a variety of policies in existence. But secondly, we say that the short term matters in terms of how the long term is supposed to manifest because individuals can desensitize accountability for not solving problems that are plaguing people right now and simply say that, you know what, we'll solve these issues within 2030. We think this is the same thing that has been happening even within developing countries where you have governments that tell people about vision 2030 when it's the year 2018 right. We think that long-termism takes away that sense of urgency from politics which you think is required for governments to solve the problems that are actively plaguing people in most instances. We think this is something that's important. But thirdly, we said that the short-term matters in order for the long-term to even matter. We said that if you don't have good economic policies today, there's no way that good economic policies will manifest later in the future. We think this is something that doesn't happen, right? We think if you can't enact good political and economic policies for businesses to function in current status quo as a politician, it is highly unlikely that you are ever going to have that long-term benefit in and of itself because those businesses don't even trust that economic environment because of how it looks like within that short term, right?"

We think this is an implicit concession on their side that there is a level of legitimacy to a policy that limits the poor individuals that you can do this. But secondly, we say that there's already a precedence to this. We don't allow criminals to run for political office, not because we don't think that those individuals can enact good policies in and of themselves, but because we think that the risk is too big to take care of. My first speaker tells you about how politics is able to affect the lives of individuals that we simply cannot risk it affecting those individuals. If you don't trust a person who's over 65 to drive in public transport, why would you trust an individual who is above 65 to be a president within your country? We say that this presidency is even set within individuals that work within public sector, that looks after people, and we think this is precedence that you need to set because you think that if the risk exists, we are not willing to take that risk because of the inherent harms that come from it.

Firstly, they tell us that, you know what, we want to have cognitive tests in instances where individuals are not cognitively capable to run for office. What is the slippery slope of this argument? First, we say that there is no determining how your wellness is going to deteriorate in the future if you run for office. This is to say that if you are over 65 and just to a president, right, we think that your cognitive capabilities can deteriorate any time, and we think this becomes a problem. Why? Because we think that those political people that exist within those positions are likely to continue to recycle those same cognitive results as a way to push their legitimacy within government office. But second, we have seen people call for Biden to take a cognitive test for over four years during his term, but that hasn't happened, right? We said that this takes even longer for those individuals to get out of office when they enter with cognitive issues, right? I think this is an inherent harm that exists exclusively on-site opposition within the state, because I think we can't afford to continue having to push for individuals to go and get tested for their cognitive capabilities. But I think that in that same period where Biden was being pushed to take those cognitive tests was the same time that was making very bad policies for America that wasn't really working for the entire country. We say America has had surges of inflation. They've ruined foreign policy by funding states like Israel. They have worsened tension in the East by causing Russia-Ukraine war. We think those are all policies that particularly exist when you have someone who has been perceived as incapable of running that particular office, right? We think these are benefits that are able to be claimed exclusively from side proposition one. Because we say that it's oftentimes impossible to determine the cognitive capability of that individual in the future. This is to say that if you test the cognitive capability of that person today, it's unable to determine the cognitive capability of that individual in the future. This is to say that if you test the cognitive capability of that person today, it's unable to determine how it's going to look like in the future and we think this is something that they needed to consider. But second, you say that even continuous like cognitive tests aren't going to work. Why? Because you think that individuals constantly have to continue to take them and it's easy for these individuals to infabricate those results to begin with. I think on our side, individuals can fabricate how old they are, and we think we can actively tell you that you've been running for political office for over 40 years. There's no way you are below the age of 60. I think this is something that can actually be claimed exclusively from side opposition within the state. Before I continue, I'll take one. If you're perceived as old and literally incoherent, why do voters still vote for you? We already told you that the sphere of politics in our first speech is based around connections, that if you're a young individual, you are unlikely to get promoted within those political spheres because we think that the way individuals are marketed to the general public are marketed by those individuals that have connections. This is to say that if you can't vote for a person that looks like Biden, right, it means that the Democratic Party is likely to promote a younger individual as the face of the Democratic Party. We think the reason why individuals have been voted between Trump and Biden is not because they believe that people of that age are particularly capable, but because they have no alternatives outside of that, right? We think they vote because of the opportunity cost that comes from such decisions, not because they believe so. But secondly, we say that believing this decision is something that is marketed to you, right? We think that the way that the voter consent itself works is not because voters are somewhat mostly informed about the decisions and the character of these individuals but rather about how those individuals are particularly marketed to you. If the Democratic Party could market somebody who has proved to have cognitive issues like Biden and get a voting base within the same is likely to happen on your side when you don't limit these individuals that have cognitive issues from running for office. But they're not the exclusive data that you get from side proposition that doesn't get engaging. Firstly, it's on the idea of responsiveness to political issues. These individuals stay in government for extensive periods of time. This looks like how Biden has been in government for over 40 years and how a lot of like the marketing that exists within the democratic party itself is likely to promote someone like Biden as opposed to a new bystander. What our policy does, therefore, is that it pushes these individuals out of those political spaces, and we think that vacuum itself allows individuals to opt into politics, right? This is something that opposition can't claim in this debate, because when you still have those people in government, it's unlikely that you create space for those individuals. They oftentimes wait for them to die or to be called out like Biden. Proud. That's got to be awesome. All right. Okay."

But on their biggest example, which is the 40-year-old who can't run for presidency, this is one exceptional position, the most important position in the world, the President of the United States, where it is probably justified to ban it in the first place. So in these cases, the ones specifically there in this house are justified. What isn't, then, is their stance that all political office, not just the presidency, but the people in the first place. So these cases, the ones specifically that are in the status quo, are justified. What isn't then is their stance, that all political office, not just the presidency, but the people in the lower houses, the upper houses, literally every political office that you could run for, is banned. And it's not also for most people who are cognitively declined, but most individuals from 60 to 70 who, look, just aren't cognitively declined, and scientifically their decisions are still as mentally capable.

Number one, this is just, once again, a very extreme stance. I just really don't think people who are age 60 or even 65 or even 70 are mostly cognitively declined in most cases. But secondly, I just want to note, voters probably do consent in this case, that even if there are two relatively older candidates, or even one relatively older candidate versus a young candidate, if a sufficient amount of population turned out for them, i.e. 30 to 40% of the population, I think this is probably enough to outweigh the potential risk in the future of a slight risk of cognitive decline in the first place. Because as they note, this is very public information, if you decided to choose to vote for someone who is age 70, for instance, you probably consented to this risk in the first place. But the final claim and the best claim here is that you have no alternatives, that every candidate is old, and therefore you shouldn't be able to do this in the first place. This presumes that it is as bad as they say, that every candidate is old. But in my intro, I already told you why this isn't the case.

But secondly, that fewer people can run, and there was a right for individuals to be able to change their policies in their country, a right for them to be able to run for office in the first place, and they take away the right for the 20% of individuals, and these are the ones who are most likely to run in the future. That if you're age 60, and you retire from your job, you're most likely to want to go into politics in the first place.

              "end": 2514.44,
              "text": "On the quality of governance done, I first want to make a very simple observation. Young people, young does not mean progressive, and old does not mean conservative. For instance, the head of the AFD in Germany is relatively young. J.D. Vance, Trump's running mate, is relatively young. He's like 42. Bernie Sanders, for instance, the closest that the U.S. has come to a really anti-establishment, really progressive politician is in his late 70s. This is because you do not set your agenda purely based on what you believe or even what your age is. And there's this weird fallacy from them that young people are necessarily far more progressive on their side. I just want to flip their argument then. I want to actually give you new constructive material as my older candidates are actually more likely to run on risky political agendas. I have two things here. Number one, younger politicians that plan on staying in politics have a long-term incentive to appease senior members of their party. This is because advancing further into politics is generally dependent on what senior members think of you, whether they think you're often reasonable, whether you're willing to abide for party lines, for instance. Thus, you're likely to actually conform with the majority. You take more risk averse to status in most parties, whereas otherwise, you risk not being nominated for senior roles. You risk having funding being given to the other candidate in your primary, or in PR systems, not being on the party list in future elections, for instance. Why does this no longer apply when you are old? Two reasons. Number one, when you are in the twilight of your career, you don't have to worry about in the future. If you're Bernie Sanders, you want to retire outbursts, so you don't care what the Democratic Party thinks of you, for instance. But two, you are the most senior member in the party in the first place. You're the one who is the entrenched senator. You're the one who has lots of allies and power in the party. Therefore, this actually frees you up and allows you to go for more risky stances, the more anti-establishment stances, the more risky stances that you otherwise wouldn't take on their side or you merely stick to the party line that they say. Therefore, if the one can say no to you, that you're Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren with relatively old candidates who actually run on really progressive platforms, it's far more likely you're on our side. But secondly, I want to make tackles until you actually move out, because their response might be, oh, but when you're 58, you also move out eventually, so it's symmetric. No, the difference is, when you are 60, you likely will continue working. Most individuals who are in positions of power, who are career politicians, tend to work until they're in their 70s or 80s, because they think they're very competent and they want to make money. When you're 75, though, on our side, you naturally age out and retire on our side, so the incentive to actually continue the long term is not so metric. What are then your extra options as a 59-year-old politician on the other side of the house? Two things. Number one, as Rachel notes, you have appointed positions in the political party's administrations. And once again, this falls back to my first incentive of actually impressing the party seniors and not aging out the individuals. Therefore, on our third side of the house, you're so lucky to actually stick to the party line because you aging out the individuals. Therefore, on their side of the house, you're so lucky to actually stick to the party line because you want to get appointed to a ministry position in the future, you want to actually be the senior party when you're 59, for instance. And secondly, and more importantly, Rachel also told you that it is the private sector. This deals with their argument on external influence. Basically, you want to exist as a consultant or an advisor to a large company, or even another organization external to politics. This means you're actually more susceptible to lobbying and external influence, and you're more likely to actually buy into these narratives that you actually take more money from corporate sources, even if you external to politics. This means you're actually more susceptible to lobbying and external influence, and you're more likely to actually buy into these narratives, and you actually take more money from corporate sources, even if you do declare it. That's your only exit option as you're older. Therefore, you're still more risk-averse on the their side. We avoid this by actually having individuals who are less risk-averse on our side. But finally, even if both young and old, young-oriented people run for office, ours is better, because as they note, old people have more connections, more people listen to them. This means if you run a more progressive platform on our side, you're more likely to be listened to. I just want to deal with the rest of their claims then. They say, I have lost my paper, sorry. They give you two claims. The first thing they give you is the idea that you are likely to leave out two groups. Number one, poor people. Look, working class people are incredibly important to the electorate. They are often 30% of the individuals in London, for instance, and therefore you just want to appeal to them on both sides of the house. Therefore, I think the incentive is symmetric and you would apply to them anyway. But secondly, the trans girl in New York City. Look, the unfortunate reality is they are very small voter base. They are not a swing voter in any way. So even if you are a young politician, you do not want to appeal to them in the first place. This is probably broadly symmetric, but I already put this earlier. But finally then, they say this is not on accountability and you don't want to hold the entire party accountable because you just hold these Sina politicians instead. This is just empirically not true. When AOC voted abstain with the Iron Dome, there was lots of backlash. This is because she clad to a progressive agenda, but was still conservative anyway. Therefore, there's still going to be lots of scrutiny on individual politicians on our side. That when someone else makes a mistake, you don't just blame the president, you blame the other people who did make the mistake. Therefore, we still hold individuals accountable on our side. But then as for meeting on our side, it's as follows. One, more people run for office. They're more likely to be capable, and when people run for office, they're more likely to be capable. you don't just blame the president, you blame the other people who did make the mistake. Therefore, we still hold individuals accountable on our side. But then as for making it on our side, it's as follows. One, where people run for office, they're more likely to be capable and on good policies. Two, you actually have better policies on our side if you're old than if you're young, and you just have the best of both worlds on our side. And finally, even if that's not true, we conclusively win in the principle that you did consent to this leader, and therefore you should not have this policy on their side."

Within the center of itself is an implicit concession that you can limit who is able to run into office based on cognitive ability. If you are at risk of getting dementia, if you are at risk of being too old to make sufficient policies, that is something which is valid and allows for you to be limited in this sense. We say that even if not every single 65-year-old can't make policies, in the same way that not every single 18-year-old is not fully developed, we still don't allow either of them. We think that their contention about this low age limit was something which was quite poor and was trying to squirrel the motion. Secondly, unlike the whole idea that people aren't going to vote for old people anyway, one, this is empirically untrue. We have politicians who are old in every country. In Africa, we have people like Jacob Zuma, Emerson Mnangagwa, Robert Mugabe, Joe Biden, Donald Trump. It's even like if they can speak examples of young people running office, we don't have the minority of cases. Even if it's not the minority of cases, the most vulnerable places are the ones where these old people are creating this harm, so we still ought to value them more. Finally, we think they just ignore our framing of how the political sphere looks. We think that we told you in the first that the political sphere is restrictive. The longer you are able to be within the system, that is how you are able to create connections. When you create connections, you will never leave. Our continuing in this debate was not only on the fact that being old is like bad. We tell you that being able to be in the system for long and being able to not be able to be displaced because you already have that entrenched power is something which you regret.

              "text": "allows for young people to penetrate the system. Three clashes in this debate. Firstly, on the clash which is the most important in this debate, which is the progression of politics helping the minorities. I'm going to prove this to you later. What have we told you since first? One, that the youth feels disenfranchised with political systems. This is because it is very obvious and apparent that individuals who are old and individuals who have connections are the ones who keep the system. This looks like individuals who are friends with each other, individuals who have control over media spaces and can influence who individuals are going to vote for. That is the connection we've been talking to you about for this entire time. This has two implications. One, individuals feel as if it is very difficult for them to get into this political sphere. So instead of trying to get into politics, instead what they're going sphere. So instead of trying to get into politics, instead what they're going to do, instead of trying to get into politics, they're going to go out and function from an outside sphere. Instead of trying to lobby for the US government to stop funding Israel, we're going to see projects like Operation Olive Branch. We like that on both sides of the house. We still don't think that it's viable, but we still think that exclusively we're able to see individuals actively trying to get the USA to stop funding Israel. That is something which is inclusive on our side of the house. But secondly, we try to have very little, if not no incentive to lobby when you know that the individuals who are in office are individuals who don't care about your opinion. Because they will never get out. Because at the end of the day, they have connections. They're able to basically practically pick and choose who gets into this office and who stays in this office. So there's no incentive to lobby on this side of the house. We changed that. One, we made it so that there is more availability of office. Individuals who are younger are able to get into the sphere and that then allows for them to be able to actually affect the policies that they get there. But two, individuals who are already in office lose their connections because they aren't able to just stay with these same old people who they've been with for 40 years from from being a senator, to being a congressman, to being a president. Because these systems of power are broken down, we are exclusively able to make individuals more likely to change their mind. What is the implication of this? We are the only side which is able to get the critical mass which is required for us to get progressive politics. Even if they can nebulously prove that there is a representative minority. Like in Turkey, there's gay people who want to have rights. They don't actually prove to us why they didn't get the critical mass, which means that government is actively going to listen to these people. You only get that on outside of the house. What are the implications of this? We are able to get rights for the trans people, rights for the black people, rights for the women. These are the individuals who are the most important. How do you weigh this clash? We weigh this clash on a few things. One, on vulnerability. We tell that the individuals who are in the minority are the most vulnerable people. We tell that when these individuals are not catered for, it is so, so horrible. We think on this side of the house, these individuals are never going to get catered for. But second, we tell that the young people in this state, who have been systematically disenfranchised from the political system, are furthermore the individuals who ought to be valued the most because they have no bearing within the system, we think we ought to allow them to have the chance. Secondly, we weigh this on likelihood. Even if there is a chance of them getting progressive politics on this side of the house, we think it is more likely on our side of the house. So we think it is empirically better for us to get this progressive politics because it is something which helps these minorities. But finally, we weigh it on scale of impact. The major question in this debate is that individuals lose choice. I ironically don't understand why this is so important when they already can see that government doesn't let you vote for criminals, doesn't let you vote for 18 year olds. So if individuals marginally lose a little bit of choice, wouldn't it give them much less impact than trans people actively being denied the right to live, the right to be who they want to be? Wouldn't they have to contend with that, that they actually weigh these impacts out?"

              "text": "Second question in this debate, and the major tend to hear on the democratic principle or the right to choice, what do we get from them? Tell us that the limiting of the age is something which is so, so bad and it's against democracy because people aren't able to vote for who they want to. What are the major flaws of this argument? One, we found that the principle is inherently flawed when they concede to the fact that 18-year-olds should not run for government. Therefore, even if a 12-year-old has 150 IQ, they can't run. So then the individuals still lose choice on either side of the house. So at best, it is a wash. Secondly, we already proved that this is a principle which can be limited. In their second speech, they can see this is not an absolute principle. I don't understand why they are just devaluing a non-absolute principle to this extent. We tried at a point in time to be able to prove that the removal of the addition of this age cap is going to have positive practical impacts, as we have said in the statement that this lower limit age cap of 18 year olds also has these same positive impacts and this then negates the principle because the principle is only contingent on the fact that this democratic process is then going to help represent the people, and at a point in time when people aren't happy on this set of dollars, we don't think we even value this choice. So we didn't know that was a major issue there. But thirdly, even if they do win on this clash, it is such a marginal wind panel. Like, yes, maybe 20 million people above the age of 60. There's probably 50 million people who are below the age of 60, because that's just how the world structure balances. There always will be more young people than old people. So the choice that they get is marginally more. But we think that on our side of the house, individuals who are young, a systematic disenfranchised from the system, they don't even run for politics on their side of the house. So basically individuals get that less choice on either side of the house. Within that, it is extremely important, you ought to value the first clash over the second. Final closing remarks on this like, extraneous clash about the idea of accountability in politics. What did we tell? We told that individuals distanced from the political parties. When individuals were being funded in Gaza, we said that the Democratic Party says, no, no, no, no, no, it was Biden who was doing that, not me. So fair and fine, as they said, Biden gets held accountable, but individuals who are really pulling the strings behind them, which are very unlikely to have been Biden, don't get held accountable. The only response here is that people really do get held accountable. But as they've literally told us, Biden is the one who stopped running for the election, even though it was the decision of the entire Democratic Party to put this policy into place. We think that that is what scapegoating is. We think that that is bad. On side opposition, we protect the minorities. We protect the valuable choice. We are the winning side. We are proud. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Can I speak at this volume?"

Insofar as the threshold of cognitive decline has not been definitively proven, it is on the idea of we ought to facilitate choice as much as possible, we ought not to bar this significant constituency from being able to run from office, be able to exercise their fundamental right. But finally, note how we already dealt with this on our side of the house. It was that people who are severely cognitively declined are unlikely to run or hold office anyway.

Governments are no longer likely to protect people on the ground. What did we tell you? We told you first politicians will become more short-termist when they recognize that their future career in politics is cut short. That is to say that when you are like a 20 something or 30 something working as like as a representative that if you recognize that your future is unlikely to be like as unlike to manifest you're more likely to do things like push for overspending now or do you prioritize climate change their only response to this were misunderstandings this is not about this is not about like one political one presidential term or two presidential terms. This is about your long-term political career as an individual. The second response they have is that you actually need the short-term to have the long-term. This presumes that there's no trade-off between the short-term and the long-term. Obviously, there is. Taking out too much debt right now means your country suffers from debt crises in the future. But that is precisely what short-termist politicians are likely to push for because they want to satisfy their constituency now and they want to get re-elected now. The problem is that this means that you come at a long-term cost because you no longer care about what the country or what your party is going to be like after you turn 60 insofar as you can no longer be in politics. But the second impact we brought to you is that regulators and politicians are more likely to exit into the private sector at the age of 60. This is because many people at the age of 60 still want to work. This means that if you can no longer work in politics, your most lucrative option then is moving to the private sector. This is bad for your incentives because it means that under the revolving door, you push for weaker regulations. They have no responsibilities. The impacts of this should not be understated. This is about policy for everyone, about the economic conditions, about the very minorities and women that they care about. It's about the strength to push for climate policies, strength to reduce debt in exchange for higher interest rates now. This is independently round-winning. We've proven, too, that governments on the other side of the house is far more likely to have short-term incentives, and this is really, really bad. Before I move"

              "text": "Their argument, disproportionate representation of older people. They have three broad mechanisms, and I'll rebut to each of them in turn. Firstly, that older people are in a different bubble and thus do not understand young people. I want to note, as Nicole already flagged you, the representation of ages among candidates who run is not what explicitly matters in agenda setting. It is what they believe voters want. It is what is electorally determinative, what is widely discussed within society, that affects agenda setting. Empirically, if you had too many old people only passing policies about, like, pensions, for instance, then not many people would want to vote for these. Then, like, proportionally, fewer people are going to vote for these people. That means you have to understand the implicitly what your voters actually want. So, if there is a significant constituency that cares about gay rights or trans healthcare, and note how these social issues are often electorally determinative, sorry, cancer, because it is fundamental to their self-identity, then it can swing their vote one way or the other. But the more and more niche that this subset goes, then the less likely it is that you're going to get change on either side of your house. That means that things that are electorally determinative and important to young people are still going to be appealed to because they are a significant amount of the population. The second thing, and to the extent that older people do have an experiential gap with younger people vis-a-vis things like technology, these are obviously not, they're obviously not the sole determiners. They work with things like technocrats or advisors or experts. The second mechanism they have is that young people select out of the presidency. First, I want to note, the strategic flaw here is that they take one position and extrapolate that to all public office positions. Obviously, there are more countries in this debate than just the U.S. presidency. In many places, they have the parliamentary system. They have representatives, and the representative ages are likely to be far, far lower. In Hong Kong, for instance, the average age of our equivalent representatives is around like 30. The reason for this is quite simple. It's because when you are relatively younger, you tend to be more motivated, you tend to be more optimistic, maybe you're fresh out of college, you want to change the world. But secondly, there are many districts that are largely constituted by younger liberals who are more likely to vote for younger people that represent their own district. That means there are many options available to younger people to hold public office. These just tend to be more on the municipal level or the representative level. As you then rise up the political sphere and as you age, then there tend to be increasing qualifications. This is not necessarily bad because the amount of power that you're afforded at each step of the way increases, meaning that you are more likely to need to have qualifications or have an illustrious career. This is not a bad thing. This just means that we can get more and more qualified politicians. But this also does not specifically bar out younger politicians from becoming president. Look at Bukele, for example, in El Salvador. He's extremely, extremely young. But finally, Nicole Split actually flips all of their arguments"

This means you are more able to think about radical change. You're more able to appeal to a smaller group, a smaller niche group that the rest of your party might not care about. When you're younger, you're then more likely to conform to the status quo. This flips the incentives on their side of the house. The final mechanism they have under this is the idea that you have connections. Look, we do not deny that having connections or having a long and illustrious career will get you connections. This is never the point. The point was, first, it's unclear why this is going to be the tipping point. It is unclear why knowing one or two more people within the White House, for instance,"

That the fact that when you work in politics over a long period of time, that you make friends, that you network with people, it's not unclear why this is unjust and why this is an illegitimate form of democracy. Contrast this then to the relatively young, for instance, RFK Jr., who is young but has lots of connections, largely based on who he is and familial connections, rather than actually working in politics for a long period of time. But at the bottom, I also want to then flag the implications of Nicole's POI here. If their analysis holds true, that older people just have an advantage over younger people, all it proves is that there are some advantages. They never proved that the advantage was so severe that you have to cut it off, and if you cut it off, you cut it off at the threshold of 60+. Presumably, Kamala Harris is still going to have an advantage over politicians who are like 30-something, so they never were able to fulfill democracy on their side of the house. What does this mean at the end of the day?"

Finally then, I'm going to flag this idea of democratic choice, this idea of accountability. They drop this in a second and then they bring it back. I want to note again, it's unclear why this sense of accountability and being able to scapegoat is exclusive to you being 60 plus. Scapegoating and moving away from candidates who make bad decisions is just a common political tactic. They were never able to impact us and they were never able to prove the core missing mechanism at the end of the day, we not only fulfilled democracy far more because we were able to expand the choices of people who can run we were able to have people feel represented that 20% of the population feels like they can vote but finally, that we get better governance on our side because politicians are more likely to look to the long term because they want to stay within politics for a long period of time, so they pass policies that benefit everyone on the ground."

Lastly, quickly now on the principle clash. Look, our claim was that there is a very, very high bar for you to restrict democratic choice. Being literally a child is obviously a reasonable cognitive limit, but most people at 60 are still capable and can be weeded out if they are. Let's weigh this on certainty, right? Think it is far more certain that you are cognitively less capable at 18 or 20 than you would be if you were 60. If this is the case, the tests are sufficient to check this.

A, it needs a high level of mental stability and resilience. Why is this true? It involves a lot of work, both during the campaign and when you're elected, i.e. you wake up at 5 to take up polls or you go to different places to speak to different dignitaries. B, it requires a lot of on-the-go work, i.e. air travel. It requires you to have a lot of movements. It requires you to do a lot of work specifically to help your country. C, we do agree to some extent that it requires a lot of experience, but the most individuals who enter office normally enter office when they are at a young age and normally monopolize the office at the end of the day. But also, D, it often takes a mental toll on those individuals. What it implies is that these people who enter these offices need to be at their highest peak in order to understand and in order to be able to cope with this mental toll due to the a little work that is done why is this characterization important it shows you that these individuals to be elected need to have some level of stability to handle the process due to the"

That is to say, right now in the United States of America, 53% of the population of 65 years old are individuals who have dementia. These are people who forget a lot. These are individuals who do not literally remember a lot of things that they necessarily do. But also, secondly, we think that the reason why this is happening is because of the massive workload that these individuals do during their young ages. Why? Because of their increased need to get rich, but also secondly, their need to compete within the society and to become better within that sort of society. But also thirdly, it's just an account of what our model looks like. Two things. One, the constitution of these countries will put laws that prohibit people above the age of 60 to run for office. This looks like places like MPs, this looks like presidential posts, this looks like mayoral posts. But also secondly, even if the only individuals that we are allowing to run for office are below the age of 60, it doesn't change the political process. That is to say, it is a merit-based process. You bring your CVs, you bring your certificates, we know instances. That means the comparative within this debate is simple. Side opposition has to defend a world where there is no upper-edge limit, i.e. you have to defend status quo within Russia, within Uganda, within countries like the United States of America. I'll take your point of information. The fact that he stepped down, the mere speculation that he had with the world's dementia, showing there were already checks and balances in place, you have to defend him. The fact that he stepped down because he had dementia, it shows that that is a problem that individuals about the age of 60 have, and that is a problem that cannot be put in the political system because we need stable individuals within the political system.

              "text": "Then in 2006, individuals didn't want abortion. Three things then to note on this argument. One, the narrative in young people's minds is that older individuals cannot understand their needs in the vast majority of instances, because in most instances, when young people want certain policies, older leaders do not cater for them within all instances, because they are catering for the bigger people who are capitalistic, who have money, who benefit them within their elections. Secondly, they don't relate to them in a personal level, because these are people who are not of their age and they don't understand their demands also sadly due to the media narrative that has been preached for example in the us they say that joe biden is sleepy joe and that the media paints these individuals as very old and incapable of the office the implication of this is that even if opposition proves that these people are fit to run to office to some extent it still cannot work because young people don't like them. The larger percentage of the society is that young people do not accept them within society. What are the impacts within this event? One, we think that one of the major factors of low voter turnout is because people do not literally have choices because of the monopoly that older individuals create because the only option they have to go to is either an 82 year old dementia person or a 70 year old dementia person, right? But also secondly, we think that these young individuals do not give public approval to these leaders because these leaders have already been shamed on social media or these leaders don't do the things that they necessarily want. This means that they won't give even respect to the policies that these leaders necessarily pass. But also, secondly, we think that it is very negatively impactful to the young who want to run for office. Two mechanisms as to why this is true. One, we think that older people tend to monopolize politics using the power that they have already accumulated. Notice that they have a lot of money already. Notice that they can carry out massive lobbying techniques to actually take this power. But also secondly, we think that in many countries they can use things like corruption, right? Because they have a huge significant power that already exists that they have already accumulated. But also finally, we see that in most countries, they actually arrest political opponents in the vast majority of these instances. The impact of this is twofold. One, young people are demotivated to run for these offices. That is why we have that huge threshold of all individuals within office. But also secondly, they don't even want to vote because they don't see their representation to vote. Why are young people specifically important in this debate? One, we think that they constitute the most population within society. That is to say, there are over 50% of individuals in society that we've got an active obligation to protect them. No, but also secondly, we think that most of our policies affect them more because they are going to live longer in the vast majority of instances. So we think that they would literally affect those individuals more. The comparative on our side of the house is that we think that we have more engagement in politics. Why? Because we give these young individuals a chance to be in politics and to actively engage in this politics. This is important because of four things. One, because we get more political obedience because you have given them some sort of representation, but also secondly, they get to buy into the legitimacy of these leaders because these leaders can relate to them and these leaders are their head brackets. Three, there is a more diverse perspective in the vast majority of businesses because we've gotten a diversity of leaders existing, but also finally, just on principle, we get more numbers within our side of the House to participate within elections and we think these are the things that democracies want to uphold because they want to uphold representation."

We think that many leaders six years and above find difficulty in performing essential tasks. Just like where you have to walk to different countries, just like where you have to attend a lot of meetings. But also secondly, right, we think that there is a tendency for you to lose respect among the people, among the international community, because of the sorts of policies that you necessarily pass, but also secondly, because of the sorts of policies that you necessarily pass within the society, but also because of you not being able to actually do what the people want in the vast majority of instances, but also because of you not being able to represent the younger generation because you want to benefit some sort of capitalists that always fund your election. But if it's our side of the house, then necessarily it becomes better because, one, we have more individuals participating within these sorts of elections because we have included the youth, but also, secondly, we get more representation of these individuals who literally are affected the most by these sorts of policies but also finally we have a sort of benefit to the society.

              "text": "important in politics. Firstly, what's our stance? Four things. One, we agree that we defend the CS poll, that there's no upper age limit for people running for office. Secondly, this debate is not about choosing between an 80-year-old dementia politician or a 70-year-old dementia politician. Give me one example of an election that that actually happens. Rather, we stand behind mechanisms to ensure the wellbeing of people running for office. This looks like health checks being publicly released. But also, regardless of this, there's a strong incentive for the public and the poor not to support candidates with health issues running. See Biden in the US stepping down after losing support from Obama and after getting massive media scrutiny. But third, notice that we live in the 21st century and 60-year-old just isn't that old. This clashes with the assumption when they say, oh, but more people have dementia. Is this really true? I don't think it's true. For example, there are more improvements in medical technology, so people are generally quite healthy when they reach 60. Or for example, increased quality of life means that people realize that things like benzene is really dangerous or mercury is really dangerous, so they stay away from it. People are generally more healthier and less likely to get dementia. Fourthly, proposition needs support. for example, from local elections, electing councillors, regional or provincial governments, all the way up to national level when people run for prime minister or president. Crucially, they restrict the right for voters to pick candidates aged about 60, even if they're completely capable or healthy. That's the burden that they fail to meet in their first speech. Some responses. I think a big push from proposition is that it gets better politics. And the reason seems to be that there is a really bad optics for old people. They gave me two reasons. One, they say old people mainly cater to rich people under a system of capitalism. Guys, unfortunately, that is really uncomparative. Because if parties want to get, for example, things like political funding, they somewhat need to cater to large donors on either side of the house, which young politicians to large donors on either side of the house, which young politicians probably still do that on their side of the house. Secondly, you talk about health, I think I read that out and settled. The second claim they make is that old people monopolize politics. I think that might be true in some countries, but it never proved to us what the harm is. Crucially, old politicians still have a massive incentive to cater to younger voter blocs because they simply want to get more votes. If it is true that young people are over 50% of the electorate, then surely there's a massive incentive for politicians to cater to them anyway. The last thing I have to give you is that, well, but policies affect young people for a longer time. Guys, that's just a fact that young people live longer. But the fact that we still care about things like pensions or things like retirement benefits, even if old people are about to die soon, doesn't mean that old people just doesn't matter in politics. I don't think that wing is genuine in this debate. Having that said, I want to talk about my"

              "text": "first argument, about the principle of defending choice in democracy. The first observation I want to make is that they massively restrict choice for voters and the electorate. The reason for this is because the purpose of democracy is to aggregate people's opinion. This means that people should be allowed to pick and choose who they think can best represent them. Even if it is someone that may not be objectively good for side proposition, it is wrong for them to implement a blanket policy or a blanket claim that says as long as you're above 60, you're incapable. You're right that some people above 60 may have dementia, but also a lot of other people who are above 60 might be people who are healthy, might be people who are experienced, might be people who actually know the local communities the best. Those people also ruled out on their side of the house. Our argument doesn't assume whether old people are good or not. It simply tells you that people, the electorate, should be allowed the choice to choose those people in the very first place. Similarly, even if I, for example, if I believe Trump can best represent me, I should be allowed to vote for them. You can't say that's the wrong decision in any case. Likewise with this motion. This debate is about, for example, a 65-year-old politician who knows about the community that has now bought from running for the election on their side of the house. There is strict choice for people. We think that's a fundamental violation of the principles of democracy. The second observation is that they violate the principle for people running for office themselves. The essential part of democracy is that you should be allowed to run for office and we respect pretty much a lot of rights. Yes, there might be limitations to people's freedom and democracy, but as long as, for example, you actually create good or provide more options for people, we generally believe that people are able to make the best decisions for themselves. Because people know what they want, the governments do not. Governments have one narrow conception of what people want, whereas different people know what they individually want. We think that's far better on our side. Think about this. Outside politics, if an old person gets rejected from a job, this will be seen as discrimination. We think this also applies to politics. There isn't a direct correlation between age and capability. We think they make that false characterization, they lose this debate. But finally, notice there's a high barrier to entry. For example, in liberal democracies, like previously convicted people can still run for election. And the reason why this is good is because we think that people should be allowed to pick for themselves. And the impact of this is that there isn't a wrong answer in democracies reading that people should be allowed to pick for themselves. And the impact of this is that there isn't a wrong answer in democracies. We think that people should be allowed to choose based on what they want. Go. But what is this by incompetent politicians? Do you practice choices which put you fundamentally that there's a massive negative impact on those bad politicians? No, no. One, the purpose of a principle is that it doesn't fall into that trap. But secondly, that just is impractical. You can't just rehash your argument and make that a POI, but that's actually"

The thesis of this argument is that having candidates above the age of 60 is crucial because they bring unique benefits. It is not enough for a proposition to simply assert that all people equals too bad. The first thing I want to do, then, is to set up a clear comparative in this debate. On opposition, we allow parties who think will win the election, i.e. who the public generally likes pretty much, to run for election. On proposition, they create this narrative if the aging is bad for politics. And notice, their policy doesn't only affect people who are 60 or above, their policy also affects people who are, for example, 40 or 50 years old. Those people will not be able to run for elections on their side. Why is this the case? Because this creates a massive chilling effect on their side of the house. Think about this. If I'm a party, and I want to, for example, push for a candidate that's 40 or 50 years old, the reason why those people cannot run for election on their side of the house anymore is because they can't, for example, represent the party in many elections. This means that they might be right, in order for any of their benefits to stand, they need to predominantly prioritize people who are, for example, 20, 30 years old. We're going to explain to you why this is harmful. So what do you think are the unique benefits of getting people who are, for example,"

              "text": "The reason for this is because those people have a long political career. For example, being a shadow councillor, for example, they are interacting with the local community, they have experiences in setting up bipartisan deals. But even if you are outside, for example, in other careers, for example, after you have led a trade union and you want to speak for workers in the politics, or for example, if you are a teacher and you want to craft education policies, those things just generally give you life experience. And notice, this is quite important, and especially in post-conflict states. For example, Nelson Mandela in South Africa, who have been through the turmoil themselves, they truly understand the struggles, whereas young people can say, I relate to you, but people on the grounds don't believe they actually have undergone those things and actually don't connect with them. But secondly, the vast majority of political positions are people in local careers. Most politicians aren't people who are running for president. And therefore, on a local level, people who are above the 60, oftentimes the vast majority of people who want to represent people on a local level. The reason for this is because those people are oftentimes more low-paid, local jobs are oftentimes more time-consuming, so people above 60 oftentimes are people who have retired. They have this unique experience. For example, they have seen how the area has evolved, which means that, for example, when they're running a planning commission, they can decide whether they want to shop to replace the park or a school that actually benefits the local community. They have a much larger vested interest in their local community. The impact is actually very simple. People simply make better policies on our side of the house with experience. They deal with disagreements externally, so they actually get more support and engagement in politics, but they also deal with disagreements within the policy better. This is important because you lead the cabinet better on their side of the house. They get more support and engagement in politics, but it also deals with disagreements within the party better. This is important because you need a cabinet better on their side of the house to get more things like stalemates, no policies passed, very proud to do it."

We think on our side of the house, there is a perfect spot, a perfect balance of age, wisdom and experience, a surety that you're going to get the best possible version of a leader that possibly can in society. Two reasons this is important. One, there's a mandate to encourage the utilization of this particular age bracket. To encourage people to utilize this mental sweet spot where there's no chance of them having a decreased mindset. But two, OPE can't come and argue the fact that apparently old people have the basic incentive to lead in specific societies. Why? The youth also engage in them. A 40-year-old man has lived in society for 40 years. He sees these problems, he experiences them, and as a result, he's incentivized to fight against them.

We tell you what, freedom of choice is based on complete autonomy and understanding of what a particular system looks like. What do I mean by this? If an election doesn't have full disclosure, why do most elections not have full disclosure? We think people inherently subjectively have an idea that older people tend to be the smartest in society, even culturally, traditionally, and wonder. People tend to believe old people can't actually lead in specific dialects. And we think this is capitalized by people. They have limited exposure of specific candidates, or even if they do expose them, they control their tactics, like writing for them their speeches, or helping them, telling them how to behave in specific cases of status quo. A good example would be the United States election, which directly engages with the idea that there are checks and balances in society. What if that specific debate, where we found out Biden was practically a dementia patient, never happened? Or even worse, what if it happened while he was in office? Why are you giving nuclear codes to somebody who's at risk of specific problems when there are younger people who can be taught, who can be cultured by a system to come forward and lead in them? Obama was 44 when he came into power with strong democratic principles. Do they want to argue that a 40-year-old man is not fully capable of understanding the dynamics of society and thus fully engaging with them at any given scenario? We feel as though they do not have accountability because they're not full disclosure of whatever systems are in any given state. And this is the most important tool to conclude engagement. One, if you have value, why not actualize it at a younger age? If Biden has had constant value, even as a president, he ran at a younger age. Why not utilize your value at a younger stage when you're better capable of assigning, better capable of working towards your policies? And this is important for two reasons. One, you're not letting down your party and the systems who've elected you. But two, you're not letting down the people you're able of handling. Biden has been a Democrat for a long time. The policies he's passing now are policies he could have passed 20 years ago, are policies he could have passed down to someone else to end up teaching them. But two, why do you run the risk? Why not mitigate the harms? Why ignore the fact that it's an internationally well-known fact that an older person is less likely to be the best possible leader in society? We feel as though there's no speciality of one given individual, but there's a strong idea of ideas and concepts that work in basic society, and those are the grounds on which you should capitalize."

And we think whatever choice people choose to make, when it's democratic, we think that is a legitimate choice for them to make. But also, we think it is specifically about identity politics. It's about trust. It's about if you, as a person in post-apartheid South Africa, look at Nelson Mandela and you go, that is the man I trust. I don't want a younger candidate who might supposedly support the same policies. I want this man who has fought for my rights for the last 20 or 30 years. We say that is a legitimate choice to make. Their only response is that, well, you might not have perfect information throughout an electoral process. Like, sure, this might be the case, but this is true on either side.

Two responses that takes us out of the debate. First, panel, I just think this characterisation is a little bit disingenuous. You probably know a 60-year-old, like maybe your parents are. Like, we just think this is well below the state pension age in most places. disingenuous. You probably know a 60 year old, like maybe your parents are. We just think this is well below the state pension age in most places. People all around the world work and demand corporate jobs at this age. Many politicians do manage to be physically and mentally capable, like C. Merkel, Pelosi, even Joe Biden during his first term in office galvanised Democrats against Trump, pulled America out of a recession. We do not think that these politicians are necessarily all senile. We don't think it was fair for them to claim that everyone over the age of 60 is coming down with dementia. But second, even if you do buy this slightly implausible claim that the majority of people over 60 are suffering from cognitive decline, or that they'll struggle with the taxing walk from their seat at the UN to the podium, these sick, senile, incapable individuals are selected out on either side to the podium. These sick, senile, incapable individuals are selected out on either side of the House. So Joe Biden stepped out because he knew that people wouldn't vote for them. Because if you're dying, you probably want to spend more time with your family because you probably don't want your long-term reputation as a politician to be shocked by the fact that you collapse on the way to your speech at the UN. So we think these individuals do self-select out of the process under our side of the House. No, thank you. For that reason, this characterisation just wasn't really fair. The only response in second is, well, why would you risk it? Because we just do not think that on a principled level, it is fair to say, because of this tiny minimal risk that you might be diagnosed with dementia during your term in office, you shouldn't be allowed to run at all. You might as well say that about a female politician. Hey guys, she might get pregnant, she might be on her period. Maybe we just shouldn't risk it. We don't think this is a fair reason to say that someone literally should not be allowed to run."

They claim that we want more young people in politics and that we only get this under their side of the house. They gave two lines of analysis here. The first, they said that the monopoly on power that older people have was used to push young people out of politics. First, as Alex told you, we just don't think this is a plausible characterisation of why older people actually stay in politics. More likely, we think it's because voters positively identified them, because people in post-apartheid South Africa liked Mandela, because people trusted in Biden, because they associated him with the stability and the trust of the Obama regime that meant that they wanted to turn out to vote for him. But second, it doesn't really engage with who gets in in their ruts because on either side of the house, the more powerful people do get into politics. But we would prefer that those more powerful people are those who have earned donors and delegate supports from their long careers in political office, not those who have earned them from being born privileged from climbing the greasy pole at a young age. That is who they had to stand behind getting jobs in their world, and they never dealt with this characterisation. Second, they said that the optics of having lots of older people in politics tell young people that politics isn't for them. But this is taken out by their own second speech argument on backlash. Because if it is true that young people get really upset when they see that everyone in politics is really, really old, I as a young person probably then do the AOC thing and I say, hey, I should stand, I should represent young people, I should also go into politics too. So by their own logic panel, that argument is taken out of this debate. But finally, we just challenge the premise that young people are necessarily better. Because Alex explained to you why political experience, why life experience of having had a proper job, a family, of just meeting more people before your life climbing the greasy pole inside the political bubble makes you a better politician. Because you've earned individual trust, because you might be better at doing local policies.

We don't think that's fair. We think these people do deserve the capacity to stand up for themselves, to have their own voices politically. Having dealt with that, then, why does this create political polarisation? The first question to ask is how do we think different groups of voters react to this policy? First, on older voters, a note panel, we really don't mean that old, like your parents are possibly over 60, my parents are nearing 60, like these people feel massively rejected and disenfranchised on propositions side of the house because they've literally been told people like you do not deserve to hold office, you are too old to contribute to the democratic process, the majority of you have dementia, your voice and views need to be shut down and we will literally put laws in place to keep you out of the democratic process. Just think about how damaging this narrative is because it plays into the idea that many older people already believe in. That the young are disrespectful, ungrateful and devaluing the contributions of those who became before them. So now your slightly conservative grandparent who thinks young voters are a bit silly and arrogant for talking so much about climate change, now thinks that there is a conspiracy to devalue their voices. So they no longer think, well, I want to vote for good policies on student loans because I care about representing my grandchildren. They think, I've got to look out for myself. So they vote for the candidate who stands on the platform of I will represent old people, the 55-year-old in their world who takes that policy. But second, younger voters are now legitimising the idea that older people don't deserve political voices. So you legitimise this identity-focused narrative of, you'll be dead in 30 or 40 years, which again, probably isn't true in the current age of those who are over 60. You make that into a matter, you get political polarisation. But also, politicians no longer co-operate. You delegitimise the contributions of older people. So you no longer have Kamala Harris paying tribute to Condoleezza Rice, supporting those who came before them, passing down policies and passing down experience on their side of the house. Because we get better political representation and defend democracy, so proud to oppose."

We are unlikely to value choice if it's for, one, going to make bad policies. Secondly, be bad to the international community. But thirdly, just aren't able to handle"

The fact is that 53% of elderly people have had some kind of dementia, whether it's stage 1 dementia, whether it's Alzheimer's disease, whether it's late stage dementia. You can't argue with the fact that there's an increasing rise of dementia, increasing rise of people who are old and are facing these kinds of things. What that means is two things. One is that you can't argue that there's a majority of politicians who enter when either maybe they are at stage one dementia, or maybe it's just dementia, but they haven't yet experienced it and it hasn't come out. But secondly, it shows that dementia is one likely topic on their side. Before I go into that classroom, I'll take your point."

I think the main push on our side and the intuition pump, which was particularly important and why we're in this debate, is the idea of optics. Why is this true? Even in an ops-based case scenario, whereby they're able to somehow prove to you that 60-year-old people are okay, they can run for office, we still show to you that the optics of young people is significantly bad on their side through mechanisms we're putting. One, how they see old people are unable to respond office, we still show you that the optics of young people is significantly bad on their side. Three mechanisms are put in. One, how they see old people are unable to respond to their issues. Secondly, the media narrative that these people are like sloppy, these people are unfit generally to run for office. But thirdly, how they feel like these people don't relate to these issues. Even when a 60-year-old person is at the peak of his ability, even when you can prove to me that a 75-year-old is at the best mental state, it doesn't take away the optics that young people have, that old people, that people who are 60 and above are unfit to run for office. There are two impacts which come with that. One, it means that they are unlikely to engage in the voting process because they say, hey,"

But secondly, it means you're having a general lack of approval to whatever leader you put into power. It means that whether you put in Biden or Trump, whether you put in a 62-year-old or a 72-year-old, there's going to be little approval, there's going to be backlash on media. That's why you have things like Sleepy Joe. This is literally the President of the United States, but there's no public approval simply because he's too old, or simply because there's a bad narrative around him that he's unfit for office. The second thing in this particular clash that we particularly pushed is the whole idea of the election process itself. We gave you three mechanisms. One is the idea of monopolizing politics. Secondly is the tendency of corruption among people who are older. But thirdly, the mere fact that because they are older, it means they have gotten into the system, it means they are able to manipulate the system, it means they are able to detain younger politicians. For example, in countries like Uganda, where younger politicians are detained because President Museveni, who is 82 years old, doesn't want threats to his political party. We proved to you that younger people are more likely to engage in a political process in 2.1. Voting, they are more likely to vote when you have younger candidates. But secondly, they are more likely to engage in a political process in 2.1 voting they are more likely to vote when you have younger candidates but secondly they're more likely they themselves to run for office because they see they actually have a chance because they are they are not subject to like lobbying from big older officials but secondly they are unlikely to be having this kind of corruption tendencies if I go into this second and final thing I'll take your point. Different age groups have different optics. For example, young people may have the optics of lack of experience, so optics isn't people judging. Here is where experience doesn't fall into this debate. Right? Ms. Crack-Toy's room actually takes off experience because she proves to you right from minute one that most people who enter politics are people who start at a young age. You start at 25 years old as an attorney or someone who is in a law office. You build your way 15 years later. You have experience. You're a 40-year-old man. You are still at the highest peak of cognitive ability,"

Third final clash is about cognitive decline. We had two pushes here. Firstly, Rima's characterization of what is needed for politicians. She tells me three things. One is mental stability to handle a lot of pressure. Our push was simple. We say that there is a struggle of older people to handle these things, essential tasks, like going from country to country all the time, doing multiple tasks simultaneously. We tell you because of two reasons. One is because they generally have weaker, they're generally weaker, they're generally in decline, but they have passed that age where they are at the tip of their cognitive ability. We tell you that when people are in decline, they are unlikely the tip of their cognitive ability. We tell you that when people in the community decline, they are unlikely to make better policies,"

We, conversely, didn't have to stand by a world where all politicians were over the age of 60. We had to stand behind the world where people could choose based on their own optics, based on their own subjective perceptions, which is literally the way that a democracy works, who they want to have in power. So we do have young people on our side of the house, such as Charlotte Owens in the UK. The difference is that they're not there just because they're a young person and just because Uganda feel like young people only want to vote for other young people. They're there on merit.

What we tell you is that older people feel rejected on their side, that discourse is poisoned, and that politicians delegitimise older politicians' experience by saying that you're too old, they argue amongst each other, whereas on our side of the House you might take on a younger politician as a mentee on their side of the House. Politics and discourse is bitter. This alone can probably win the debate. Because when there is more infighting, when policymaking gets far worse, because running for the primary on their side of the House is beset with conflict. Instead of choosing the best candidate, the candidate that you believe can best appeal to people on the ground with the best policies, a looming consideration is always age. It's always for the 45-year-old, well, you're almost 60, you're probably not going to stand and serve the party for a long time, so we don't want you. At that point, note this also takes out that only mitigation to our principle on choice, which is we restrict choice if bad decisions are made.

We think that if you do have dementia and you feel like you can't take on the burden, if you don't want to be under the scrutiny of people trying to get your medical records, you're probably not going to apply for that position in the first place. They say that politicians don't freely disclose their records, but firstly, note that Biden stepped down because of speculation. He didn't even need to disclose his records. Secondly, there is so much scrutiny on these politicians when they're there in the first place. Let's compare this to their claim of career politicians tend to monopolise politics and engage in corruption. I mean, the first thing to note is that this is just an assertion. Often politicians who've been there for a long time still do want to build their legacy and they're not always going to engage in things like corruption and the entrenchment of power. But secondly, if this isn't the case, they are still likely to be there in politics, a presence in politics, who's bankrolling younger politicians as they say you can pass on advice to younger politicians. But at that point, when they aren't the one actually running for office, when they aren't the Biden who's going to be running your country, you don't get the same level of scrutiny trying to get them to disclose their medical records. You just get their influence in a far more insidious way. And so the domination of politics by people with dementia still occurs only in a far worse way under their side of the house,"

              "text": "older politicians this was an issue that's incredibly important to a lot of young people but secondly note that often the only way of actually getting younger people of people of lower class backgrounds for example into politics is allowing them to have a long career and a long trajectory in politics. Because if you do come from a lower class background, you can't suddenly drift into politics at the age of 60 like Trump did. You have to work your way up. You have to firstly be a chief of staff. You have to firstly work on polling. You can't run like before the age of 60. And what they do essentially is nip the talent in the bud of these people. These people could only get into senior offices when they had the opportunity to develop their talent to rise up the ranks in politics and I think getting these people into politics actually increases turnout disrupting the perception of politics as a sphere that's actually very incredibly removed from people. But note also the material that we brought you in class that hasn't got engagement. It's incredibly important, especially in post-conflict states, to have experience and knowledge and understanding of something that's happened in the history of your nation. And it's really important also when you have other careers, when you are able to cross-apply this knowledge and you have had a long track record. The impacts of this were really important. Firstly, you know how to break deadlocks when you're in politics. Policies are more likely to get passed in the first place. But secondly, you also have legitimacy and respect. You are more likely to get passed in the first place. But secondly, you also have legitimacy and respect. You are more likely to run a better government, and so older people are incredibly valued in politics. They shut them out. Yes? If you can't put sentences together, you're probably not going to get elected, because the way people elect you is based on the kind of interviews you engage with, the campaigns you engage with. You can't form sentences. You're not going to do very well. Second thing, then, is improved engagement of young people. They essentially say that on their side, they get young people running in elections and young people engaging in elections. A couple of responses here. Firstly, in many cases, as we tell you from first to no response, often young people just aren't going to stand for elections on their side. For example, municipal elections, smaller level elections. This is because these are lower paid roles, they don't have much prestige, and people who are young people who need to make money just can't engage them in the first place. So on their side in these elections, you just have a smaller candidate pool, you have a lower quality of decision making and candidate quality, and that's what actually makes people, both young and old, stop engaging in elections in the first place. But secondly, if trust is actually affected by age, you probably don't vote as a young person for an old candidate. And in most systems, if one party chooses an old person to run, for instance, Chabon in Mexico, the other party is probably going to pick a young person because it creates contrast, because of the fact that you're more likely to appeal to a greater voter bloc. So there probably is a young candidate for you to choose from on their side of the House. And note also that older people do have the incentive to cater to young people if their competitors are not doing so because of the fact that they do want to maximise their votes. And that's why we see politicians like Bernie Sanders, who are old, that actively do cater to young people. And thirdly, I think a track record is an incredibly good thing. You're more likely to have it if you're old. I don't look at a young person and say, I feel represented because he's also my age. I look at somebody who's actually been able in the past to get good education policy, who's actually done something for the environment. That's when I'm more likely to cast my ballot. And that's when we get improved engagement with young people."

By contrast, we told you about the people we want to go into politics, who have political experience, who have life experience, who haven't just spent their entire youth climbing the greasy pole so that they could achieve political success in the top job before they turn 60. Rather, we support the individuals who've had careers in life experience before that. We told you about personal trust. We told you often they're willing to do the stuff that younger people aren't, and they take on important, valuable jobs in local government. So because we preserve voter choice and because we benefit from experience as well as youth, we are so proud to oppose."

Secondly, we tell you that in many countries, things like corruption exist. Countries like Uganda, even if it is a democracy, we tell you that corruption exists and rigging of votes exists.

One, it is not choice when individuals are coerced to voting people who already have high places in power. It is not subtle choice. But also secondly, Jesse tells you specifically in his speech, if choice is important, why don't we give children that choice to participate within these elections? Secondly, they tell us that they have checks and balances existing within their side of the house. This is still mitigated from our first speech, our second speech, and third speech, when we tell you that things like corruption literally exist within these countries. They don't give us any responses as to why this is not true. They cannot take it at that point."

They cannot take this debate at that stance. Secondly, they give us something to do with older people having an incentive to benefit the society. What do we tell you on this sort of idea? We tell you that one, all of us live in the society, we experience the bad things that happen within these societies, that gives us an incentive to work on those societies. But we still tell you that the specific thing about younger individuals is that they have a longer term stay within the society. That means that they would want to benefit the society more. And this specifically comes in my speech and Zephyr's speech, which is something that is not tackled by their side of the house."

That means, they tell us that older individuals can still feel neglected and polarized within the society. We think that the same push that they had with saying that the state has an incentive to protect younger people is the same push that we still have on our side of the house to say that the state will still want to protect these older individuals.

One, we tell you that we get more younger individuals within the political process and that is something that is good. Why? We tell you this is under two circumstances. One, they can exercise politics because we break the monopoly. That means they can engage fairly and they go against each other. But also secondly, they can get to vote because of the better optics that exist. We don't get any response as to why we actually don't have as to the voter turn up on our side of the house. Notice that this is an argument that exists from the first speech which is not responded to. That means that they cannot take this vote. Also secondly, we're telling that many leaders, 60 and above, still have problems to think. They have cognitive disabilities. That is to say, 53% of them have these disabilities. We think that they do not clearly handle this. They cannot take it. Our case was never that there are no good leaders who are 65 years and above. But our case was they have problems that infringe on their working, which we need to solve with the younger generation being able to engage within politics. We take this debate from the side.

              "text": "talk about is about how politicians get selected in the first place. Firstly, on candidate selection, usually this happens in two ways. A, when party leaders or committees decide, this looks like in the UK or New Zealand, party leaders tend to be disproportionately old, because first, the longer you've been in politics, the more clout you tend to have and the more reputation you tend to have. But secondly, you often have to be rewarded or be seen to be rewarded for your past service. This looks like how the Australian Labour Party will almost always pick Peter Dutton as their leader, or how Winston Peters will always be the New Zealand first leader in our country. No, older people are more likely to be comfortable with other older people, and this is very unfair to the young individuals. But sec B, on primary systems like in the United States, old candidates are still likely to be the ones selected because primary voters are disproportionately old because first, voting in primaries is a very high investment process because you have to pay to be a registered member of the party, but you also have to spend a lot of time to physically go to the party headquarters"

But secondly, old individuals are often single-issue voters, like concerns about pensions that are very proximate to you as an individual. And they're extremely motivated to come out and support other older individuals. But second layer, then, on the actual elections, why are old people still heavily favoured? First, they have the narrative of having experience, like not shaking the ship. And so the lack of experience will always be used to attack younger politicians, even if this isn't true. Like in 2008, Obama was heavily attacked for being too young, even though he had been a senator previously. So this is often a vicious cycle because all parties feel the need to do this. But secondly, there's often very strong name recognition for older politicians because they've been there for a lot, like, certainly in voting patterns, the most reliable block of voters are often old individuals because they have a lot of free time, because they're very motivated, because they tend to be quite wealthy and have the capacity to spend a long time in line. So why do old individuals still get represented on the outside of the house? First, we're not taking away their right to vote, and so there's still a very large electoral block. But secondly, there's still a very reliable voting base, right? So the issue in the status quo is not the old people in and of themselves, but there's far too many old individuals in power. What this means then is that on our side, we're able to cater more to young people. So why do old"

              "text": "politicians pose a political risk? The first layer to this point is the potential risk of mental incompetency, because why does being in office link to mental deterioration? Four reasons. First, there's extremely high stress, so you're responsible for an entire country of individuals or in charge of a particular ministry in your country, for example. And this puts an exorbitant amount of pressure on you as an individual. But secondly, there's a very high intellectual burden to being a politician. It's because you have to deal with very complex legal frameworks, international relationships, for example. It's a very high skill than the average job but third it's very emotionally draining because everyone hates you as a politician at least half the country probably does so you're always personally attacked for your failures policies but fourth it's very physically exhausting right this is because you have to spend a lot of hours traveling or speaking at conferences and it's just been some very long hours right so it's for example during preparation for the debate, Joe Biden spent about 15 hours a day sleeping from 8 to 11, right? It's very incredibly physically tiring on you as an individual. Why is this particularly exacerbated for old people? First, they've already deteriorated to a very large extent. They're just slower as individuals, they tire more quickly, and they take longer to make more decisions. But their metabolism is also just incredibly slow, right? But secondly, there's increased stress factors having a multiplied effect. Because if you try to run... So maybe they try to run a counter-model on political competency, but in many instances, they're actually fine when they enter office, but these extreme amounts of stress that put you in pressure actually make you even worse as you go along. So even if you do run a comparative of like political competency tests, they're not likely to work. Second layer then is how there is a lack of internal accountability within these parties. Because no one challenges these older politicians. Because firstly, there is a perception that they are more electable for stability. Because these internal politicians, as we've proved to you in set up, often have a lot of status quo bias. But secondly, in many cases, these politicians are the ones who gave you a job in the first place. If they don't want to challenge you because they either feel a debt to you or they don't want to lose their job, this looks like how Mitch McConnell will always be the leader of GOP, or at least for a very long time. That's why it's unlikely to change. What are the outcomes at this point, then? At the lowest level, there's a very big time trade-off to having very old politicians in party. This is because it takes longer to file a report draft or a bill, but you spend less time doing your job overall because you need to spend more time napping just because you're older, right? This is very reasonable because you spend a lot of time doing other things like caring for your health. This looks like needing to go see a Parkinson's expert, for example, because you're worried about your health. Also, more of your job is just delegated auto-advisors or bureaucrats. No, this is a principal harm to democracy, because if your elected official is not the one actually doing the job and representing you, it's very harmful on that front, right? But on the higher level, you're just more likely to make mistakes in general. It's almost like calling Zelensky Putin by accident. But no, this can often be far more pernicious and far more destructive when you are in charge of the country's nuclear program, but no, this can often be far more pernicious and far more destructive when you are in charge of the country's nuclear program, for example, because the stakes are really high when you have to deal with international presidents in the stage. But third, you can often be removed from politics because of your age, either because you literally die or you get incredibly sick or you just get removed by the rest of your party. And this is a huge disaster for politics because there's an extreme disruption to the political process because it now holds policy and it holds decision making when you now need to spend a lot of time selecting a new politician. And now the person elected isn't always a person who's in power, which means people often feel far more disenfranchised by the state. Before I move on, I'll take a point. Let's trust-crash the UK economy. Why does youth automatically mean"

So, A, it becomes a huge media issue. For example, Dianne Feinstein's stroke in the Senate. But B, it's often weaponised by your opposition, like Donald Trump always calling Joe Biden Sleepy Joe. But C, you have to spend a lot of time defending your own age. And this looks like how the Democrat Party puts up interviews just to make Joe Biden seem more youthful. This is a huge cost for your party. This has two harms. First, you crowd out more relevant political discussion because it's far more interesting and scandalous to just talk about your politician's age. But secondly, you waste a lot of time doing interviews and spending a lot of money trying to prove your youth that could be used instead to prove your policies. So secondly then, young people who are already less likely to vote as they don't have established voting patterns often view these politics as less proximate to them because of politicians' age. So when you see Joe Biden tripping over his feet on stage and trailing off mid-sentence, you probably don't think he's going to pass legislation that will help you. But even if they appear competent, you're still unlikely to relate to their policy platform. This looks like how Winston Peters only talks about retirement age in New Zealand. But third, we often get less new candidates when people stay in politics for a very long time. This means that A, you're more likely to vote for familiar faces, but B, there's less challenges because you don't think you're likely to win. This is very bad because new candidates often need to generate a lot of discussion about their policies because they have no other opportunity. What this means then is that, on the comparative, they're more likely to care about individual policies. What this means then is that, firstly, there are going to be more young individuals caring about politics in the first place. But secondly, the campaigns are actually focused on what actually matters in politics, insofar as democracy is about policies that help individuals I'm very proud to be here. Okay, can everyone hear me if I speak at this volume?"

We are fine with enforcing things like the age of legality, saying that only people who are over 18 or 21, depending on the laws of the nation, are able to stand, because they are unable to fill their obligations otherwise. We are also willing to support things like a capacity test to test whether politicians are truly in control of their senses and able to enact the offices in the correct manner. Notice, they try to tell us that we cannot have this if it is ineffective. I'd like to respond to that here. Our capacity tests are effective because we can do them on a regular basis. That is to say, they can be done with every yearly health check-up, meaning we are able to test when someone's cognitive ability has declined since they have been in office. They try to tell you that removing them from office is this terrifying thing. It really isn't, panel. We have a variety of methods in place for us to be able to remove politicians who are failing to meet their obligations. We have vice presidents or vice prime ministers who are able to step up in these cases. But I want a response to a few other things they try to tell you. They tell you that the nature of being a politician is inherently challenging and that leads to cognitive decline. To the extent that this is a challenging job, we think the impact that it has on people is limited insofar as they fail to meet their burden here. They are telling you exclusively about Biden, a literal 81-year-old. They are not talking to you about over 60-year-olds. The people in this round that you have to care about, that they have to justify, is limiting the ability of these people who are 61, not just those who are over 80. But what we think here is crucially, Biden literally steps down because of his age. I don't know whether this news is filtered down to the New Zealand bench yet, but they literally had to remove Biden because his age was becoming so problematic. That is to say, there already exist mechanisms for us to prevent people whose cognitive ability is in such serious decline from standing for election we don't think that their model actually solves this okay let's look"

              "text": "we're talking here about free democracies where people have alternatives to choose first argument then on democratic principled rights and how we are the side that fulfills them the thesis of this claim is that the state has significant power over your life and only by allowing for you to have control over the way in which you work at worst can this free democracy and this control of the state be justified. Why then does this right exist? We are born under the control of the state having never accepted that coercion. We have never consented to being part of the state. It is simply something we are born into. That justifies an unconstitutional imposition on our freedoms. The state owes you in return some freedom back, and the way it gives that to you is through voting, and crucially, through the ability to stand for office. They try to tell you that voting is sufficient here. That simply is not, because when you are voting, you have to be able to choose whether you are someone who could represent your preferences greater and to a better extent than any of the candidates who are currently being fielded. They limit the democratic principled rights in two ways here. One, on removing the right to stand. Voting does not guarantee that there is someone who represents your preferences who could take your position in Parliament. We think that only by allowing someone to stand can we actually enable them to access their preferences. That is to say that if I do not see anyone in the political landscape who is advocating for what I want, I ought to be able to stand up and say, well, I'll do it then. I will stand up for this person. They have to explain why they are willing to remove this ability to influence politics from these people. But two, they remove the ability for people to vote freely. Let's note the previous mechanism I've given to you applies to people over the age of 60 whose proposition limits them standing. But the second mechanism applies to literally everyone who votes in free democracies. That is to say you ought to be able to choose who best aligns with your preferences. Whether I, as an 18-year-old, choose that that person is a 76-year-old or a 25-year-old, it doesn't matter. What matters is I ought to be able to make that decision for myself. If I believe that Biden's age is an issue, I ought to be able to, as literally happened, advocate for the Democratic Party to push him out. This affects everyone in democracy. They cannot outweigh this harm. The only two cases in which we are willing to infringe upon these rights in our society is if you are, A, a minor, that is to say you cannot enact the ability of the state's office because you do not have full rights under the law, or B, you lack literal capacity, that is to say if you are literally imprisoned, you cannot run for office because you cannot be president from a jail cell. Those are the only two times when it is fair to justify these impositions. Propositions don't stand for this. But I want to weigh this principle then. The beliefs of individual people should be ultimately respected by a state which has coerced them into every choice in their life. That is to say, because we live in a world in which we have no alternative to the state that governs us, we have to be able to control the ways in which we are imposed upon. If we are unable to do this through voting and through standing in a free manner, we are imposed upon. If we are unable to do this, through voting and through standing in a free manner, we are just unable to get anything other than a coercive system. We respect choice of utility at every step of our principle of obligations. That is to say, it would be completely unjustified for us to tie someone down and inject them with dopamine, even if that was an enjoyable experience for them. We limit their ability to choose the things which they are accessing. Therefore, even if Proposition choose, these people would be better politicians. What matters here is choice. Before I move on to my second argument, I'll take a point. So if your principle is fairness in democracy, why is it fair that a majority of politicians are over the age of 50 when there is a minority of people in society? I'm going to explain in my second argument why they are the side which actually limits the number of people who are able to go into politics from alternative backgrounds. Second argument then, on the benefit of having people with life experiences in politics. The thesis of this claim is that only on opposition are we able to get people from different backgrounds, different career experiences, and different life-lived experiences in politics, creating a political landscape which is more varied and enjoyable for the people who engage in it. Two ways in which this is true."

That is why we see older politicians under the status quo. Having access to these lived experiences means we break the political bubble which encourages people to just live in the echo chamber of Westminster or the Capitol Hill. We think only by allowing people to have lived experiences are we able to actually enact the changes that people need in their day-to-day lives. We think that when you have lived experiences, you have more knowledge on the impact that you're able to make in policy. But look, this is exclusive. They might try to tell you that people are still able to have careers before they go into politics, but this is not true. If you were to have a meaningful career as a lawyer or a teacher or a doctor, you have to dedicate 20, 30, 40 years to this career. Even if they get people going into politics after having been an accountant for five years, they just have had to sacrifice a great amount of live-life experiences to get to that point and are never able to actually access the knowledge which would enable them to make the policy decisions which are the most successful but additionally here even if you have had a career that lasts for 20 plus years why are you unlikely to go into politics on their side two reasons here one on the limited benefits if you are 50 you know that seeking re-election is not worth it for you because at maximum you're going to get what two electoral cycles in politics that just isn't enough for you to be able to make the mark you would wish to but two you know that you're just unlikely to get what two electoral cycles in politics and it just isn't enough for you to be able to make the mark you would wish to. But two, you know that you're just unlikely to succeed. That is to say it often takes people a long time as they concede to work up their way in the political system, to get the name recognition, to get the notions, to get the support in order to be able to actually access politics. They lock people out of doing this by ensuring that only career politicians are able to rise up, not those who have any actual lived experiences. But two, on access for different people. When you are young, under their side, and you know you have to enter politics at this age, this means you have to come from a particular background. You need money to enter into politics for three reasons. One, you need to be able to donate to your campaign to fund it. Two, you need to have living costs for yourself to be able to survive during that campaign. And three, you need to come from a privileged background to have the connections you need to succeed. Do you know what this means it means that on their side no young people are ever able to rise up because they are just unable to get the knowledge and the know-how that they need in order to access the money and the funding and the name recognition to actually succeed in politics this is us flipping their point on youth representation because we tell you you're unable to get youth in politics when they know that they are unable to do the things which are a prerequisite to them being able to access success. The only way that working class politicians were able to rise up is because they had time to gain money and a reputation. That is to say, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were able to do things before they went into politics. That's how they were able to maintain their progressive ideology. The impacts of this are twofold. One, we get more varied politics which gives better choices for the individuals who we're engaging with. That means we have more people, say, from science backgrounds than just those from social subjects. But two, we just get greater voter engagement. That is to say, people who see they have more choices and are more willing to engage. Young people who see that young people are able to enter into it are just more willing to engage. Under their side, the alternative is career politicians, people with no experience, people who come from a privileged background, because we are the side that stands for true democracy and true representation we are so proud to oppose. Thank you. All right. Thank you. The problem with Ops' claim that the only way to get people from minority and underprivileged backgrounds into politics is when they are old"

The fact that age is the lowest hanging fruit to critique because, A, it becomes a huge media issue, but B, it's weaponized by the opposition. C, you have to spend a lot of time defending your age to your party constituents, critique because a it becomes a huge media issue but b it's weaponized by your opposition c you have to spend a lot of time defending your age to your party constituents which means you can't spend that time on talking about your policy but d also just that's what becomes the thing that people talk about it is much easier for you there is much lower barrier of entry you feel like you're able to discuss that joe biden shouldn't be in politics because of his age instead of talking about the policy that just means you just get a less informed populist voting. We cannot stand by that, because that is the thing that undermines the principal harms of democracy. But the second thing I want to say here is that young people already aren't able to choose who they vote for. They're already not engaging in that right to choose in the status quo. We told you young people are disengaged from politics. There are four reasons for this. Firstly, because they don't have already established voting patterns that they can just rely on to vote in a particular way. But secondly, because they have other concerns they view as more proximate, since politicians don't cater to them. This doesn't mean that the things that politicians are doing aren't relevant to them. They are talking about education. They are talking about climate change. But, you know, they're not framing that as the main thing that they are pushing, but it's things that they're doing behind the scenes. We think these are things that young voters do care about, because they're not framed in the main frame of mind of what these politicians are campaigning for. They get disengaged. But thirdly, because young people aren't taught enough about politics and voting processes in schools, it makes them disengage from these systems. But fourthly, we already gave you reasons as to why they're undermined for being young. This looks like not being listened to in family discussions. It looks like being told that your ideas are naive. They internalise this feeling of incompetence and feel like there's no point in me going out to vote. These are the people that are disengaged from the status quo. These are the people that undermine the principle that everyone should have the right to choose who gets put in power. And these are the people that we make room for on our side of the house. Look, the impact of more young voter turnout is not just that we get a better fulfillment of this principle of democracy. It is clear that the reason why the principle of democracy exists is to ensure the best utilitarian outcomes for everyone in the population. This is why we get things like more progressive policy when we get more young voters in because that is what young voters care about. There is a reason why politicians are able to just undermine climate change and throw those issues under the rug because old people don't care as much because they're not having to live into the future generations that are going to have to deal with its effects. It looks like old women in politics not caring about abortion rights because they're not the ones who are going to need to have abortions in the future because they're already too old. We think the comparative is when you have discourse around policy. This is incredibly important because this is what mobilizes voters. We think that insulting somebody based on their traits, based on their age, is not the kind of thing that will incentivize a person to skip a day of work, to wait hours in line to go out and vote. The only thing that will be able to do that is when you talk about policy, when you talk about"

You know, when Joe Biden calls the president of Ukraine Putin, that's really bad and turns away a lot of voters. We don't think that's the kind of thing that would signal you as unfit for politics in these capacity tests. Just because you're taking a bit longer time to do things doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be flagged as unfit for politics, but it does mean that the things that you are doing in politics aren't as good as they should be. It does mean that you're taking a longer time to push through important policy.

Because A, it disrupts policy and systems in the interim when you have to find a new person, when that person can no longer go to the meetings.

But C, because you get a lack of public trust in the system when you are showing that, look, we have put somebody into power who is now unfit, it's much better that we enforce the restriction before that person ever gets into power in the first place so we remove this kind of lack of public trust that leads to voter disengagement.

This relies on discourse points. When I refute that later, that will also deal with this. But additionally here, this just fundamentally isn't true. I want to support a level of information, like people having access to free media, as they do in democracies. We don't think this is a prerequisite, because the point is here, panel, the state has a coercive power over you, and the only way that we present that being an overstepping of their power, that they violate your freedom and impose things on you, is that you have the capacity to choose no matter who you are. We don't lock poor people out of voting because they have a lesser standard of education and therefore no less, because we say that their choice is equally legitimate. And we told you, crucially, that this infringes on two ways, neither of which they directly responded to. The first is that the capacity to be a representative is an extension of your right to vote, which is to say your right to vote is only legitimate when you could represent yourself if there wasn't someone you wanted to vote for. Represented democracy only functioned in those scenarios. And given this means that old people can no longer represent themselves, it locks them from having full access to choose who represents them. But secondly, it just removed the right to choose from everyone involved. So if you're a young person who wants someone like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren to represent you, you just can't select them at all. And this is a massive sector of the population. People over 60 panel, in fact, a growing sector of the population as we trend in the ageing population direction. And what that means is there is a huge segment from whom they absolutely remove the right to choose that capacity to represent them. This is a violation of democracy. And what this means is, even if they prove to you that democracy doesn't function perfectly, they infringe on the freedoms and democratic rights of everyone involved in that democracy. And what this means is, even if they prove to you that democracy doesn't function perfectly, they infringe on the freedoms and democratic rights of everyone involved in that democracy. And that's something we cannot stand for, because it's tantamount to a state exerting a coercive and abusive power over their citizens. But let's get into the meat of this round then."

              "text": "I just want to deal with this cognitive thing, because I think they've run a lot here, and they really shouldn't. Because, panel, this just involves in such fringe cases right they're banning over 60s but cognitive decline is happening predominantly over 75 into your 80s right for most people in these scenarios notice also these people are probably people who have access to like good health care take their vitamins you might select an old person but you probably don't select one who's like dying imminently so probably we're selecting out the people who are worse they're worse in those scenarios So I don't think they're fulfilling their burden. But also, extend this panel. This would mean stopping disabled people from standing because them using a wheelchair limited the amount of time they had to govern because it took them longer to get places. Just because they might have limited capacity in comparison to other people means we should create access for them in those scenarios to make it easier for them to govern, not remove them because they aren't the perfect version of the person that we envision. And crucially here, we're just happy to say in our worst case scenarios we have to remove these people sometimes if our cognitive test mechanisms, which we think are very effective, sometimes fail. Because we think this would happen about as often as someone, a 40-year-old would have a heart attack in office, or about as often as someone would just have an emotional break as a 40-year-old under this pressure and have to leave. So that's pretty symmetric. So I don't think third should go on with this let's move on then though and talk about what we think discourse looks like in these scenarios i think my big big push here is that politics is dominated by elderly people i'm going to take them at their very best and say elderly people tend to be the people in highest positions of power why are young people still catered to so this does panel is even if they prove to you that leaders tend to be elderly there are still policies which cater to young people and and that is very useful. And obviously there are still some young representatives, as we see under this data quo. Firstly, young people are huge social contributors, which gives them unique leverage over the government. They're people who are working, contributing to the economy. They're people who can vote with their feet, who can very frequently take to the streets. They're people who can strike from work and reduce your economic output. They're people who are active in the media. So comparative to elderly people, they exert a massive social force in society and they shift trends. But secondly, they're a vested voter base for politicians to invest in, which is to say they are a previously untapped group, which is why there's so much capital under the status quo to increase their engagement, as we've seen as a massive uptick over the last 10 years. And this is simply because if you can lock people in at 20 that's a massively useful voter base to you because they can vote for you for many many elections to come if you hemorrhage some voters at 75 ultimately that unfortunately might just stop affecting you after five or ten years and ultimately then politicians opt to then focus on young people so even at best we think this is likely to still mean that we get representation for young people. But let's contest that young people tend to be just completely locked out. Why do we think people are selected for leadership positions when they're older? We're happy to say that we select people when they're older because they've done more years in the job. They talk to you about recognition. That comes with experience, which is not exclusive to age. You could have a 50-year-old who has done it for 20 years or a 70-year-old who's only been it for one electoral cycle. This isn't exclusive to age. These mechanisms they provide are much more about experience. And we're happy to say that because we do think you should spend years as a lawyer before you become a judge because those things guarantee your levels of experience. But additionally, notice here, right, just alternatives here, like having no young people would always be electorally damaging because you'd have call-outs for lack of diversity. And all of those things mean it would be really dangerous to have the absolute domination they talk about. I'll take that. The democracy is about the balance of rights. If the most powerful people are the most call-outs, why shouldn't you restrict their ability to do that? Because you restrict them so much more than you liberate anyone. So I've just proven to you why young people have significant influence. Why in fact that influence is growing as they become more and more engaged. We see more and more young representatives because we're lobbying against this dominance. This dominance can shift at any moment. It takes young people voting with their feet, but their constitutional change harms everyone. On discourse, they try and tell you, oh, you just talk about age. This is the symptom of identity politics. They literally gave the example of Obama attacked for being young. This happens to whoever you are. You're attacked for the job you did before you went into politics. You're attacked for your age. You're attacked for other aspects of your identity. This is not exclusive to age. It's part of identity politics and it happens to everyone. Therefore, we don't think this disillusionment happens. What you do do to politics is turn away the people who have the life experience to make it meaningful. Because you simply can't have a career and then go into politics if you're going to exclude me or 60. So you're a 50-year-old doctor and you're only into one electoral cycle. You can't make a change to the health system that you saw crumbling behind you. And without that, you get entitled career politicians. So even if you get young people, they're people who play the game for the game, rather than try and make an intellectual difference. And this matters, because representation isn't necessarily good for young people if they don't cater to them, because they're not running on principle, they're running on utility. So even by their own metric, if you want people who change the structure of society, it needs to be people who have experience in those structures and for these reasons, opposition."

Note lastly, they don't actually explain to you why it's specifically harmful to, quote, coerce people into better outcomes. They only assert it to you with extreme examples. But the state often forces you into things that give you better outcomes. It looks like they make you go and do rehabilitative programs after you commit a crime. If it's okay for the state to do it in some instances, they need to explain why the state isn't able to do it in other instances.

              "text": "So let's talk then about who gets the best form of representative democracy. They bring to you a lot of material on life experience and people with different lived experience. But note firstly, it's unclear why these people are likely to get elected if establishment politicians are going to lock them out anyway. If Mitch McConnell can just lock you out because he's super old and he doesn't want teachers running for office, it doesn't really matter if you have the capacity to do so. But secondly, we think that they tell you that we're going to get only the privileged young people able to run for office under our side. But I think it is better that we have a privileged young people able to run for office under our side. But I think it is better that we have a privileged young person like Obama who is able to run for office because there's a balance between privilege and coming from a marginalised background. And when you have the double bind of being old and from a marginalised background, which means you're more likely to get turned away. Thirdly, though, they tell you that seeking re-election isn't going to be beneficial for you if you have limited time in office. You lock people out of politics who could make really good changes. Three things to note here though, firstly, one or two terms is a lot of time and in fact there probably are just term limits anyway, so if you can only be in politics for eight years it's probably fine. But secondly, we get people who are already willing to make a lot of sacrifices to be a politician, are likely to want to make this trade-off even if their career doesn't last very long. Thirdly though, we think it is good if some people only have a short time in office. If there's a deadline for how long you can stay in office, we are more incentivised to make good and lasting policy. If I know that I'm going to get turfed when I turn 60, it doesn't matter if I pass a controversial healthcare reform because people can't get rid of me. We think that's a good benefit insofar as we can pass more sweeping change, more progressive policy, and it's likely to be progressive given that we're going to attract more young voters. No, lastly, they just kind of assert to you that young voters have an increasing amount of power because they're a, quote, previously untapped group. It's unclear why this is true. We don't see this happening in the status quo. If young people are so powerful, why are all of the big powerful politicians literally 80? But secondly, we think that young people are a group that have more disparate interests. It's unclear how you cater to them exactly. On the comparative, it's pretty clear what all people want, right? Things like rights around retirement. It means you're a much stronger electoral initiative to such a reliable voting bloc and one that has such established patterns of representation. What that means is we think you're likely to cater to the elderly on either side. When you get more diverse politicians is when you cater to young people and you are uniquely able to do that. When you make politicians seem like they're about quality and not about age. I'll take a point before I move on. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are old politicians who are able to counter the police of younger people. Your metric on why older people can't help those who are younger people is completely insufficient. It doesn't matter if some old politicians can cater to the interests of young people. The general perception is that that isn't the case. What that means is when you only see old politicians and you don't really care to read Bernie Sanders' Party Manifesto, you probably just don't. You probably get turned off from politics. I think at the end of this, it is more likely that we get representative politics under our side when you put a damper on the chokehold that old people have over these institutions of power. And note that they don't really respond to what we tell you about ageing, particularly low-hanging fruit. It's easy to attack, it's easy to make this the issue that elections are. They just assert to you that you're going to do this to the same extent with young people, but if you significantly reduce the amount of old people there are to compare young politicians to, that metric for attack goes away. At the end of this, it is more likely that we get representative politics because there is a higher incentive to cater to young people. You aren't just an old politician who only caters to your old friends anymore because you have gone to a retirement home. We still represent elderly because the electoral incentive to do so exists, but we uniquely appeal to young people and therefore are more likely to get policies that are important to them."

When the entirety of the US presidential election has just been a smear campaign against Joe Biden's age, when every second TikTok is like an edit of him spacing out, there's a very strong perception that the risk is high. That means that people don't have faith in their democratic institutions because they're afraid the president they're going to vote for will literally die two years from now. Even if Joe Biden doesn't, or even if another president wouldn't, or even if there was a mechanism to replace him, people lack faith in their democratic systems when they think their politicians will literally just die. They tell you that mechanisms for removal exist, but these are uniquely extremely pernicious, because you can point to a competency test against Donald Trump and say, that's just the Democrats trying to lock him out of office.

I think the important thing to note about risk is that the stakes are very high here, right? We're talking about a person who could make a foreign policy decision go badly because he offends a delegate, but we're also talking about your local representative who spends so much time visiting the doctor that he can't spend time out on the streets talking to his constituents. That's uniquely pernicious, even if it occurs in only like 5% of circumstances, because people deserve to have politicians who are competent enough to represent them. Two things to judge this debate on then. Firstly, who represents the broadest amount of people the best? As the elderly are always represented, we should make the trade-off to represent the others. But secondly, on who gets the best politicians. And we remove such a high element of risk. We remove such a high element of shifting focus away from real politics. We are uniquely able to get that.

But second of all, the media that is dedicated to popular memes, to popular ideas, to not politics and not actually discourse, but entertainment, is going to do these sort of things under either side of the house. That is to say, they're not focusing on Kamala Harris's aid, but rather phrases such as you just fell out of a coconut tree.

Two responses, then, were going to be incredibly comparative because they have failed to. One, I don't understand why a 20 year old likes a 40 year old and feels very proximate to them. I don't know why a large age difference between youth and relatively old, in my opinion, is going to change. But second of all, I just think there are different things that you are empathised with compared to their age. I.e. if they have a similar background to you, you're still going to empathise with them.

Three layers. One, there's a greater incentive for the youth to vote. A, they're less disillusioned because they've not participated in politics for the same amount of time. If you're 60 or 70 and you've seen the same government and the same policies for the past 40 years, that is when you're more disillusioned. B, they're more invested in the future because it affects them. And C, we tell you that politicians are more likely to target younger voters because they have future returns. If you secure a long term voter that is better for you but also they are just able to influence their kids. Older people, the kids have already left, they cannot influence them. Secondly, there are other incentives aside from electoral ones that politicians have to cater towards the youth. They are simply your workforce and the ones producing your families. You need them to create a perfect country, therefore even if not electorate, there are still other incentives. Thirdly, we tell you there are other mechanisms as to how young people can engage that older people cannot. A. Younger people can strike because they are in jobs, older people cannot. B. Younger people can protest, older people cannot because they have to have walking sticks. And C. they're inherently online, younger people are inherently online, whereas older people barely know how to use technology. Younger people are more able to participate in discourse."

The response they give you in P3 is that it's difficult to cater to younger groups because they are very disparate. The problem is, no, progressive policies and what sort of politics you support is different for every single voter. But there are broad generalisations, i.e. you support labour laws if you're in work. You support family benefits if you're a young person that's a family. You support pensions if you're an old person. There are broad categories that you can cater towards. What this means is we're able to prove that we get engaged. But even if there is a trade-off between engaging young people and engaging old people, I would much rather engage older people because they are entirely reliant on the estate. If you do not work and are reliant on the estate for your pension, if you are likely to experience health issues and you're reliant on the estate for more than a younger person, these people are far more vulnerable and therefore we should prioritise them. What that means is we prove to you why we get greater engagement but also why we should care about older people even if there is a trade-off.

One, there are multiple ways in which we mitigate this. We tell you there are cognitive tests. They tell you, oh, this does not actually help you, and you're not actually able to find out cognitive problems. Cognitive tests are used by doctors in the medical industry. I just think they are true. We also tell you how you're just likely to have backlash if you're a politician and just constantly stuttering over your words and unable to form sentences. For all these reasons, I think this claim is incredibly mitigated. They're trying to extend this by saying that even if you kick people out of power, they think the destruction is enough of a harm to win them this debate. Three responses. One, again, this is incredibly symmetric. Younger politicians can also get ill. Also younger politicians are subject to disruptions that older politicians are not. They're more likely to become a parent, that means they need to take parental leave. I just think there are disruptions under either side of the house. Second of all, this happens before you get elected. Biden stepped down before he was elected, therefore there was not a large amount of disruption. This largely symmetriises this clash. What Mia tells you is we are the only side able to get experience. What this means is we can weigh on exclusivity and likelihood. Under their side, you also have problems with mental capacity. You also have problems with risk. It is only under our side that you access experience that is crucial to getting good policy. You want that local doctor into politics so they can campaign for a better NHS. That is the impact we provide under our side. So proud to oppose."

              "text": "Firstly, then, on the democratic principle. Every day, the democracies we discuss in this round choose choice over utility. The reason for this weighing that we've given you in our case is twofold. First, without democratic freedom, the state is an abusive force. Third says, oh, but the state has other mechanisms to coerce you. But we only think that's legitimate because you influence the state, which is, this is a prerequisite to the state doing anything else. It's the capacity that you have to choose it. But second, don't let them fool you, panel. Utility is not an objective metric. It's not for us here, privileged debaters, with the biases that we have, to decide what is right or wrong for people. Utility is what we make it, and voters vote on different utilitarian issues. Therefore, the only thing that we can guarantee has a clear metric here is the democratic violations. Why do we tell you this fundamentally violates these things? The first is by violating the right to stand. We told you that the right to vote is only fully actualised when you could replace someone because that's only when you have total choice. So if I can vote for anyone below 60 but I really want to vote for someone who's one of my friends or a colleague who would stand or I want to vote for someone over 60 because someone I resonate with, I don't have free choice because they can't put themselves forward to stand and give me choice. But additionally if you are over 60 you are just prohibited from being part of the state. Your only voice is through voting for other people, assuming there'll be someone else who listens to you. But secondly, it just violates your freedom to choose. And that is awful because we think everyone has a right to choose anyone who has capacity. But now I don't get to choose freely, and that's anyone in society. And that totally violates choice. Why do we think it's ever okay to violate these things? When we talked about the age of minority, notice this crucially, Pamela. We didn't frame it that we thought young people were stupid, but rather, literally, because young people don't have all the rights that they need, they literally couldn't function because they wouldn't be able to drive or vote, so obviously they can't. This wasn't about the merit of those policies, just the fact that that functions. But additionally, we were happy to stand over capacity. So if there was a debate here about whether young people not had capacity, we'd be happy to look them up if they didn't. But that wasn't part of the debate. It was about framing out people who had capacity."

Politics shift constantly, as we already see, but a constitutional removal is a guarantee of removing this right. So even if they win all of the other clashes, we already run in the violation of democracy. But why do we not think they do that? Let's talk about what the nature of politics is. They try to tell you that young people are systematically locked out of politics. So do young people become disillusioned with elderly people? We told you this wasn't true, primarily because young people have so much social capital. They have so much vested interest in influencing the future. They're not as apathetic and disillusioned, but also they're a key voter group that people are trying to tap into. For all these reasons, even if all their materials stand about why they disproportionately chose old people to be in higher up positions of power, the having of young people in lower levels, like ministerial jobs or simple representatives, was sufficient because we could lobby for more influence."

And if you want to increase changes in actual systems like healthcare, that wasn't something you could do in electoral cycles. It matters that we consistently, for years, have doctors on panels about medicine, that we have judges on panels about justice. They just remove these people very quickly, meaning the types of people you get are people who are playing politics for the game, not because they care about influencing those systems. So if you wanted good politicians, it mattered they wanted experience. Finally, the cognitive just fell out of this debate, because evidently you don't select people who have major cognitive problems, even if you select old people, that we're going to test them regularly, that we aren't going to restrict disabled people because they might take longer to do things. That's evidently not the case. We improve mechanisms to do with them the best that we can.

What we told you is, firstly, we're able to reduce the power of establishment politicians by at least 20 years. What does this lead to? We need to more turn over in politics. What this means then is that politicians now aren't able to campaign on their own reputation. What they need to campaign on is the specific policies to which they're able to help individuals.

This means they could have spent more time with a brighter variety of politicians campaigning on issues that actually matter.

That means that these younger voters don't want to vote in the first place because it's not that they want to vote against old politicians. What changes is that they see these old politicians as their only options, so they don't want to engage with the political system at all. The comparative is one where we have a world where politicians need to campaign on specific policies. We explain to you why to no response. What this means then is we're actually able to get far better discourse. At the end of this, we think democracy in the status quo favours the most powerful structurally, and those tend to be the oldest individuals.

Recently, France has withdrawn its troops from Operation Barcane from Mali in 2021, was forced to leave Burkina Faso in 2023, and was kicked out of Niger at the end of 2023.

French companies divesting from West Africa. This looks like the Bolloré Group, run by a politically influential French billionaire, selling their 42 ports in the region. There are already discussions of the sale of French assets with companies like the Swiss-Italian MSC, the Danish Maersk, as well as Chinese and Indian companies. Let's be clear about what the opposition must support. France's exit is not an abstract proposal. It occurred through France being expelled from Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali. Opposition cannot create a hypothetical world where there were no coups, there weren't mass violent protests, and colonial resentment did not exist. They must give a reasonable explanation of how France would have stayed in power to prove their comparative. Are they in support of using French forces to oust the military in Burkina Faso at a risk of a major war? Would they have remained in Niger even when the junta threatened not to let food or supplies cross the territory and reach French military bases? Would they have suppressed the protests outside French embassies late last year? We need an answer."

              "text": "First argument, then, on why France's exit improves West Africa's security. The Sahel is in a crisis. Empirically, France has failed to provide West Africa with the security it required, particularly in the battle against jihadist groups. This looks like the terror groups murdering 45,000 in Mali, 8,000 in Niger, 10,000 in Burkina Faso. In Jibo, Burkina Faso, JNIM killed anybody who tried to leave the town, raided the cattle, and left those living there to starve to death. When France left, Russia sent in servicemen through the Wagner Group, now known as the Afrika Korps and the Ministry of Defense, liberating large swaths of Burkina Faso over four months. Why is Russia a better security partner than France? Before that, yes. Russia uses Mali as a training ground for working forces. France is in these countries fulfilling a specific mandate to end terrorism. Who's better protected to be on the ground? This argument will answer that. Why is Russia a better security partner than France? What matters are the incentives and capacity of actors in meeting their goals. While France, like Russia, may have incentives to provide security to gain allies and access to resources, they are constrained by disincentives. This answers their POI. First, the French government primarily cares about its domestic success. Thus, it's unlikely to take the risks needed to protect those in Mali or Burkina Faso. It is incredibly unpopular to lose troops abroad. When 39 French troops were killed in Mali in 2019, the story was sensationalized in every French newspaper. At best, France attempts to protect major areas controlled by French companies. Russia is less casualty-averse than France. That's because Russia is not a democracy. It doesn't have a free media, so Putin doesn't need to care about the sensationalization of the deaths of a few soldiers. This means that Russian ground troops can be placed strategically to root out jihadists, destroy their bases, and seize their weapons. Russia is willing to redirect Wagner to West Africa, which keeps them far away and prevents the chance of another coup attempt, repeating last summer. Second, France refuses to sell offensive weaponry in West Africa, as it wants them to maintain their reliance on French forces for defense. Without offensive weaponry, West African states aren't able to push back insurgent groups, and instead, insurgencies gain the ability to regroup and prepare for another attack. Russia and China are far more willing to sell military offensive weaponry. To gain influence, Russia has differentiated itself from France by granting more independence to them, which they can independently use to more effectively root out jihadists. And although they may not gain total control, this is what gives them the ability to gain some control. Russia's capacity to sell weapons is not limited by the Ukrainian war. The weapons that you need to fight a Western-funded army in Ukraine are hugely different from what you need to fight jihadists. These weapons may be old by Russian standards, but are more than sufficient to defeat poorly equipped jihadist groups with outdated weaponry. This is why Russia's Ministry of Defense sold old MiG-29 fighters to the army, Verba surface-to-surface missiles, and T-54 tanks to Burkina Faso. Thus, we guarantee security, saving lives, and creating the preconditions for investment, as stability for investors is secured."

              "text": "Second argument, on why France's dominance uniquely exploits West Africa. All countries, be it the US, China, or Russia, act primarily in their own interests. Modern France's actions in West Africa are no exception. Those interests are exploitative. Why? First, France wants to maximize benefits for its voters. These are cheaper products imported from West Africa, a secure supply of uranium from Niger, and a captive consumer base. In contrast, the daily details of French exploitation in West African politics are of little interest to most French voters. Second, the 200 French MNCs in West Africa want the best deals possible. Companies like the oil giant Total or Orano Nuclear Group. These companies are major employers, control 75% of the regional oil giant Total or Orano Nuclear Group. These companies are major employers, control 75% of the regional oil trade, and have huge political power. Total Energy is notorious for hiring veteran diplomats and policymakers like Macron's former chief of staff, Ismail Emelian. Powerful French officials know that their most lucrative exit option are into the private sectors of these French MNCs, and thus will push for their interests. How does France exert their control? France is a new colonial power in much of West Africa. It uses that power to limit the ability of other countries to challenge it or control contracts and vital resources. First, France holds control over many West African governments. It does so through hand-picking the rulers and members of the elite, or providing support for their political cronies even when they grossly abused human rights. For instance, Omar Bongo was promoted from a minor politician to a president via a French-supported coup, before ruling Gabon as a brutal dictator for over 40 years. There are similar stories in Chad and Cameroon. Second, France acts as a key intermediary between West African states and others. This is through Bolloré, a company that owns 42 ports in the region and has historically forwarded French interests, like prioritizing French companies to the exclusion of other nations, which import into and export out of West Africa. Why is the alternative far better? When West African states are freed from French control, they can negotiate with a range of different partners. There are numerous countries which want to conclude new trade deals, invest, or make a play for military contracts following French withdrawal. As a result of increased options, West African countries now operate as kingmakers, choosing which countries to partner with. You can now garner new investment from countries like Russia, China, and Turkey to get the best terms and deals. Russia and Chinese influence may increase, but neither will ever hold the exclusionary influence that France had. France had control over the ports, the currency, the political system, and was the region's dominant security partner. Russia may have some power in the security realm, but China has never sent significant troops to fight abroad, so cannot act as a security guarantor. No country can purchase all of the 42 ports, but China and EU countries are likely to buy at least some. China and Russia's interests are not just in West Africa. They are positioning themselves as alternatives to the West to attract allies and secure markets globally. Russia needs new trade partners given Western sanctions. China is concerned about an increasingly aggressive America and wants to secure support and markets. Thus, both are seriously concerned about their image in states that are not closely aligned with the West. One of their main selling points is that they are not the people that oppressed you. If they act overly maliciously, they risk losing allies all around the world. This is reflected in how China, which a decade ago seized ports, now cares about its international reputation and has participated in Western debt restructuring in Zambia, Ghana, and Sri Lanka. Thus, we increase West Africa's options and economic partners, improving their ability to make deals and generate millions in revenue. Thank you. In 2013, Mali begged France to intervene as the Malian army was overwhelmed by an Islamic"

Thirdly, if Proposition wants to talk about other countries like Senegal, we would know that A, this isn't a motion, but B, this relies on a speculative hypothetical that neither side would be able to convincingly prove in their round.

Crucially, these elites are more concerned with cementing personal power than improving security or prosperity in the region.

              "text": "One extra thing is rebuttal. They try to tell you that China cares about the image. Like, guys, you come from Hong Kong. The reason why I went to the UK is because they actually crack down protesters and they don't give a damn about people's lives or anything. I simply don't think China cares about image That is why I went to England. First argument then. The exit of France drastically increases instability in the region. Firstly I think you want to know, but they literally conceded that Russia and China is going to be the alternative on their side of the house So I won't spend too much time explaining why this is true The first question then is why is France better for regional stability? There are a couple of reasons. Number one, France does not want instability in the region as it will create an African refugee crisis which will pose an existential risk to EU cooperation, right as it tries to gain a more leading role in the EU. The second reason is because French domestic politics cares about West Africa more than any other Western nation because of long-lasting historical ties and a large diaspora and a voting bloc within France who cares about the situations in these states. Notice how this mechanism clashes with their claim. When we talk about how France only cares about domestic success, domestic success to France oftentimes looks like being able to help their previous colonies and we can be able to do that far better on our side. Thirdly, France is far from the Vatican or Nice domestic terror attacks, so it's desperate to avoid the creation of a rogue ISIS-style pariah state that will facilitate and fund more attacks in the West. This shows that France cares about regional stability, but Russia does not. Secondly, on ability, France has unique experience and knowledge in the Sahel region. This shows that they have had a presence in the region for centuries, understand the cultural and regional complexities, the terrain and ethnic dynamics, developing a specialism, and targeting insurgents in the area. They've also learned from their past mistakes, for example, of inefficient military policies. We think they change their tactics nowadays. But thirdly, notice that France has invested the most into counterterrorism in the region of any country. Operation Broccani, which they mentioned, costs 1 billion euros a year, with a lot of these investments being in military bases and equipment. France took that away when they left Sweden as a convo on their side. But we think that Converse is true for Russia for a few reasons. Number one, Russia does not care about African states and limits their relationship to transactional opportunities with automatic leaders in the region. This means that Russia is more flighty as a military leader, as it could abandon these states when its strategic priorities change, such as reaching a peace deal in Ukraine. This leads to a claim, where they tell you how Russia has the capacity to avoid scrutiny, and therefore can effectively rule out jihadists, because they never prove to be the incentive for Russia to lose out the very first race, and therefore they can't unlock any of their benefits. The second reason why Russia doesn't care about stability is because they want to divert attention from the Ukraine war by using instability in West Africa to destabilize Europe. Think about it. The more the EU has to argue over refugee quotas from Sahel states or focus on domestic counterterrorism initiatives, the more disconnected and fatigued the EU becomes about the war in Ukraine. But finally, notice that Russia has no experience and therefore ability to counterterrorism in West Africa. Russia specializes in smaller private military contracts Russia has no experience and therefore ability to counter terrorism in West Africa. Russia specialises in smaller private military contracts and has no experience with an operation of the size necessary to tackle the ethnic and terrorist activity in Sahel. The conclusion is simple. On our side, France is not only the most invested external actor, but it is the only external actor with the incentives and capacity to provide good peacekeeping as Russia cannot and will never prioritize bringing peace and security to West Africa. What's the impact of this argument? One, the French exit has led to massive instability and chaos in the region. Record kidnappings in southern Niger, the deadliest year of terror ever. On their side of the house, you get more deaths, more destruction, more refugees, and more pain for innocent civilians. But secondly, it has destroyed regional cooperation. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso formed their own little bloc called the ASS. Like, guys, the name is self-explanatory, but it also means that they stopped interacting with ECOWAS, reducing trade and cross-border cooperation economically and on foreign policy. Before I move on, PY. If France is scared of refugees, why doesn't it just secure the northern borders and just bar children from sending troops in and risking domestic unpopularity? We come from England. Why do you ask for a sheet soon like that? The answer is because they cannot. You can't just like settle a border because people can still get through the border. You simply need to provide stability and solve the problem from its root. Like guys, go out."

Why do regimes then care about this? For leaders who just came into power, you know you have enemies. The military may turn against you and they may be counter-coups. The Wagner Group guards against this uniquely. What does this look like? This looks like the Wagner Group protecting the world-largest government in the Central African Republic, receiving valuable metal resources in return. Wagner effectively uses people's resources to oppress the very people who are on the ground. They have destroyed villages and murdered civilians on the ground in attempts to extract minerals and advance their economic interests in the mining sector. This is the true impact where they don't face any scrutiny. Why is this harmful? What? You think the vagrant conduct of war and civilian treatment is inhumane? It gives authoritarian governments the resources and expertise to rule of impunity and punish dissenters. But secondly, how do you weigh this argument? What?

The term France's exit from West Africa encompasses recent and ongoing events, including but not limited to France's 2023 exit from Niger. Let's look at France's 2023 exit from Niger as an illustrative example. The new government demanded France to leave. For the first two months after the military coup in Niger, Macron maintained and stationed French forces and troops in the area, in spite of Niger's government's demands to leave before eventually backing down. Opposition needs to give us an explanation of why Macron should have shown his crown and how he could have. It is not an unreasonable burden for us to ask the opposition to defend the policy that Macron initiated. It is an unreasonable burden for them to suggest that they get to defend a world where there's undoing local resentment or there's three military coups caused by the structural and inherent feelings of France and Africa, never happened. France themselves caused the resentment, you cannot just fiat that out on your side of the house. Therefore, the opposition needs to prove that they won't lead to violence, mass protests, and civil war. But to be clear, our entire constructive case still exists independent of this. What are the strategic implications of them not having an alternative? One, they cannot fulfill their burden in this round, as they actually had to prove why France can actually stay in the first place.

              "text": "But I just want to firstly deal with a negative case then. They give you two claims as to why Wagner is bad. The first thing they say is Wagner will commit human rights abuses like they've already done to some extent. Any war will have abuses. That is inevitable. On one side, they are caused by the inaction of the French government. On the other, damage caused by the African Corp and Russia. The important difference is that the latter is likely to be short-term. It's during the operations to root out insurgents rather than a prolonged five-year war at best. Moreover, France's tactics of airstrikes itself to avoid the death of their own soldiers causes collateral damage and kills civilians when terrorist targets hide in urban areas. A UN report concluded that dozens of civilians were killed in a French air strike in Mali on January 3, 2021. Therefore, maybe it is true that Wagner will have some abuses, but on their side, the abuses are far more, because France just lies back and does nothing and does not kill the insurgents, which causes far more harm on their side of the house. The second claim, then, is Wagner is really bad because he can't really deal with terrorism in the area. I don't really think this is true on a factor level, given they did deal with terrorists in Central Africa in the first place. But at the very least, I will tell you why it's going to be likely to be more effective than the French, which is their comparative. Consider what you need to deal with insurgents. France's refusal to risk its own soldiers is an even more weak problem when it comes to fighting insurgents. While France is an air force and high-tech weaponry, you cannot, with air power alone, deal with an insurgent group. Ground support is necessary in order to stabilize an area, while airstrikes can drive insurgents. While France is an air force and high-tech weaponry, you cannot with air power alone deal with an insurgent group. Ground support is necessary in order to stabilize an area, while airstrikes can drive insurgents out, troops that need to secure the area, set up an encampment base, and prevent any future encroachments. You have to be around the villages, you have the whole territory, you cannot fight in town. While France could kill some terrorist leaders, they were replaced by new leaders. The strategic implication of this is, they never proved to you why France has the actual incentive to actually send these soldiers in the first place. They made up a broad incentive to care, but the voters do not want them to actually go in and send soldiers to die in the first place. Therefore, they do not prove why you actually get security on their R side. Even if R side is imperfect in this flood, it is so far better than the French. Give them the same. I want to do the positive incentives as to why France will actually be good. They give you two things. The first thing they say is they feel really bad for colonizing West Africa and therefore they will be good. I'd actually argue this had little impact thus far. Guilt did not prevent exploitation, or mean that you invested more into the continent in a positive way. In fact, many French citizens actually feel the opposite, that France has provided so much, many people in the East of Hell weren't at all thankful, but they were in fact resentful. This actually in turn stirs less guilt and more resentment, as they're far less likely to actually help West Africa in the future. But I still feel they best claim then, that France wants to stabilize these places to prevent refugee flow. The premise is true, that France probably wants the region to be stable and it wants to reduce refugee flows, but they are wrong about how France would do that. Stability is too difficult and it's too hard to deal with jihadists without losing too many of your own soldiers, it's too hard to stay in. There are two better options and ones more likely that France will actually take. Number one, they will secure their main transit routes, that refugees can't come to France directly from Niger, but they go through North African ports. France and Italy are already working on securing those in the status quo. That is not easy, but it is far easier than stabilizing the country and actually fighting the insurgents in the first place. But secondly, once they reach France, you literally just deport them. That is similar to what the UK government tried to do, deport refugees to Rwanda. Therefore, both of the above are the far more plausible solutions than stabilizing West Africa. They have to prove why France actually takes the solution. Our plan was simple. France is very, very bad. import refugees to Rwanda. Therefore, both of the above are the far more plausible solutions than stabilizing West Africa. The integral part of France actually takes the solution. Our claim was simple. France is very, very bad. Wagner may be imperfect, but at the release, they will send troops in, they will fight the jihadists, and even though both sides agree that insurgency is very bad and causes instability, we clearly win this round because Wagner is still good.

This is an example, not a general claim. You cannot just claim you're from Hong Kong and use this as analysis. Obviously, China also interfered in positive ways. They actually gave debt restructuring to Zambia, Ghana, and Sri Lanka, often on very positive terms, and they did it well. And structurally, here's why it's actually not true that China is bad. Maybe China cares very heavily about their domestic politics. That's Hong Kong, Taiwan, maybe even, Yeah, okay, I'll just leave it there. Yeah, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But I think in terms of foreign policy, what they often want to do is assert their influence. They want to fight against the West. They want to have, actually, hegemony in the first place. Therefore, their desire to actually get the West in the first place, as far as better, like, beat the Western world, is actually far better on our side. That's what makes them actually have good behavior in the first place. Therefore, I think China would like to be far better on our side, and they are a good source of investment.

Therefore, this argument is still debate-winning, OG must engage with this as well. Finally, then I might split, and my French involvement may be still a risk of coups. In the Central African Republic, there are protests against Russia on a daily basis after their abuses are stolen by Russia. What makes you think that Mali will not become another Central African Republic? I mean, look, we gave you incentives as to why Russia is currently only involving Wagner. Russian government is just not empirically involved as deeply as they would have it. And either way, France is significantly worse as we've proven to you. You do not engage with your own comparative. Okay, argument three then, on risk of coups. France's continued presence in West Africa when there was further coups, protests, and violence. This is because hatred towards France and Africa is both intense and very hard to combat. This is because A, France is a colonial power many either remember or told by their parents and their grandparents of the horrors of French concentration camps, racism, and apartheid. But secondly, France's actions, positive and negative, are interpreted through the lens of colonialism. For instance, an airstrike in January 2021 killed 19 innocent civilians at a wedding in Mali. When he saw this as further evidence of its brutality, France's leading role in the anti-jihad Operation Barcane led it to becoming perceived as yet another example of neo-colonial franco-freak. Fundamentally, to the person on the street, France was synonymous with political repression, corruption, and dictatorship, meaning that everything France did became tarnished by association. Why does this matter? France's lack of popularity creates a rhetorical device to legitimize coups by power-hungry leaders. Coup leaders require the support of a reasonable faction of the population. The bank and file of the army are ordinary citizens. They have families, and armies rarely want to shoot thousands of protesters. While in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, the coup leaders were largely motivated by power. They were able to justify their takeover as liberating Africa from French control. I want to stress what a strong justification this is. It is coup plotters claiming that they are liberators, that they are removing an illegitimate, foreign-controlled government, that they are saving the country from exploitation. For many of these countries, this is a tipping point between"

We think frankly this would be akin to claiming that, for example, in the UK, because we have just stopped oil protesting, that means that everyone is in favour of an instant green energy transition and stopping using oil overnight.

Their claim is that France aims to maximise its benefits to its own people. First, I think Alex broadly analysed quite well too, why we think that France does have good incentives in West Africa. Why they have incentives to maintain security because refugees trailing into France would be so incredibly harmful. But also, panel, just note that this claim is fundamentally uncomparative. Like, do they genuinely think that China or Russia do not also want to maximise benefits to their own government and own people. Like, we're all debaters.

First, we just don't think it's true that France necessarily causes coups. Like, sure, maybe Russia tries to exploit this narrative somewhat. But equally, we think family infighting, socioeconomic problems are all equally impactful. So we think they're going to have to actually weigh to what extent this is the tipping point. They fail to do that. That's the problem with beginning your split at six minute times. But equally, do not homogenise the people of West Africa proposition. We think some people do support funds. There are countercoups for people who think that these governments are illegitimate in imposing the Russian will as opposed to the French one on the African people. So they're going to have to do a little bit more analysis there to explain why they think this is a tipping point and why it's comparative. Let's ask them, which side improves security? No, thank you. They claim that they improve security under their side of the house. And the crux of the claim here is that Russia is better at fighting terrorism than France. And they give two reasons for this. The first is that France primarily cares about domestic success, is concerned about things like the body bag effect, small numbers of casualties mean they pull out troops. Russia does not. Two responses. First, I just think this is a massive concession that France is vulnerable to international and domestic scrutiny in a way that Russia fundamentally is not. So even if France is perhaps more cautious, that also means they don't have an incentive to do the most harmful things like butchering civilians. That is a trade-off I will undertake. But second, this clearly concedes Alex's argument that this first grants an incentive to avoid refugees. This gives France an incentive to cater to what people actually want. They try to push back by claiming that France just doesn't care that much, but your own claim is that Russia doesn't care at all. Second, they claim that France refuses to sell offensive weapons to fight jihadists, but Russia and China will. But again, the logic here is very strange, because you're not selling to the average guy in the village to take up arms against the jihadists. Rather, Russia is probably selling, no thank you, to the warlords who can afford to buy this weapon from them. Probably also to the terrorists who then use it against the very vulnerable people they want to defend. But also, I don't think they appropriately deal with our case and how Russia is fundamentally bad at fighting terrorism, that they're inexperienced, that they're unscrupulous, they need to engage in this mechanistically if they want to win this clash. We told you that France has the ability and the incentive to ensure stability. We don't think they dealt with this appropriately. But even so, no thank you, in their world, we think that Russia is far more likely to pull out in a way that is incredibly harmful. We think Russia is an unscrupulous actor. We think Russia is far more likely to pull out in a way that is incredibly harmful. We think Russia is an unscrupulous actor. We think Russia is far more likely later down the line, so they reach a settlement in Ukraine, and it no longer serves their strategic interest to stay on West Atika. They are probably more likely to pull out in a way that is far more harmful than any managed French withdrawal. So the real comparativeness debate is not a well-managed French withdrawal versus France staying. It is a France staying versus an incredibly poorly managed Russian withdrawal that means that these states are fundamentally crippled. No, we don't think you get as many people, we don't think you get the same military hundreds in our world when France stays, when France maintains its security guarantees. We're simply not listening to our case."

              "text": "Why then is there a massive reduction in aid under proposition? We think this is an independent path to victory for us in this debate, because this, in their world, means thousands, if not millions, of lives lost. And we are going to need to hear them engage with this, because this is a massive harm that wins us the debate. Why is there a reduction in aid on their side? Four reasons. First, a French reduction in aid is inherently part of their burden in this debate. Note how they just fail to engage really in their stance with the majority of what this debate is about. It's very bright, it's very assertive, there's a total lack of detail. But we think that once France gives up its sense of a special duty to the region, it stops feeling like it has a special duty to give more aid than the rest of the world. We start seeing significant cuts. But not only is this shown at an analytical level, it's also just true empirically. We think that, like, it's not just a speculative harm. Marnie Niger and Burkina Faso have all seen approximately 150 million euro cuts each since the France withdrawal. That is something they're going to have to deal with. But second, this isn't just about French government aid, Pam. This is also about EU and American aid, because the EU and US rely on the French security guarantees to give their aid. Because when France pulls out and as they concede from first, the bargaining group shows up. International domestic law literally stops these countries giving aid to these places where it could potentially fall into terrorist hands, into groups like the bargaining group that are designated as terrorists. But even if it's not the Barking Group, even if it is just a military junta, international pressure and fears of funding corrupt, oppressive regimes means that the EU and US will not send aid to growth centers in Mali or the CNSP in Niger. Again, this is empirically true. The US cut over $500 million in aid to Niger after the 2023 coup. The World Food Programme says that 7.3 million people will move from moderate to extreme food poverty as a direct consequence of the sanctions after the coup in Niger. Third, sometimes the military governments that merge post-French withdrawal will decline aid for selfish political reasons. This is something they try to push on us, but this is what happens in their world when aid convoys literally stop at the border between Benin and Niger, because Chiani literally would not let them in. But fourth and finally, this is also about the way aid is given and the charitable organisations that provide it. So previously, UNICEF or Médecins Sans Frontières had people on the ground to deal with famines, with epidemics and all other forms of crisis. So they gave vaccines, They detected symptoms of malaria or Ebola early. They explained this to local people. They quarantined them. They administered cures. But now these people have gone home because they cannot get insured. They cannot, according to domestic law, go to work in these places without the French security guarantee. That is not permitted in their world. What is the impact of this? First, they get less aid money. That looks like people starving. That looks like people without malaria nets. That looks like people without vaccines. But what do we think an outbreak looks like in their world? Well, in our world, where it looks like someone in a hazmat suit comes in, they take you to the Western hospital, they say, we're quarantining you, we're giving your friends and family vaccines. In their world, you do not have those aid workers. So the people in that village in Mali, they sit round, they share a meal, they drink from the same water sources, they live in the same houses, they commute to different places to work. That means that the West only learns about these outbreaks within two or three weeks, by which point it is already far too late, by which point thousands, if not millions of people are literally dying from Ebola and malaria and cholera and tuberculosis. Because they stand behind no debt in their world, shame on them, we win this debate. I'll just take the speaker and I will let you talk to the computer. I have a second figure and a very good option here. Sorry, just let me strike this on the back. All right. Opposition strategy in this debate"

But secondly, even if it is the case that they currently receive aid from countries like France, it is unclear what this aid actually does. As they note, oftentimes it is terrorist groups that block this aid. Note, for instance, in Mali, where 19 French aid workers were shot in 2020. That means that even if aid is, like, I mean, if they are trying to get aid to flow into these countries, it is oftentimes blocked on their side of the house as well. But finally, and really, really importantly, it is only when there's Chinese and Russian influence in these countries that you are likely to have other powers that want to, like, send in aid to compete with them. Why is this so? If you are the US, you do not want China to be expanding their geopolitical power. It is precisely because you are intimidated by this, which means that this is when the US begins to join the fray. This is when the US begins to send in aid, because they want to take away some of that power away from China. That is why we get so much more aid on their side of the house."

What would they do in the future? In the worst case, they would cut to all eight. This also responds to their argument on eight. But in the worst case, they would use their influence to push worse and worse policies towards West Africa. This means they would demand things like cheaper uranium prices. They would push for weaker conditions for French companies to enter West Africa.

All of their benefits are likelyFrench resentment in the future. That military intervention on the other side also goes down. That aid also goes down. All of their benefits are likely to retreat in the near future. They need to respond to this about how they want the French election to go. Before I move on, I'll take a few words. China is in a housing market crisis. Russia is in a bloody war. How do they match the aid that France currently provides the West? I'll break this down to two parts. Firstly, on Russia and Ukraine. I want to note first, the lack of manpower in Russia has never really been the problem. The problem was that Putin feared that the Wagner Group was going to overthrow him, while people like Prigoginev marched on Russia and tried to challenge Putin. As a result, it's actually in Putin's incentive to station these Wagner Groups further away from Ukraine, to reallocate them from Ukraine to West Africa. So that deals with the Russian kid. But secondly, on the idea of weaponry. The weaponry that you use to deal with the Ukrainian war... No, thank you. I'm responding to your PLA right now. Wait. The weaponry that you use to deal with the Ukrainian war is very different to the weaponry that you use to fight jihadists. The weaponry that you need to deal with jihadists can be relatively outdated or can be relatively old because you do not need such advanced weaponry to deal with jihadists. Russians can do that on their side of the house. Finally, China's economy, yes, it is struggling. It is still seven times the GDP of France's. It is still massively a much better trading partner than France. If you want to talk about economic problems, let's talk about economic problems. France has a debt crisis. It has a demographic crisis. France is literally spiralling in terms of debt, and as a result it is unable to actually benefit these Western African nations economically. We also gave you so many mechanisms in our first speaker as to why France currently has a monopoly over these countries so even if it is the case that to the extent that these Western African countries currently"

What we proved to you was that France's specific interest and their colonial history in these nations has led their interest to be diametrically opposed to many of these nations, that they want to monopolize these nations, because that is where they currently derive a stable source of uranium, for instance. What we have then told you is that the incentives when Russia and China enter these nations is to promote more stability and because they want to build allies. It is to promote more economic growth because they also want to reject power in the region. Let's talk about human rights abuses. Because yes, it may be the case that you have speculative human rights abuses under the Wagner Group. We can accept that. But what we can also be certain of are the human rights abuses occurring right now, what we call terrorism by JNM and other jihadists, enabled by the ineffectiveness of the French government. Even if it is the case that you get some human rights abuses by the Wagner group, this is highly likely to be short-term, in the case that this is highly likely to only take place during the period in which you are fighting off these jihadists. But given that they've never been able to contest that our side of the house is far more effective at dealing with these jihadists in the long term, insofar as the French government refuses to put troops on the ground, it is extremely casualty-averse."

The next theme under this is that these countries are likely to unscrupulously pull out. I think it's unclear what this actually looks like, and it's unclear what the impacts of this are likely to be. Because if it is the case that Russia and China, because we can accept that Russia and China may have external, like, external or, like, what's the word? They have other incentives, basically, to stay in the region, but that does not necessarily mean that they're going to pull out of those regions in such a surreptitious way that harms these nations in the long term. Finally, then, on the incentives of France, I think that Nicole's responses have already sufficiently taken down a lot of their incentives. There are only two reasons for why France wants to help these nations. First, because of colonial guilt, they want to help these previous colonies. And secondly, that France knows the history and the culture of these places. I kind of feel the need to reemphasize the reason why France knows the history of these places is because they were the colonial oppressors of these places. What does this imply? This implies that the tribes in West Africa, which you need to work with in order to take down jihadists, are highly unlikely to trust the French government. Note that the currently most deprived tribes in West Africa, the ones that make up the largest constituency in these jihadist groups, are also the ones that are the most economically deprived under the French colonial power. But secondly, colonial guilt, it seems just highly intangible as a way for why an average French voter would want to vote on France helping West Africa as opposed to things that are more proximate to them, like the economy. Finally, then, on the idea of capacity. I think we've already sufficiently taken this down. Even though France may have the capacity to deal with these places, the Afghans do not have the sufficient incentive. That is to say, you may want to deal with refugee flows, but O2 ignores the words that Nicole actually told you. It is far easier for France to just not put troops on the ground, to not risk French lives. It is far easier for them to just launch airstrikes from a safe position. That is why France has never and will never help these places. Thank you. People in Mali might be waving Russian flags at the moment, but in the Central African"

              "text": "when they say that how could France have stayed when leaders are cracking down on them? How can France stay when there's protests going on? I mean, the simple answer to this is for the same reason that they've stayed for the last 60 years, despite the fact that there always have been protests against France. They always have flared up, but France has managed to stay in Gabon. It's managed to stay in Senegal. It's managed to stay in Guinea, despite the fact that there were anti-French protests very much similar to the ones that are occurring in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso right now, for the same reason that Russia is able to stay in the Central African Republic, despite the fact that there's huge protests against Russia. These Western powers have the ability to deflect protests, they have the ability to stick it out. But secondly, a lot of people still do support France within these areas. For example, in northern Mali, there's a lot more support than there is in southern Mali. So what France could have done, for example, was not just crack down on locals, but shift their bases temporarily in order to withstand the upsurge in anti-French resentment, and then continue to suppress terrorism in the region. But lastly, note that these coup leaders are opportunistic. It wouldn't necessarily have been impossible for France to stay. All they need to do is throw carrots at particular leaders. See the way in which they've done this in Chad, for example. They have worked together with the coup leader, Debbie. They've made commitments to Debbie's family. And Chad is now one of the most stable countries in Western Africa. And note that in any case, any method that France used to stay is far better than the alternative, which is letting the Wagner forces in."

Let's talk then about aid, because what Maya tells you is that international humanitarian and medical aid just isn't able to flow into these countries. They give a couple of responses. They say that firstly, China and Russia are going to match the amount of aid. Three responses. Firstly, there's absolutely no incentive to do so, whereas France has a special relationship with West Africa. There's no special priority on the part of China and Russia. Russia's more incentivised to keep its troops in, for example, Sudan, because they have more of a vested geopolitical interest there. But secondly, there's no ability because of things like war, because of the things like the housing bubble in China. Thirdly, right, sure, they might get aid eventually, but this is still a shift in aid, because whereas there is French aid on the ground currently, there is a lag time on their house. When it comes to things like Ebola and malaria that are literally the biggest killers in West Africa, this is a ticking time bomb, and any delay is going to prevent hundreds of lives from being saved. Fourthly, even if the amount of aid isn't matched, it's never going to be good as the WHO that has a specific and special mandate to actually deal with things like malaria and Ebola. This is locked out by international law because you literally cannot send the WHO in when there's been coups, when there isn't that democratic mediator of France to prevent these organisations from coming in. And for that reason, it's not only just about France, which is also apparently in a housing bubble, it's about all the other countries that contribute to the who this is round winning because on the scale of impact alone things like malaria and ebola kill thousands of people every year so if you're not sure about how many people are killed on terrorism you you judge the debate on this"

Yes, it's fantastic that it cares about maintaining stability in order to protect French companies, because what's the comparative? It's the Ouagra group being hired by particular leaders in these countries. And these leaders in the West African countries, people like Goita in Mali, and Chiani in Niger, literally do not care about retaining stability. And that's because, for example, in Burkina Faso, the new military leader, he said he's only going to have elections when the issue of terrorism is resolved. Because he wants to stay in power. There's a vested interest not to actually solve terrorism. Because of the fact that a lot of the people who are most harmed by terrorism are people who are in the Arab section of these nations. The higher-ups don't really care if they're harmed solve terrorism. Because of the fact that a lot of the people who are most harmed by terrorism are people who are in the Arab section of these nations. The higher-ups don't really care if they're harmed by terrorism. And because of the fact that having lots of refugees flowing out of your country gives you a huge amount of bargaining power. So there are a lot of the leaders, the leaders who are controlling what the Russian forces do, who actually have an incentive to prolong the instability. Even if it's just in the areas with French companies, we'd rather there be a force that actually wants to retain stability. The second thing they say is that France sells offensive weaponry. But we think it would be incredibly harmful if Russia were to match this degree of offensive weaponry. Why is this the case? It's because it's used for incredibly harmful purposes. See the coup in Equatorial Guinea, for example, brought about by the President's cousin. Yes, they might talk about anti-French resentment causing coups, but a lot of the reason why coups arise are things like interpersonal familial feuds and also socioeconomic problems that are going to occur on either side of the house.

Russia is going to go to whoever gives them minerals and whoever gives them resources. And that's something anyone, whether that's the people in charge or the people cooing against them, can do. And incidentally, also, in the attempt to do so, the minerals are jeopardised as different groups fight over them. You're more likely to actually get the exploitation that they talk about on their side of the house. But even if Russia does have an incentive to engage in terrorism, why do we think France is just far better? A couple of reasons. Firstly, there are facets of the fight against terrorism that only France can successfully fight upon. For instance, it's only due to the French evidence gathering that the ICC has been able to convict the former head of the Islamic police in Timbuktu for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Secondly, other powers can work in tandem with France to be very successful. For example, the UN peacekeeping mission to Mali helped to identify terrorist migration routes and defuse guerrilla warfare, and the fact that it was composed mostly of African peacekeepers circumvented the problem of the political unpopularity of France the proposition wanted to talk about. But crucially, when France withdrew from Mali, so too did the only vote in favour of continued intervention in Mali on the UN Security Council disappear. And that's why peacekeepers were pulled out. Likewise, the fact that France is a dominant player in the EU means that the EU is likely to completely end its missions in places of Niger. And lastly, irrespective of whether France is actually effective in fighting terrorism, the fact that it's there, that it was present present was a symbol of its resolve to do so. And on their side of the house, you're able to get terrorists strengthening your rhetoric. The ISSP can now say to Marlins, the one power that promised to defend you to the end is gone. There really is no other option but to join forces with us. That's when this increases recruitment for terrorist groups, and that's when terrorism gets far worse."

Lastly a quick note on their other exploitation material. Look, these countries aren't going to be kingmakers. They aren't going to get Russian and Chinese investment. You know when they're kingmakers? When they have leverage. When there are thousands of migrants going to the EU and they are able, therefore, to negotiate with other countries. They weren't going to band together because of the fact that these Western African nations already had inter-ethnic conflicts between them. France was the glue that was holding them together, was the only power that was able to get them a seat on the international stage, a voice on the global stage, and for this reason we're very proud of them.

If they want to do so in reply, I think that's a little bit late. But then they brought this argument on coups. We told you in second and again in third, you can't homogenise these countries. We could play example tennis all day with coups and with counter coups, with coups caused by France and coups caused by other reasons, by the lack of French presence. But ultimately, I think the fact that they dropped this in third after we took it down is that not even their own team bought it, their case is falling apart before our very eyes. By contrast, we said that France has the ability and incentive to ensure security because they want to avoid influx of refugees into France, because they want to avoid domestic terrorism, because their own argument about economic exploitation literally relies on the fact that France has an incentive and the ability to ensure stability in these countries so that they can build these factories, so that they can buy uranium. By contrast, we told you that Russia wants instability. They challenge whether France actually cares about stability in these places. We said your own arguments rely on it, and also this is supposed to be comparative. They ask why is it West Africa? Why would Russia come into West Africa? We said because France is withdrawing buyers. They are literally creating these opportunities. But also, note the push that we brought you in second, that they literally did not acknowledge or engage with. When we said that the comparative they have to stand behind their world is Russia pulling out. Because Russia is an unscrupulous actor. Russia is a fickle actor. If they reach a settlement in Ukraine, if they decide that West Africa is no longer useful to them, they will pull out. Check your notes panel, I said this in second, and this was devastating for their case. Because even in their best case scenario, they don't have a well intentioned Russia investing in these places, ensuring stability. Because as soon as it serves Russia to pull out, they will do so. They will leave these places presided over by autocrats. They will embolden them. They will build corrupt states. They will build unstable states. For that reason, we"

We told you a couple of things here. First, China gives one-third of economic development and aid to what to like east africa as opposed to west africa and this is because french occupation or like french presence in west africa has crowded out such investment they have competitive deals there that crowds out china it can always be more right second right we think china and russia have an incentive to care about their image and allies given all their past mistakes we told you that china has gone after debt restructuring after debt restructuring for instance the g20, for instance, the G20 initiative, right? But lastly, on a mechanism they never dealt with, on multipolarity, we told you from first that two actors on a seat is obviously better than one actor because you're better able to get competition. You're better able to see which deals you can get from different countries playing your hand. On eighth then, they say, we told you, like we told you down the bench that France is literally in a debt crisis. And the problem is that they lack capacity, right? For instance, France's GDP is 3 trillion, while China's GDP is 18 trillion. That is a huge difference here, right? So the capacity is totally different.

But it doesn't flow that this means that France will send in troops and manpower to deal with jihadist insurgencies because that is far too financially and politically costly. Hence, we told you that the likely alternative they are currently engaging with with Italy is to secure transit routes, right? Not rooting out jihadist violence on the ground. Or another alternative is that you just deport them like Sunak is, like they said we should look at Rishi Sunak. Then they say in 03, but you have UN peacekeepers. But obviously, this still depends on the political capital from Western countries, in which it is very domestically unpopular to be sending in troops to these places. Why was our alternative of Russia and China far better? They say human rights abuses by Wagner Group because A. lets accountability B. offensive weaponry is sold badly. Look, both sides have examples that we can but when we gave structural incentives, right? First, we told you the times are changing. You need allies and to secure new markets given sanctions. Hence, you're likely to end this violence earlier, right? Look, any war is going to have any abuses, but they let this slide through the inaction of the French government. On our side, we may have short-term abuses, but it is likely to be temporary. But even in their best case, we think Russia is willing to send in manpower or PMCs, while France is likely to use airstrikes because they want to avoid the body bag effect.

The French promise after decolonization in the 1960s was that West African states would develop with the support of France and be militarily protected. But in 2024, West African states like Chad and Niger are the poorest states in the region. Operation Barkhane was a decade-long failure that never dealt with the terrorists that now threaten the region. An anti-French sentiment has led to three out of eight West African states forcing out the military presence of France. What we support on side government is that it's much better for France to start a tactical withdrawal and a continued exit from West Africa rather than being forced out of West African nations violently and relations being further broken down. First point of setup, what is French West Africa? These are countries that were colonized by France in the past, including eight nations of Senegal, Guinea, Côte d'Ivory, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Benin. Second point of setup, what is the status quo of West African states? France's decolonization process was quite unique. It didn't decolonize and give these states independence, but it coerced these states to remain in a program called state services through threats and political assassinations. There are two problems caused by this. The first is stability and security. It looks like rising threats from Islamist insurgency and political instability, both of which were caused by anti-French sentiments. It also looks like economic problems that come from the exploitation rooted in neo-colonialism, which looks like French companies owning almost all the natural resources in these West African states. Third point of setup, what does France's exit from West Africa look like? This exit includes the political, military, and economic exit from West Africa, which includes the forced exits that have already happened, but we also support the proactive efforts that are ongoing to exit West Africa. Three notes on the exit. Firstly, France can still pursue any other forms of relations that are based on equal national sovereignty and international law. For example, it can still provide preferential trade agreements that all EU states give to their past colonial states. Secondly, some of the exits have already happened, like in Mali and Niger. Some of the exits are ongoing. We want to support both sorts of exits. And thirdly, this exit doesn't happen all at once, but it needs to start now to avoid further harms to African states. The burdens of proof then. Firstly, why France's exit fulfills the French obligation to decolonize through upholding sovereignty and supporting self-determination. Secondly, why France's exit improves the economic and political landscape within West Africa. On the split, I'll talk about the principle of why we fulfill the principle obligation to decolonize by upholding sovereignty and self-determination. My second speaker will talk about increased African cooperation. Before I move on to my argument, sure. Why has the death toll from militant jihadism worn down since the Obama-Greta Kaine Valley security partner in 2001? We reject the premise that French exit has caused these harms. The reason why these jihadists are in power and the reason why these juntas are in power is because of the decades past of French staying in these countries, which led to anti-French sentiments that caused the jihadists and caused these juntas to rise into power in the first place. What you support then is the increase in anti-French sentiment, which will cause the other five of the eight to have the same problems that exist in terms of jihadists and juntas. On to the first argument then about why France's exit fulfilled the principal obligation of national sovereignty and self-determination. Firstly, why is sovereignty and self-determination the most important principle to maintain and interact international relations? In the past, through colonialism, and in the present, through neocolonialism, the right of these nations to self-determine is violated. This is the principle of international governments. These people have the right to decide who looks after them and how they are looked after, and this is infringed when France controls these nations. But secondly, in both the colonial past and in the present, the people of these states have had practically no say in how their country is governed. And this is problematic because it infringes on the rights of the core of democracy and freedom, which Western states support. Why, then, does France infringe on the national sovereignty of West African states in three key metrics? Firstly, let's talk about military control. France has permanent military bases across West African states. It's a looming threat for any West African state that wants to distance itself from France. But also, French control over the region's finances means that it impacts the military and security spending of these states, which reduces these states' ability to conduct warfare. There's both a principle and practical contendence. On the principle, these West African states never consented to these agreements. They were coerced into these defense and military agreements. But practically, these countries cannot hire any other form of military support because it would seem to anger the French, even if hiring these other forms of military support would benefit them. What then does the military exit look like on our side of the house? It looks like the withdrawal of French troops currently stationed in West African countries. Some examples of this is the exit in Niger and Mali and Burkina Faso, which we think is somewhat regrettable, because the increase in anti-French sentiment resulted in coups that forced the French military powers out. What we think then is a planned French exit in the other of these countries would allow for a much smoother transition of power. Instead of an imposition of French military support, these countries are free to choose the version of military support that best suits the needs of their own countries. For example, sovereign troops for their own countries, military support and alliances from regional blocs like ECOWAS and G5, but also government-hired PMCs. Instead of the ineffective Operation Barcane, these states are then free to choose a form of military support they need, for example, foreign actors. Why, then, are foreign actors comparatively better than France? Assuming all foreign actors act in their self-interest, foreign actors like Turkey, India, Russia, and China are likely to be better actors than France for three separate reasons. The first is because partnerships are based on political consent and equal sovereignty. The reason why these military support will be there is not because France imposed it upon these West African states, but upon these West African states, but because these West African states chose these military powers, which gives them more negotiating power because they get to choose from different powers. Secondly, local people are more open to working with these powers. The reason why French military intervention in these states was so unproductive is because locals and local groups actively resisted French in these areas. But thirdly, these military groups are just more effective in terms of security and defense. PMCs are historically much better at fighting against insurgencies in West African states. China historically has a very good track record of preventing piracy in maritime trade routes. The biggest example of this is Russia's expeditionary corps, which were able to take down insurgent groups in Mali when France couldn't even stop them from going. So in terms of military control, we better allow these states to have sovereignty over controlling their own state. I'll take it. Why is it likely that China will come in? You expect happy good, but you never expect it's likely. It's empirically true that the thought group won't stay in the country. It's empirically true that China and Russia are in West Africa, and it's also true that they have incentives to enter. The fact is that these incentives are much better and much Africa, and it's also true that they have incentives to enter. The fact is that these incentives are much better and much more transparent because it's clear that you're trading some natural resources for some military protection as opposed to imposing France onto these countries without any form of choice from these countries. Secondly, then, on economic control. France controls the CFA franc, which is the currency used by all West African nations, which has allowed French companies to buy African resources without any transaction fees. France also holds veto power in the Central Bank of West African states. It's used this veto power to block Cote d'Avry from being refinanced by the bank when it wanted to distance itself from France. French companies also own a large majority of the natural resource deposits in these West African states. This disproportionate control then over West African economies infringes heavily on the national sovereignty of these countries. The reason why is because economic decisions are now not within the control of these countries."

Instead, they recognise the government somewhat, and they somewhat attempt to do things like cooperate with them. This is likely because Chad and Gabon haven't removed France after the military coups because it was in their interest to keep France there. We would just simply argue it was also in the interest of these other governments as well. It's possible that France provides some economic consentions. They've already reformed the CFA franc. We think that if France just doesn't generally get kicked out economically. However, note that not all countries in West Africa are dictatorships. Senegal and Mauritania are also still democracies. We can say they can have democratic relationships with France."

Note they provide you a sea of alternatives and never prove one, never give you examples of where it's true. We'd say that the Wagner group is most likely for two reasons. Firstly, it's empirically true that the Wagner group is working with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, but this is not an accident. Many of these countries are fighting military jihadism in the region and require some level of security partner, so they prioritize the Russian private military security partner. And secondly, Wagner is the only place that fits lots of their criteria, being a non-Western hegemon coloniser, being interested in Western Africa militarily and economically. Russia wants resources so bad because of the war, they have the capacity to do stuff like put boots on the ground in West Africa. They have put boots on the ground in West Africa. Has China? No, they have not. They cannot prove that as likely. But note the alternatives they provide, maybe the China, maybe US, maybe a sea of one that they never even pick to. Don't let them run away by never picking or proving a comparative. It just won't be likely because first, these countries are very isolationist. China is scaling back things like the Belt and Road Initiative. US is becoming more isolationist. And secondly, often just not empirically true. They can't get away with that. So noting that we have the likely comparative, we go ahead. I'll take your point now."

              "text": "Do you support France ever leaving West Africa? And if you do, who decides when France leaves? We think that people should democratically decide at some point whether they want to have relationships with other countries. Maybe hundreds of years in the future it might be a good idea. Let's just have the debate here rather than having speculative debates about things we don't know about. So, next thing on to the principle of sovereignty. Three ways that we get up on this. Firstly, not all countries want France out. Chad, the Ivory Coast and Senegal want to keep France in there, and when France does leave and do exit, they don't get that represented in what they want. They no longer get those relationships with France. They lose their sovereign decision there. Secondly, lots of the countries they point to have become dictatorships in the absence of France. They even force kicking out France, even when it does not reflect the will of the people, by using propaganda and force to silence dissidents that agree with keeping France because it is good for them economically. And also there are people living in dictatorships cannot affect their government. So we don't care about sovereignty because it means states get sovereignty. It's because people get their democratic will reflected when democracies have crumbled after France has fallen out. That means that sovereignty no longer matters because people do not get to affect their own government. Third reason is that Wagner is just far, far more coercive than France is. The countries in West Africa are far less powerful than they did when France was there. And note, you may not believe that. That's in the practical argument."

              "text": "Why is this better for West Africa? Four reasons. The first reason is France is just far, far more accountable than Wagner Group is or China or whatever comparative they want to give you. Why is it true that France is more accountable? Firstly, France is currently facing backlash on reaping the benefits of colonialism through international organisations like the EU. The Italian leader Giorgio Maloney is doing a lot of backlash against France for reaping benefits of colonialism. Obviously places like the Wagner Group in Russia do not face the same extent of backlash politically from international organisations. Even if China is the comparative, they don't face that extent of backlash because they're more separated from the political world. Second reason they're more accountable is they have more domestic political backlash. Because France has a population that cares about human rights, they have a strong African minority population that can do backlash if they do bad things in West Africa and entirely stuff it up. But the comparative here is autocracies, not even democracies. Even if you did believe that there were African people in China, they could not vote in those cases. They were unable to get that benefit. But the third part is the existence of France in these countries. It means there's more free media which is able to hold you accountable and hold these governments accountable. The free media does not exist when a PMC of the bargaining group comes in there. Free media doesn't exist when the China comparative comes in there. That's it. So what are the impacts of this accountability? Firstly, elections are run more fairly and do not cement the ruling party so that you can get good deals for Russia and favour them. Secondly, you're able to drain far less resources as the external power of France from there, whereas Russia is able to drain resources to fund its war. And thirdly, you're less likely to take brutal methods to enforce stability like the Wagner Group would execute an entire village to kill two jihadists, because it didn't matter that they killed a bunch of civilians in the context, because they were not accountable to doing that. They would do it in the quickest way possible. That explains, far more accountable on our side, West Africa would be better off with France. Second reason that West Africa is better off with France is that France has more capacity to be able to do good things for them. Why is it true that France has more capacity? Firstly, France just has far more money and isn't currently actively fighting a conflict. The Wagner Group has far less money and is actually fighting a conflict in Russia. They have less capacity to spend time in West Africa and focus there. But secondly, they have specific resources to being a free and fair democracy, like free press and election officials, that they can implement here that Wagner Group does not. The impacts of this are first on democracy. France is able to uniquely bring in news outlets and election experts that ensure free press and free elections. On the economy, France has the capacity to invest in building up the infrastructure, which massively improves the quality of life for these people, doing things like improving transportation networks, improving port systems, so that they can help them overall. And also on stability, France has special ops able to limit the number of civilian casualties rather than summarily executing an entire village. They have enough and good enough troops to ensure stability. Note that the Wagner group is actually fighting conflict in Russia. That's where their best troops are going. Their worst troops are going here, which means they have less capacity to do good things. But note at the end of this, you didn't even have to believe that France had good incentive, didn't have to believe that we were doing this well, you just had to believe that having more troops was a deterrent. The fact that France was a big military power meant you wouldn't start a conflict in the first place, didn't have to believe that we'd intervene well, just that we didn't do separatist states, you didn't do coups because you were scared that France would be able to have the capacity to intervene in a way that the Wagner group would not, and that they have had many uprisings and coups in separate estates on their side. Third reason that the France is better off is that they just have an incentive to do better things. Even if you think they intervene the same amount because they don't deter, they have a better incentive. Why is this true? Three reasons. Firstly, they probably care about healing and repairing the colonial damage that they did. They're not an entirely evil country. The Wagner Group literally is kind of entirely evil, right? The comparative here may be France, you don't think that they're politically great, but they're not evil. The Wagner Group literally is. Secondly, the Wagner has strong negative incentives because they need to exploit resources. They will lose the war if they don't get the oil, the lithium and the uranium they need for their military systems, for their energy systems. Maybe both countries have economic incentives to somewhat take resources out of West Africa. One is about making your country a little bit better. One is about stopping you from losing a war. Obviously the one where you're stopping your country from losing a war means you're far more likely to exploit heavily on their side. But thirdly, France leaving, even if they don't do it well, just creates a power vacuum on their side. It means that there are leaving, even if they don't do it well, just creates a power vacuum on their side. It means that there are a bunch of local actors trying to exploit West Africa, trying to get their own benefits out of it. At best, it's transitional, harmless opposition. They never do the legwork to prove it's transitional. It's empirically still going. When is it going to stop? You guys need to tell us when the conflicts in West Africa will stop, because France exited. The impact of this is that democracy, it means remaining democracies in West Africa remain there, and the Wagner Group doesn't actively prop up military governments to serve Russia. It means that France uniquely has an incentive for sustainability of the whole region, not just protecting the mining sector, whether they can exploit resources from, they want to protect everyone, and a West Africanist economy to serve themselves. Lastly, is that France, you get more negotiating, the last mechanism, is you get more negotiating power when you've made deals with France than you did in the Wagner group. Nearly all that coercion does not stand up this mechanism because these countries right now in West Africa are facing existential crisis that they point to, which means they're in a uniquely bad negotiating position after the exit of France from West Africa. So they're making bad deals with Wagner. When France went in the 1950s during an era of decolonisation, it was not politically as much acceptable than to do the exploitation that's happening. These states had far more negotiating power, meant they're far better off. This means that African countries are less likely to prop up dictatorial regimes and trade off. We win on democracy, economy, stability in West Africa from this. Very, very proud to oppose. I thank the first proposition speaker for the speech and now to continue the debate"

The incentives exist for other actors to come in as well, panel, because West Africa is still a resource-rich nation, a region with some things to offer in terms of trading as a trading partner.

              "text": "But secondly, on the principle of sovereignty, because they told you that the alternative of diplomatic and equal relations is not possible, like the alternative of equal relations with countries such as China or countries like the Wagner Group is not possible, yet under their side they say that they're going to try to claim a more equal relation with France, where France somehow gives power and sovereignty to these nations. We told you that this is very untrue because of their very own characterizations panel. Because these nations have historically depended on France, meaning that if you continue these same sort of relationships without necessarily giving France an ultimatum, France has no incentive to give you more power because they know that without them for example you may hurt in certain ways if there are if there are not other actors and so equitable deals don't exist under their side if they want a democratic choice democratic choice occurs more under our side when there are more options to choose from when these countries such as China India and Turkey all want something from West African nations and West African nations are the ones who can, for example, have negotiating power, meaning that they can negotiate for more favorable terms of trade. And also, let us note that under our comparative, countries in West Africa, if they choose to do so, can still interact with France on an economic or trade level, it's just that France is not physically within their country imposing their laws on them. This means that if you really depended on France as a partner of trade, you could still do so, but this is under your own terms. It is not under the imposition of colonialism. But their principal argument comes under this framing that not all countries want France out, and somehow countries become worse dictatorships in the absence of France. Note that a lot of their problems that they give you have been caused as a result of France in the first place. Things like military hinders would not have risen up if France did not fail to adequately provide these citizens with the resources, with the development that they needed. France was the actor that needed to go. But this ignores a lot of my first speaker's argument that we already told you, that these countries were ones that wanted France out, that this is why three out of the eight nations have already forced France to leave on a military scale, because the incentive of these nations is now one of call-outs, right? It's now one where they wanted to be sovereign. It's now one where they wanted to control their democracy, or they wanted to control their nation economically, and this was the only way they could do so don't let them get away with the principle of France somehow giving these countries sovereignty when they haven't done so for six decades sure do you think military dictators like Saddam Hussein represent the will of the Russian I think that what is worse is that France at least under their side was never supported by the popular will of the people at least military dictators at some point garnered some support in order to be able to rise up. Comparatively, we know that this is not the best case, but it is better than one where people have no say at all. Second issue on insurgencies and violence. Firstly, I reject the premise that the high death toll is mutually exclusive. On both sides, civilians had to die. The difference is that under our side, when you have countries like China who actively train the military, who actively are coming in to fund the national military, you actually have decreased insurgency. You actually solve the problems created by France. What happens under their side is worse. And I'm going to flip this because in the future, at least when France leaves, you de-escalate the conflicts that were started from France in the first place. When you have less polarization, when you have less ability for these extremist insurgent groups to capitalize off of people's anti-French rhetoric, that is when you get less of these insurgencies in the first place. You have less of the rhetoric in the first place, which means that in the first place, you don't have the insurgencies that you have to deal with. Even if in the worst, worst case, we trade off the deaths right now that are marginally higher, we think this is a worth it trade-off for the long run, where you don't have as many of the uprisings that occur under their side and the violence that occurs. But third on the development of West Africa, I think it's very ironic that they say that the French can be held accountable, because if the French truly could be held accountable, they would have been gone 60 years ago, at the point where they could not develop West Africa,"

I think this is simply untrue looking at the facts where Operation Barking was a huge failure just because the French were very reactive because they didn't want to put in their resources, because they had no incentive to actually save you before the problems occurred, because they were only willing to do so after the fact, when it started to affect their economy or when it started to affect the actual benefits that they reaped as a country. I think France, in the first place, is much worse under their side. West Africa is better off, though, on a flip, under our wealth, in terms of development. This is because of the very stability that they want to talk about. Stability is the code word for stagnation panel, because under their wealth, what France refuses to do is actually allow these economies to develop, is actually allow the development or creation of new infrastructure. What you do when you peg the, for example, CFA franc to the euro, is you essentially force these West African nations to develop European policies. This stagnates them because European policies, which are focused on low inflation rates, are focused on things like stability. This has historically hurt weak nations, such as Greece before. It continues to hurt West African nations, who are developing nations, who cannot live under stability. What they need is growth, and that growth only occurs when a shift in regime is actually occurring. It is not caused by stability. But now I'm going to move on to my substantive then on how Francis Exit uniquely fosters African cooperation. At the top of this argument, I'd just like to characterize that the degree of interference that France imposes on their previous colonies is unmatched by any other previous colonial power. But France's exit uniquely promotes cooperation because French direct interference undermines pan-Africanism. In the past, the influence of the French on aspects of controlling West African nations directly clashed against these ideals of removing the white man's power and becoming empowered. And even in the present, even when France has lost control, states are still divided. This is reflected in polarized discussions around keeping or changing the economy from using the currency of the franc. To move towards collective collaboration for African nations, this is much better to dissociate from the French imposition completely for two reasons. One, the removal of a symbol of past extremism shows the willingness of a country to move forward to a different future, but two, you're likely to have more political and economic compromises when countries actually accept each other as legitimate African nations and not as extensions of French imperialism as a whole. The impact of this argument is very clear. We have countries that work together more. We have countries working together towards very important developmental improvements, like Agenda 2063, which aims to improve economic integration, like African Continental Free Trade Area, which aims to boost the trade and unify the continent this is an exclusive benefit we bring on on side government so proud to propose I thank the second proposition speaker for a great speech. We will give panel 10 seconds to finish our remarks. Thank you for your patience."

China had never been in a standing war since 1978 after they failed miserably in Vietnam. They would never be willing to do that. But thirdly, even on an economic level, China was scaling back its BRI because they were economically struggling, because they cared more about domestic circulation than its international sphere. And the strategic implication is quite devastating for this case, right? Because firstly, their position just utterly fails. These countries do not have an autonomy other than Wagner. They have to choose Wagner. Therefore, all status of sovereignty go out of the debate. Secondly, it means that their economic arguments also don't work because West Africa can't just pick the best deal. They have to accept the deal that's given by Wagner.

              "text": "The first way we win this debate is on their own metric of the principle of sovereignty, because they say, we need to fulfil French's obligation to leave West Africa, and stuff like that. A couple of things to note here. Firstly, it's unclear that France's presence violates sovereignty because France has increasingly made concessions to not be seen as neocolonial, they've made substantial changes because of international scrutiny. This looks like, for example, reforms to the CFA fact that they referenced in their own speech. This is something we can claim on their outside as well. But also, the fact that these countries wanted France to come back. Mali literally invited France to come in to help with the jihadism, right? But also, a world in which France does not exit presumably means that France makes concessions to these countries. It shows a willingness to cooperate with them and treat them as a security partner, not as a colonial. Secondly, it's unclear that military dictatorships who wanted France out represented the true will of the people. We think that coup makers often had very dubious popular support because they jailed dissidents, because they jailed political leaders who opposed them. This was not a functional democracy that this team operated under. It was a dictatorship. It is unclear that the sovereignty, that the dictatorship preference is the reflection of the people. We think that this argument isn't the average person in this country wanting a colonial power out. It's rather a military dictatorship wanting any sort of Western accountability that can hold their cruelty and their atrocities in account, wanting to throw us out. We think that that is unclear. But thirdly, it's unclear that Prott discharges this principle. Obviously, it is practically contingent on whether the comparative, as I alluded to in my introduction, can also ensure self-determination and sovereignty. Obviously, it is contingent on them proving that the alternative is not much worse. They said that, oh, alternative countries are better because Western Africa can choose who comes in. But this is obviously not true. Firstly, empirically, Walnut is in these countries most of the cases. But secondly, Wu explains that why other countries are not the case. But we also flip this, right? Because Wu explains in his own speech why the negotiating power of West African countries in this current context is far less than what it was in the 1950s when French companies came in. Because these countries are now facing existential crisis and existential threats from jihadism, they are now in a much more desperate state in which they are willing to just take whatever violence offers them, they are now in a much more desperate state in which they are willing to just take whatever vulnerability offers them, because they are literally under existential threat, right? In our comparative, when French companies and French forces came into the 1950s in the decolonisation era, they were not under existential threat by jihadists, so obviously they had far more negotiating power in our world in the 1950s, so obviously they could negotiate far more favorable terms. That is why, comparatively, we are far, far better at discharging this principle. If they want to win this debate on principle grounds, they need to do some practical analysis. They can't just keep relying on their principle crush. But no doubt charitability and engaging with their main win part, at the end of this, we've mitigated it, we've basically mitigated it down to nothing. We've flipped it in many contexts, as Roy alluded to in his own speech, and we've shown you that it is clearly, practically contingent. But this wasn't really what the debate"

              "text": "was about, right? We won for a second time over when we proved that France's presence was crucial for West African stability in two ways. Firstly, France deterred the eruption of ethnic and separatist conflicts. It deterred many cruises from happening. Secondly, it was far better at fighting jihadism than any other actor. What did they say? They firstly said that Operation Balkan didn't work and that PMCs are better at fighting insurgencies. Firstly, France was very good at fighting insurgencies in Operation Balkane. They shared information and logistics, such as in Nigeria. They recaptured several cities in Operation Seville, such as Gao, from jihadists. Balkane was a relative success. But also, we think that jihadism was just a problem that neither team could solve in this debate. Jihadism was a problem that arose from structural reasons like inequality, etc. Like, Wagner couldn't solve jihadism on their side. But maybe France couldn't eliminate jihadism entirely, but they've done the best job that we've seen so far because they contain jihadism reasonably well, because they've stopped jihadists from overrunning major cities. Wagner has done a terrible job. Local governments have been incompetent in three distinct ways. Firstly, because Wagner is just actively evil and doesn't care about human rights. In Mora, for example, Wagner literally tortured and killed 500 civilians, all from an ethnic minority group. Tactics are blunt and horrifying. It looks like scorching entire villages suspected of hiding jihadists. This isn't effective counter-terrorism strategies. These are brutal and cruel human atrocities that Wagner is carrying out. This actively worsens jihadism because it radicalises members of the jihadist group and the local population because the tactics that Wagner uses are so blunt and indiscriminate that it radicalises more people than anti-French sentiment. But also because Russia is stretched thin in the Ukraine war because it's lacking equipment, which means that they often give the worst equipment to these countries. They often just give like cluster, cluster bombs that are, like, Soviet-era-style cluster bombs, which means that these countries have no choice but to carpet-bomb entire villages to fight jihadists, but also because local governments are often too poor and often divided by ethnic conflicts to fight jihadism. But a new response. We think that France has a unique incentive, other than Rwanda, to protect regional stability in West Africa, for the reason that France is very close to West Africa, so the problems in West Africa have a very high chance of spilling over into France. For example, building resentment or insurgency or terrorism makes it likely that those terrorists also attack France. We've seen this in the past. 82 terrorist attacks have been committed in France in the past few decades comparatively so this gives them a very clear incentive to preserve regional stability to decrease the amount of terrorism in the area. Comparatively, China and Russia are far, far, far away which means that they don't have as far of a big incentive to preserve regional stability, to decrease the amount of terrorism in the area. Comparatively, China and Russia are far, far, far away, which means that they don't have as far of a big incentive to combat jihadism. Their best claim was that, oh, the increased anti-French sentiment was what led to jihadists radicalizing in the first place. Three responses to this. Firstly, this isn't a retrospective debate. You guys can't regret France colonizing West Africa and this anti-French sentiment not existing in the first place. Obviously, anti-French sentiment exists on either side. So military junta and jihadists are also radicalised. You guys can't rely on that. But secondly, the obvious response here is that juntas and military coup makers aren't motivated by anti-French sentiments. They're not anti-French-driven movements. They're often ideological movements. They're often religious movements, which means that anti-French sentiment is not the-French driven movements. They're often ideological movements. They're often religious movements, which means that anti-French sentiment is not the crucial part of these movements. These movements still exist in isolation. But we flip this for two reasons. Firstly, because as I alluded to before, jihadism gets worse because the tactics that are used are far, far worse and far, far brutal for the civilian population. But secondly, because as Will pointed out, these hunters can consolidate power far easily when a non-Western state is in far easily when a non-Western state is in their country, and a non-Western state allows them to do things like suppress the population and crack down on press freedom, right? If it was France, they wouldn't allow those Hunters to do that, so therefore we don't have the Hunters consolidating power in these regions. What is the impact in Wayne here? This wasn't some abstract benefit of regional security. This was the most concrete and legitimate impact in this round. It meant that innocent civilians didn't die in horrifying ways. It meant that jihadists didn't overrun cities and ethnic and separatist conflicts didn't raise their villages to the crown. Why does this outweigh the principle? Three pieces of way. Firstly, because stability is a logically prior precondition to literally everything else in this round. Economics, stability, everything. People needed to be alive in order to access any of the self-determination or sovereignty benefits. Countries and economies needed to know that the region was stable in order to invest in these reasons. For those reasons, we think that stability is an obvious win for our side. That wins us the debate. For those reasons,"

Why didn't they go into these countries and impose CFA franc, impose the ability for them to take control of all the mine? No, thank you. And thirdly, take control of their military to make sure that who gets into power and fund pro-French leaders. At the end of the day, they're not here to be nice, panel. If they were so nice, why are they still the most poor countries in the world? Because they still did not accept that the majority of problems that happen in West Africa is literally caused by France. It is sufficiently important to hear them, no thank you, that if France had good incentives, they would never be here in the first place. They can talk about international scrutiny and freedom of press in all instances, but they never prove to me why this actually happens."

We don't understand how UN would come in and check and balance on them, no thank you, because at the end of the day, France already puts large control over those areas and makes sure that other individuals cannot come in. That means, and secondly, I have a really, really big problem with our imperialist language, because they say that sometimes sovereignty is not important because they might turn to a dictator and they might make bad decisions. The first thing, not all dictatorial countries are the same as Saddam Hussein, which they talk about. No, thank you. That means then that dictatorial countries can also be, for instance, should not be subjected to neocolonialism, because, for instance, under those countries, when they make bad decisions, there are still things, for example, checks and balance and coups that can come up. But the important thing here is that at the end of the day, it's about state legitimacy and making bad decisions. Because making bad decisions would exist under both sides of the House, no thank you, but only under our side do those bad decisions are much, much better. Because the bad decision on their side is literally blame on the colonial masters that screws up French sentiments and makes sure that under their side of the House, the colonial masters make much worse regional stability. Under our side, maybe some instance says, no thank you, there are the house, the colonial masters make much worse regional stability. Under our side, maybe some instance says, no, thank you, there are bad decisions, but at the end of the day, it's about sovereignty, that people are seen as a legitimate state, and they can take them accountable and make sure that the representation of the people was there. Secondly, then, they cannot just say that all countries in here are dictatorial, because they say simply under theirs are the house of democracies as well. So under those democracies, why are French still imposing all of their narratives under these countries? It is for them now to make decisions on their own, and this is the most important impact in this round. Why was this truly sufficient for us to win then? Number one, we explore the choices we shall talk about. That's why we get much better choices on who you choose as your partner, and you get much better choices on how you want to protect your citizens. That's why you see in status quo, Mali, after French left,"

Because they're literally kidnapping individuals, literally torturing communities to take territory. I think that it was fine for them to escalate warfare to make sure that their citizens are protected. Secondly, then, principle and sovereignty make sure that it was only under our state of the house that they weren't subjected to the same colonial masters, no thank you, that they were talking about. Colonialism is the worst form because you don't give them control and you don't allow them to develop. Secondly then, on democracy, I just want to note here that number one, in terms of democracy, on their side of the house, the countries that are already democratic is sufficiently important. No, thank you. Because we told you since first speaker that the reason these countries turned non-democratic was because of the French. The fact that anti-French sentiments needed to come up to make sure that military coups kicked the French out and pressured the French to go out. That was the reason why dictatorial regimes only come on their side of the house. And the countries that are already still democratic is the most impactful in this round. They cannot say, oh, it's a regrets debate, but we still have five other countries that will be affected under their side of the house. But secondly, these things are reversible, right? Because at the end of the day, dictatorial regimes can transition at the end of the day. On our side of the house, when you prove that there's less anti-French sentiments, which you see in status quo, we are really, really happy with other countries coming in. No, thank you. That means that under our set of house, it's much more likely that we can transition to a democracy where people are not literally having military coups every single second. That's why in status quo, military coups are the most, and 72% are in Africa, and in that 10 to 28 coups, 72% are in Africa. That's why in democracy, we get much, much better on our side because the French didn't represent the people and only represented their own interests. On our side then, we get much better actors. No, thank you, because one, we tell you that you can choose your own troops. You can choose G5 alliance forces. You can choose PMCs around the world. Turkey has already put their troops into Niger and Nigeria because of the same resources that we wanted to talk about under our side of the house. There was a much more choices and equal exchanges and negotiation can only come on our side when you have competition, when you have competition from many actors to make sure that these states have sovereignty and these states make the best decision for our own West African nations. So by that metric then, on their side, they're very, very imperialist, they cannot win this round. No, thank you. Oh, before I move on, sure, point. In the absence of France, Russia is taking oil, lithium, and from the West African states to fund their recolonization of Ukraine. Ukraine is losing to its colonial power, Russia. Why is this justified? Okay, the justifiable thing is that they traded normally. Not every political trade and transactions would never be equal. But the point here is that they make concessions. For instance, they actually put in military troops that are effective. On their side of the house, those trades are ones in which are extremely neocolonial, in which literally come into the country and remove their sovereignty."

We told you on terrorism, the root cause is literally France. Because in that Sahel region, the region where it's much more controlled by France, people needed to turn away from governments and turn to other support structures. For instance, anti-French sentiments that started this Southerner terrorist group in the first place to make sure that they claim territory and make a state of their own. Operation Barque No Thank You was largely unsuccessful because of their passive nature. Structural reason here was very simple. France was extremely reactionary and knew that under their side of the house, France would still take the benefits under the instance that terrorist groups are still there or not. This was sufficient then because they cannot talk about civilians because civilian deaths are likely to happen under both sides of the house. But it's important that only under our side, no thank you, that with the civilian deaths we also get effective terrorist combatants. Why? Because these states escalate warfare to make sure that these people proactively go into those regions, proactively make operations to make sure that the region is lacking of terrorism. We may not solve it in the best instance, but we make sure that it was only under our side, that we did it well and make sure that they didn't expand anymore, like they say on their side.

Firstly, before that, I'll quickly deal with our second speaker, substantive on African cooperation, in case they want to whip it out of the play. First thing is just, this is not true. These African nations won't just start cooperating when, like, France leaves. The reason why there are conflicts are often because there are ethnic conflicts. Look at the many ethnic minority conflicts, for example, in Mali, between the majority race and the minority race. There are lots of Fulani Muslims in other countries. There are ethnic conflicts fuelled by these regions. But also opposition maximally exacerbates this conflict because the moment they had jihadism bleeding through the borders because the borders were porous, because of poor Russian tactics in actually targeting these jihadist conflicts. These African nations are actively turned against each other. That was why their last path to victory never stood. So then, quickly on the principle, that the way they try to win this debate is on the principle. Note that was just intrinsically problematic because firstly, we already proved that they never discharged their principle in the first place, that these countries weren't able to choose, and we have never heard response from opposition."

They had to give resource concessions because they had to deliver on their promises of keeping security safe. Exactly because of their rhetoric or because of what they said at third, that these dictators no longer have excuse to blame everything on France. That was the exact moment, or an additional reason, why they were likely to get unprofessional deals from military groups, because now they had to bring these military groups in because they had to deliver their promises of opposition, if that was opposition's best case.

For example, Senegal. They never discussed that principle in the first place. But the most detrimental impact was when they tried to win on democracy. When they tried to say that countries wanted... When they tried to say that, oh, they'll somehow get democracy in the long term. That was just structurally impossible. They never listened to our case. Because we already told you how Wagner Group or China or any other PMCs had no incentive to keep democracies in this region. You actively evicted democracy. That was why you actively lost on the principle that you discharged. At the end of this, even if you believe that they won on their principle, why do we still weigh this out? Because we told you it was just logically downstream to stability. People had to be alive in order to assert their right to self-determination. We were the side that kept people from jihadist attacks. We were the side that kept people alive. We were very proud to defend that. So that was their own path to victory. They argued from first to third and that was why they lost. So on our win path then then why do we get more stability firstly let's firstly let's talk about jihadist insurgency because they tried to shift at third and try to say that we actually get more warfare we told you we told you on your side you were actually the side that actually got more warfare because you were bringing other pmcs in we told you these had, firstly, less trained troops because the Wagner group literally pulled people from prison. They were less trained than the people from the French army. But also, we also were able to show you that these groups simply didn't have investment into these regions. These groups simply didn't care about these regions enough, as we told you at third. That never got a response from them, and that was extremely detrimental. But the last response here is just to say that the France army was a much bigger deterrent for these countries because of the mere military presence there, because France had the extra incentive to preserve its security. Their last push was trying to say that, oh, France was controlling these resources, therefore harming the stability of these regions. Firstly, this is just not true. Like, France mining companies are literally, like, paying taxes. I just don't think that this is true. But also, note that this is less true on our comparative, because for France to say, they probably had to make some concessions. For example, pay mining taxes. That was just untrue on the comparative. That was not what we had to defend. But no, on their side, it was much worse because Wagner tried to take control of these resources in order to fund the war in Russia. That was such a worse impact on their side. Not to mention we gave you a bunch of impacts. If you still think this clash was a deadlock, we gave you a bunch of impacts on coastal Western African nations, on how jihadism was now able to bleed through the border because of the brutal tactics that PMCs are likely to employ. These actively threatened the stability of this region, and that was why they actively lose on this issue, and that was why we won on this issue. Before I move on, yes? Proactive, specialised PMCs who eliminate terrorist groups, why is this conduction of warfare better? Because they are literally not professional. We told you firstly they never had the incentive to put the best troops in West Africa, listen to our case. But also we told you that France was actually, like fighting jihadism, was actually just quite hard. We told you that these places never had intelligence infrastructure. We told you that France was probably doing its best. They were the side that had to provide mechanisms on why these streets are wetter. We had provided you a couple of structural examples of that, first and second, and they never responded to that. The end result of this was that in our region, we got more stability. People didn't have to live their lives in here. And that was just a good on the outside of the house. But lastly, let's give a couple of more responses on their economic argument, because they've been trying to say the monetary independence is good. A couple of responses. Firstly, we told you the most coercive elements. For example, the one they wanted to talk about, controlling currencies, we're going to replace anyways. For example, beginning in they wanted to talk about, controlling currencies, were going to replace anyways. For example, beginning in 2027, the ECOWAS countries were concluded that eight CFA franc nation members are adopting the ECO, and they're also removing like 50% of the reserve requirement. So that was just an untrue argument to make on their side. They never got any economic benefits. But also, we just told you that the CFA franc was actually quite good, because you weren't plagued to disable euros. It eliminates the chance of an uncontrolled inflationary spiral caused by currency collapse. We told you Congo's average rate of inflation was 50%. Zimbabwe suffered from hyperinflation. We never got that on our side. It meant that people could purchase goods and services on our side. But secondly, we told you that currency accepted by euro was just easier to access, easier to trade, that meant we were able to build up countries economic benefits. But lastly, if you remove the peg of the currency, the volatility still made it less attractive to foreign investment. That meant that they never got any of the infrastructure development"

Firstly, because notice the difference in our analytical rigor. Like we've given you all those reasons. They keep asserting it's colonialist and imperialist, and they accuse us of being Western. They don't speak for West Africa. It's not imperialist to care about stability. It's not imperialist to care about democracy. I challenge this team to give us actual analytical reasons instead of accusing us of being Western or just asserting that it is imperialist. But secondly, and crucially, the principle can never get over our point on stability for two reasons. Firstly, because stability and regional peace was just upstream of many of their points, right? Because people didn't feel like they were sovereign and dignified beings at the point at which they were threatened by jihadism in the area, at the point at which Wagner literally killed 500 ethnic minorities because they were threatened by jihadism in the area, at the point at which Wagner literally killed 500 ethnic minorities because they were looking for jihadists in the area. That was not upholding the principle of sovereignty. We thought that people needed to be alive to feel sovereign and feel dignified and feel free. They didn't allow people to do that. But also, secondly, stability was what people cared more about, right? It was coming home to your family every day that people cared more about, not some abstract principle of sovereignty that Thailand seemed to really want to push. So at the end of that, the principle clearly didn't matter, and even if you think it did, stability was far, far more important."

Firstly, because we deterred conflicts and coups from happening in many contexts, and secondly, because we thought jihadists better. They just had two responses to this. Firstly, the only key response is that, oh, the root cause of jihadism and military coups is because of French colonialism. Firstly, not true. Jihadism was a religious thing. It wasn't an anti-French thing. Military coups were anti-democratic, not anti-French. But secondly, empirically, in the countries that France left, these military detaineeships still exist. Terrorists are still running rampant in Mali and Niger. Doesn't make sense for this team to be like, oh, terrorism will disappear if France leaves? Obviously not empirically true, obviously ahistorical. But thirdly, we flip this in two key ways that they never responded to. Firstly, jihadism got worse because, as we told you down the bench, violence tactics were far, far more brutal and far, far more devastating for the local population. And as any guerrilla tactician would know, if you literally crack down on the local population far more extensively, that radicalises the population and turns them into jihadists. But secondly, because France was a democratic actor that cared about democracy and violently actively wanted to keep these military dictatorships in place, they had no incentive to actually transition these hunters into democracies. For those reasons, proud to oppose. China is already expanding Belt and Road Initiative to West Africa."

First, on which actor is better, we told you that France's existence limits other countries' ability to show interest because of the prospect of fighting with France or proxy wars in the ability to show interest. Absent France, you have more alternatives because West Africa is seen as a beneficial nation to trade with. Like any other nation, it is more likely that when you have these alternatives, West Africa is given a choice. But regardless of actor, even if it is Wagner, we told you that regardless of this, at least the choice was given at some point in time. It is not the same as under their world, where France literally forced you to sign an agreement to stay with the state. Otherwise, your military and financial funds were taken away. This was a coercive decision under their world."

The incentives have existed for 60 years, panel, and nothing has ever been done. Don't let them fool you into thinking France is an angel. If they were truly good actors, they did not need to employ French adjacent dynasties in Senegal. They did not need to poison anti-French Cameroon leaders. The media scrutiny they say, though, exists takes a back burner in this debate because when people see that these issues are old news or when these people see other issues that are more pressing in the current world, it is unlikely that active call-outs happen. But even if call-out happened, we tell you that they had no capacity to actually remove the French. Because of the inequitable relationships that have existed for decades and decades, we tell you that they had no capacity to actually remove the French. Because of the inequitable relationships that have existed for decades and decades, we told you that the premise of these relationships was unfair in the first place. So no, they did not have more negotiating power because insurgent groups hadn't arisen yet, according to DLO. They did not have any power at all because they were forced by colonization."

Trades with France can still occur if countries choose to, but this is done under their own terms. Their main pushback was how democracy is disrupted due to military juntas, right? But juntas are the result of decades of pent-up anti-French sentiments. Absent of this, absent of the French strategically leaving, what you have are that these groups continue to get larger and larger and rile more support. It gets worse under their side when the French do not actively leave right now or leave in the near future, which they conceded at first that if in the far future democracy wanted to elect the French to leave, they would be okay with that, right? But the problem is that by that time, you would have had so many more conflicts. You would have had so many more military people coming into power, gaining even more disproportionate control. But they say that if the country wanted to kick them out, they will. This is impossible, given our characterization from first about the disproportionate power that France holds. It's like analogous to saying that sexual assault victims should have just said no. This is not true, panel. You have no ability to say no when you are in a coerced relationship."

France has empirically failed to deal with insurgency. That's why Mali or Niger had to hire PMCs in the first place. But my whip told you that because of international law, France can only react to these things. They cannot preemptively improve or proactively act here. They told you that Wagner has bad incentives. First of all, even if we concede that Wagner group is the group coming in, at least the symmetrical checks and balances exist under both sides if they want to claim that. But moreover, you have more good incentives when there are competition, when you can be threatened to be the power that they don't choose if you don't do a good job. That's why you have the incentive to employ your best troops. And in the long run, we just told you there are less conflicts in general just because of the fact that a lot of anti-French rhetoric is used to fuel other conflicts. Even if they are ethnic conflicts, the anti-French rhetoric is continually undermining, underpinning a lot of these things."

This has been done because of the narrative that France needs to leave, and French control needs to leave. Beyond this, we told you about African cooperation.

Thirdly, we tell you that art and art fellowships is evaluated by art snobs and critics, which usually are the most traditional and privileged. Fourthly, the trend of AI and lack of support for artists and status quo leads to a downward trend of less and less artists enjoy an art. And I should even two arguments. Firstly,"

              "text": "why art is exclusively deserving of a basic income. And then secondly, how do fellowships limit the variety of art? Starting with the first argument, why art is exclusively deserving of basic income. Why art is different from other jobs. It is extremely hard to quantify the goodness of it. Most have a majority of jobs under status quo, can have clearly set tasks and requirements that workers can meet to earn a wage and advance career-wise. Accountants have a set amount of documents to file a day. Programs have a set amount of codes to build. Art is not the same as you cannot pre-set your creativity and creative process, which can take different amounts of time. This makes it really hard for artists to secure a stable job. Look at art, which is produced, for example, one art piece is produced in a year. That is exactly hard to quantify. It's extremely hard to see what exactly you have done all of these days to produce that art. Then secondly, it has intangible value. There are three values of art. Firstly, aesthetic. It is mentally relieving and satisfying for different audiences. Secondly, it's cognitive. It's important to transfer messages, educational value. Thirdly, it's experiential. It's emotionally valuable. But movements use it and push people to the action. And lastly, know how art is extremely subjective. Firstly, all types of art have a niche audience. People like different things, have different tastes. Thus, it is extremely hard to measure what is good art, and what you can quantify as good art, what you can pay for, and what you cannot pay for. But also, it changes over time. Art pieces are often disregarded, they're seen as unimportant in present times. But after some time, they're seen as the most influential pieces, simply because people were not ready for them. Look at Van Gogh's art, that was not valued in the time but now it is seen as the most influential art and artist in a while. What does this essentially prove? We posit that art is an exclusive in a way that firstly all of it is important and deserves recognition and funding it always has some value. But also, it is a field that makes it hard to secure a job for an artist, no? Why is it bad without basic income? Firstly, it is extreme emotional damage to the artist. Notice how artists have inherent needs to create art. It's when you just have to write it into a book to feel satisfied, when We just must tell that story and share that message through a paintbrush. What this means is that on their side of the house, they have an intense mental suffering. They're unable to do that. When they're pushed into other jobs, into other spheres, they cannot fulfill that. Before I move on to my second argument, yes? Basically, first you say that in your craving, you only include people who have education. Then you say that art cannot be quantified as a value. When you graduate, it means that you're good at something. Please engage. Look, in order to speak a language, you need to know words. I aspects of it.

It's extremely flawed. Firstly, on people who evaluate artistic ideas. These are people who have traditional training in art. This looks like art school degrees, years of being into critics, and others. There are certain standards which they expect to be met. Think of the applications to the mainstream media and audience. Think of the significance of the message. All of these metrics are extremely subjective. Critics then hold that their own specific standards will be met. All their ideas, which do not subjectively fall under the category of good, are rejected. But also, these critics are usually well-established. Privileged individuals have been around arts for a long time and have developed prejudices, have developed biases and taste of art. Think of galleries not accepting black individuals because of their prejudices, because they do not want that art. Even if they're not openly racist or homophobic, these subconsciously reject the message of a minority art. Think of critics not valuing indigenous art, about colonialism, or simply meeting the artists and seeing them and being essentially pushed by their subconscious biases. But secondly, on unequal opportunities to access fellowships. But before that, I can take a second one. Isn't it slightly colonial that you think people should go to art school in a western country when what they have learned, maybe their traditional art from our indigenous grandparents? Can you repeat? Look, if I learn traditional art from my grandparents and I have to go to art school, people don't consider me an artist. Isn't that colonialism?"

If my professor from Oxford is now helping government grant fellowships, you're more likely to get the money, as they know you, and they want to support you. On a comparative, there's essentially nobody evaluating ideas and determining their value. Various artists are more likely to experiment with their art, create unconventional art. As a result, artists more likely become various and exclusive. It's more likely that the unconventional ideas will enter and represent different groups.

What it is possible is to define art. That happens on our side through these specific projects and a merit-based quality standard. Our fellowship and grants can be compared to basically the startup and research grants we see in most countries, where we see it's competitive, which ensures a high quality, and it is based on merits or needs. On the one hand, it sustains"

Wouldn't the government value more like a historical, educational, biblical, like some war? Or wouldn't they value more like a small, educational, art, or community? I will go into the standards, if you want, right now. So, you explained into the standards if you want right now. So you explained that the standards will be like prejudiced or biased. First of all, we explained to you that these biased values, even if they were biased, are still better than unconditional money that you give to artists regardless of their income or employment. You have to realize how inefficient this is because people can literally be super rich, employed and have a high income and still get this basic government funding regardless of everything else simply because they went to like the art school that proposition says like when they were. So this is absolutely no efficiency of government budget even if the standards were biased. Second of all, we do have the words based on marriage or need inside and this is given by the government. So it is very very likely that the fellowships will not be too prejudiced first of all because there is probably a set of different artists evaluating your art or portfolio because these are the people the government would hire for these jobs and secondly the government employees like have a record of also being able to establish who has merit or need in all other sectors where they give grants or fellowships, as I mentioned, research grants, startup grants, and so on, or, like, scholarships. Now, a few more points at the bottom. You explained that it is hard to get a job for artists, and there are, like, deadlines which push you, which isn't good enough if inspiration hasn't come. First of all, think, like, deadlines and, like, finding a job. This happens in any field. Why are artists more important than every other member of society? I will explain this further on in my first argument. No, thank you. Second of all, the point on like it is not good enough because inspiration hasn't come and they still need an unconditional wage for things like entertainment. Do you realize what huge backlash you're exposing these artists to because now the rest of society has this image of them getting unconditional money simply because they had this little artist label on them from the beginning for basically doing nothing? Because that's the point of unconditional. Not right now, thank you. My second speaker will go into the backlash interpretation argument further on later. And the last point I want to rebut is the part where you say it's like a written problem and tricks and biases. We explained to you that due to the fact that this is like given by the government, it is likely to make this actually quite accessible and competition here is based more on the quality of the art, which does not actually"

              "text": "make it a higher burden for any other artists. So going into my first argument on efficiency and social justice. First of all, we explained to you that the unemployment benefits exist either side, so we mitigate most of these, like I'm just a poor artist harms. And what else do we mitigate by saying we spend the grants on merit and on me? First of all, this is not an indefinite, constant expense for the government. And we can use the government budget more efficiently. Why is this? First of all, as the motion says, it's only for periods of time based on merit and need, which means it's just nominally weaker in how much money the government has to spend. Second of all, artists on our side can gradually become more self-sustaining easier. Why? That's the beauty of art. You don't need, like, huge resources. You can do trash art, graffiti, online courses, or be self-taught, and a talented underdog can be immediately recognized in our merit-based grants. So proportionally, we support those who need it and have the highest potential or the highest vulnerability, most on our side, rather than just saying we will unconditionally give every artist money just because they're artists. So second point is the funding based on merit or need is enough to incentivize performance from these artists. It is enough for motivation in terms of merit, like artists that have this merit of good quality art will get this funding more easily. Yes, after a monthly wage, despite how many plays they play, why do they deserve it when art is no use? Okay, first of all, artists do have the chance to get employment. Like, we're not saying there is no art employment. I don't know what you're facing there. And second, this is government funding. If a construction worker that builds a road for the government gets money, they're getting it for the merit of building this road, not just for being a construction worker. So I think this really does rebut it. So, back to my point on why the funding base for merit gives motivation and also deterrence. It shows that art is not for everyone. And will actually maintain art having a good reputation and a valid job that is competitive and seen well. No, thank you. This means the quality of art and artists will increase on our side. And the government resources act as a unique opportunity to support these vulnerable artists in need or the underdogs who have lots of talent and merit and allows them to establish reputation and recognition. Like, as again, for example, Harvard applications are also competitive, but that's because you actually get something for your merit, and just because it's competitive is not a reason that it shouldn't. It should just be given to everyone because that would just decrease the value as if we say everyone gets a Harvard scholarship just for nothing unconditionally because they're a person okay, third point on competition, competition basically just means the quality increases and there's more awareness of the skill, we see right now there are like 100s of influencers making art, but that is basically shit, but they feel good about it because they're like, I'm an artist. On our side, we don't have this like fake art and we rather like improve the actual quality."

They don't get unconditional money for nothing, although they involuntarily put themselves in this position. Artists voluntarily become artists and then actually have to face the consequences of this, which happens in every other industry too. We do not understand why artists are more vulnerable. Second of all, we have underpaid jobs in society, like cleaners or caretakers or construction workers. The government also doesn't give them basic income unconditionally for nothing. This is always tied to merit, as it is on our side of the house. There is absolutely no reason that artists deserve more, and there is rather a huge danger of the misuse. For example, a doctor who also went to art school at the beginning will not face eight years of very hard enduring med school, but rather be like, oh, I can get my basic income of being an artist aside without doing anything, regardless of income or employment status. So we stand for merit and quality."

These are the people who already have enough money to do these things, but they get even more benefits on their side. But furthermore, we tell you that essentially it is unfair and they never prove to you why their fellowships work. We tell you that fellowships have critics who decide who gets the money, right? And those critics have very limited thinking, right? At the point at which they have traditional ways of valuing art, right? But we also tell you that they have biases, right? Because usually, you know, individuals who are privileged, and they essentially will not likely give, you know, money to minority art. On our side, comparatively, these biases are taken out of the debate at the point at which everyone gets support, right? At the point at which everyone has equal on the side, right? But then, like we tell you, essentially, they essentially challenge our, like, value point. They say that, okay, why is art so exclusive that they need to get this, you know, basic wage? Why don't construction workers get it? But we give you brilliant analysis that is never responded, right? We give you three reasons. Firstly, we tell you that art is different because all art is valuable to an extent, right? It's different. Valuable at the point at which, you know, there's like cognitive value that is like experiential value, that is aesthetic value. There are different types of value that individuals find within art. So any individual in any piece of art will find something that appeals to them and will make it worth it to find this art. But secondly, without it as significant as art as an industry, it's really hard to enter and to survive on. Because it's really hard to find a job in a place where there are no strict criteria. Programmers can simply make the code and then get the wage for it. But for artists, it's different. You have flows of creativity. You have writer blocks where you can simply write, but then you can come up with the most brilliant ideas at some point. This is why art is exclusively such an unstable industry, at the point at which government has to ensure that it is being created and the only way that you can ensure it is by ensuring that there's no money going to these people. They never engage with this. So it simply stands. But what do they tell you on their side? They tell you that essentially you don't need a lot of resources to create art. You can do So it simply stands, right? But what do they tell you on their side, right? They tell you that essentially, you know, essentially you don't need a lot of resources to create art. You can do, like, trash art. We tell you that we're not talking about how much materials cost. We're talking about the fact that even when you create trash art and the materials do not cost a lot, you need to get something back from the trash art to get, you know, food on your table, to get a wage, right?

The thesis of this argument is that art is currently inaccessible, because first, it is impossible to start out, but secondly, it is not seen as a legitimate career, right? People don't go to study art to these universities because they're scared of an unstable career, right? Because there will be no basic wage when you finish it.

If you make art and you think that this is a good career choice, the discourse is simply that you're choosing a career path that has no, like, essentially potential, that you will never get a good wage from it. On our side, the government recognizes art and artists as people who generally need something valuable enough to get a basic wage, right? And at this point, the discourse simply shifts, right? Now, people do recognize it as a work that depends, that needs this wage, right? We tell you that essentially, that means that more people will go study art and head into arts in the first place, right? Intuition pump.

They just admire a piece of painting and want to do it because it seems pretty. And also on their point of, which was also my POY, everyone gets educated. Because the"

If you just wait and say, oh, I need motivation, motivation starts if you actually start doing it.

So they have the chance on our side of the house to get famous anywhere or have their connections. And if they have connections from artists, so it's on our side of the house.

So even if you have this basic income, you tell them it's based on people if your art blows up. So on your side of the house, the artist still won't blow up even if they have this income because it relies on people. So it's symmetric on both sides of the house who actually blows up.

And yeah, the difference is you give it to arrogant schoolies, we give them to underdogs. And you just had a whole point about art is privileged and we need to push people. You literally give money to the privileged people who had opportunity to go to art school, while we prioritize people who didn't have the opportunity, maybe some did, and actually really need the resources and do traditional art. And you also had this point of art is disorbitant because firstly, they don't get wage, secondly, art is subjective, and thirdly, it changes with time.

And thirdly, it changes with time. This is actually what we say.

And if they, like, get, do they, like, submit their art, and an Oxford person submit their art, it's still subjective. And it's more likely than on our side of the house, they will actually like the person off the streets more, because they are there, while on your side of the house, they have no incentive and no capability whatsoever. So why is backlash there? Because everyone, art students, get it, and the average person will be, of course, mad, because why should we fund literally already privileged people who already have it instead of people who actually need it?

And why is this different on our side of the house? Because people actually view it as good because there's a smaller amount of people actually getting this funding, thus people see it as special. You can see it in scholarships. If everyone gets a scholarship who went to school, it's not seen as something special and something you work for. But if only multiple people get a scholarship, you actually work for it. People see it as special and not as a waste of money. And this also ties into the point of lower motivation,"

Then who values whether graffiti or other historical pieces matter? Most of the data themselves agree that not art is good art, and we are the only side that can prove the exclusivity that all art at least can have the possibility to become good art, right? But secondly, we tell you that this job as being an artist evokes emotions of people, right? It has cognitive value and not simple, intangible merit.

On our side, the artists have merit to receive the grants. On your side, the unclaimed, untalented, unliked artists get unconditional income. Look, you talk about merits, but it's not really clear what those merits are, right? You never explain to us what are the criteria that these critics are going to judge upon, right? that unlike artists get unconditional income? purpose of art.

And even if it's the same amount of money, no thank you, it's still few people getting the money, meaning like the average person does not know how much you're debting and therefore even if it's the same amount of money spent on both sides of the house, like people are likely not even aware of this, meaning the potential for backlash is lower, right? And what I think they still have not managed to, like, you respond to is the fact that, I'm sorry, a childhood dream does not mean that it's actually a good career path for you. Maybe you like biology in high school, but you realize, actually, I'm scared of blood, then maybe you shouldn't become a doctor, even if you think biology is interesting, because that's going to have some negative impact on your patients, right? And I really want to push how their framing excludes any traditional artist. It's so funny because their second part wasn't like minorities but it absolutely, like, it excludes anybody who learned, for example, like, indigenous art from their grandmother, right? On their side of the house, if you live in a, no thank you, if you live in a European country, you have to go to a European art school that was founded by white colonizers, and you have to adjust to all these like curricula that were written by white colonizers based on art of white colonizers, okay? Meaning, look, in majority of universities, maybe you get like one semester of learning about"

              "text": "indigenous art or something, but the large focus of art school, especially like in European countries, which they seem to be talking about, no thank you, is literally European art, and so they say, okay, whatever, like, art schools are accessible, but you have to pass exams in art school, right? Art school is highly academic, I don't think they understand what art school is like, they think you go to art school, you paint a bit, and people are like, okay, nice, but no, art school is paint a bit and people are like okay nice but no art school is learning like so many boring years of history of like mostly european art and saying okay this one european guy painted this one thing no thank you and it's highly academic and some people just don't like it okay do i have to know history in order to be a good artist we say no in order to be a good artist you have to do art and not history. Thank you. Now, basically, what's very interesting is that Sexy Speaker pointed out that people in fellowships are uneducated about art. But now this completely goes against the point of saying you have bias about art, because if you don't even, like, if you're not even educated about art, how are you going to have these biases? No, thank you. If you're not even aware of the option of having a bias, right? If you don't know that something is indigenous art because you're completely uneducated, you can't discriminate because it's indigenous art, right? This was literally their thing that these people are uneducated. Now, on the exclusivity of art, you talk about education. Van Gogh didn't have an education, and his art is still good because it's about expressing himself and not about learning 500 years of European history, right? Secondly, it's about expressing yourself and not about like learning 500 years of european history right secondly it's easier to educate yourself on art why do we believe this especially and this is again where the vulnerability thing comes especially if your parents are against art because it's usually viewed as a bad thing this is when you can actually teach yourself on our side of the house if your parents say no you can't go to art school well you can't go to art school on our side of the house if your parents say you can't go to art school, well, you can't go to art school. On our side of the house, if your parents say you can't go to art school, okay, cool, you can still have your own, no thank you, of art that's still valid on our side of the house, even if your parents say you can't go to art school. Yeah, sure. Look, as an art teacher who has finished law and arts in one and a half years, many years of being an art student, what I value the person from the same class, what I value the person who does the green one? Look, what we think that this is about, again, this is literally your entire frame. Your framing is literally saying art is subjective, we agree, and look, the thing about CVs, this is literally symmetric on both sides of the house, because you're also more likely to get into junior if you have like a better, if you went to a better high school. Look, the thing of privilege is completely equal on both sides of the house. And what we believe is that how these people will decide is based on who actually gets outreach in the end. And we believe that these people will notice at one point that giving it only to people who went to Juilliard or Oxford, these people probably kind of do the same art. But if they give it to a street artist, who, no thank you, and an indigenous artist, look, you have so much more options, meaning the chance that the public will actually appreciate this is higher because you have far more options. Therefore, we believe this is how they're likely to decide, because seriously, who needs like 10 different paintings of Oxford people who paint in Renaissance style when instead you could also have a graffiti artist and an indigenous artist. Look, the outreach and therefore the popularity of this measure will increase if you actually include different objects. No, thank you. Then on that point, saying that it's less accessible. First of all, it's nominally untrue because people who have talent or interest for art can access art far more easily than ever before, right? Because in our set of the house, you can literally use online material, teach yourself a little bit of art skill. And you can apply to this if you are capable and if you have talent.'s at the house again it's about literally going to art school right there are far"

It's also marginal because even if some people in marginalized communities have less access, they still have more internet, cheaper art supplies, online patrons, and these solutions exist on both sides of the house, right? And the artists in marginalized communities who do get grants and fellowships now have generous resources and opposition rather than just enough to survive on proposition, meaning it can be put to use more effectively. Andly why this is actually our weight look we prefer to have people who have skill and drive to reach the top tier and who are actually really ambitious and who are willing to stick to a deadline because apparently that's the problem in proposition than to have a few people who can't even stick to a deadline like a bunch of people who can't stick to deadlines getting getting endless money. And look, even if less people do art, let's be real for one second. They said, look, not everybody who wants to do art gets to do art. Okay, honestly, I would rather prefer to have a few of these people being a little bit sad because they didn't go to art school, but becoming doctors and saving my life, than like all these people going to art school being happy and no doctor being there to save my life.

Every kid likes art in high school, but have you seen the portraits and these barely recognizable shoe sketches that actually are the outcome of this passion for art? If we incentivize all of these people who enjoyed sketching their friend in high school to go to art school and have an unconditional basic income for the rest of their life, of course a lot of these people will go to art school because it is basically the only place that offers this unconditional basic income forever. No other industry does that, although we do think that other industries are more important than art. So on our side, we really have this deterrence effect that shows that not everyone is made for art, but rather the people who are talented in art will be incentivized to go into art because they have this potential of actually getting this reward of this merit-based grant rather than everyone being welcomed to this basic income forever. This is why on our side the quality of art definitely increases."

We've explained to you that on our side we have no higher education barrier and we do not exclude the minorities, and the threshold is just merit or need. We've also explained to you that the government selection will, of course, not be openly discriminatory or biased, and the government will hire known art evaluators or artists. So this is actually quite a fair thing based on merit or need. Government will also fund the well-recepted and good art, and then the outreach will be merited, and the other citizens and taxpayers who are actually affected by this will see it as a more positive thing, because they actually like the art or think the artists are at least putting in the work. Third of all, I explained to you in my first speech that this can be compared to research grants and startup grants. If you just have a business or a science degree, this is not sufficient for you to have unconditional income forever. You actually need the merit for a good startup model or research idea, just like you need the art idea on our side. This is why the accessibility and quality of art on our side is high."

Because work is normally connected with wage. So on your side, wage is connected to this label of being an artist. Second of all, if the people, if the citizens, the taxpayers, see these art students that finished their school and they're out like chilling, partying, and engaging in the entertainment you think they need, although they have no talent and no incentive to work, this will lead to huge resentment of the public. You really have to face this. All the people who are actually working and paying taxes, and then those taxes go to the people who just finished art school, and that's all they had to do for the rest of their lives. On our side, we have the merited good artists that get the grants and get the outreach. So the money per person on the one hand decreases, so on the other hand, it's more of a start boost rather than this eternal couch potato investment on their side."

Really, not every art is valuable, because look at the pictures and like the drawings and some of the songs we see on a daily basis by these I liked art in high school people. This is not valuable art. And you have failed to prove why bad artists from art school deserve unconditional income for the rest of their lives on the backs of the taxpayers. On vulnerability, we simply win this class because we on the one hand give the grants to the artists in need, so the most vulnerable people, as well as the people who put in the most merit and have the most talent and highest outcomes. So on the outside, they're rewarded and incentivized and actually give back to the community and the taxpayers with the good art and outcomes they have on their side.

Which side essentially is able to achieve better art? They say, oh, we have self-taught artists that are allowed into these competitions, therefore ethnic minorities can do art. We tell you, firstly, this is absolutely inexclusive, right? Because ethnic minorities usually have, like these minorities usually have a comparatively harder time getting into things like galleries if they create things like ethnic art. Three reasons why. Firstly, they're seen as not a safe bet for a gallery. Secondly, they are faced with art-critic subconscious or conscious prejudices. Thirdly, they have a bias against what is good art. The delta here is the capacity to be allowed into galleries and how much they win the project is dependent on biases, of snots, and on gate-capped knowledge of project writing. Consistent capacity to live off of art when you win only sometimes is not good enough on their side of the house. You usually don't even win these competitions because it's so extremely competitive that only the top artists are likely to get into these competitions and win and get these prizes. Comparative here is, on our side, you can take a loan for a university, you can make a portfolio, it is not inaccessible. Ethnic minorities and others can literally do the same thing. I'm not clearly making the link why ethnic minorities cannot go to art school. To say that is simply racist."

On our side, we reach a wide scale of people who are able to survive off of art. We reach a bigger scale, and we make it more accessible for everyone. But then, on a comparative, we tell you that we uniquely have an ability to get art that is unconventional. Look at how it impacts intense emotional experiences of the viewer that they can experience, even if it is not conventional. It also includes things like ethnic art that you talk about, because these Palestinian minorities go into art schools and they're able to get funding in order to not starve and get into galleries or make galleries themselves. We also have things such as capacity to have representation or have different experiences in art galleries. No more Samoal is dying in his 20s. No more Van Gogh being pushed into book period. No more starving artist stereotype. But secondly, the impact we have is the intensity of intense quality of life of suffering artists in the status quo that improves on outside the house. This is major scales of people who had their whole lives ruined because they either died or were forced to give up their purpose of life. Lastly, they can see it in their second, that art is subjective. This means they accept their analysis, why all art is inherently important. Even if some people are making some shit art, it is only shit for me, but not for Martina. Martina may think that my art that I like is shit, but it's not shit for me. Thank you."

Firstly, one, to ensure quality and fair foundation because we think currently within status quo, it's linked to the networks and the people that you know, but also what's being consumed in mass. It's the reason why we have TikTok music on things such as Spotify. But significantly, secondly then, we think that there's going to be significantly more art on our site as a result of more people being able to produce art, which means we have significantly more ability to access good art. At the point at which we're producing more, there's better art in which we can engage with. We don't necessarily think they can have that on their site. Before I go on, sure, I'll take a POI. How do you prove that your art can be commercialized? So, panel, if you have the incentive to be commercial, i.e. you're producing a film that you want to sell to a mass corporation, you can actively show that you're putting the work in, you're writing the script, you're actively putting teams together, we think we have that capacity.

              "text": "First argument, then, about why we get significantly better quality of art. Panel, let's be realistic. Art at the moment in status quo is not a viable career for three reasons. Firstly, one it's really hard to make a living. There's a set number of places you can display your art and you can sell your art. There's only a set number of major labels that individuals can go to and it means there isn't necessarily a variety that exists. Secondly, then, individuals are grossly overworked in their initial years to becoming artists. It looks like individuals having to produce music en masse so that they can sell it to record labels, which means they're likely to burn out and they aren't likely to have sustainable careers. But thirdly, then, panel, it's extremely risky. They don't provide any guarantee on their side that you're going to be successful, and we think through a basic income, we don't make success a criteria for you engaging with art. Secondly then, why do we think this disincentivizes individuals to engage with art? Because you don't give them any job security, and there are significantly better alternatives that individuals opt into. This means in instances that you do have talented artists who also have alternative things like debaters, they're likely going to pursue a career in law because it's significantly more stable, which means you lose out on those talented artists. But the reason we think you lose out on talented artists is because to go into art, it means you have to affirm yourself and back yourself, panel. And that's something that we don't think all people have the capacity to do. It's not something that's easy to just say, I'm not going to eat, I'm not going to engage. Thus then, we think as a result of a basic income, we're comparatively better because we provide a stable income regardless of whether or not you're successful. We remove the risk and we provide you the job security and we remove the incentive for you to make money quickly, something that becomes important for the impact. Note, as a result of this basic income, you have more capital"

Note, uniquely on our side, we can have significantly more Kendrick Lamars at the point at which we give them basic incomes. On the comparative then, note they have to fulfill a demand because there's still an incentive to make money and to feed yourself. It's the reason why we have things such as TikTok music. Individuals are just trying to fulfill the demand that labels are looking to so that they can get contracts to ensure that they can fund themselves and they can have stable jobs. What is the impact here? The impact here is, firstly, one, we get significantly more artists on our side, which gives us the ability to also access significantly more art. And in the instances where that art is good, we think those individuals are likely to get funding within the private sector. But secondly, then, it means different art is allowed to exist on our side because there's no incentive to fulfill the demand, you're still being paid i.e individuals can create any forms of art because they're being"

              "text": "able to ensure that they're getting their basic income secondly why are we better for minorities panel the framing here is that minorities lack the social capital to produce art why two reasons firstly one they lack the networks they're unable to contact the individuals who are going to platform their art and mobilize their art to match artists. But secondly, we think that sometimes there is just a physical restriction as a result of circumstances. It looks like African artists in Africa not being able to communicate in things such as English and thus then being denied the ability to present themselves to panels. Secondly, there's a lack of capital. So it means they're unable to pay the bills that they're required to produce their artwork. Panel, this is where we say to produce a studio album, you need to rent out studio space, which means you need to have money and capital, at the point at which you don't give them the ability to pay for those studio instances, and you don't give them the capital to engage on that pursuit for that career, we think you don't allow minorities to engage within the space. So in the worst case scenario panel, we think minorities stop the pursuit of arts due to the pressure that's being placed on them to provide for their families, and they opt into an alternative career. But similarly, in the best case scenario, we think it looks like minorities finding intensive lucrative means as a means of funding their art. It's the reason why most rappers have the story of I had to work five jobs so that I could be successful, I could be recognized by a label. On the comparator, as a result of basic income, we provide the means for individuals to prioritize their art because there isn't an instance where they have to raise that capital. There isn't an instance where they have to ensure that they're creating that platform or paying someone to create that platform. We remove that barrier to entry and we allow minorities to engage. Note then, the impact is that opposition locks up minorities when minorities are likely to engage in the lesser instances. Why then do we think this becomes extremely impactful? Because you lose out on the political messaging that minorities have. When we speak about Kendrick Lamar's alt-right, when he speaks about police brutality and the violence faced by black individuals in their communities We think you lose out on the ability to have more of those stories being captured To have more of those stories being pushed to individuals and at the point at which we deny Minorities to tell the stories that tends to mobilize individuals and things such as social justice that tend to mobilize Individuals pain and the experiences that they're facing at the moment, that's the point of problem matter. The reason why we want vote prop is because we show you minorities in art or something we ought value, so proud to propose."

So secondly, the comparative of fellowships and grants would look like one, institutions such as public universities or museums would likely organize these competitions and pick the art. They will often be evaluated by an objective lens because one, it will be done by people who are in the field, so people who understand art and are art experts. Secondly, we think that it will be the criteria of innovation, technology, and curation of the exhibition, etc. And third and certainly we think that artists have incentives to accept new forms of art because they are likely to stay relevant they are likely to want innovation that will keep people engaged with this thus we believe that minorities often have specific stories to tell that stand out from the rest of the crowd but for that reason we think that they will be able to compete a lot more under their our side of the house than theirs as i'll explain in a second second we believe that when you win a competition you give artists a certain degree of credibility and reputation so you're more likely to obtain a platform for your art where more galleries are interested in you because you literally won a fellowship, you won a competition, and that gives you more credibility and a capability to show your art once it is produced. And thirdly, we think that the government has incentives to fund artists who need the funds, because under our set of the house, you're not funding Broadway productions that already have private investors. Instead, you're funding small upcoming theaters with local directors who wouldn't have this amount of necessity on their side.

Firstly, if the requirements to access the basic income are too lax, then massive amounts of money will be taken from the public sector. This means that they won't be able to spend as much money of their art budget within other areas of art or simply within other areas of the government. Secondly, we think that if it's too difficult to access, let's say that they have to be working actively, that they have to have a certain recognition that they are artists, then we believe that they take away their impacts. And thirdly, either way you get minimal amounts of money for artists. We think that thus far in the debate, they haven't been able to clarify what the criteria would be on their side. Thus, it is likely that it is still exclusionary and that it is still negative for the government."

              "text": "Now, moving on to my first argument on efficiency of resources. The thesis of this argument is that basic income for artists entails a misuse of resources for three reasons. One, it allocates resources equally. This is a problem because A, it doesn't discriminate on necessity. So you're aligning the pockets of artists who don't need that extra money and you're sacrificing investments into other areas like museums and cultural centers that will actually change the way that people can access art. You see, it doesn't matter if certain artists have more paintbrushes or more funds to produce their art if they don't even get into art in the first place. We believe that if governments have a certain allocated amount of budget that they can invest into art, it is more important that they invest it into things that more people can access. Comparatively, we allocate funding on the basis of merit and necessity. This is better because, one, we're able to carry out expensive projects. Oftentimes, arts such as theater productions or film productions or simply big art exhibitions require a lot of funding. We believe that we're more likely to be able to fund them entirely when we have to allocate resources between less projects. And secondly, we're more likely to fund projects that would be overlooked on proposition. We're able to fill the gap that they need because basic income won't necessarily give them agreements with museums. It doesn't give them the incentives to create an innovating art. It doesn't give them the platform to share their art in the first place and we believe that our side is exclusive on that. Under our side, you're directly collected to galleries because a lot of the times they will be the ones who are running the competition in the first place. But we believe that our side is exclusive on that. Under our side, you're directly collected to galleries, because a lot of the times, they will be the ones who are running the competition in the first place, but even if they aren't, you're given a platform. The issue with art isn't only affording the production, it's being able to take your art to a gallery where it will actually be seen. Secondly, we think that not all art requires the same amount of funding, so we're able to allocate it more effectively. And thirdly, we believe that there's a big opportunity cost. Proposition probably uses a lot of money, because one, a lot of people work in art. Art encompasses music, theater, dance, literature. So many people will be working in this field, so there will be a lot of money put into this. And secondly, we think that a basic income policy entails giving more money to individuals their whole lives. And because of inflation, this will likely be more and more money over time. And thirdly, we think that in order to provide any sort of decent basic income, you need to be spending a lot of money to allow people to live, let alone produce art in the first place. So comparatively, we think that there is less money spent on our side, because one, competitions and grants are temporary, and two, they will probably be allocated to less individuals. So why is this beneficial? Because one, governments have a limited amount of money, especially when it comes to investing into art. And we think that it's better that this budget isn't spent exclusively on funding specific art projects, and instead it goes into funding museums, cultural centers, education about art in schools, etc. Because A, we think that it benefits more people, because simply more people can access these benefits than just the individual artists. And secondly, it has long-term benefits, because in the long term, more people care about art, and more people can get past this threshold. If they want minorities to be involved in art, they need to be able to care about it in the first place and secondly we think that aside from investing into other areas within"

We think that they are still experts. We think that they will still be able to evaluate objectively in terms of technique, in terms of innovation, in terms of many different areas. We don't think we need to answer this question within the debate. Now, moving on to my second argument. We believe that we obtain better art that is more innovative and engaging for audiences and fulfilling to artists. Why? Because one, we're funding fewer artists so we can give more money for projects when needed. A lot of art is expensive and it is unlikely that when money is divided amongst them, that is enough. Now artists can fulfill their mission, which means that they have more personal fulfillment because they're able to carry out the projects that they had envisioned. Secondly, we get better art simply because they're able to execute it to a higher quality with better materials, better sound studios. And thirdly, they have more of a capability to innovate when they're using different materials, using different types of things. And secondly, we think that fellowships and grants entail following through on the creative process because it gives people incentives to produce and it systemizes creativity. Since they're investing into specific projects, they need to follow through with it and ensure that they are actually successful, which means that artists are likely to continue working over long periods of time and produce good art. And thirdly, we think that we have more competition on the art side of the house. So probably this presents in like how you present your art. It changes the way that the mediums you use. It means that more upcoming artists which have challenging views and which actually stand out from the crowd are able to get funds. This oftentimes looks like minorities.

Firstly, museums and all of that are just not a part of the debate panel because we're talking about the same amount of money for people. That's to say the arts and culture department within the government has the same fixed capital on either side of the house in order to give to people. So that's to say the $10,000 that would have been given to a person to get a scholarship to Juilliard on their side of the house is just spread out across people on our side of the house. So the separate part of the budget that is for museums and that sort of a thing is literally symmetrical. The people part is what is changing in the debate that isn't contentious. But a second note on this part of context. We think there are other ways of raising funds on our side. Considering that they don't contest the fact that we get more art on our side and better quality of art, something we give you in first, we think we're likely to get more buy-in on our side of the house. Because art is subjective inherently. So there's more art and more ability for people to connect with art. We think we get more buy-in, we're able to raise more funds.

But secondly, there are more resources on our side. Artists have more time. They have more ability to raise capital on their own accords, which means that they can be more creative. Considering how art isn't something like a corporate job, which you can overwork yourself, you need opportunities to be creative. But thirdly, we told you that there is less catering to a market to get support, so we get more creative freedom. No response to any of those mechanisms. The only thing they tell us is that they still believe that they have a cap so they don't engage with it because there's a cap to the amount they can earn. Panel, this is factually incorrect. You can earn past basic income. Basic income is the minimum that isn't the maximum that you're able to earn.

They lack the networks, they have physical restrictions like artists in Africa, and furthermore, they lack financial capital. And the impact of this was really important, because we told you that political messaging gets harmed on their side of the house. And to extend that impact, another reason why political messaging gets harmed on their side of the house is because we think that a government has the opportunity to censor anti-governmental ideas. So if I, as a minority, am protesting against the government, but the government has an ability to evaluate whether my art is good, they're probably not going to fund me because they don't want any anti-governmental ideas. So on their side of the house, minorities are stunted in their ability to protest. On our side, that doesn't occur. The only response we get is the idea that basic income won't be enough for minorities to do this. Like, literally, no. We think basic income, by definition of the motion, is you get enough to fulfill your basic needs. So that means instead of you as a minority working five jobs to fulfill those basic needs, we can work maybe one to just get extra art supplies and that sort of thing.

We think they were trying to corner us into a metric, but we think we can clearly take this out of the debate, because it's just whether or not you're willing to sell your art. If you are, then yay. Second thing they tell us, they tell us that there's more credibility from people who get scholarships. So if you get a scholarship, then you're a more credible artist on their side. This just isn't the case, because we can still have awards on our side of the house from private institutions that can still do this. We think that's still possible and we think that gets expanded on our side of the house when more art is explored. So the analysis that Kumo gives you, as you said that there is less catering to the market to get support and there's more development of different art, means that you shift the overturned window and you shift the norms as to what art is, that is the way movements progress. So we think the metric of fellowships changes on our side because we have the ability to see different art and get those into the market. On their side of the house, that doesn't happen. Second thing they tell us is that it's really bad because you put money into the pockets of people who don't need it and you don't put it into museums. I've already taken out museums.

We think this argument's to say that we get better development of art on our side, and we think that this is really important, because it's the idea that you can't evaluate art, so art inherently progresses better on our side. But before I get into the meat of that, I'll take a POI. How are artists supposed to exhibit their works in the first place if you're not giving them any capability to do so when you're making them on the income? We think that you have the ability to exhibit your art when you have a basic income, because you can then contribute to your ability to work on getting your artwork on display or having it in the streets or using the money that you earn to get a studio. We think that you have the ability to access extra capital on their side, you're captive just trying to get your basic standard of living. So the idea of this argument, the reason it directly engages there, is because it's the idea that there should never be a metric for how we evaluate art. Because art inherently has been something where we've rejected metrics. Think about the fact that the reason surrealism arose in art was a rejection of realism. We think art inherently has no definition for two reasons. Firstly, it's all about perspective. It's about individual experiences that are different. So an apple to you means something very different to an apple to me. Secondly, because definitions are very exclusionary. They're based on what an objective metric tells us. So based on color theory and things like that, we think that locks out different forms of art. Think about perishable art and how that was only able to rise in the instance in which we didn't use basic metrics of art. So this becomes really bad on their side. Because we think new art gets stunted with the opposition. We think we use a stunted metric. Because you don't allow people to progress across the initial phases because they're unable to access capital otherwise. So Yoko Ono's rotting apple doesn't ever create a genre of perishable art on their side of the house because it didn't fit the previous understanding of art that they had. And notice, they can never say that they're fully flexible because if that is the case, they can't claim quality control and whatever they want to push for on their side. Why is the progression of art very important? We think it is very important because firstly, it's able to connect with new people. Think about women and the connection that they had to Yoko Ono's rotting apple as a sense of decay to represent how their beauty was viewed in society as something that was perishable as well. So we think we're able to connect to more people on our side. But secondly, we think that there's new and effective means for social messaging on our side."

That basic income is not going to be able to pay for a studio, as they say is necessary in order to become an artist. It's not going to be able to pay for you to have a larger theater production. Note here that still, poor people cannot access art, but under their side of the house, it is far, far worse. Why? Two points of framing to reframe the debate. Firstly, what is it to be considered an artist? Because basically they say you have to be consistently working on a project. We think that this is partially true, right? If you consider you're working on a project, you're going to be given money. But that project still has to be seen as legitimate. That project, the government still has to say that it's a good project. Note that under their side of the house, those same metrics that prevent some people from accessing money in order to develop a particular project still prohibit some people from having access to particular developments of art. But note that it's actually worse under their side of the house because it's likely that other metrics come into play, such as do you have a particular art education? Do you have legitimacy within your field? Which means that more people are going to be excluded and not have the ability to have even the minimum wage and much less be able to actually push larger projects. Second point on where does the money come from? Because I think they just brush this off, right? Like the same amount of money is going to be spent on art on either side of the house. But note that it is far more expensive to be able to fund every single artist's minimum wage under their side of the house than it is to just fund some particular project to be able to push them, to make sure that they become mainstream, to make sure that people buy into them. Note that under our side of the house, from the get-go, we already proved why their side of the house is very unlikely to actually help anyone, particularly because that budget is likely going to have to come from somewhere. So yes, funding towards the arts is going to be limited on both sides of the house. That means you're going to take away funding from museums, you're going to take away funding from art education. Note that here you take away the possibilities of people accessing art far worse under their side of the house. Now first flash on artists and where can they better access art. So first question, where can lower income people actually access art? They say that they're going to be able to do this better. No. Structurally, a lot of people cannot access art on either side of the house because they don't learn about it. They are not told that this is a possibility for them to have access to it. They do not come in contact with them, which means that a structural reason, these structural barriers still exist"

              "text": "under their side of the house. But secondly, what is the actual comparative? We think that under our side of the house, countries will not be able to fund any type of art, because we think that when you dilute money that much, it is very difficult to actually process anything, not only because of the material things that you need in order to actually be able to develop art, but also because of other structural reasons, such as being able to pay your rent coming first. And when things become more expensive, it's going to be harder for you to keep up, and you're likely going to have to take up a second job either way. But furthermore, we tell you that you take away incentives for privates to continue to invest, because now the narrative is placed that every artist already has it well made, right? Because you have a basic income income what else can you need this means that other artists like that other privates such as museums but also such as like private investors and art have less of an incentive to actually do this have less of an incentive to continue to promote art so on aggregate you have less people actually being to maximize being able to maximize the money that it's used for art what do they tell you? They basically tell you that you remove barriers of entry for minorities because often these people need to work five jobs in order to be able to get here, to get to a good point and that there are structural barriers that prevent them more. We already told you that this happens symmetrically because these barriers are often less tangible than just the fact that you have to work multiple jobs. Because a lot of artists have to do this. We already tell you that some people are still going to have it a lot easier than others. And apart from that, you're giving them more money. We think that the comparison on our side of the house is better, because when you see when somebody needs more money, you're more likely to fund a government project that actually enables them to have this. But what else do they tell you? They tell you that often minorities lack social capital in order to be able to push their own art. We think that this is becoming less and less true every single day. Because we think that other actors have more incentives to invest on minority art."

              "text": "And we also think that it becomes more prevalent and more well-looked at when the government starts investing in this. So we think that there are huge incentives for the government to actually invest in these types of projects, as we see with multiple governments now looking to invest into good graffiti and therefore changing the narrative of what is acceptable or not. We think it's better on the other side of the house because you don't just give every artist money and hope that they make it for themselves. But instead, the government is forced to change social narratives about art by itself, and therefore these pushes are much more likely to better change things in the long term. The other thing that they tell you is that you cannot protest. Again, we think that in terms of protest, there are often other actors that would likely fund this instead of the government, but we don't think that this is true. But we think that comparative is a lot worse. Why? Because we think that instead of just not funding a project, you actively delegitimize actors, like artists, by not giving them the money that they need to succeed, not giving them, and you generally just stop considering them artists, and we think that this is far, far worse. Finally, we think that the only response that they give to all of our mechanisms on why it's unlikely that you can produce as much art is that you can just share art because you have more time. But I think ICIA tells you that there are multiple barriers that you need in order to be able to get into a museum because you still need that legitimacy that is only brought to you when your project is the one that was picked. You need that legitimacy and that extra amount of money to be able to pay multiple people to help you set up an exhibition. We think that that extra amount of money is better used under our side of the house than it is. And yours, before I move on, I'll take a P.O. The InfoSci says fellowships go to people based on merit. Would you give money to Martin Scorsese? I don't think you would because it also said it's based on need, right? I think that everyone can say, hey, Martin Scorsese is a great director, but I think under your side of the house, when you say that all artists get money, that's more likely under your side of the house. Now, moving on to our second flash on where you get better art, because I think that the main question we have to ask are, are there correct mechanisms where we can see that some art is better than others? We tell you, yes, two reasons. Firstly, we tell you possible commercialization is incredibly important because when you're giving money to somebody, you expect that to have some sort of return. Therefore, the government can measure what is more likely to be sold, what is more likely to become commercial. Note that it's not just you want to sell your art. We think that some art sells better than others and we think that this is how most investors work. Therefore, we think under their side of the house, art that does not sell as well is still going to have multiple barriers of entry. But under our side of the house, you don't waste money on those people who are not going to be able to sell art, because under our comparative, you're taking that away from somebody who could have a better art education. You're taking it away from someone who could have actually opened up a better film or produced something that caused better social change. But secondly, I think they themselves tell you that some art has more value than others, right? Because they tell you that some art is more politically motivated. They tell you that some art has a bigger impact because when you're lifting up a minority, that has more power than just art that is like finger painting. We think that there is a comparative here because we're telling you that when professionals validate a particular type of art, you give it a lot more power than just diluting that power amongst many artists. But note that we also bring you three mechanisms. And I think it's important to note that they completely drop our first argument"

But currently, minorities don't have enough capital in order to succeed and have the studio that they want to claim under their wall, meaning that based off of meritocracy, they're less likely going to be looking at minorities specifically, and they don't actually fund the projects that they claim are likely going to be benefiting individuals. So it is either that you are funding people who already have established capital, meaning that they continue elitism under their wall and have less progression within art, or it is likely that they're going to be only selecting a few bunch of minorities, and in that regard, they don't actually get that progression of art in either case, specifically because of the fact that they're nitpicking specific individuals. Team Mexico can't have it both ways, and I'm going to show you why."

The second is on who is able to get the most progression of art. But before that, I just want to deal with a couple of strategic flaws that exist within the opposition case. The first is what exactly is their model? Because they tell us that you can objectively view art, but this is fundamentally untrue for two reasons. The first is because art is inherently subjective in terms of interpretation. We all interpret art in very different means, so they cannot objectively view art in certain distances. But secondly, people are most likely going to be leaning into Western institutions because that's the form of art that we're most common to. That means under their world, they're likely going to be rejecting the forms of art that minorities typically lean into. This looks like African art. This looks like African art, this looks like rap music within America. They cannot claim that this is something that is likely going to be existing under their wall because primarily it's been rejected by majority of the fellowship from the grounds that they're looking at specifically here. Secondly, they burden us to have like just a high burden on these kinds of things. We told you that we only need people to have a specific commitment towards music and that's enough for them to actually get that very same funding. We think that this is important because we think that we still continue to incentivize individuals into having to invest into their music but also create good music in the long run. Last, let's just note that things like museums aren't a part of this debate. Lisa already told you why exactly this is the case. But just to extend on this, we think that we can get private institutions on either side. And this is also true because of the fact that P2, or O2 rather, directly conceded to this by having to claim that investment into minorities is likely going to exist by private institutions. If that's the case, that can also exist under our world, meaning that we can have some level of allocation of funds while also having the government services being provided to those individuals in the first place. That's an added benefit on our side because you have a larger pool of capital for those specific individuals that are likely going to be overlooked under their world."

              "text": "First question on whether or not this is the best allocation of resources. We get two arguments from their side. The first is that they tell us that they will be able to fund projects that are likely going to be overlooked under our board. Three key responses. One, if art is fundamentally elitist, as they've all one claim, then those overlooked projects will not be considered due to the high bias that exists within artists. That is to say that classical music has always been prioritized by a lot of fellowship programs because of the fact that that has been the Western convention of art under their vote, meaning that things like rap music are less likely going to be prioritized in this regard. This is going under the elitism charge. The second thing is that a majority of government fellowships are generally far away from the people who are overlooked under their vote. That is to say that it's difficult to actually meet the minorities who need it most, mainly because of the fact that they need to exercise a large amount of capital under their world in order for you to be able to access that capital or able to access that fellowship in the first place. On the comparative, under our world, with a universal basic income, that very same capital is something that is allocated to you in the very first place, meaning that individuals are likely going to be getting that benefit on our side, specifically because of the fact that the government is mandated to do that in the first place. But third, we specifically fund people, or under their word rather, they specifically fund people who already have some capital to establish a repertoire in art. These are specifically individuals who are rich, and these are specifically individuals who are able to advertise themselves towards these fellowship programs in the first place. Meaning that under their world, they're likely going to be funding projects that have already had some level of capital and have already some level of interest from these individuals in order for them to succeed. Especially because of the fact that under their world, art is highly competitive and doesn't actually allow for individuals to express themselves as freely as they would want to. The second thing that they tell us is that because of the fact that you are allocating resources equally, you're not actually providing a good amount of allocation of resources. First, there's just no inherent harm to this. Universal basic income is specifically good because of the fact that it recognizes the quality of individuals, but also recognizes that the industry itself is being catered for. Generally, the government has the obligation to individuals who contribute to the industry, and given the fact that almost every single individual who is trying to commit towards their own work is having that contribution, we think the government has the obligation to reparate for that on the basis of reciprocity. They need to tell us why reciprocity isn't a very fundamental principle that the government needs to be providing for these individuals in order for that very same argument to make sense. But second, people have the incentive to make a career out of this art, meaning that they will most likely focus on the good creation of art, so they cannot tell us that we're not going to be funding people equally or to people who don't actually want this. I think that if it is that you are investing into art, you already have some level of investment into the commitment, into the process, into the things that make that art very important, meaning that based off of reciprocity, the government needs to reparate you for that. What did we tell you then? We told you, one, you have more diversity into art and the ways in which we interpret it because of the fact that you have more artists entering the space. This is important because the progression of art and the progression of the good allocation of resources comes once you maximize the alternative that you're likely going to be having in the first place. This is important because this allows for more income to come specifically for individuals. This is important and this means that we win this class. One, specifically because of the fact that the allocation of resources goes specifically to the people who need it the most, but secondly, it allows for the diversification, which on its own is a good allocation of resources. Second class, then, on better art before that savior case."

Note that the same factors have been re-applied in reverse out of the house. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. People are already investing into their art under our world. This is emphasized by the fact that you have a basic income that is able to support you in having to make sure that you achieve all of those things. But secondly, if you're assuming that scouts can exist under your world, they can exist under our world too because the fact that the investment into those things are things that are intrinsically likely to exist because of the fact that you're so inherent and so committed to that art in the first place. Why exactly do they not get better art? They tell us, one, that fewer projects are actually going to be funded and therefore better art is likely going to be there. One, the prospect of that art don't actually get uncovered under their world because of the fact that there's a limited number of people who can actually engage with that art. That is to say that the art that exists under their world is specifically for targeted communities as opposed to the general public and it isn't likely going to increase the validity of that art in the first place. But second, that means that we lock out individuals that are needing of that money in order to ensure that that artist is likely going to be progressive under their work. If you're funding fewer individuals, it's less likely then that minorities specifically are going to be getting that funding. And this is something that you can see within the own logic of your argumentation. The second thing they tell us here is that you're going to be able to follow through into the project in and of itself. Why? There's a high standard that makes it difficult for you to actually succeed under their work, mainly because of the fact that fellowships have quite high expectations of artists under their work, meaning that a lot of artists don't actually succeed in the long run. But second, people generally value their art enough to push themselves into improving that art, regardless of incentives in that regard. This is without high standards, and it's most it's most likely progressing art in the future proposed. Thank you. Proposition's case is quite disingenuous"

So then on, they can sell their art to other parts of the world. We think that this is extremely significant, and this was not out of the debate like they simply asserted the second thing that i want to point out is that they constantly claim that art cannot be evaluated on their side of the house but note that it can it's definitely sort of subjected to evaluation on their side of the house simply because some art is bound to be popular other art is not bound to be popular like we're constantly evaluating whether people enjoy it or not so it's not that this thing that art can never be evaluated yes it can some people the majority of people consider a specific thing to be good then we think that it's good if the majority of people doesn't consider a specific thing to be good then it's not good and that is the reality that happens on their side of the house they like it's also subjected to market mechanisms art on their side of the house.

So if I'm able to take this down, this is like, you cannot vote for their side. I think first, we this point greatly Due to the advent of technology and social media producing art is cheaper than ever You can record on your phone edit and then publish it on SoundCloud for instance We told you that you can do this very easily and this is not as There's no longer a huge buyer of entry Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, Lisa, Kanye West, and Frank Ocean are all artists that are extremely popular now, and were able to actually become extremely famous by first recording in the room, and then publishing their art elsewhere. This not only applies to music. Artists on one part, artists can create painting, and then announcing it on Instagram, so they become popular. So what we tell you here is that the barrier of entry is extremely lower now, and because of that, minorities can actually access these opportunities, and people who would otherwise be disadvantaged. So the necessity of their case is not as relevant, and therefore their case is not as relevant to this debate. What we're saying here is that people who are talented can be successful on both sides of the house. They can even do so extremely quickly. However, their side comes at a huge opportunity cost, and know that it's extremely relevant, because on their side of the house, they're giving money. You cannot give money to extremely talented minorities and give large sums of money to those talented minorities so that they're able to be extremely relevant in the future because you are giving money to everyone, even those who are already receiving funding. So that means on their side of the house, they're literally funding mediocre art because there's people who are not good and are not successful. And most people aren't, most people do not like it, but simply because they claim that they're artists, then the government is giving them this basic income.

First, we told you that this is what came in first and was never contested, that oftentimes this is an independent panel. The government is not directly assigning the fellowships or grants. This is most likely an independent panel that is given the money so that they are able to choose who will receive the grant. And there's five reasons why we are able to prioritize alternative or criticisms or minority art. First, you choose art that is innovative because this makes the competition more relevant. If you are choosing something that is extremely new, that probably means that you're going to attract the attention of more people and more people are going to participate in the competition. This makes art significantly more relevant and because of that, we think that you're likely to choose it. Secondly, art that criticizes the government or criticizes political things is extremely controversial. So it brings a lot of attention. Art that criticizes the government or criticizes political things is extremely controversial. So it brings a lot of attention.

This is the reason why there's a lot of people who are receiving fellowships and grants in the status quo who are actively criticizing the government, who are actively talking about racial inequalities because we think that this is controversial, this is something that we need to talk about. Thirdly, we probably tell you that there's electoral incentives. If your community thinks that the government actually helped a minority artist within your neighborhood, within your community succeed, largely, we think that you're going to actually approve of that government and because of that you're likely actually going to support it. So there's electoral incentives to do this. Fourthly, we also tell you that you want to be seen as progressive in the international community, in the moment in which you are actually funding stories that are worth telling, stories that actually were not told before. And because of that, it's extremely likely that you prioritize this. But fifthly, the info slide quite literally says that it's based on me. So we can actually prioritize those arts which are currently underfunded. That is the info slide. The fact that they're denying it, they're not debating the actual debate. So I think they have no grounds to win this debate."

Art that is simple and horrendous. Art that oftentimes it looks like funding a terrible actor, for instance, that is not good. That is trying to audition one and one time again. But on the other side of the house, that actor is probably so bad that they're never funding. So that means you're sacrificing the ability to fund significantly a minority to become extremely successful on our side of the house. We told you that there are talented minorities who deserve access. to become extremely successful on our side of the house. We told you that there are talented minorities who deserve access. And even in our worst case scenario, we think that is significantly more rewarding because it took you five years to become relevant. It took you hard work. Their point is basically that you don't want people to go to Juilliard or this huge academic schools that prioritize art. We tell you that on our side of the house house we're definitely not impacting as many people. But we're impacting individuals in a very meaningful way and because of that we're maximizing the happiness of that individual in a significant extent as opposed to their side of the house where there's some people getting funding without merit. But before we go on, take your POI. A phone that doesn't receive funding on both sides, how do you know if it's good? How do you know if it's good when it's never produced? We already told you that there's already probably the advent of social media making it seem like you can expose your art elsewhere. And two, literally, ISA gave you structural reasons as to why you can definitely value whether it's innovative, whether it actually tells a different story that has not been told before. And you want that. Please engage with what we're telling you in this debate. Second question on the creativity or the quality of art. They told you basically that they have writer's block because they're producing quickly. But on the other hand, one, their metric is to commercialize, so I think on the other hand, they're also going to produce quickly in the first place. But secondly, it probably means that in the moment in which you are actually trying to do something, like in the moment in which you are simply funding whatever art on the other side of the house, it probably means that oftentimes there's this low quality. We told you in our second argument that you are, one, pressuring people to improve. You're pressuring people to actually produce better art because you force them to compete based on merit with other things. So because of that, we think that art gets significantly better, they seem to get significantly more innovative. But also, we told you that in the moment in which we are able to give more money, so that means that you are able to produce bigger things. You are able to produce a major production. You're able to expose your art for the majority of the world. And because of that, it's far more likely that you not only have quality, but you also have a vast amount of exposure. For that, I think this is a clear ballot for Team Mexico."

But notice, even if they were willing to win the idea of museums, it's not even debate winning for them. Two reasons. Firstly, because unweighing, we think museums are less homogenous on our side. So even if we have less museums, we think the museums incorporate different art. They're far more engaging, so they're probably just of higher quality with us because we told you we shift the Overton window as to what is displayed. But secondly, notice O3 even frames to us why we don't even need these museums because they tell us you can access art on your phone in response to a PY about form. So if that is the case that they win out on museums, they don't win out on exposure to art that isn't debate winning. Second thing on Strat, I think they push a fake principled harm as to say that it's really bad if you give capital to people that already have capital. This was strategically weird for two reasons. Firstly, because they give money to rich people if they're seen as good art. So clearly they don't have a problem with giving money to people if they are supposedly good. But secondly, because they give money to poorer individuals even if the art by their metric is bad.

We're a bit confused. But third thing on Strapped, we think the question here is who does the government fund? And that's how we went out in the debate. We said there were three things to note here. Firstly, the government does not fund individuals who are politically against them. Secondly, the government does not fund individuals that are too innovative, because they have to be innovative by 2024 standards, but not by 2030 standards, because we haven't gotten there yet. But thirdly, because they're only going to fund individuals that they think are profitable within the markets we frame. Those are pieces of characterization that never actually get fully contested.

We told you that art becomes unviable, is seen as unviable, and that we have more artists entering art on our side. We get more movements, art progresses. They told us that art becomes, like, uncredible and things like that, and more artists are incentivized to make good art on their side. Four weighing metrics as to why our benefits are just more important. Firstly, because we think our argument is a prerequisite. In order for you to have a repertoire to be recognized on their side of the house, you need to be able to develop your revolutionary idea. You need money. On our side of the house, you can get that basic income to progress yourself. That doesn't happen with them. Secondly, art is a unique place where quantity is more important than supposed quality, because you don't need quality control, because art's able to connect with individuals differently. So we think that quantity, as soon as we gain quantity, we're inherently weighing out. Thirdly, we think our harm isn't that big. In our worst case, we have some bad artists funded. In our best cases, we find Picasso. We think we're fine. Fourth, we think our benefit is exclusive, but their harm is even worse. Because on our side, we're able to get new forms of art. On their side, they inherently can't. And on the second clash, on who's best for minorities, it's really simple, panel. On our side, you don't have to work five jobs to pursue art. You can just work one if you want to get a studio. We think we're inherently better. So in the world of opposition, we wouldn't have had the rap battles between Kendrick and Drake. We wouldn't have been able to progress. So like Kendrick said, they're not like us. Side proposition."

One, we think that creating art becomes more economically viable on our side of the house. In a serious quote, a lot of people go to art school on either side of the house. But the unfortunate reality is that a lot of them simply choose to, for example, follow a corporate path, because that is seen as a more traditional path for people to earn more money. The difference on our side of the house is that with government income, you are able to at least guarantee survival. So, a lot of people are able to, for example, follow their passion because they don't need to, for example, fear about starving or fear about worrying themselves or their families because they are unable to get any form of basic protection"

The problem of fellowship and grants is that there's a massive risk on their side of the house, and return only comes in the long term, for example, when you're able to build up your reputation to win competitions, or when you're able to meet, for example, the various entries of competitions on your side of the house. This is why there are massive narratives that deter people from entering the art industry. This looks like artists' careers being, for example, unstable or volatile. For example, people only get paid paycheck to paycheck, which means they get strong opposition from your family and friends,"

Sure, you might get the basic unemployment benefits on either side, but we think the protection on your side is probably far worse on your side of the house. What is the difference? We think that basic income for artists is able to sufficiently counter those narratives. This has to be reasonable. Some people will probably still choose to be a doctor, but we think stability probably means that far more people are now going to be willing to choose to become an artist on our side of the house because they feel their basic needs. We think this is important. Secondly, why is this argument really important then? I think there are three different reasons. Firstly, we think that we are able to increase the quantity of artists which increases the quantity of art. And the reason why this wins us the debate alone is because the quality of art is incredibly subjective"

              "text": "if that's what opposition wants to tell you about. But what you can be certain about is that if there's a massive quantity of art, it is far more likely for the average public to actually find some art that actually meets their tastes and preferences, that actually finds arts they actually like. So opposition, if you want to talk about quality, needs to explain to you what quality of art actually looks like, but you can't believe that quantity of art is something that is guaranteed on our side of us and that's able to meet the tastes and preferences of more people on our side. But secondly, let's talk about the quality of art. Is that something they want to talk about? Because look, what is unique about art is that they may not be seen as immediately good once they are published. For example, Emily Dickinson's correspondence isn't meaningful when they're just letters before when someone survives. It only becomes meaningful posthumously or after that person actually passed away. Therefore, more artists entering the art industry allows more possibilities for people to realise good art in the future, and therefore we think that while good art is subjective, we think the possibility of you finding good art is far higher on our side. Thirdly, we think there's a principal element to this argument. The reason for this is because governments have a responsibility to address market failure. What does this mean? We think that artworks are oftentimes under-provided by absent government support. We think it's similar to things like compulsory education. The reason why artworks create massive social good is because, for example, often times these are things that people generally like and do not create negative externalities. These are often times, for example, a form of expression that allows individuals to chase their passion and also convey messages that are actually good for the public. We think that's massive social good and therefore governments also have a principal duty that they should provide. Alright, before I move on, go. Governments have a think that's master social good, and therefore governments also have a principal duty that should provide. Before I move on, go. Governments have a duty to general societal good. If one artist are believed to be not good or not receptive, why should governments not fund them? One, because what is good is really subjective and varies from people to people. But secondly, for example, governments still fund sport, even if you might not like sport. We think governments don't fund things only because they benefit every single individual,"

Second argument, why do you get a more diverse range of art on our side of the house? There are two observations under this argument. Firstly, we think artists get far fewer restrictions on our side of the house. What does this look like? Under fellowship and grants, it probably means that artists are forced to follow really tight deadlines and they cannot deviate from the expected style, because the average competition probably has a very strict regulation or very strict styles of what it means to be good, because the judges you get in, for example, those competitions are people who determine who actually deserves the grants. Oftentimes, people from a very specific background on their side of the house, they oftentimes are people who are more privileged and can garner a certain degree of reputation, and therefore they are more conservative, and there's a very specific or narrow conception of what good art actually is on their side. Why does this change with basic income? This is a far more organic process on our side of the house. This means that you have more time to explore, experiment with different forms of art. You have more liberty to try new styles of art, because if you don't starve to death, you simply have the right to try more styles of art, whereas on their side of the house, they are forced to confine your societal expectations. What do these new styles look like? This may look like, for example, the shading or the emotions you convey in paintings. This may look like a plot you use in movies that actually convey different types of narratives, meaning that you get far more diversity, which creates more people's needs on our side. The second observation, then, is why you simply get more types of arts on our side of the house. We think that there are certain forms of art that barely survives on their side of the house. A, we think it looks like things like protest art. For example, UK singer Stormzy criticizes the UK government for the treatment"

              "text": "on a large scale on their side of the house, because fellowships or grants will not be given by the government to someone who is seen as challenging the government. But for example, you look at things like sunflower seeds, we think that you are far more able to do this on our side of the house when governments are forced to give artists basic income on our side of the house, which means that you're able to get, for example, far more collectivity between social movements, really that's important. But B, we think it also looks like things like provocative art or abstract art. For example, Rhythm Zero was a piece of performative art by the artist using her body as a canvas. They allowed people to put things on her, and she realized that people, for example, put pins on her. This shows how authority corrupts people. But because governments generally appeal to the public and have a very narrow conception, because it's only like one government that determines what is good or not, we think that provocative art or abstract art simply don't survive on their side of the house. But finally, we think art produced by minorities are probably going to survive to a much larger extent on our side of the house. They don't get private funding on their side because there isn't public appeal. They don't get government fellowship because they want things that appeal to the general public. Crucially, this is important, because art is a uniquely powerful means for the author to convey their message and connect with the audience. Their messages and narratives can only be spread through art. For example, sunflower seeds spreading resistance cannot be done explicitly on their side because of how China works. Very proud to propose. both teams are holding up first. Sorry? With BOK dispected, both teams are holding up first."

              "text": "We will offer governmental fellowships and grants to certain artists upon application rather than governmental basic income for all artists. One, what do government fellowships and grants to certain artists upon application, rather than governmental basic income for all artists. One, what do government fellowships and grants look like? They are based on a range of criteria. On one hand, this is decided based on need. If artists are unable to sustain their art processes on their own, governments can step in to provide them with capital. On the other hand, this could also be based on merit and quality of potential art produced. Governments can evaluate this using various independent art bodies and ombudsmen to decide the quality of art based on criteria such as 1. The technical skill and precision of the artist 2. The level of social messaging it sends and its impact and 3. Audience reception. We don't think this is a very radical policy. Many criteria are subjective, like in debates, but we still use objective criteria to evaluate it. Furthermore, we think most people are able to intuitively decipher whether a piece of art is good, and we can aggregate these opinions to extract out a criteria. I want to note, governments are likely to still invest in art that shows high potential, but not merit in the present. This can be seen based on factors like the social messaging that artists intend to forward or the thinking process artists go through while producing this art. These grants will be given to a significant number of people on our side using immense political capital used by proposition to provide this basic income to like every single artist in the country. After obtaining these grants, the conditions applied to artists are unlikely to be overly harsh, as they assert, because governments are not profit-maximising entities and thus do not demand immense returns from artists. Governments will also want conditions or grants to be favourable for artists to entice people to apply for this scholarship. So their assertion of overly restrictive timelines is out of this debate for the structural reasons I gave you. Intuitively, the quantity and sum given to each artist is larger than the basic income by virtue of the grant being given to fewer artists. The application process on our side would likely be highly publicised and accessible to all with low barrier of entry to entice the most number of applicants. Lastly then, fellowship grants is not just a lump sum of money. It even connects artists to art institutions or educational opportunities to enhance their skill sets over time. Secondly, private funding exists on both sides of the house, which means other governments may not want to fund, can still be accounted for through private grants and fellowships. So the sons of art that we want to talk about will still exist on our side, but our external governments have an incentive to publish that too. Thirdly, finally, proposition has a majority burden to prove that basic income is beneficial in a majority of instances. Case division. First, on more accessibility. Second, on expanding the impact of art. And third, on better talent cultivation. Before that, the balance. Their false argument on increasing access. One assertion under this, becoming an artist will become more economically viable. One, they don't mechanise this. They said only a best survivor is guaranteed. How are artists going to produce art on their site? Second, it is uncomparable because on our site, our value of grants are far larger, given as given to fewer people. So the price of being able to produce good art is also incredibly, significantly much more enticing. Secondly, they say, well, increasing the quantity, quantity is more important than quality. First, we think on their side of the house, they don't prove how these forms of art will be pushed out to the public enough. So they could say, hypothetically, if there's a lot of art circulating, the people could find taste and preferences. They don't prove how art gets from the table to the public, so they don't get their claim. But finally, even if quality is subjective, we need to have a panel to choose from. It's not just one guy saying, I like the sunflowers and I want to publish it. We have a panel representing all sectors of society, which is structurally likely, because governments want to be inclusive. So it's on our side of the house that may be subjective, but it is fair. The second argument then is also out of this debate, because we do to be inclusive. So it's on our side of the house that may be subjective, but it is fair. The second argument then is also out of this debate, because we do have reasonable restrictions. And secondly, we also think governments have incentive to be innovative, so they won't just not pick new forms of art. For those reasons, both their arguments are then out."

              "text": "First argument, on increasing the accessibility of art. Let's make clear the difference separating both sides. On our side, individuals who are poor, individuals who have merit will be given these funds. Those ends of the spectrum are covered. This debate then is about whether individuals who have neither merit nor need should be given a mere sum of money by the government in hopes of making them contrary to society through the production of art. We say providing them with a government-based income incurs a huge up-cost. One, definitionally, they don't need the money because they're not poor. But secondly, these individuals who are privileged in the art industry actually constitute the majority of artists. This is because the barriers of entry to becoming an artist before you can even be awarded this grant or income are incredibly high. Art schools are rare. School fees are exorbitant because they're so niche. And there's no political pressure to subsidise these school fees. Therefore, a huge part of this basic income is given to people, hold on, who don't actually need it. Yes? Your disciples are in school already have projects and prospects. But what do you do with those with experimental projects that governments won't fund or are between projects? That's it. I've just proven to you that governments have an incentive to fund experimental projects because they're new, they are interesting to people. So if they want to promote art, that is the art that they will fund. This is problematic because that means that few minorities who actually manage to get their foot into the art industry through, for instance, breast scholarships, are deprived of the ability to make an impact for art. One, because you need resources to make art. Materials are incredibly expensive. We're not just talking about expensive acrylic paint. We're talking about cameras, high technology that can allow you to make films, for example. Editors to look through the seven drafts that you have just made for your new book. But secondly, you also need different sources of inspiration to create good art. Imagination originates from reality. The more fantastic realities you're exposed to, the better imagination and the more propagating it is. On our side, large sums of money are awarded to people who actually access it, which means they also get access to institutions they previously were unable to access on the side of proposition. But secondly, within governments have a strong incentive to make sure these grants given to minority artists are effective in helping them empower themselves. One, because it improves their reputation. They are seen as an inclusive government who are able to contend with opposition views, who are able to represent minority cultures. That is why on our side, these minority arts are pushed out to the forefront with more money, and that is how we increase visibility. The impact then is that uniquely on our side of the house, we empower minority artists, we empower minority art. Second argument, then, on expanding the impactful role of art in society. One, we're able to do this because promoting art is incredibly difficult on their side of the house, when they already have this safety net. So if it's true that they managed to prove this income will be sufficient, within their side of the house, artists are less motivated to actually promote the art that they create. Because you have to go to so many galleries to get someone to accept your art. You have to go to harsh criticism every time you get someone to vet it. That means that on their side of the house, every time they meet some form of roadblock, for example, a very common artist block, they're less likely to take an effort to overcome that. It's uniquely on the outside of the house then that with government grants to incentivize them, they're less likely to take an effort to overcome that. It's uniquely on the outside of the house that with government grants to incentivize them, they have to do it, they have to push themselves to produce art for the good of society. Here's the way. Even if with a lower quantity of art, we think a higher quality of art is more important. If art is good and it incentivizes more people to participate, that uniquely happens on the outside of the house because high quality art changes people's perception of art. I don't remember all the paintings I've seen on Google when I googled sunflower, but I remember La Pieta. I remember all the important works of art that have"

It is that that causes parents from lower income backgrounds to say, I know that art is your passion and your vocation, but I just don't think it's a good idea. Thank you. He also told you you're more likely to drop out of art in their world to look for something like a corporate job later down the line when you grow tired of leading this life of instability and financial instability. And finally, he said you're more likely to look for a better paid job. How do they engage? Well, they give three responses, and this is kind of the closest they really get to a positive push on this class. So let's just take them down. No, thank you. First, they said you didn't mechanise this argument. Well, Alex gave you three mechanisms, so that's out of the debate. Second, they said you are more likely to be enticed into art on their side of the house because you are offered bigger prizes. Look, this might be true, but this is only true for the very small group of people who probably go into art on either side of the house because they are very passionate about it. This is only true for the very small group of people who probably go into art on either side of the house, because they are very passionate about it. But this group of people who go into art in their world are always going to be the more privileged. No, thank you. Because they can be enticed by the potential of a big prize. They can be enticed by the potential of this prestigious fellowship or grant. What they don't have to worry about is when they are between projects, when they do not have wealthy parents to fund them, when they do not have people backing them up, paying for the rent on their apartment, paying for them to have food to eat at the end of the day. It's in the name of that group of people who we think are more likely to produce, no thank you, diverse and innovative art that we stand behind, that we see the most important thing in this debate is getting them into their art world. Finally, and this was like a little odd, like I will admit the Proposition Bench laughed a little at this, they said people can't afford to make art in our world because they're only getting a basic income and therefore you don't have enough money for paint. Like panel, first of all you're still able to sell your art, like we're not stopping artists from selling their art, so if you want to sell a piece of art and get a fancy new camera you can still do that on either side of the house. But second it's just really unclear how many people get into the art world, no thank you, in their world. I think people can start making art, can get a foothold in the art world without having these most expensive art worlds. I think then from there, the UBI will be perfectly sufficient. Why does this argument matter so much in the debate? Alex gave you three reasons why it's only in our world that we are able to get this best accessibility of art. Not only is it right on principle that we think people from all backgrounds should be able to go into art, we said it's important that we have massive quantity of art, because art is subjective. This is the only way multiple people will find what they actually like, because you can't assess objectively in the present day what the most popular art will be in the future, because this is the only way to address the market failure of the under-provision of art, which we think is a social good. No, thank you. Second question is on diverse art. We said that you are far more likely to have so many restrictions placed on the type of art you can create in their world, because you need to meet certain expectations, because you're judged by people who are narrow-minded, because you're vulnerable to deadlines and pressure, because you're pigeonholed into meeting a certain conception of what your own style is in order to get more and more. So you're more likely to be conservative conservative to produce less interesting, innovative art. How do they engage? Well, they said, first, you can establish objective guidelines. No, thank you. And what I think is quite funny here is that they give the example of debating. So they say it's quite subjective, but you're able to establish objective guidelines about what is good and what is bad. Panel, I think if anyone can say that, like, you know, the debating meta shifts over the course of several years, it is Team England. A while ago an EPL accent was enough to win you the debate. Now, unfortunately, the side proposition it's not. But I think it's very clear. You cannot tell in future what will be considered good debating. So whereas in the past accent prejudice or the fact that I'm a woman no thank you, might have deemed me unable to be persuasive, we think in future you are far more able to assess different types of art. We're able to assess what is likely to be better in the future. Then they say, well, governments have an incentive to fund diverse art because they want to attract more people. No, this is literally a reason for what Alex told you. They're going to attract the tyranny of the majority because you want to get not the largest amount of people, no thank you, but you want to allocate the funding in a way that is going to get each individual piece of art the most funding that you can possibly get, that means that each individual piece of art is deemed to be as utilised as possible. So it's in their world, actually, you feel vulnerable to this tyranny in the majority. You do not fund diverse art, you do not get the kinds of protest art, provocative art, innovative art that Alex tells you"

              "text": "is so important. Before I go on to my argument, I'll take that for your why. A corporate job is still like pay more and be more stable. Why is unbillable income the tipping point for the South East? Because you're literally being told you're going to have a stable source of income. Like you are literally being told you can pursue your vocation, which you'd probably rather do than a corporate job, but now you're not going to need to worry about being literally without income at certain points in your life. I think it's very clear that it is this narrative of instability, it is this fear of being literally without money at certain points that does put people off. Why do we increase ability to see art in our world, increase accessibility of art? Four reasons. First, because we just get more art, it just becomes much cheaper to buy, you're more likely to be able to get accessibility, no thank you, to museums more cheaply when you have more art when it's being sold more cheaply. Second, because artists are better paid, they don't have to inflate their prices artificially. They don't have to buy into the perception that art is a luxury, that only the very wealthy should be able to buy a painting or a sculpture to display privately in their homes. You can sell a painting rather than it being perceived as a luxury. Third, artists have far more control in our world. So you can decide for the benefit of social good, for people you care about, for people to whom you think your art might be really impactful or important, you can decide that you want to donate it. You can decide you want to sell it for a lower price to a museum that offers lower entrance fees. You can decide to find it the perfect home with someone you think will really appreciate it. But in their world, when it's tied to a certain government initiative or project, you are far less likely to be able to get that art displayed where multiple people will be able to see it. And fourth, we think in our world, you're far more able to work on a passion piece in your spare time that you can sell for a low price while also making more expensive pieces. You're not constantly caught up in their rat race of looking for your next project, looking for the thing that you can sell at a very high price. Rather, you're able to decide that actually you want to do something more innovative, more experimental, even if it does not meet the maximum possible reward. Why do we think this is so important, that more people can see art? We think it's really powerful to see something that opens your mind to new ways of thinking, see how Banksy's love in the bin, which was shredded as social commentary that private ownership of art is bad, or it reflects the experience of an oppressed group, or it literally just makes you feel interested and uplifted. We think this art is incredibly socially valuable. We're so proud to propose."

Second of all then, even if they want to claim that in the current status quo, it is insufficient, and many people fall through the gaps, we'll argue, we can use the same amount of political capital they consume on their side to improve these systems, to catch more people who need more money. Like, for instance, increasing the income cut-off for grants and fellowships. Lastly, I just want to point out, their comparative isn't necessarily perfect either, because they say they too wouldn't explicitly attach conditions, like for instance, the need to be verified as an artist, or to be attached to an art organisation. In many cases, these same things require financial capital and connections. So the weighing is this. At the very least, on our side, we have more money to give to every single poor person awarded a fellowship or a grant. Because with the same pool of funding spread across fewer people, on the wing level, we put to you in our first argument that on our side, the poor get more of what they need."

              "text": "So the strategy in this debate is this. They have not actually engaged on a unique difference between both sides, which is that on their side, they have to fund those who neither possess need nor merit and do not meet any of the calls for any grants or fellowships. They therefore have to defend uniquely giving more money to those who do not need this money, are not poor, and have not actually demonstrated that they can produce good art. On the way, therefore, we reduce the opportunity cost of giving money to these people. We have more money to spare for poor artists. I then want to deal with their mechanisms at face value and take them at their best. The first thing they say is that they make art not economically viable. This assumes that giving the same amount of money to everyone is sufficient. But it is different. For the poor, $1,000 a month may be enough for someone from a middle-class background to survive on making art. But it is insufficient for someone who has to pay rent and cannot just live in their family home. For someone who, for instance, has to juggle multiple bills and multiple debts. So what we've proven, therefore, is this. On our side, we can first target those with more need, second, give a greater amount of money per grant, and third, patch any gaps in the status quo with our model. On our side, therefore, we've proven to you there's an incentive for the government to give to the most vulnerable because that improves their reputation and their general perception. They shift, therefore, to saying that they can shift the narrative around us. But if it is true that the return on investment on grants and fellowships is so uncertain, we think on our side, boards have an incentive to give out more of these grants and fellowships to cover uncertain, we think on our side, both have an incentive to give out more of these grants and fellowships to cover this uncertainty, which changes the narratives because when more grants are available to the general public, it is now viewed as a more viable career. But second of all, I want to flip this claim because grants and fellowships uniquely have a certain prestige attached to them precisely because they are competitive. That is why many Asian parents actually ask their children to go into art to get these grants. On their side, when the entire artistic industry is viewed as a bunch of struggling artists who rely only on government welfare, their perception actually decreases and there's a worse narrative around art. That point falls to us. They retreat at the end of this craft, therefore, to pure mitigation. They say artists can still sell their art to earn money. This obviously contradicts their own case on a need for universal-based income to begin with. So I suspect they need to make up their mind. So at the end of this question, the way is this. One, we can target the poor better, and second, we incur less of an opportunity cost of giving money to those who demonstrate neither need nor merit. Next, on the quality of art, yes."

              "text": "So in a debate where the infrastructure literally says that this UVI is enough to find a basic standard of living, you chose to say that it's not enough to find a basic standard of living. But I want to ask you, is it actually enough to do the things that they say, to create adventurous art, to create a lot of art, and to create it very well? It is not. They need to prove that. This debate, therefore, was not actually about the sunflower or socially valuable pieces, because on either side, given that we can both recognise these pieces as socially valuable, clearly, they already exist and already receive funding. This debate, therefore, was about other forms of art. Things like, for instance, NFTs, or commercialised forms of art that just lose their meaning because they are so diluted. On weighing, therefore, it is just not true that quantity is greater than quality, for a few reasons. One, this doesn't fulfil their own metric of social utility, because a mere quantity of art, in many cases, is not accessed by many people. A thousand pieces, in many cases, would never all be seen. Second of all, there is an opportunity cost, as we proved to you in our first argument. Third of all, on their side, by increasing the quantity of art, they actually cropped out good art because there's a saturation of the art market which makes it more difficult for good pieces to stand out. The way therefore is this, when they say future art has potential, we'll bite the bullet because on our side, we can pick people who already demonstrate merit and therefore have a higher certainty of return. Their second argument, therefore, was hinged on subjectivity. But way put to you, subjectivity can be corrected because there are many different selectors with many different tastes in art so they can check for each other. Second of all, there is an incentive to accept more adventurous forms of art because those are the kinds that break through to the forefront. So this is out of this debate. Lastly, therefore, they shift to protest art. But that is not true for a few reasons. First of all, governments have an incentive to fund art that is critical of them to get ahead of the criticism. Second of all, there are opposition parties and non-partisan agencies who want to fund these arts as well. So those incentives are counteracted on our side. So for all of these reasons, their case does not stand."

Because this argument directly deals with their strongest push on the quantity and quality of art produced. And the premise of this argument is that it is uniquely on our side that we actually get the cultivation of talent from a young age. And the structural reason why is because on our side that we actually get the cultivation of talent from a young age. And the structural reason why is because on our side, artistic institutions have a greater incentive to cultivate talent within their own four walls. And the reason why is because grants and fellowships come with a certain prestige attached to them. As the InfoStyle says, in many cases, they are extremely competitive. So many institutions want to invest such amounts of money into their entire pool of students to get good students who are able to get those grants so they can later advertise it to get more people to join the institutions. Comparatively, on their side, they may say, ah, but institutions still have an incentive to do talent cultivation"

It looks like, for instance, more investment in youth programs in summer schools, more investment in allowing poor students to come into your school and do art for you. So for all of these reasons, this argument takes them at their highest. We get a greater quantity of art with more talent, higher quality of art, and we benefit the poorest who are now let into these institutions. So at the end of this debate, I just want to flag out they have here to deal with our argument because all they say to our arguments are mitigation. But as we've proven through, first of all, all the way in, quality is far more important than quantity. And second of all, if they want to talk about the poorest, equity is far more important than absolute equality. So for all of those reasons, we think this debate on both of their highest grounds.

Because of the fact that governments are accountable to the people and there's going to be huge amounts of criticism when people are saying, why are poor artists receiving more than poor sports people or poor people who are working in shops and are only on the minimum wage. At that point, governments are not likely to fund the very poorest artists on their side. Know that what they want to stand by is just social welfare. It doesn't exist in some countries.

In order to produce some of the art that has had the biggest impact, such as Colombian protest songs that are literally made just using indigenous instruments or paintings that are made using very inexpensive oil or using natural indigenous materials, you don't need a lot of money. What you need is you need a basic standard of living that encourages you to dedicate your life to art, to dedicate a huge amount of time to art.

What Maya tells you is that art is far more likely to be accessible. It's far more likely to be cheaper because artists are better paid, because artists have more control, and for that reason they don't feel the need to artificially hike up their prices. Absolutely no response but I think this is debate winning for a couple of reasons. Firstly it's an independent avenue to getting more people wanting to go into the field in the first place because when more people are aware of art people are more inspired to actually take the leap of going into that field but secondly when art is valued that means you have political pressure to art things like support so even if you were to buy their strange claim that this isn't a sufficient amount of money to live in, we're more likely to get political pressure to up whatever this income is that we are giving on our side, and that's more likely to encourage people to go into the field in the first place. It's more likely to spread the value of art.

A couple of responses here. Firstly, the people on these boards do tend to have grown up in the same kind of artistic milieu. They tend to have the same kind of belief as to what kind of brushstrokes are best or what kind of melodies are best. And so it's likely to be the same people who are getting funding. Governments are quite risk-averse. They're not going to want to invest in some sort of experiential art. But secondly, I think when you do have to compete with other artists, which is something that's exclusive to their side, exclusionary metrics tend to arise from that. Because you have artists who are trying to one-up each other. You have people at the top who are saying that this kind of art is valuable and this kind of art really isn't valuable. And at that point, it's the people who do venture into experiential art who do try and push the boundaries, who are less likely to get that funding in the first place. So there's a significant number of people who are locked out. But even if that wasn't the case, note that it's only the perception that it would be the case, which is quite a reasonable one for people who are considering whether they want to go into the artistic field in the first place to have.

I have a number of responses to this. Firstly, because of the fact that grants are larger, there are necessarily fewer of them on their site. So I know, for example, if I want to go into art, there's a 2% chance that I'm going to get a grant on their side. So I know, for example, if I want to go into art, there's a 2% chance that I'm going to get a grant on their side. To up my chance of getting that grant, I need to take out a huge amount of time that comes at a huge opportunity cost to actually develop my artistic skills. I need to find a market. I need to find people who want to buy my art. I need to find a niche that I can go into. And that's when I have to buy expensive resources.

Because you now need to market your art, they still haven't given us an explanation as to what this competitive process is actually going to look like, but I presume it's something like pitching your art to a panel and saying what you're going to produce. And at that point, you need to not only produce your art, but you also need to put huge amounts of resources into the advertising campaign for your art. This is just an extra layer of difficulty for those who are locked out and can't afford it. Lastly, when they say that this isn't going to be a sufficient level of income, it will be sufficient, that's given to us in the motion. The crucial thing to note is that artists often stop. So, for example, one piece of art is rejected and they never again go down that path. We ensure that they have the level of stability. We ensure that they're able to continue producing art. And this is really, really important because it engages on their claim of how quality of art is the most important thing. Because the highest piece of quality art isn't going to be the first piece of art that you produce. It's likely to be the 60th or 70th piece of art. That 60th or 70th piece is only produced on our site when people are empowered to continue down that path. This is really important because it means that we have more people from minority backgrounds and it means we have more art. Every single piece of art that comes out has a huge value for people so we clearly win on that. Yes? So sure, a UBMA itself is a sufficient site, but when you give it the exact same amount everywhere, doesn't that give the rich an advantage?"

There's a huge amount of pressure on artists. They feel pressured. But secondly, even if this isn't the case, artists are very afraid. If they don't produce their art quickly enough, if it's not good enough, they're never going to get this grant again.

Their first claim is that grants are exclusive and therefore people will constantly generate more art pieces, but however, this only happens on our side of the house when people are pushed to generate more quantity of art pieces simply because it's a grant and a fellowship that pressures them to do so. They say that on their side of the house, you need to wait many times for instance because people only get good art on their 50th or 60th art piece. No thank you. We think this may be true. But as we outline in our setup, artists and governmental organisations are still able to see the potential for individuals to get good art. So sure, they can look at things, for instance, your university portfolio, whether that's an increasing trend of your art being more provocational and being better in terms of quality. So what their side doesn't recognise then is that there's a spectrum of artists, those in need and those in merit. As for the influence, we can cater to both groups. What their side needed to cater to was both not in need and both that don't have merit. I'll prove then why this is bad for their case."

Therefore, if you give money to individuals who have not as high quality of art, that's when the backlash is likely to be worse. But second, poor individuals who produce poor art will be funded, no thank you, and this also benefits rich individuals and changes the perception of art because it's seen as something that everyone of different social classes can also produce. First, let's talk about the artists that are poor but don't really have potential. Their only mechanism remaining in this debate is that there's a narrative that changes"

              "text": "on their side of the house of self-indoctrinated fear. I just want to note, if you have been getting a C's no thank you in art school every single year, I think your parents will still tell you to take that corporate job because on their side you can get a basic livable income but if your art pieces don't even sell, your art pieces don't get accepted to a gallery, a corporate job is probably more stable and there's probably better career progression. So it is true they have consistent income, it is consistently low by the virtue of the fact they spread across many individuals. They say you don't need huge amounts of funding because of an indigenous thing. Not their language. Their case in third shrinks to indigenous oil that honestly doesn't meet the majority burden. No, thank you. The problem then is that artists on their side of the house still need to compete with rich individuals who regardless of whether they have the basic livable income still can have access to things like high quality paintbrushes, like high quality editors, and that can actually benefit the art pieces to make them even more higher quality. So the indigenous oil brushesers, while native, still lose out on their side of the house. But I want to note then, their policy of accreditation is euphemism for going to art school. No thank you. So people on their side probably seem to get degrees or at least be interested and cultivated within the art sphere. And this should be prohibitively expensive for most of the poor individuals on the ground. Therefore, this debate was more about the rich individuals who did not have the merit to qualify for grants and scholarships. Why then was it bad? We told you it was bad because it came at a significant opportunity cost, because you are giving individuals money when they simply do not need it, no thank you, and they do not produce socially utile outcomes. Therefore, on our side, we can back the cater for the vulnerable. What do they say in response? Their third argument is about access to art. Their argument is is about the access to art. Their argument is purely about the increase of the quantity of art. One, the quantity of art is not the limiting factor because on either side, I think if their side just looked at social media, no thank you, there are plenty of art pieces in this world, on social media, in real life, on murals, etc. Therefore, it's more about the advertising and the spreading of art. So they have no direct response to our second argument which tells you there's a higher inertia for artists on their side to publish their art when they already have the basic livable income. What does this mean for their case? No thank you. This means, one, they need to account for the individuals who simply do not have merit. They may produce more art pieces, but this is bad on the way. Because one, the way you treat the perception of the art industry as not being useless is to create provocational, emotional and impactful art. If you have a lot of art, but all of the art is bad, people still think the art industry, no thank you, is not worth going for. So it's only a quality of art that can lead to more people being interested in the art industry that are increasing the quantity of art. That was a unique weighing mechanism to prove that quality mattered more. Second question then, whether artists are likely to create diverse or stagnant art. Before I go on, sure. The problem doesn't lie with governments giving everyone money. It lies with your side when governments get to pick and choose who to fund. You can't just say whoever more to fund will also be funded on your side of course, because the reality is governments often overlook and censor certain types of art that could be obligated for protest art. I'll get to protest art later, but check your endpoints. The motion at Infrared Sites says that you can also cater to those in need. So those in need with high potential also get catered to on our outside. I'll flag you when I respond to anti-governmental art. The premise of their case then is that right now, the art industry is incredibly rigid and will be controlled by governments. First sub-question, is art rigid and do they get more time and liberty, as our first speaker says. Despite their litany of examples, Team England actually misunderstands the art scene in the status quo. We think the art scene is more likely to be dynamic and fluid because the government and society right now recognise us that art can be abstract, can be emotional and can also be technical at the same time. That's why here, for instance, we have a variety of artworks from art pieces like Helena, which show a fish being put in a blender, to more classical art paintings that show technical brushstrokes. The structural reason why governments are likely to fund this on our side is because governments right now prioritise creativity when there's a saturation in the market. Promoting different forms of art, therefore, allows individuals to be more creative. There's good, positive spin-off effects for the rest of society when they see provocation of pieces of art, no thank you, and unconventional art. But second, the metric of art on our side is aggregated not by the elite, but the public as well. This is because we can use mechanisms like push and pull funding to see how much audience acceptance there is on our side of the house before giving the grants and the fellowships. Notably, this takes under a principal push because even if it's true that some art critics will be posthumously good, we don't think governments should cater to individuals who do not exist right now, but individuals who exist 50 years in the future. This is because governments have a moral obligation to individuals who are living right now. So if these people within society think that artwork is bad, I don't think governments should use taxpayer money to fund these forms of art. So audience receptiveness is a unique weighing mechanism that is important for our site. Comparatively, on their side of the house, artists are less likely to publicise their own artworks, which is something they don't respond to. This is because their rebuttal doesn't hit our analysis. That, for instance, artists on their side of the house, artists are less likely to publicise their own artworks, which is something they don't respond to. This is because their rebuttal doesn't hit our analysis. For instance, artists on their side still need to"

The way here is this. Even if governments are rigid, we still win. One, private groups and organisations can fill in the gap. So even if it's true that there are protests out of anti-governmental arts, private organisations have the incentive to fund these kinds of arts because they want to be viral and because they want their art to be sensational. Second, they don't respond really to a second speaker argument. They get more talent motivation. And this is important because they told you have art, they're sensational.

First, the argument they tried to bring us at the end of their first speech on how you have more incentive to create art in their world. We told you that this is true on our side as well, because on either side you have to prove that you are an artist to access any kind of funding. They dropped this in second, attempted to resurrect it in third. I don't think it's coming back from the dead, given that they literally just reasserted it. Second, on their claim that artistic institutions now nurture young talent. But Jess responded to this in third, when she told you that this is a claim about private institutions which give funding equally on either side of the house. So that was also out of the debate. And third and finally my argument which they claimed was contingent on more art conveniently ignoring the three other mechanisms we"

We gave you a very specific, very nuanced analysis here. Because when you perceive art as an industry that gives funding only to a select few, and rightly or wrongly, you expect those to be those who went to the top art schools, who have access to the best materials. You buy into the narrative that you will be out-competed for these very large, very prestigious grants by the most privileged, and you will be left with at best a very sporadic, very unstable form of employment, but worse, you get absolutely nothing. And we told you from first, it is specifically this narrative of instability that is so harmful. Not that they tried to strawman our argument, the general claim that art is poorly paid. Rather, it is the idea that you are going to be left with literally no income in the in-between periods where you are not accessing these very few, very prestigious grants. That is what encourages parents to tell their children, don't think you should do this even though you really"

We said, well, it's on the info slide, so take it up with the motions committee, not us. But also, this is a very uncomparative claim. Are your grants going to be big enough to fund an entire year's worth of rent until I hopefully win another very exclusive, very prestigious grant? This is the problem with case shifting in third Singapore. You just do not have the analysis to bear it out till the end. But then they say, what if you have no money for paint? We told you this was disingenuous. But crucially, even if you buy, that better materials, better cameras, better paintbrushes, whatever, are likely to massively improve the quality of art in their world. At the very least in our world, we're not competing with other people who have access to this for funding. Rather, you are guaranteed this funding either way. Finally, they said we can fund on need. We said you're still fighting others. There's still very few grants. But then, note just how they've narrowed the debate by this point, this claim about wasting money. But they're the side that gives funding to those who don't need it, to those who already have prospects, those who already have projects in the world who could have accessed private funding either way. By contrast, we give money to those in-between projects who needed to tide them over, to need to keep them in the art world producing."

First, because the right to create art should be equal. Second, because the quantity of art matters most because it is so subjective. Finally, because people from lower income backgrounds have things to say with their art, because we don't think it's fair that these people should be cut out and their perspectives ignored. But finally, on diversity of art. By the end of this debate, their claim here has shrunk to the idea that governments are very good at deciding that they're going to fund subversive protest art. We told you this is not true, because there are very few people in these government departments deciding, because they're likely to be the most privileged because in our world you are guaranteed that funding so even the most provocative art gets funding compared to in their world with only a toned down watered down version of what the government thinks diverse art looks like. We're very proud to propose."

Secondly, on how we get economic development, thirdly on how we get regional stability in the region. A few points on set up. What does the French exit look like and what is the French exit? France's exit from West Africa is a combination of military exit, political exit and economic exit that has occurred since Macron's admissions office in 2017. This is independence, this is kicking out French corporations. This is removing the French military. What is the comparative then? In Proposition's world, after the French exit, we think that power over politics, the economy, and the military falls into the hands of local governments who actually affect citizens' interests. This is factually true, but what are the structural reasons for this? Firstly, West African citizens value democracy above anything else, driven by generational trauma from colonial rule and a strong desire for autonomy and dignity following their recent independence. Look how 67% of West Africans say they prefer democracy over any type of rule. Secondly, but even in countries with weaker democracies, they are likely to transition to civilian rule because a general general international pressure, b. ECOWAS military interventions, all military juntas in West Africa have set up plans to transition to civilian rules in the next five years, c. when one country democratizes, it opens up its democratic media and imposes a trickling which can force other countries to transition into civilian rule as well.

Firstly, we still support trade with other countries including France, but secondly, what we do not support on our side is the military presence of France and countries having governments avoided by France.

First argument then, on why the continued presence of France in West Africa is principally unjust. The first thing is that status quo is an extension of colonialism. France continues to exploit West Africa by sucking up resources and staying inside the country. Most importantly, citizens of West Africa deeply resent France's colonial legacy. For decades, they have demanded France's exit, elected anti-French leaders, and protested outside French embassies. France's continuous dominance against their will is by definition full of illicit. But why does this principally necessitate France to exit West Africa? There are two independent reasons why France's presence is principally wrong, if either of them stands, France ought to be. Firstly, France possesses something that is not rightfully deserved. We think when France benefits heavily from things which they have unfairly gained from West Africa, that is theft. We think theft is inherently unjust, regardless of whatever benefits side opposition may want to talk about their two implications. A. Analogously, we don't take so much talent away from them because we can take care of the talent better. In the case of France, it is an inmate breach of property rights that is euphemized by economic growth. But B. Speculative future impact is irrelevant consideration from repugnation. Any future consideration like the potential of corrupt whacking group, which may you want to talk about, is hypothetical and is not critically legitimate grounds to undo any past damage. For example, all companies would not be excused from compensating disliked villagers just because there is a potential that someone else that is evil might do the same. Given that France's mere presence in West Africa and other countries was unjustly acquired, it is only fair that they exit altogether. Note that this principal reason is not contingent on any practical outcomes. This, in and of itself, requires France to forfeit its rule because it is not deferred. The second reason is that France exiting is the best method to maximize the agency of individuals. West African countries are currently mere puppets whose strengths are controlled by France, and the best way for them to be free is to be cut those strings. France has systematically maintained a power imbalance within the citizens of West Africa for two reasons. A, massive military capabilities, political lobby to endorse specific politicians, selfless incentives to select which projects to do, uniquely makes the voting power, taxing benefits, and voices of the citizens not be heard. Therefore, the best form of reciprocal power that citizens can obtain by France exiting West Africa and then being able to channel their voting rights and political preference into actual action by deciding which local political party to stand behind. For those reasons, France must be West Africa. Moving on to the second argument then, on why we get economic development in West Africa. This comes in two layers. First layer, why the presence of France has stunted West African economic development. During the colonial era, France set up economic systems that enabled it to dominate West African countries' economies and make West African countries overly reliant on France. France has created a system that never allows for these countries to grow in any way whatsoever. After the French exit, we get economic development for two main reasons. One, though, the abolition of the CFA-Franc. There are three main problems with the CFA-Franc that still linger to this day. A. France requires a massive portion, nearly 70% of Africa's nation's reserves, to be stored in a French treasury, inaccessible to African nations. B, it instills instability, because nations cannot control their own currency. They cannot control interest rates and control inflation and stuff like that. C, the currency is tied to the Euro, which leads to extreme appreciation, and therefore decreased exports and more expensive imports. This is like when Senegal couldn't export their rice anymore because the price of them increased so much that Thai rice outcompeted them. The abolishment of the CFA franc and the shift to a more local currency can change this as they get more control over their own currency and have a currency that is more proximate to their area. Also due to mounting anti-trust sentiment in West African countries and multiple regress from West African regimes, France abolished the French Foreign Reserve Policy. This led to countries like Senegal being able to enact huge macroeconomic policies worth more than $2 billion during the COVID-19 crisis. The implication is that countries have more access and control of their own money, which wouldn't have happened without the exit of France. The second reason is the exit of exploitative French companies. Numerous French MNCs take advantage of the systems that they established during the colonial era to extract disportionate benefits from West African countries. For instance, the French-owned state-owned company ran away more than Niger's entire annual budget by selling off Niger's uranium. This means that French companies use a pre-established industrial dominance to block competitions like foreign direct investment. This also means that French companies create cheaper and better products which stamp out local industries. This is terrible for West African countries as it is uncertain when France will stop funding the region. In the comparative, there is decreased exploitation as there is increased competition. Under French rule, the French do not allow for any competition and block other countries from coming in using the first movement of the package. In the comparative, we think that West African countries can pick and choose from which country to cooperate with. This is because there is likely to be competition between nations. Most Western nations and countries like China have incentive to come in due to, one, the abundance of resources, and secondly, the incentive to block each other's influence. In the past, France created a dictatorship where countries could only obey. Uniquely on our side, we give West African countries more choices to choose from. It is obviously whichever option that these West African countries take is the one that we'd best offer. Look how ivory coast has a GDP of one-third of that in 1978. Cameroon and Congo have never reached this high GDP since the 80s due to their problem on their side. To conclude, in the past, colonisation used to come through tanks, but now it comes through banks. We are extremely proud to stand for the side that cares about people. So proud."

However, all eyes are on France. There is a high degree of international scrutiny that comes associated with France's support for West Africa, given the fact that they already have a colonial legacy associated with it. Which means that uniquely, France is going to be scrutinized to the degree that these other nations are not going to be scrutinized. Yes?"

              "text": "Okay, so their entire claim only stands if they continue to exploit them. I tell you no, because trends have been increasing. I'll point out how trends have been increasing over the past few years. But other than that, I also want you to know that if international scrutiny does not exist, there are other points like, oh, there's going to be international scrutiny and because of this, countries are going to be forced to democratize. Doesn't necessarily work. They can't happen both ways. Either international scrutiny exists and countries are going to democratize or they're not. Then moving on to why there's a trend in terms of France's relationship with West Africa and the Philippines. I want you to crucially note that we think that this comes in two major forms. The first is operational support and oversight of these providers. If you look at how they basically ensure that the security issues that exist within the countries of West Africa have been suppressed to a certain degree, we saw that the security issues that exist within the context of West Africa have been suppressed to a certain degree. We see that they have been really effective in ensuring that the terrorist regimes that exist within West Africa have been suppressed. If you listen to the International Crisis Group, they tell you that in Manchuria, France was able to bring the militant control of that area in control of the 70% within the first year, right? Which is also to say that we are also able to maintain a large degree of regional coordination. It will become more important why this regional coordination is important data, but we need to understand that France's diplomatic and financial combinations are the only mechanism through which we can form joint regional coordinates and policy harmonization. Then moving on to why this is the worst time for France to enter the West Africa. There's four key reasons. The first of which is that if you look to West Africa just to move into 2022-23, over 11,000 civilians were killed, half a million refugees and over 640 million people were internally displaced by the U.S. troops in the Saharan region. This is an impending refugee crisis that is waiting to happen which is only going to get worse if France is entered. We also see that this is a massive security crisis and like I already tell you, China and Russia are going to be amassed into these security threats because they literally won't care. France is much more invested in these countries and it is lacking to care about these security threats. And in Toronto, with examples, look at the cheap IELTS choice vote. It helped all these like Burkina Faso, which helped Chad, which helped Mali, which helped Mauritius, which helped Niger. Second reason, extremist unrest has caused significant damage to the vital infrastructure in two of these countries. Look at Chad. When France's stand shifted to avoid diplomatic and distance position, 700,000 people went hungry because food supply chains were broken. This is something that has literally happened in the stages where any speaker in this state are denied. So just to say that people's life gets litigated worse. Thirdly, we think that Malini, Ayush and Gini and Rukhna Pasu have also undergone bloody political coups and political unrest and we think that military jatats are the most likely option to exist within the state of coup for a few key reasons, right? The first is that their entire theme on how they want democracy so they are going to get democracy doesn't necessarily work just based on examples that we've seen. But also more importantly, we think that we've already seen this in the past as well. If you look at what the international precedent has been, you'll recognize that when countries, when the West has left their military interventionist strategies, for example in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken over. When it has done something similar in Iraq, once again militant groups like ISIS have taken over. So when they do it without people in the institutions being there, it is very likely that the terrorist institutions come over and take over the job, no matter what the political will of the individual citizens in the front lines are. Third, the institutional structures of COVID-19 was also a source of massive infrastructure damage to these institutions because of which we see things like massive unemployment rates. They have conceived with you that they are going to take away all of their MSCs. I don't necessarily see all the economic infrastructure supporting these regions at that point of time. Then moving on to more of their economic rebuttals, right? They tell you that one of the major problems with CFA franc is that they don't have autonomy over their currency. While we can see to a certain degree that sovereignty in terms of where people are able to conceive their monetary exchange rates is important, we think that what is more important for them is to ensure that number one, they don't have a liquid crisis and we've seen that a liquid crisis has a liquid crisis on his or on the CFE franc and number two that there isn't hyperinflation. Because we think that the hyperinflation happening is the most likely piece when CFA-France countries opt out of the CFA-France system, right? Now, let's talk about what are the harms in the position, in the context of when a France would exist. Which, for example, to visualize what the French exit would look like. We think that France's exit from West Africa has been drastic and it will continue to be drastic. This is the exit that we have to support. Look at what happened after the coup over United States president in July 2020. France literally left within two months without informing that any of the institutions were in move to deliver the aftermath of their own mess. Which is to say that when this drastic and staggered exit happens, it's going to create a security vacuum and these countries are going to be forced to turn to the worst defenders like Russia, like China. And we think that this is the worst possible thing that we have to put everything into context of this. Now, why do we think that we can die in the arms of this? We think that the arms of this are most probably going to be like a refugee crisis, like regional instability and black people dying. The reason this is so important is that if you look at the capital, you will realise that their borders are very important. Which is to say that all issues are transnational issues. If an issue exists in Burkina Faso, it is also going to go to Mali, it is also going to go to Nigeria. Which is to say that all of these transnational nations have the ability to object to large degree of individuals very quickly and take the entire region to a degree that has never been seen before. We also think that when investors like China want to get access to these regions, we think that they are unlikely to care about the security threats. Why is this so crucially important? Because like I tell you, there is a large degree of individuals who are becoming number one in space, number two they are losing their lives, number three they are becoming injured because of the fact that security threats from militant groups exist. We think that France exclusively has a responsibility to ensure that these military groups are established but other individuals like China do not have this incentive. Because if you look at what China has done in Pakistan, you will come to realise that China only really cares about these security threats when it is a threat directly to their investments, not when it is a threat to the citizens. Which is to say that France has a better incentive and we have proven that to you both propositionally."

We provided to you a host of unresponded to mechanisms from our first speaker, why these military regimes are likely to be democratic. It is because the citizens want democratic rule.

We think that a lot of countries in West Africa already have somewhat amicable relations with Russia and the West Coast.

They don't need to march in there and kill all civilians in order for them to maintain friendly relations.

Because look at what Wagner is doing right now in other parts of the world. Wagner is literally fighting in Ukraine, he's fighting on fronts in Syria and the Middle East. We think that it's incredibly unlikely that Wagner will just march in with all these high-technology weapons and be able to suppress the people. We think that that's simply unlikely characterization. No thank you. But even if they say they do have the capacity, we think that, well, if they do have the capacity to fight multiple fights at the same time, we think that these, like the Wagner group, would have taken down these French regimes in the first place, regardless, irregardless of whether France existed or not.

But not how this knives their own case, because they said that China will come into these West African countries because they have economic incentives, because they want to develop infrastructure in China. If that is so true, then we think that China has a huge incentive to make sure that these economic companies and the Chinese companies that they put in West Africa are protected to a great extent. We think that China will care about security and China will ensure security. But we say that even if that doesn't stand, we think, no, we say that does stand, but we say that also China doesn't have an incentive to exploit people on that side of the world. I don't.

They want to appeal to these West African countries and be a beacon of hope for them. That they're different from the exploits of French companies that exploited them. So by showing that they are not colonizers but rather trading partners, we think that they can largely win their trust.

We think that yes, although it is true that France has been able to temporarily, in a very short time, in 2010, decrease the number of terrorists, we think that over time they have increased terrorism by a thousand percent, which has been proven. What they have failed to understand is that France, that the presence of France is actually the catalyst to increasing terrorism and increasing coups. Here are the reasons why. First here, we think why does the presence of France worsen regional stability? We think that this is because both terrorist groups and military groups weaponize anti-French sentiment in the outing of the war to orchestrate terrorist attacks and coups. The reason why anti-French sentiment is a unique mobiliser of this support is because it is a universal concern for all West African citizens to experience on a daily basis. When their wages are mega and when they see French soldiers on the street, they have this anti-French sentiment. But secondly, why does the absence of France improve this regional stability then? We think that in the absence of France, terrorist groups and military groups will not and cannot hold this trade, large-scale demonstrations and large-scale violence. Not that terrorism is whose intensely hot to do. It requires mass mobilization of people and it requires insane amounts of commitment. We think that it's not something that a light and casual citizen is likely to do unless you have this fire-and-aggression site, which we only get where France is in these countries. Unique tipping point that France's existence creates is that the massive incentive to cause terror diminishes. When France exits, no one wants to participate in these coup d'etats anymore because they are happy, because they are satisfied with their military regime. Because we have proven on all levels why we are superior, so proud to be part of the state."

But secondly, on poetry and autonomy, we think that's also something that is comparative, it doesn't completely go away. When we think of France, we think author-actors have greater purpose in this to come to these features more and we'll move to that in my future study.

No. Wagner Group and China has a consenting to control them for profit. They say we already have soft power but what is interesting is. No, Wagner Group and China has a consent to control them for profit. Basically, we already have soft power. But what is interesting is that if the Wagner Group is something that has assisted many military groups in Niger and Mabin Bukina Faso, historically these, like, militant groups have been hired by these military conductors to order for them to go and take over these forms of governments, and they already have a lot of power over these countries, things like Wabi-Land or even hyperdependence on these security groups of production because if they step out, they're not going to have possession anymore. We think then, due to these unique structures, they're uniquely able to create situations where they want to exploit these resources. They want these military leaders to be empowered because if democracy as a comparative exists, they're going to have to bypass the public sentiment which in most instances or every instance let's be realistic is going to be against bypass the public sentiment which in most instances or every instance let's be realistic is going to be against the profit incentive that Russia and China have. So their comparative one with Russia already as a common power is something that is unlikely. If they just wanted like allies and international allies, they would probably not even say the war groups in the first place or they would probably call for even other more likely for rich people."

But lastly they say, well even even if they want to fight, and if they have the structure reasons to fight, they won't because they're already fighting wars in Ukraine. The unique reason they would still do that is because this exploitation of France helps them fight those fights. Uranium in these regions are used by these groups to manufacture things like atomic bombs. Other minerals can be used to manufacture weapons. Wagner is not just a military group. They have permeated all the different spheres of the economy, society and other such things, creating unique benefits for themselves. Their reasoning is not enough. But lastly, they tell us, we knife ourselves because China doesn't care about these countries, it's false. Historically, the way China permeates these countries is they obtain specific resources in very important military locations, very important geological standards. But this means that they are only likely to defend those very standards, as compared to France, who probably has a greater incentive to control the economics and the violence in the strater region, because again, they have a lot of economic incentives in the greater LECs. We think they are compared to the severe ill-advanced. And we have historical precedence for that, because China historically, in places like Pakistan, I showed you, but even if there is a story like violence everywhere, they still only care about their specific infrastructure. They need to give us analysis on why that example doesn't work, they're just saying this example doesn't really give you enough to trade off on the practice. Therefore, we can get their contentious up to this point as it's been something that is largely untrue. Let's go on to the classic thing, and let's compare the increase. Terrorism. They think that's increased a thousand percent since France's coming. We don't necessarily see what the structural reasons are for that, we think that's simply an assertion."

We don't think that the UN would probably have an incentive on either side, but here's why French involvement really matters. Firstly, regional cooperation. France has historically worked in ways that promotes cooperation between these countries through mechanisms like the G5-7. With French influence, we have an added incentive for entities like the EU and Germany that have also historically been involved in these regions through mechanisms of French alliances. Thirdly, Russia and China are unlikely to care as much. Why? Number one, China only defends their limited infrastructure that exists in strategic locations and we have already moved on to your strategic thing, but I will also give you examples for it. Secondly, Wahab and Hood has a history of leaving countries in trouble. In Mozambique, for example, they simply gave up an accident when they couldn't deal with the military shotless anymore, who with triple guerrilla tactics were able to overpower them. So we clearly don't see what their comparative here is. But lastly, we need to look at the human impact of terrorism. Millions of people in these African regions have their homes plundered. They have their crops destroyed by jihadi terrorists who think that they do not follow the Muslim ideals. They destroy their idols that are culturally significant to them, they destroy societies. They have no point in their cases, through whose speeches, deal with this, we think the lives of these people matter, therefore they lose simply on this. Let's weigh this then. In our worst case scenario, we agree that France probably has some control. On a comparative, on this simple class meeting we think many more people are losing their lives, families, and the things that matter to them the most, crops and all such things because of terrorism. We think even if you weigh these things, we already are on sort of like a winning streak, but I would say two other classes before that I think would be wise to go."

First thing we tell you, there are a lot of MNCs that employ hundreds of thousands of people in these regions. With the French exit, it is likely that these MNCs are too going to exit. Even if they don't directly exit, which they already concede by the way, we think they are gradually, eventually going to exit. Additionally, NGOs that function in West Africa that are primarily funded by France are also likely to exit. Thirdly, on the CFE France, they say this means that they are not able to trade, but they don't give us a comparative. Things like the ECOWAS are very, very unlikely to work. Why? Because this leads to large foreign exchange implications because they are that, they really do not have precedent for their currency being strong, so foreign exchange is going to be a problem.

Ivory Coast, for example, owes 10% of its external debts to China compared to the other financial loans, which is only 7%. This just goes to show you historically, right, why actors like China is something that is very very harmful. On good governance then, they just claim that military jhanatas are something that is likely going to go away and they are likely to be democratic. First, even military jhanatas by virtue are people that want to maintain power.

We agree that this is probably a principle that stands to some degree, but if you weigh it off against the harms that people face on the ground, we think this has no impact. Second, autonomy. We proved that Russia and China, through mechanisms like their traps and the Bunker Group, have more perverse incentives to create more control over these decisions, which means that they probably do not have actual autonomy on either side. By this point, I think it's pretty clear. They can't even solve all those problems, but all they're doing is leaving these places with no help. Therefore, vote toss."

I want to talk about four things. First, on the comparative and what happens to the absence of France. Secondly, on the political. Thirdly, on the economy. And lastly, on the narrative. Firstly, let's talk about the comparative on this day. I want to clarify that we are perfectly fine with forming bilateral trade agreements. What we are against is the coercive power and military presence on our side of the house. The first thing they say is that military uncertainties are going to arise. If you actually look at their mechanism, the first thing they say is that, oh, this is already true. The second thing is like, oh, it happened in Iraq, so it must happen now. So their only mechanism is the third one, on unemployment. But this is notably contingent on economies of the entire Senate. We tell you about how economy is actually one of the worst on the other side of the house. I'll talk about that later. The second thing they say is a better mechanism. In Dukhiya, I want to say, oh, this is historically true, but Russia and China can fund coups. I have three responses here. One, they never approved the incentive of Russia and China, but one, they always fund this military side to begin with. But China, but one thing, they're always fun, this is like military side to begin with, but second of all, and more importantly, they never provide a capacity of other China and Russia exists. If we call it from the role of speech, that's why Russia already is invested in places like Ukraine or Syria, which means that they have diminishing incentives and a capacity to actually invest in those to begin with. In China, if you wanna talk about that, their argument might have worked 10 years ago, but if you actually look at the real world, the Chinese DRI is substantially decreasing as time passes because of the internal debt crisis within China and the failed DRI investment in Eastern Europe, for example, which has meant that they simply cannot just throw away examples of war strikes in China. But third of all, I think that independently does not constitute a reason why military crews are going to gain power insofar as countries like the United States of America or a lot of other Western countries have an incentive to gain democratic government, which means that it's up here to me why this military regime is going to actually increase on our side of the house. But even if, to what extent, it is undemocratic or democratically weak, what we tell you from his vocal speech to no response was that in the context where there is military coups were occurring everywhere, those democratically weak governments have an incentive to actually cater to the interests of its people because of the selfish incentive actually aligned with the protection of their own government and their own position, right? Which is an unresponding characterization, which is why I think, to an extent, the imperative is not as good as they claim. The second thing you see is that, oh, why is your group all going to come? To clarify, our claim wasn't necessarily to say we don't trade with Russia, but why wouldn't your group, wouldn't the military intervene or force? We gave you three mechanisms which Roku sees as to how they know how to access it because they already have their relationship. And going in militarily and the benefits simply already exist but secondly on capacity and thirdly on symmetry I think that already exists. Before I move on to the principal object of UI."

              "text": "Secondly, let's talk about the economy. I want to first flag in the beginning that economy is more important than regional stability in Paris and the report's three main factors. One, there is no moral distinction between people killed by terrorists and people who die due to hunger, therefore, at least neutral. But second of all, I think hunger simply affects more people. If you want to talk about the economy, it's like 10 million individuals who are living under poverty. So third of all, I think there's less defense mechanism against people who, like if you compare between people who have a bomb and just against poverty, right? I think it is much more difficult for you to defend against people who are living under poverty, which is why I think our claim on the economy is significantly more important. Given that, their claim here is that this new currency is going to be unstable. I have two responses here. One, stability in and of itself is never a benefit. Because our thing was that, inherently, the CFA's rank is having a higher value, the radius is high to begin with, which does not match the local's desire. Because, for example, the local desires, local individuals want to decrease their currency in order to increase the attractivity of their export, but you cannot do that. We simply cannot control their inheritance in an interest rate, which is why stability in the Netherlands is not a benefit. But secondly, it's obvious to me that it is stable in the Netherlands, but it's just because France owned it does not mean that it is stable, because France themselves even isn't using this currency, right? It's only Western African citizens that are using the currency, which is why the margin of stability is not that enough in this city. The second thing they say is that, oh, MNCs exist, but they never proved why these MNCs likely trickle down to local individuals. What we told you from first to knowers' thoughts was that this exploitation exists. Then I want to answer to their entirely and their key why. I want to note, the reason why it is substantially better on R7 than Hull is that local individuals presumably would still have basic resources in the absence of private wealth, which means that they are likely able to use their local currency and export their resources for instance because there is still a demand for those resources, let's say uranium and nitrogen for example. Which is why on R7 and Hull, even if there is no MNCs or less MNCs, there is simply more number of trickle-down effects on the market than there are. Now, I want to weigh this idea of layers. I want to do the weighing within the economy. I think they cannot simply say that terrorism hurts the economy. A currency presents the economy more than terrorism for a few different reasons. Firstly, currency being too expensive is all the time. In comparison, terrorism and conservancy is only in some times. But secondly, terrorism strikes someancy is only in some times. But secondly, terrorism strikes some industries that are strong, but currency affects every single aspect of your economy. But third of all, costs of fighting against terrorism, like for instance rebuilding infrastructure or hiring workers in the process of it, does bring you back to benefits to the economy, all of which means that you simply cannot run a Hail Mary case from quit as to why terrorism also connects to the worst economy. Therefore, we think economy, independently, wins the debate, even under their practical touch."

Secondly, our PLO have already suggested China and other Indian countries, or other Indian actors that come in, also wants to actually fight back against terrorism, insofar as they're sufficient and they actually protect their own economic benefits over the climate fighting back against terrorism. But finally, I want to point out that their other third argument is entirely on this quantity about how individuals uniquely have an incentive to fight or join the terrorism when they have an active anger against friends. And they are not simply someone who wants to do anything. There are individuals who have their daily lives, they have an individual who are actually working, they only go in when there's a high anger against people. Which is why the incentive to actually go into terrorism uniquely exists more on the other side of the house. For all those reasons, he just has to anticipate."

First, we get it that you get economic stability because France always wants to ensure that its pegged value to its currency, to the CFA franc, is always seen as legitimate by the international forum so that they get more funding, they get more appraisal from the community and so on and so forth. But secondly, there is an actively anti-junta sentiment within the French government. That is to say that firstly, it did not recognize the EGF, for example, when the junta was able to capture the whole nation. But secondly, it has an actively democratic agenda that China and Russia, the worst of actors in this debate, don't have.

We already told you in our first speech three reasons each for why that is the case. When France exists, China and Russia intervene and we... Let's look at China, three reasons. One, it is already evident in the military base they own in Djibouti. To monitor the port, they would have to get more influence within the region and that is more strategic for them. They ignore this. Second, we tell you that the Belt and Road Initiative wants to expand actively because that is the economic strategy of China for the next, I don't know, 50 years. But thirdly, they want access to uranium and bromine or deposits that they tell you France has been stealing from. China also wants to do the same thing. But now they do not have an incentive to stabilize the region. Russia, three things also which has already happened. One, militant control by selling arms to the Wagner Group. I don't know why in this debate there comes up a point where they try to push that the Wagner Group is not interested in selling arms to these people when they have already decided to do so. Imagine what happens when France builds a vacuum within these regions. They come in and actively give them arms because the moment it ends, the France stops supplying all of these. The only source they get is the poor in Russia. But secondly, they want to get the South Paralympic because it's a very strategic location. To the north you have Europe, to the east you have the Middle East. There's a lot of other reasons as well like natural resources and the Gulf of Guinea becoming a very strategic location for global trade. We tell you then that when we compare the France influence on our side versus the Russo-China influence, we get far more benefits and they give a lot of hands that they need to show why it does not happen. They cannot simply assert that it does not happen."

Russia only wants to expand militarily. These do not coincide. They do not balance each other. Second, France is more accepted by the international community than undemocratic Russia and China. So there is likely going to be scrutiny over this. That means when at a time when Russia is so politically active, this Western scrutiny that is imposed upon China and Russia within these regions put into a lot of skirmishing in the region, which is devastating for the institutions and the people over there. But thirdly, the alternatives that they pose, that they have in the most likely case, are more coercive. Because China just wants to propagate an economic debt that spirals in the countries. And secondly, Russia just wants to create a military debt law because that is the most profitable model in the instance where there are people engaged for the geography of the scale.

One, they tell you, they concede to the fact that people have anti-friend sentiments. So people are likely to think anything is better. This does not necessarily give them a bargaining chip. But secondly, it's wrong because actors like USA don't have vested interest in the region. Because maybe they're too busy caring about the side of South China Sea.

I tell you no, for a very simple reason. Just look at how the world works. The Nepali rupee is valued at like 0.00 something against the UST. Are we competitive in terms of exports?

We told you that this problem is much much worse because there are no borders. These borders are very very poor, which means that all the countries are transnational. He also tells you that the terrorist threats crash against these economic concerns, right? And their response to that is that the terrorism exits because of France. This is literally just factually untrue. The largest terrorist group that operates in these regions is Boko Haram and Boko Haram is literally based on Muslim ideology. I don't know how this is bolstered by France. Even if it is bolstered by France, this is a large-ranged minority. The larger point here is that the bigger picture is that these terrorist groups are literally motivated by the fact that they have deep ethnic and religious ideologies that they subscribe to. The only people capable of controlling this is France. Why is it that France is so deeply invested and France has the incentive to help their binary? The first and the most apparent and damning incentive that people are going to do with was that the colonies literally pegged. What does this mean? If the CFE grant is going to be devalued, this has busted ramifications for France because that is literally going to devalue the Euro and the international community. That means that all the assets that are denominated with the CFE grant for France and literally all of the European Union were also going to be devaluated. We think that they have a larger incentive because they also have to care about the election politics and the democratic things that they have that we presented to them, which is to say that the only side that makes people's lives better truly is opposition.

France can protect the economy. Notice how laughable it is when you look at the stupid quote. We think that the spread of tendencies, the established dominance over these West African countries' economies, and it does not trickle down to the people on the ground. They make $40 billion from Cote d'Ivoire and the mines in Cote d'Ivoire and ship them all to France. This does not trickle down to the people. We do not see any wealth in which that's how you could make it trickle down to the people. Rather, we think that in the absence of of these we told you for our first speaker that the point of which has so many actions that want to come in not just china not just russia but also switzerland the uae turkey this is not competitive incentive to appeal to these west african people to appeal to them that yes we will provide you with good wage yes we will not exploit you. We think that because these countries uniquely do not have war minutes as compared to France, we think that that's the point at which resources and profits will actually trickle down to the people on the ground. But secondly, we told you about the CFA frame, how the CFA frame is not stable in any way whatsoever. The euro is not stable. But secondly, we think that even if it is stable, it is stable at an incredibly low rate or incredibly high rate, which will make these economies basically crumble. We think that stability is not important in and of itself. But lastly, we told you about how they cannot adjust the interest rates and how this is detrimental to their economies. We think that this leads to countries suffering through multiple times of the recent experience during the 2008 economic crisis, that entire economies will crumble with the CFA framework, while we support local currencies in which people can adjust according to their economy, and can adjust their interest rates, and can get access to foreign reserves that they should be able to access."

You cannot do that on our side, but one can because there's no incentive for these citizens to join any war. But lastly, we think that terrorism is just not important when compared to the economy to begin with. Because what? Well, now people are affected by stumbling hunger. Like 50 million people are suffering from hunger in West Africa as compared to the 1,800 people who have been killed by terrorists. We think that there's no bit more distinction between them.

But before that two pieces on framing. Firstly, what does the implementation of this basic income policy look like? We think that this basically looks like providing less than the basic income and only the basic living expenses for these people. The implication of this is that there will be no irrational opt-in from actors who don't really want to pursue art. Because this is not a huge grant. We are providing them with the basic necessities that they need to keep on living. The people who will benefit from this policy are the people in the status quo who want to pursue art. But secondly, what is the definition of artist and who are the artists who will be funding? We think that there are two criteria. Firstly, that these people will basically have to have some, be making some sort of income from art. But secondly, that they have to be making art at some level of consistency. The implication of this is that this person who just made one song like 20 years ago and has not made any songs since is simply not going to be able to continuously get money from this policy."

                "end": 329.32,
                "text": "With that then, on to our first argument of increased accessibility on art. There are two layers to this argument. First layer, why under fellowship and grant programs in the status quo, not many people can access art in the first place. This is simply due to the fact that currently the art industry is very, very competitive, and you have to take down lots of competition in order to even get these grants in the first place, which are incredibly limited. You do not know who gets these grants, because, especially so, since in order to get a grant, you need to pass these application processes. What that means is that inherently, people who had access to money to go to art schools, who had money to access good paint brushes, good paint, who had money to be able to have the capacity to have time to even create these art pieces or create great art pieces to send to the application process. Only those rich and very privileged individuals can get access to these grants and fellowships on our side of the house. We think this is also extremely difficult for people to just balance the application process with other things like applying for your side jobs for example. So the implication of this is that poor people, especially those who need to do multiple jobs at the same time, are very very disadvantaged when it comes to applying for these applications because they cannot produce good enough quality art to be the people at the top. Note that there's also no guarantee, again, even if you as a poor person are able to get a grant the first time, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a grant the second time and the third time because it is so competitive. On that side, no thank you, we think that because of this, on that side, many people have to quit art in the first place because their paintings do not go through the application process and they're not even able to get out into the public sphere. We think that there are also people who pursue art because they're so passionate about art, but because they continue to pursue this, they are only depleting money from their pockets and going into the cycle of eternal poverty, not being able to get any money whatsoever. This looks like the people who create mangas in Japan. We think that there are many people who like to pursue mangas but simply cannot get enough income to sustain their basic necessities and they keep but and yet they still keep on going. On the comparative, on our side, under our policy, everyone is able to get money. Every single artist is able to get money. So on to later to them. What is the impact of this? The impact of this is twofold. Firstly, everyone who wants to pursue art can pursue art. And note that this is incredibly important, Josh, because the characterization of these artists are that these people inherently want to pursue art because you wouldn't be an artist if you didn't like doing art, right? So on that side, when we're actively taking away the opportunities to succeed, it's incredibly mentally harming and an inherent contradiction to that entire identity as an artist when we think that we are able to give them the opportunities that they deserve to be given on our side of the house. But secondly, we think that we also are able to give money to those who continue to pursue art. We think that on either side, due to passion, people will continue to pursue art. We think that we are uniquely able to give them the money and give them the basic necessities to be able to sustain themselves on our side of the house. Before I go into my second argument, what do you mean by accessing art? We think that accessing art is basically the ability for artists to be able to make profit from art, to be able to succeed from art, to be able to get self-sustainability from art."

                "end": 506,
                "text": "Second argument then, why fellowships hurt minorities disproportionately. There are three mechanisms of this. Firstly, we think that in this stage, the government and the people who grant these fellowships is an amalgamation from people from majority communities, right? These people have intrinsic biases that lean towards that majority community. For example, in Japan, that would be the very rich elitist at the top. But you think that secondly, the fact that there's no objective metric to decide whether one piece of art is good or bad means that people can very easily weaponize this lack of objectivity and discriminate against minority artists. This looks like, for example, in a very white-centric community, we think that if you can have a portrait of an Asian with a portrait of a white person, even if the skills and the art style that were used were the same, we think that the white person or the portrait of the white person is more likely to be granted access and to be granted fellowship. But thirdly, we think that even if the minorities are able to get through this application process, we think that they'll still cater to the majority perspective. We think that this is because they're dependent on the majority people for that funding. What that means is that when people want to make movies about rape victims, they will not really depict the full brutality of it, and will not really blame men for it, and we think that they will downplay this to a significant extent. This also looks like whitewashed paintings of racism that exist in the state's core, and can only get publicity under that brutal policy. The implication of this is that minorities cannot get runs, and even if they do, it's only for artists who downplay their social message. So what is the importance of this? The importance of this is twofold. Firstly, on principle, we think that this is principally wrong. We think that this is an inherently arbitrary way you are born, and what status you are born, so it is wrong for the state to actively endorse discrimination against certain groups of people. Just in the same way it is not good for the state to actively fund white schools over black schools or white schools over Latino schools. We think that it is simply wrong to take this policy or to further the continuation of this policy. This policy should be for all. But secondly, we think that minority art in and of itself is extremely important, especially for those minorities, because it is simply very liberating for them to be able to express their anger, to express their oppression. We think that at the point in which the state is not allowing them to do this, we think that we should take this policy that allows minorities to at least be able to self-express themselves and make an income from it. But lastly, we think that there are many societal implications of this. The fact that literary arts like the colour purple or music from artistic choice of art spread huge societal messages to the rest of society, we think that on that side, that is at the point in which you're not able to get the societal narratives out in the open. For all those reasons, proud to propose. Thank you."

But secondly, they never proved to me why a market, a specific market being very limited and has a very high barrier of entry, the government should give money to those people to produce that. I think there's a lot of sectors in the economy, there's a lot of sectors in the workplace that are very limited and that have very high barriers of entry to the sources of art. And I don't think that the government should be able to give money to all of those people so they can actually enter those type of things in the market."

                "text": "So let's actually understand how the comparative debate looks like. The difference between the words, their role is about the artists. They are now giving money to all of those artists, independent if their art are good or if their art are bad. But secondly, our rule is about the artist's self. It is about the value that the art can aggregate to the role. Because it is our sign that with more selective process, people are actually able to analyze the art and actually understand if the art is able to produce some social impact to society. So let's understand why would that be affecting our side of the house, and who would be analyzing this art in our side of the house. We believe that our government and organization, why does this mean? When we talk about government, it's not the president who would be analyzing that. We're talking about colleges, universities, professionals inside the ministries of education, inside ministries of art, but we're also talking about independent organizations who also have an interest in producing art, in supporting those artists. We're talking about independent organizations funded by other people. All of that is who is funding the art on our side of the house, and all those people will be analyzing the quality of their art on their side of the house. It's very difficult for them to be able to claim that they will be able to analyze the quality of the art and the social impact that art has, because as the new infoslide says, they will be financing all artists in their side of the house."

They will be analyzing which project this is, how does this project look like, is it a theater, what is the social impact of that theater, how much money will it cost? All of those things will be analyzed in order to be able to analyze the quality of their life. So now let's understand about in our side of the house, we are actually able to generate more social impact. Why? We believe that art in our side of the house and the art that the government is putting should necessarily have a social impact. Because the money that the government is giving to the art is the money that comes from the people, comes from the thanks of the people, and the money that people are giving and the public, the general public, is giving to the government. Therefore, the money that the government allocates must generate some social impact to the general public as well. If their point is based on the fact that art is a passion of someone, and therefore someone is producing art at their house and is producing a paint in their house and is not generating any social impact, I don't see why the government in Australia should give money to that, since the government would not be taking money from the general population and giving it to a very specific thing, yes, except for POI. Behind the guise of social utility is governments weaponizing this word to limit the capacity for specific individuals and their anti-government views to remain proliferated into society. As I just explained, I explained to you why would that be effective. I don't think there's a president that is only doing that. We have a minister of education, we have a minister of art. But not only that, even if you try to portray that those are also used by the government or instrumentalized government propaganda, in our side of the house, as the info slide says, we're still talking about organizations. We're still talking about independent organizations. If a very rich independent organization decides to do a part in our set up the house, they will still be able to do so, and they will still be able to do so with a quality of art, because in our site is that where we have a selective process. So how is the social impact defined? The social impact is about the social impact that is able to generate on people. What are we talking about? We're talking about the emotional response that it has on people. We're talking about, for example, how people would think and how people would reflect upon that art. So therefore we're not finding any type of art. We're finding the type of art that is able to generate emotional response. We're finding the type of art that is able to generate real thinking and a broader thinking in people's lives. How are we actually having better quality of art in our set of thoughts?"

The things that you need to paint, for example, something, are also very expensive. The testing, the studying, all of those things that you need are very expensive. But not only that, there are types of art that are intrinsically expensive. We're talking about theater. For you to be able to produce a play that's also very expensive, very expensive to do that plays, you need actors that will go a lot of money. When you talk about movie, that's also intrinsically expensive. So how in their side of the house are you actually taking away this quality? Because in their side of the house, since they're giving that money to more people, since they need to be able to allocate all artists and not specific projects, now they need to be able to give small amounts of money for each individual. Since they have more individuals and since they have more projects to be able to fund, the amount of money that those projects are receiving are smaller when compared to our side of the house, where we have a smaller amount of projects being funded and therefore also being able to give a bigger amount of money to each project. So what does this mean? What is the implication of that? Even though we have less projects, our process has more quality, because now people are able to actually study about art, are actually able to buy the best resources in the market, are actually able to test about the art, but secondly, they are able to produce a type of art that wouldn't be produced in their side of the house. And here we meet with their main stakeholder. Their main stakeholder, those four people that we talked about, those minorities, now they are also able to produce theater, movies. They're in their side of the house, they would never be able to produce because the amount of money that those people are giving, the amount of money that the government is giving, is way less because they needs to fund a whole amount of people. Therefore, what are the actual implications of our settlement house? We are able to not only fulfill the actual necessities of the government that they are having in their settlement house, because they never gave me reasons and now they have the money to pursue me, while the government specifically has a reason to give those people that money, but also we are proving to you how we are able to better produce quality of art and how also we are able to produce, how we are able to have those arts better"

Firstly, opposition misunderstands or mischaracterizes our frame, because what they tell us is that they think that we support a world in which only artists who earn enough to sustain themselves get this funding. This is not true. What we say we support is artists who have some amount of income from art, whether that be $10 a month or whether that be $100 a month. We don't believe that these artists are making all of their income off of this art. Obviously, they wouldn't need it in that case. We did not say this to clarify. But secondly, I also don't think that opposition has enough fiat to say that the standard by which all of these artworks will be judged is simply unsocial utility for two reasons. Number one, because oftentimes these art programs, as the Incluside specifies, are external to the government through things like organizations, which governments have very little purview over. And also secondly, that there are a lot of uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and governments have very little purview over, and also secondly, that there are a lot of uncontrollable factors that exist in organizations and governments. Like yes, the Minister of Art does exist, but you also don't know what the Minister of Art thinks, and you cannot believe that the Minister of Art is always going to maximize social utility. Therefore, I don't think the criteria by which opposition can judge artwork is always going to be this idea of social"

With that said then, I want to firstly discuss which side is better on the level of social utility, largely dealing with most of Oppa's shoot game, that are minorities' accessibility, and finally, quality of art. Firstly, on social utility, I want to know three main things about this argumentation. I want to know firstly, that this maximization of social utility is not true, that I don't think opposition fulfills the adequate burden of proving to you how these artworks are going to create this scale of social utility. We don't know what they're talking about, we don't know what the mechanization is. On the flip, what we believe is oftentimes these artworks are chosen deliberately through the incentives of specific actors. If, for example, you are an actor that lead government, you're probably not going to want to proliferate messaging that goes against what your government stands for. Maybe that means that you don't want to promote things like female rights or LGBTQ rights because you're a conservative government. Maybe all that means is that you don't want to depict specific politicians in negative ways. But we do think that in any scenario there are going to be third party, other ulterior incentives other than social utility that mess with the catalyst. The problem and the unique reason why this is extremely harmful in opposition is because opposition allows for governments to do this, organizations to do this, under the guise of social utility. Because what these people can do is claim they're trying to maximize social utility while minimizing individuals who have opposing views. They can do this, and this is going to be incredibly harmful. But the second layer of response is to say that not only is this harmful in a general scale because the maximization of social utility isn't going to happen, but also that this is going to massively harm minorities specifically for two main reasons. Number one, because minorities are unable to create artworks that are probably going to be perceived as good, or as the info slide says, have mirrors in a lot of scenarios. Because as they, to somewhat correctly characterize, artwork to some extent does require a lot of training, and creating good artwork, or artwork that will be accepted by society and therefore create social utility, are going to have to be artworks that have a lot of resources put into it. The implication being that minorities are unable to access the scale of social utility that opposition wants to push, and therefore these vulnerable actors, who one of their only methods by which they can self-express is artwork, are limited. The reason why this is crucial is, just like I said, this is one of the only methods for their self-expression, because they cannot do things like vote in the government and have enough votes to create change for themselves. But ours can be sensationalized, ours can be picked up, ours can be displayed, and this can proliferate their messaging across a broader spectrum of individuals, doing things like a garden and sympathy for votes. The implication is minorities are better at voting. But the second reason why minorities are hot is as I said, there are going to be intrinsic biases that mess with the process, which means that the maximization of social utility is going to be the minimization of minorities. Before my third response, go ahead."

We have thoughts for English dictionary right there, we'll lift it up. But also, secondly, I want you to know that this is a highly uncomparative theme at best, because their world has a lot more limitation than anything in our world. Maybe graffiti won't get any funding in our world, but a hell of a lot more things are going to get funding in our world in comparison to their world. Third and final response then. Social utility is a fluffy impact. It is an impact that is unfair. We do not know what type of social utility is created. We don't know what types of art they're making. We don't know what types of social utility they're creating in their world. We think that a far more important impact in this debate that isn't the second passion.

We tell you that art is a very competitive landscape, that individuals have to fight tooth and nail to make it in any sort of way, and that this is an unsustainable way to run this industry. On the flip end, what we can do is we can guarantee that these individuals have some amount of income so that they can continue to pursue their passions. There are two important impacts of this. Firstly, that these individuals can do what they want. Rather than, for example, having to do things like take on three part-time jobs, you can take on two and you spend the rest of the time doing your hard work. But also secondly, that leads to mass-scale poverty alleviation. But a lot of times these artists are in poor situations and they're unable to live by themselves. And for these individuals, we can alleviate their poverty. Now the outlandish opposition response you get in response about this is basically to say, well, governments shouldn't have to do this because this is the same in any other industry. There's two problems with this analysis. Number one, it is not the same in every other industry. R is actually uniquely competitive and uniquely cut-throat and only the top 1% of earners earn enough income to sustain themselves. R is more competitive than anything else. But secondly, we do think that this utility maximization of things like poverty alleviation, hard impacts that we can get in our world, is something that governments are prioritizing over unclear impacting like social utility.

Artists have some amount of employment, I don't think artists are getting enough money right now. Finally then, I want to, in my last 40 seconds, just deal with this, I just want to finally talk a little bit more about minorities because there was an important principle of the past that was unengaged in this argumentation. That is to say, the governments are discriminating minorities or disenfranchised individuals uniquely in all positions of the world under the disguise of social utility or in the disguise of merit. This is an unjustifiable way to run things. That even if all of these individuals have the most maximal altruistic incentives, and all they want to do is maximize social utility, all they want to do is create a better art history, that the fact that they have some amount of intrinsic biases that clash against that incentive is going to mean that they're going to have biased results. That even if everybody tries their absolute best, it is still going to be biased. The government cannot condone such injustices. This is a principle, and is an impact alone that is debate winning.

But firstly, on access to art, notice that they say that art is important within the first speech because it makes you happy, because it's a form of expression. Notice how this isn't contingent on you having a living to produce art. You can still make art because it makes you happy on both sides of the house. We believe that people who enjoy drawing, people who enjoy singing or playing a guitar, people who enjoy writing can still do that on their side of the house, just as they can on our side of the house.

But most importantly, we believe that access to the industry of art is important for the sake of making sure that things that are being published are of quality and that we have actual people who are capable of publishing things that aren't just the rich white majority who already have access and resources to enter these institutions in the first place.

We believe that on our side of the house, you will have to submit a portfolio, meaning you show the process of your work, the kind of work you produce, how you study work. You're going to provide, at least, an analysis on the work you produce. You're going to provide proposals for what you want to produce your work about. And you might go through an interview with them. This means that the judgment is much more than just a simple loss and a bias. There's a literal amount of evaluation in regards to quality. Remember that these institutions aren't just political institutions, these are literal institutions filled with people who spend their entire lives studying and dedicating themselves to art because they think it's important and because they like analyzing it, they think it has depth. We don't think these people are going to immediately put their bias in the first place, and that they have the incentive and the capacity to care about the quality of it. Now, they see that these institutions have good biases, but notice that institutions aren't singular. You can compose an institution and not hold every single value it proposes. These processes, being so complex, have multiple individuals in each phase, which each have their own personal biases, which will be conducting thousands and thousands of interviews and processes. We don't believe that there is a single bias that is going to outrule them all. And even if I buy that, we still think that there are competing institutions with competing biases. We're going to have different arts being promoted from different places, like different galleries, museums, charities, etc. So we don't think that that's a big point of provision on our side of the house. Now, we much rather have art that is judged on depth and intention, on the level of skill of those artists, and the meaning, so that we can actually produce quality art.

You need significant amounts of money so that you can actually have trials and experiments and studies of a piece, so that you can experiment with different materials, different kinds of paint, different kinds of mediums, so that you can actually, for example, gain access to events where you can promote your own art, or so that you can have larger projects that involve significant more amounts of money, like film. We never need a scenario where art is actually expensive if you want to produce it in the long run.

I already explained why the point on biases isn't true, but notice how minorities contribute uniquely to art through the different forms of culture and experiences that they can contribute, through the different kinds of expression that they can represent, especially in countries with lots of minorities like Brazil. I think indigenous art is going to receive a lot of attention from the Brazilian government because the indigenous people and black people consist of a relatively large portion of the population and they have interest in promoting this. So I don't think that minorities are significantly harmed. But why do I believe art in their state is significantly less accessible? Notice that income from art is already generally hard to get without any form of a program because you still rely on large amounts of money and financial support to do so. On our side of the loss, you're actually providing people with amount enough money so that they can quit their job, so that they can focus on making their art, and dedicate all of their resources to creating projects that can provide them with a career in the long run. On your side of the house, you're providing people with such minimal amounts of money, tell me how the poor artist who is struggling to make a living is actually going to be able to produce art that helps him join a career in the industry in the first place. Second of all, notice that their criteria are also inaccessible. They say that it's not about making full income and dependence on art. But notice that in order to prove that you make some sort of money in art, it needs to be a substantial amount. So if you're selling your art on the streets, it's significantly harder for you to prove that you're getting income from selling your art on the streets because those people from lower backgrounds don't have access to the institutions that can provide them with proof of their income. Or for example, making art consistently. I think people who have jobs and other concerns, like they say, work in two to three different professions, are not going to produce art consistently, and are therefore also not going to pass. So we believe that the most vulnerable people don't exist on both sides of the house. The important thing is that we're actually providing them with careers and the capacity to produce art that is not only reaching the public, but is actually viable for their careers."

On their side of the house, they're gaining very little amounts of money that they can't actually produce anything worth. Now, this is our second construct of our careers. We believe that we can actually maintain people who are low income and enter the art industry in that industry on our side of the house. On their side of the house, they're going to be gaining minimum wage to make little to no money from their art or little to no access to this institution from their art, and they're not going to be able to produce it properly. On our side of the house, firstly, we have prestige and recognition from being able to pass this in the first place, after all, it's selected, and you're associated to institutions. Second of all, you have connections from these institutions. So for example, a gallery picks up my work, that gallery is necessarily more incentivized to keep buying my work or to keep selling my work in the long term, which guarantees me an income. Thirdly, we believe that you're also generally going to receive more money overall to produce better arts, which allows you to have a career because now you can produce art that is of higher quality and therefore get picked up even if you don't have all of those connections. Notice how this is significantly more important than what they bring me. Because when you have that small amount of people, but they can actually pursue their passion and dedicate all of their time to it, to not only produce a social good that is for everyone who goes to the theatre, who goes to museums, who frequents galleries, but more importantly that these people are going to, in the long term, be able to continue pursuing what is so important to them, which is art, which the government doesn't have to only support them for the rest of their lives. You support them for that one project, which propels them, and they can continue supporting more people. On our side of the house, you get better art for more people on the long term. On their side of the house, you're creating the false impression of accessibility. I'm highly proud to oppose."

They give us wholesome analysis and wholesome benefits that you can have once you get elected and you can get money from the organizations. They do not prove why you can actually get these selection process and you can get into the very first place. Our argument that we give you from Giroco explains why these individuals who oftentimes do not have connections to begin with are incapable of actually selecting the selection process to begin with. The reason being that in this art industry, there is a significant high competition in the status quo, which has meant that people who went to prestigious art schools are far far able to out-compete individuals from poor backgrounds. It has meant that you can actually, people with higher capacity and money to be able to create artwork in the first place has meant that you can out-compete others, and that a lot of the connections do matter in this debate, which has meant that they never proved the three requisites of this argument through first-leaf style to begin with. But secondly, let's say they've got their best. Let's say that you can actually get in, they never prove why you can continuously get in. Because note, this is a highly competitive industry, which means other individuals can get in in the very next second, which means that yes, you can get money for this one project, it doesn't mean that you can get money for the next project, which is why they lose already."

Our claim that we gave to the first was really simple, that if most artists are internally poor or are really struggling in the status quo, I think Seiji's POI proves this and they can see it when they say that most artists do become artists because they are passionate about it, not because they want to actually make money. Which is why the substantial number of people, most artists and animators in Japan in the status quo, are heavily struggling to make ends meet. Which is why I think their attempt to out frame argument and saying, oh poor artists do not exist is simply ungrounded in reality. When in reality a lot of the individuals are in fact making art but are still struggling to make ends meet. Given that, let's take their focus off this and eliminate all of this. The first thing they say is that welfare still exists. Notice here at all, the welfare exists in the status quo, and welfare does exist on both sides of the house. But still, in the status quo, there are a substantial number of artists that are moving paycheck to paycheck, which is why I think it would be better than life, but welfare is not enough. But secondly, on our side of the house, we are able to actually give them money that actually enables them to live a more sustainable life"

                "text": "that is above the working life in the status quo. The second thing they see is that, ah, I like to debate, but that's not the reason why you want people. But that is because there's a significantly smaller number of people who are debaters, and most people who are debaters don't sustain themselves with debating, right? Which is why this is simply not analogous. There are in this tax bill 10 million artists and quite a lot of them are living under poverty line. Which is why I think if there are analogous things, we are more than happy to do that. But even if we don't take that just independently, we are capable of actually saving the individuals within the artist industry. Which is why I think this is still our task to victory. Why is giving money to these artists actually important when in the round? I have three important ways of looking at this. One, money is oftentimes an objective benefit, and one objective benefit of this debate. Oftentimes you don't have epistemic access to what individual funds, but in capitalist society, you need money to do anything, to buy anything, for instance, which is why money is important. But secondly, money is the prerequisite in capitalist society. Anything requires you to have money to begin with, which is why money is important. But third of all, even if you have some sort of money, which I think we're going to come up here and talk about, I think that does not mean that you have money, like enough money all the time. No one knows when an economic shock will hit you, no one knows if you want to have children, or this might look like you're not being able to have a comfortable life, you're eating two meals instead of three meals for example, which is why having money is the biggest shield against the uncomfortable circumstances, which is why I think our claim in material well-being is significantly more important than any other claim put into the debate."

I think their strategy is to say poor individuals do not fit in the criteria of artists is inherently unimportant to begin with. Let's say animators who is making anime in Japan are obviously artists, right? They are in the film industry and they are in like film making making protests like it's unclear why they are saying that these people are not artists on our side we at least give them the money which is why we significantly help the most vulnerable secondly on minorities what we tell you from like um so what we tell you from the local was extremely simple in the process of actually making decisions, I think there are internal biases, etc. Their claim is that, oh, we should fund something that generates social impact. But the premise of this is that the governments and organizations have the perfect capacity to actually assess which part has more social utility and which part has less utility. And our claim that we give you from P was indirectly, which was directly not responded to, was that the decision making calculus is fundamentally biased to begin with, and their response implicitly from second was to say there are a lot of processes and criteria, and judges and NGOs are in fact involved in the selection processes. But I think this immediately falls under the bait at a few key grounds. First, I think people have incentive to actually do reasonable dealing with it, because I think this immediately falls under the bait of a few key grounds. First, I think people have incentive to actually do like, resident living in the Midwest, because I think unfortunately we do live in a society where residents don't like to cram pens. It was simply an assertion for them to run away and say that there is no incentive for this actually functioning in the Midwest. I think there exists these kinds of incentives. And what we, an important nuance here that Hiroko gives you was that insofar as there's no clear criteria of what is the best part and what is not, it's lacking objectivity, which allows those people who have the incentive to spread racism to actually get away with it, which is an unresponsive characterization. So just having 10 people instead of one is not going to solve the structural problem of racism, which is why you don't let government or any experts actually decide what is good for them, especially when we're using the taxpayers' money. But second of all, even if racism explicitly does not exist, our claims that those things are implicitly ingrained in our mind and that people's decision-making capitalism, what is good power and what is not, is inherently flawed, which is why the art of things like gay men kissing is not going to be actually going to the public in so far as people implicitly have their biases with the gator. But third of all, I think lack of objectivity inherently creates a problem. Even if these are not explicit, I think our principle argument does stand within the debate."

Plus, I think one mechanism that Hiroko explains, which is directly not responded to, is that even if minority people can get in the selection process, they are unable to make a minority art insofar as they're getting funding from the government, and they need to please the government, or they need to please the majority, which means that they are going to create art that is good for the majority, not for the minority. So, two things then. One, we win, because this is principally unjust. It is principally wrong to simply only find white people, and not black people, in the process of, like, let's say, scholarship, right? We think this is principally illusory for the government to do this. But secondly, internally, we think when there's minority art, minority individuals can actually perceive and self-affirm that their art and their gender or their race is actually good. This is incontingent of social change. We think having minority art is in and of itself a good thing. For all those reasons, please, I can't take this debate. When you're there,"

The first thing that they establish is the model that says that people need to have some sort of income from art to actually participate in that kind of job. Why this is also a mid-tariff day or on case? Because a lot of art doesn't profit with art. We already explained how, firstly, art is extremely expensive. A lot of people, even if they like art, they aren't going to sell things and actually receive money for that. But mainly, why this is the most current in a contract or in their own case. Because what they say, a lot of people do this art not because they want to have income from that, not because they have financial prospects on that, but because they like art, because they are passionate about art. So we think that the majority of the population that they are trying to affect actually does art because they are passionate and don't sell this kind of art. So we don't believe that these kind of persons are having income with art. So we believe that if there are multiple passes, these kind of people aren't actually participating in their own program that they tried to create in this debate. So we believe that they are contributing to our system in the beginning. But second thing, they tried to paint in this debate that a lot of people, they are passionate about art, even if they have some kind of income, but we believe that this is true, but they have the burden to prove why, in this debate, governments should finance the passion of people. We believe that a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck in a variety of different professions, and a lot of people have different professions that they love, that they are passionate about, and governments aren't giving more money to them to exercise this kind of profession. We don't believe that just because someone is passionate about it, the government shouldn't say that. But even if we believe that it was true, why this kind of programs that governments financially guard actually exist? Because it gives a social impact to the population. It's not in society that you are giving money to artists to produce their own creatures. We are actually giving money to artists because they will actually give a return to society, and the money that these taxpayers give to the government to invest in this kind of problem, they are actually returning to them because we have a social impact on that. So what they tried, they had to win this debate, is that the kind of practice that they had in their side of the house is actually giving more social impact to the population than what we have in our side of the house. I'll engage with my second point in this debate about quality of art, how just we can have more social impact in our side of the house."

We believe that, and we try to paint firstly, that a lot of people that are in the minority, they won't have the capacity to produce art and create all the distribution with art in our self-domination. Firstly, and to the selection process, we believe that first, art is not necessarily political. So if I produce art, it's not because some government is like from right or left, he's not allowing my art to actually impact this government. We believe that the majority of art actually isn't political. Second, we believe that the people that actually analyze this art is in fact the president of the country and actually one party of the country. We believe that there are a composition of a lot of people that are not the right to do that. And third, because governments, they have checks and balances also. We believe that the governments, they really do this kind of process. They actually need the best outcomes from this process. So, they are actually going to receive and to actually analyze the projects, that our generation's social roots and population, that our generation comes to the project that they are reading, and most of them, because if they select just bad things, we think that the part of the population that votes for them won't vote for them anymore. We believe that this government, they don't have the interest to vote for the person who is at the top. But more than that, why do we believe that even the minorities, even if they are from different groups, they still select the next top house? Because the process is not what we paint. We believe that it's not like you send an ad project that is expensive and the corporate likes it and they will sell it. We believe that's much more about the project. That's what the infillality is about. So if you have a good project, for example, having a theater and producing a theater, explaining how it would impact the population and what kind of resources you need to do that theater, these kind of things are passing hours and hours. But when they start to close, what they actually need to do to prove they are an artist is sending artists to the block room. So you believe that the only way that we can financially minorities have good projects, do good projects, and actually improve their capacities in art, have the income to do good art, and actually produce something that has such impact on society, is only in our side of the house, when we actually give them this money to do this kind of things. But more than that, they try to paint old, they suffered biases. Actually, they have a big burden to provide for example, what they tried to paint, only for example white work is selected. We don't believe that this is true and some reasons for that. First of all, the composition of the government. But second, we believe that art is one of the few sectors in the government that is much more progressive than other sectors in the government. We believe that when we are talking about art, we are actually being more progressive to the nature of art that is actually transforming society and giving new perspectives to people. So we believe that the people that are involved with art, even in the government or in the different organizations that are actually in our set of house, as the English language says, they are going to actually give an attitude to the people, not want to try to create their own southern house.

I already explained how we have a lot of methods to be sold, and how Corbett's have actual incentives to decide the better quality of projects, and how they work, and how this selection process actually is about. But second, we believe that only in our central house, even if we have similar projects than quality in those central houses, the money to realize these kinds of good arts to give them to the population is much better than our central house, as we have fewer artists being selected. We give more money to them, the resources necessary to them to produce that art. So we just believe that even if they have good artists, good selectors, we believe that they wouldn't have the money to actually produce the arts that is necessary to give the social impact. So we can only ask ourselves how we can guarantee that. But how do you try to answer our principle that I talked about, how is not the data to govern the social issues? They have two main answers. Firstly, they say that art is much more comprehensive than any other sector in the society. This is simply not true. It's not to say that women artists are not equal to black people or other women in the financial sector. I just want to point out that we are not trying to say that women in art is not difficult to do, like most of the women in the financial sector. I just think that you are wrong trying to engage with other women. But second, in that art is actually accessible. We are having a role where internet and AI say, I'm actually helping people to produce art. We are in a role where people actually can really evaluate different types of art. And we believe that in their scenario where people are actually passionate about art, even if they don't have a lot of money to be sold, they can actually produce art for themselves. We don't believe that this is incestuous. So we believe that art is expensive to produce very good things to help society, but it's not expensive to do normal things that we're passionate about. But second, the way that we try to answer is that arts are also poor, and governments should help them as they do. We do welfare policies. First, we believe that no thesis is totally true if they are not the answer of the bill. I stated that if they were poor, they are going to be helped by these welfare policies. What you say is, oh, but they aren't that poor, they are actually having a good job and they do art that should complement them. If they aren't that poor, I don't believe that governments should spend their money to make these people that are rejected rich and to receive more. However, there are a lot of people that are actually struggling with poverty and hunger, and they don't receive this kind of money because government has a limited amount of resources. So we don't believe that government should have the duty to just finish the passion of people that are just coming for the options. So you believe that the principle that happened in the Narcissus House, but it is not the duty of the government to have that in the Narcissus House, is to end the lithium-ion. And you believe that there are continuing minorities, and actually, flip it to our Narcissus House, because just in our Narcissus House, these minorities, they actually have the capacity to produce a good high if they are interested in the projects, because only Narcissus House has the resources to do so. And secondly, about the quality of the price, believe that just as high quality of art in the US because of the selection process and because there are a lot of films that are used by artists that produce that, and so we give much more social impact to the population that are actually the most important. So, we are proud to be here."

The only reason you get for artists not being poor on opposition is their existing welfare assistance which you get in POI. This, from Natsuki's speech and an unresponded response we proved to you, is not enough. The important nuance, therefore, of artists being poor in opposition is not just that they are poor, but that they are unable to do things like access alternative measures, which my first introduction mentions. As DLO concedes to my POI, it is deceptively alluring. People become incredibly passionate about art. People develop things like sunk cost policies where they've invested too much, and art is an untransferable skill. The implication then is that individuals are unable to opt out, or individuals are stuck in a lack of earning that exists in our opposition. Comparatively then, are these artists better in our world? Opposition will have you believe, too many protested why artists are not better in our world. Opposition, firstly, will have you believe that poor people are unable to pass in our world. But Natsuki explains how many, for example, animators are under the line of poverty. But it's not even just that, right?"

I also want to next deal with the opposition claim that if the majority of these artists are so passionate about art, then it's probably fine that they're poor. But the issue lies outside of art, which I'm sure Natsuki's weighing mechanisms prove to you. It's about whether you have food on the table, milk for your baby, a house for your family. It's not just about whether you can have fun in art. Is this argument therefore, is this, is all of this important in this debate? We give you four reasons why this is massively important."

One, this is again a premise that an opposition leader would prove impartiality, which they have never done in this debate. And two, this is the most futile thing to do in this debate. The impacts on opposition are incredibly fluffy. Let's talk about minorities here, and every important response opposition gives. Opposition wants you to believe a lot of things, like this insane idea that art isn't political, though an actual important responses you get from op are truthful. They firstly have you believe that governments are diverse and have checks and balances against minorities. Across the bench we tell you two things. One, not all countries have it. They can't just debate in the most progressive democracies, they have to exist in the spectrum of the context. It is true that in many countries the top of the ladder are individuals who are old, rich and white. It is true that in a lot of countries the top of the ladder are individuals who believe that women rich, and white. It is true that in a lot of countries, the top of the ladder are individuals who believe that women have no place in society. But secondly, that there is implicit biases that cannot be tackled, even if the governmental system in and of itself is perfect. Humans are nothing, no matter how many cumulative individuals you have, they still, for example, buy into the majority. Opposition then has to believe that there's a lot of backlash when minorities get in, but often it's more implicit than that, minorities having significantly smaller chances of getting in, it is incredibly hard to call out. It is a matter of statistics, and a statistic that never gets published. The implication of all of this is that the argument of bias is that this is principally wrong because it is arbitrary where you are, whether you are a minority or not. This is analogously only funding white individuals and disregarding black individuals. I think that this argument is maximally important and the principal metric we take this debate. Thank you."

                "text": "Moving on to the first part of my mention, as to why inter-trafficking to a religion of alt-ism is immediately harmful. The thesis of which we'll admit is that strength secularism is essential to ensure a biased political discourse and equal access to public services. There are two layers to this argument. First layer, then, is why strength secularism is necessary to eliminate the intertwining of original politics. No major. We think anything apart from it results in heavy intertwining of original politics. This is due to three reasons. One, politicians have massive political incentive to capture these votes. And note here that not only open voters, religious supporters still identify with politicians' support because they are the most loyal voters. For instance, today, about 25% of the US do identify themselves with evangelicals, and most of them back Donald Trump in the 2016 election and took the scales in his favor. Two, religious organizations have vote-based incentive to pass change-loving government. We want a first-ever policy, and both been extended with the capacity to lobby government. We want a first-ever policy, and they also have lots of capital to lobby. They acquire funding from foundations, from their followers, and use it to hire lobbyists to form broad-minded campaigns. This looks like NNE, No Me Too, National Association of Evangelicals, Lobbying and Abortion, or the United States Congress of Catholic Bishops, lobbying in Indonesia. Three, The line as to what violence and separation of church and state is inherently unfair. Just consider the U.S. president, placing an ad on the Bible during an inauguration. Justice is endorsed Christianity, or is it a merit ceremonial? Or is it supposed to eat moral and liberal life that anger? Is it promoting Christianity? The implication of this is that the blurred boundary between politics and religion makes it extremely difficult for justice systems to step in. For example, Japanese ministers were accused of holding ceremonies at religious tentacles, but courts have not fully guessed that. Thus, what some think is deemed acceptable is sent to the president, and over time, slowly memorizes the more and more extreme forms of non-secularized political involvement. Thus, strict secularism is necessary because it is only when you bend all forms of religious polling expression that parents lose the power to demand for vital citizens' schools, that religious groups are barred from lobbying, and that religion protests are met. Over time, discourse around secularism will fade away on our side. It will be normalized to not talk about religion and not bring up religion as a polling, which further encompasses the incentive of politicians to pass discriminatory religious policies."

                "text": "On to the second link. What are the impacts of this dysfunctional secularism? The impact of this is twofold. First, it restricts people's capacity to go to public space. When religion and other faiths which is called sex for education get tangled up, it creates a enormous model. This is because the state gives more political and financial support to these religions. This looks like Christians lobbying for LGBTQ plus folks to be banned from school. This looks like gay people being barred from accessing public services in LGBTQ plus regions in Poland. And this is harmful on two levels. A, on a practical level, certain people are barred from the vital public services of just schools and hospitals. Obviously, these are incredibly important people and you cannot live without them. When they are not welcome in these places, they feel like their identity is not valued by the state on a daily basis. On the principle, public spaces are funded by tax money, which is 100% given by all citizens. Therefore, principally, everyone ought to have an equal right to use the benefit from these spaces. I'm studying the impact of world politics. It's prompted two points. entanglement between politics and religion erodes political discourse and compromise. This is because when political parties are implied to register, it significantly surpasses and compromises the issues. This looks like Christians longing for no sex education at all and being unwilling to accept atheist demands to reduce their restrictions. B. Restrictions, related to the extremities, all being empowered by the office sector as well. This is because the title groups organizations that lobby for this are not moderately influenced people. For instance, the risk-holders, such as Christians, who wouldn't even go crazy to church on Sundays, wouldn't go out lobbying government. However, hard-liners, which is even helpful, who tend to have an extreme view in the world, would go and push their policies, such edge, lifting restrictions on page speed, especially in the context of English speech. All of this harms vulnerable people, especially those who find your name in the news. These policies could pass the government, as these followers of the Bible, the Ephesians, and evangelicals perform significant and humiliating policies, strict step by step to prevent the more severe forms of income. And before I move on to a second argument, I'll leave it to you. I think you were just expressing the right feeling about the census. Before I move on to the second argument, I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question."

As to why a better absence of public space necessarily creates a piece of tight contention between religions. First of all, it's important to note the context of this debate. As I pointed out from my intro, the status quo of the world is my own truth, my own view, and my fear. This shows that religions have a hard time focusing at all the times when quo of the world, my own recent writing, is in a theater. This shows that religions have a hard time focusing at all the times the minority which is feel-pushed aside by the majority in society. In this debate, opposition will lie to you that religion in the current world can coexist from a reason. We tell you that as and always will not work. Coursework for reasons. One, exposure to different visions of the public fuels people's antagonism against minority religions. Religions often have a contrarian view of their ideas and put those in the question of pain. Seeing public Muslim festivals celebrate a new public is a constant reminder of how much the opponents disagree with their religion. Every time you see them, you feel like you are being invaded by these new religions. All you can see is that there is a limit. This won't happen because you will see an event that will call that here to come. 2. The concept of religious freedom in public allows people to attack other religions. The line between faiths which are confined to religious discretion is extremely blurry and individuals have been splintered against other religions. Women who mislook like Christians, going around to the cross-country saying that our country is a Christian country, you can fist at anyone, so you can block their line of rights. Comparatively, people cannot weaponize religion and politics. Three, politicians with a massive incentive to weaponize a negative sentiment against minority religion, whether in all favor, as that often turns different books. It's the same politician calling all Muslims quote-unquote Islamic radicals to instigate fear, or in the worst case, to incentivize the destruction of the Reds, a similar example from Mao. Comparatively, politicians cannot talk about are weaponized religion. Fourth and lastly, minorities feel neglected as society disproportionately favors men-contrary religion. This is because everywhere you go, you see Christian symbols. From the lens of the Muslim, you feel your belief is not represented enough. Consequently, minorities are not shown in the face with the majority and the dissimilar. Our impact of this is very simple. Minorities, the minxies, are able to walk down the street every day like any normal person. For all these reasons, we are very proud of the police."

Okay, why is this untrue? Firstly, we think just because you ban the popular religious expression does not mean that these incentives these people have, that the fact that these people want these policies to want to have the change-based policies in place will still want that, but now they're not able to publicly express this. What does that mean? Now they feel actively threatened. They feel like big ads also tell us that they're going to be the most radical group of people. But this means that now they feel they're being suppressed by the majority, they're being suffered by the state, which means they're likely to be even more anti-independent. What this means is now they're not going to be able to publicly rally, so they're probably going to do these things in hidden places or under the, without the state's control because now the state has no ability to monitor them because it's not being done professionally. What this also means is if these people want these narratives to be in place in the first place, they can still rally for these things under other terms. Like if you want abortion to be banned because of religious reasons, you can still push back on the narratives of the whole life instead of just not saying because of religion.

They are a beautiful step give you most of it, and I think most of it is probably look like a ban on wearing hijab or a blue cap, but like, we take one from wearing a cloth or not having a statewide religious culture and generally we can maintain a culture, religion, and a public sphere. In most of the cases, like, a public is a Jewish minority. And you start with, how many is toddler? I think it's like four or six. Four to six. . . . . . . . Okay, are we ready? Okay, starting in 3, 2, and 1. It most likely looks like more extreme forms of practices that some European countries like France are already doing, right? But that is not their second point of setup. How is the imposition of strict states and norms and rules to be done in the first place? In a biased manner, majority of these Western liberal democracies have a long-standing Christian heritage, which is largely seen as their culture back home. These structures will continue to cherish this heritage and its symbols. They are so integrated into the daily lives of these people that these countries would recognize them as merely religious symbols but also as a cultural symbol as they do even in the Christmas. So what will happen is that the balance will be in position because your shanty will be expressed all the time in the veil of culture while other religious expressions will fall under the gluten and gain smash. For example, Christmas is a large part of the cultures of these nations and while most likely continue to be celebrated grandly in public spheres, hence these symbols will most likely still be displayed in public. It is only religious minorities whose ability to express their religion will need to be sacrificed. But secondarily, public servants like teachers, government officials, etc. will enforce these policies and their subjective discretion policies. This is like a French teacher, Jacksonizing a girl because her story goes too long and similar to a book club. This means there is no uniform application of this policy due to the very little permission of these policy-based people because they are so unfamiliar and the lack of exposure to these practices in the first place. See even normal things often appear as unlawful because they just don't know enough about it. But see, the punishment of a violation for this policy can exist on a wide spectrum, including the imposition of bad device. In prison and at times, it may be even beating up innocent individuals. Probably, it has to prove why even risking confrontation and injuring people to defend this policy of theirs is more than legitimate"

This argument doesn't seem the best case of proposition because even if we think and actually enforce that policy uniformly for all religions, it all comes to be done if we can prove it as a direct violation of people's freedom of expression. This religion, which is crucially tied tied to their identity is being attacked. The minister is going as a part of the sum of identity now. It can be temporarily given up because the same way you cannot fundamentally ask a trans person to have to temporarily identify with their birth gender, really because others are offended by or disagree with their identity, right? Why is the assertion of position in the public sphere a critical part of their identity? It inhibits their moral beliefs. It influences their actions in both public and private spheres. It really is a crucial way to access peace and solace for these people. People's religion is an act of selfishness and the act of sort of going to hell for those who really need it. People fulfill their religious duty by being able to express it in the public in their first place. How does straight-state terrorism then violate religious identity? Because firstly, many of the industries that are able to express religion in belief that a way is meaningful to you, they will mostly look at things as an imperative for a firm to be able to work out any type of rejection of that freedom or denial of that ability to practice their religion. But when you can practice your faith in a way that is deemed right by people, you feel like a sinner. These practices are able to... These practices are being... Key math is provided by religion, and we think it's essential to follow this. But additionally, also he's told that hypocrisy of Western liberal democracy is a matter which prides itself on the so-called bastions of freedom and choice.

I think that answers it. Authors that can talk about street-state socialism and biases will not see into because they don't have other problems holding these governments in control. I think that answers it."

Introducing the religious minorities to interact with the majority, the expression of religion becomes much easier with the ending endings of people, though similar religious and beliefs. There are more thoughts developed in these areas from both the minorities and thus they can pray or abide their religious mandates by staying within that area, so it furthers a different sum of communities. Secondly, when minorities interact with the majority groups, they often play a student, their religion has not been has not been brought into the public sphere, right? Even in this interaction, you will often be negative with your side because people from different communities do not properly interact with people from other communities until they are teenagers. And by acting this way, to build a solidified student that already exists, right, this inclusion is likely to lead to extreme polarization in their sight of the world because you want to interact with people who share your beliefs and you only care for your own community.

                "text": "Firstly, what does the implementation of strict state secularism look like? Opposition tries to come up here and say that strict state secularism will only be applied to minorities. Well, we say that this is simply not true for a couple of reasons. Firstly, please read the motion and the motion's application. We are basically supporting very strict state psychosocial, something that applies to all people living in the state, which includes vans for all religious symbols, including both Christian cross and Muslim head scarves. So the opposition cannot just come up here and say that this will only be applied to workers and jobs. If a Christian cross is used as a religious advocacy, we will obviously still ban it. If parents come to the school board trying to get Christian beliefs into the public curriculum, we will still ban it. And most importantly, if there is lobbying, obviously we will ban it. But secondly, we think that the premise of that entire argument is wrong. They try to say that people just don't have enough knowledge about religions and religious faiths and religious public displays in order to be able to restrict these Muslims from holding these Christians equally in the class space. But I think this is simply not true. The fundamental tenets of religion, the clothing, the accessories, the practices, are largely known by everyone. Everyone knows that the Christian cross is a symbol of Christianity in the same way that everyone knows that hijabs are part of Muslim faith. We don't think that anything stupid like black fanny boots and bells and long dresses will happen. But if that is an expression of religion, we think that yes, we do have a justification to ban it. But lastly, we say, so what? Even if the lines are blurry, we think that we are at least able to apply this policy to the vast majority of things that are generally viewed upon as religious. We are still able to ban the most obvious forms of religious and cultist ways. Sure, Christmas might not be banned, but at least on our side, we can prevent people from using religious classes to get across very, very anti-Muslim rhetoric. We think that the most extreme forms of extremist violence will still be prohibited on our side if those reforms are clear. No thank you. So they can't just point at helping in cross-stabbing us as a whole, they won't. But that doesn't engage with the class of our argument. With that, the implication of all of this is that strict secularism will be applied to an equal extent. But secondly, on religious freedom, no one can guarantee it like us."

                "text": "The opposition tries to come up here and say that public faith and public display of your faith are very important to your expression of religion. We think that this is untrue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we think that the people's conception, or religious people's conception of normalcy can change over time, because once this policy is enacted, once strength in secularism is enacted, every single micro aspect of your life changes. There are no more theology courses in college, no more religious protests, and leave around you cannot state your faith openly. So once you continue this for a couple of years, you get used to this life, simply because society as a whole does not assign religion in public any collective significance. We think that this looks like, for example, after the genocide that happened in Rwanda, the present mass citizens are expressing their ethnicity publicly, and now people are just confined with that, they are willingly expressing their religious freedom under the veil of their private faith. So the implication of this is that when states implement strict state secularism, this is not compassionate because people will adapt willingly to this religion. So it is not a compression of religious freedom if people are going to adapt and express their religious freedom willingly. But secondly, we say that the degree to which public display of faith matters is incredibly limited. For most people who practice religion, the ultimate goal of practicing faith is forming a personal connection with God. The humongous moments of elevation and emotional salvation for religious people come from praying to God and getting salvation from God, which happens through prayer, right? So although we do see that public displays of faith and proselytization may hold some meaning, we do not think that this is the most important consideration for these religions. On the other hand, you can still do a majority of meaningful private things. For example, you can still pray by Thursday and enjoy your communication with God. The implication of this is that you do not feel like you are being betrayed by the state because you will adapt to it and it's not an important freedom that you're giving up. But lastly, we think that the choice to exercise religion in the public is less important when compared to the choice to exercise other things. So this choice of freedom and religious freedom is not absolute. Because religions are contradictory in nature, your right to form religion in public greatly offends and harms the other religions. We think that the state is justifying to limit certain rights of expression when there is a bad party calm. We see this in masks of hate speech. We see this in brands of graffiti. Because although you are expressing yourself, you are telling others that that is not just. At the point of which we proved the economy of Mexico by our explicit back-plotting bombs."

We don't want Christians to come out of their community and post their religious bands on LGBTQ plus people. We think that that is a good. But secondly, we try to tell us that Christian people can still vote through other means, and through passing off abortion as proclive. But we think that even if we can't conceive that we cannot change abortion, we can still change a multitude of things on our side. So I told you from our last speaker that maybe these policies become less absolutist, because at the point of which you're not assigning your political views with your religion, there's more space for compromise because it's not a clash of identity. Secondly, even if you can still vote for abortion policies through other means, we think that there's still many other huge benefits, such as being able to ban lobbying, such as being able to ban people from getting out of that cross and protesting outside Muslim mosques and making people feel very uncomfortable. We think that this is a benefit that does not exist on their side."

We think that he likes people on that side who want to even interact with Muslim people in the black space. We need to get rid of these public displays of expression. We think that people can get together and expose them and get together as human beings not because and not judging each other by their religious faith.

When you allow different forms of voices to come in, you allow checks and balances to be announced to make sure religious individuals aren't dehumanized and demonized by politicians who have every incentive to do so. This form of check and balances makes sure these individuals can continue to have a magnified life. First then, on the principle. We've given you every single layer of analysis. So why is it morally legitimate? We've given you layers of P.O.I.s. Why? And you ask me this. Would you allow a gay individual to not stay still in their private life involving in the yet-weirder response? No, pardon. This is an extremely semantic thought. The way through which religious individuals express and empower themselves is through being a part of religion. It's through expressing themselves in public and it's through feeling like their God is with them no matter where they go. The moment you die, these individuals are barred from doing so. They feel dehumanized and there's a level of innate human being where you feel like you're less than everyone else around you. Where you feel like your ability to express yourself is for some reason barred by a scheme even though you did nothing wrong. You get to hear any responses to why this is problematic. The reason why all of this is important and it matters within the religion is because the ability to express yourself is the way through which you inform your identity. We believe this debate exists for every single person whose religion, but also for religious minorities as well. No parallel. He said individuals who have left everything in their country behind. He said people who have come to these countries for the sake of immigration because they have had no other choice. The only identity that they are often able to bring with them is their own religion. If they are stripped away from this on their side of the world, we are making it feel that you can't express yourself because the state tells you that you are somehow harmful. Really, this is father-publishing by individuals. When individuals are able to frame you under claims of how you are evil and that's where the government directly bans you. It's part of our virtue in state speech. And this is important. Even if in public spaces it doesn't happen, either forms of aggression don't disappear. If you're born under the name of your name, everyone knows you're a Muslim. Within these communities, it's not that you automatically don't face harms anymore. You will continue to do so. The only thing that then changes is your ability to express yourself in public. Unless they show to you yourself in public, unless they are able to show you why in private spaces you won't be decriminalized, though unlike the Proms, they have tried to keep you from their cases. But at the end of the day, the principle continues to stand. Unless they are able to prove what its egregious forms of fun are somehow justified, we believe they automatically cannot be the same. Secondary. On secondary, the inclusive increases the secular culture. No matter. Under the mainstream, governments can continue to fund these forms of religious groups. They can fund churches and they can fund Muslims. Which is why we have popes who directly go up and generally they think this is fine to be homosexual because you can still end up going to heaven. The reason for why this exists is because religions have been immediately centred to become a path to overtax. However, when you directly mar the community with access on their side, these individuals are left to only cater to the most extremist forms of groups because they want to hold on to them and make sure these people never leave these groups to begin with. Or this is look back, it means you going up to your other church individuals and telling you that look, if you leave these communities, you're not fulfilling your holy duties. These forms of extremist narratives would often turn other people off and they do not have an incentive to do so. But here, this is the only way through which they can hold on to the small amounts of groups which can continue to support them. The problem with this, then, is how it increases the very level of extremism that they talk about. The next thing about this is, and this is the second here, religious ideologies and political ideologies fall under very small grounds. What this means is you can frame a lot of interesting, underpinnings of political ideologies fall under very small grounds. What this means is you can frame a lot of these things under claims of political ideologies as well. Emotion may be religious in nature, but at the end of the day, it can still be framed under the theme of true life. At the end of it all, what this means is politicians, due to having angry levels of religious individuals who want and feel more things because of feeling that you've been marginalized by the state, now vote for these groups that they themselves want to harm against. This means the very perpetual forms of harms and aggression of minority repercussions of making sure your religion doesn't become unsafe for others and the very burdens they themselves feel at the very beginning of their speech. The reason why then all this matters is because when seclusion increases, the ability for minorities to come into power automatically falls as well. People have in-groups that are built into them. People feel like different religions are different and should remain within their own obligated abilites. Muslims fear going out of their power because they feel like the state does not recognize them, which creates more internal groups, reduces the ability for groups to simply interact and grow together with each other, and it reduces the ability for them to then come into possession of power and believe in mistakes as well. Now, it is illegitimate to say that religion is harmful. It brings you peace, it brings you solace, and therefore, to say that religious individuals do not deserve to express themselves is a monogamy, which is..."

                "text": "majorities will define religion as selectively biased and faulty, under the veil of the century. And I like this awkward position right now, because if you look at this motion clarification, the motion clarification does indeed tell you that you are going to be banned a lot of the obvious forms of things, regardless of what culture or religion it is. Look at it, I will quote, a person wearing a cross necklace, or a sick turban, or hijab in the public, all of these are going to be simply banned and are sent on the halls in the public, which has meant that it's on their knee what they are pushing for in the city. And I do agree that it has a core motion, you don't have to simply defend your right to communication, but the motion's definition does tell us that we have to defend the world, and I think the role that they accuse us of defending is not a role of supreme state capitalism, which is why it simply cannot get swayed by the right wing, which is why our impoverished leaders stand for right. which is why we simply cannot get swayed by your rhetoric, which is why our in-public leaders tell you from the first stand already. We tell you that if a Christian cross is used for religious advocacy in the public, we will ban it. If parents oppose the schoolwork in corporate religion and education, we will ban it. And quite obviously, if politicians, foreign religious organizations, coordinate schools, we will also punish them. And if you cannot punish these people, this is not a secular thing, which is why I think our case stands at this point already. Secondly, let's talk about your claim on how the new case put people internally in the private. This immediately told them that they could take rounds. First, it's what they've done less than the R-side of the House. But if it's true that Rosen's one money, do you think that they would not be as excluded because they would no longer be able to follow the path of the public in our side of the house. And notice here, remember, panel, that the religions cannot depend on the current followers all the time, which means that they have to gain new followers, which means that they cannot become excluded in our side of the house. But secondly, it is actually only on our side of the house that it can effectively crack down on them. So when we have the first-rate scouts like Riddham, we have the capacity to police religion because we are the only side that can punish these that are religion-displaced for not being like these leader-coaches for instance. All of this is brutal, is a nowhere. The governments are so pro-religious freedom, and a lot of religious organizations are actually able to block government all in the name of religious freedom. And therefore, at the point of the state, they can see that religion has some sort of origin of exploitation, that is to say, that it's simply worthless on their side without their health. Here's the way, though, two pieces of the way. One, even if it gets more exploitative, there's a limited use of the word health exploitative in that case, because it's uncritical and how much it would use their popular law. So second of all, I think that if it gets exploitative, even if that's the case, at least it's more difficult to join religion apart than it does to all, which means that in the long run, there's less people exploiting a religion for the first place, which is why your path between law and school religion, expulsion, is gone. First of all, what do you put out? Your mind. If it does get more exploitative and more people time-hardened, then most people who are born into this world are not forced to go online and start it. Because the religion has no incentive to be available, because it's no longer publicly exposed and cannot gather followers in that way. How do you deal with that? Sure, but I just said that it cannot be exploitative, it can get forces on their kind of house, so their way is against their family's house. I'm not going to say that I'm not a Catholic. Firstly, let's talk about rights. Two things I want to note here. Firstly, you not being able to wear a hijab is not analogous to you not being able to be a Muslim woman, right? It is simply being mean for all of the Jewish state. If they cannot wear it, they don't feel empowered. Especially, we told you from the Sirocco speech as to what the inherent purpose of God is not to simply actually give posters to people in the public, rather it is to individually let, like, present for God to talk to pastors give posters to people in public, rather it is to individually elect, like, present for God to talk to pastors, which is why in Buddhism in Japan, a lot of the people are actually going to mount into individually elected God. I think that religious conception can impact change. But second of all, I think that the long-term train has meant the normalization of new conceptions of religion are in fact going to be adopted on our side of the house. Because imagine, guys, this motion gives us this magical view that in Western liberal democracies, strict state factors is going to be adopted. What does this mean? UK, US, France, a lot of old-time countries, big countries are going to adopt this policy. They're not religious, like pastors, for instance, and preachers have the incentive to gain new followers. They have the incentive to actually interpret this religion in a new subjective way, which is why the world was announced as going to help religion-neurotic teachings can't keep standing at this point already. The implication here is simple. The reason why it responds to your claim that it is freedom to talk about your religion is that it is not the state oppressing you. When the state acts in a lawful way, people willingly make a choice not to bear the job committed to the forest as their own choice, which is why I think they pursue other things. But even if that's not true, the unfortunate reality of the religion is that there are some coercion in religion that exists in the past. So it's true that many people want to get a job on their own, right? But it is also true that most people don't mean to opt in to religion if they are born into it. And two, the choice to opt out of religion is not a realistic choice when God tells you that your religion is the eternal way of salvation, and when your parents and your families actually adopt your religion, which has meant that there are also some people who are versed into actually wearing hijab or actually wearing hijab in the public, which has meant that all the way, those beautiful, like, choice can adapt, but on their side of the house, those people who are vers worst into wearing it is going to be eternal. Which is why the forms are asymmetric, but those vulnerable people are going to need to be part of their side of the house. But, even if we lose on the right, there's too many better things. Why? What if practical farms, to be frank, I know this is kind of counterintuitive, but we did prove to you why very few people are actually going to give you some sort of practical farm. We can talk about the second part, but we're in minorities. And in the same way, we don't allow people to just go to the leaders of the patient, where we actually, not even thinking about it, but we think that practical farms can outweigh the microlithics that are bluff away from the identity status of the wealthy in the US. Secondly, on those harm principles, we tell you from your book that this advice significantly harms other people, which is why Linus Wright did not sign a new plea for full-ranging. Let's talk about the limits and handlements. There are pieces that are emotionally symmetric, but I think there are a lot of political issues in their reference. One of these is that in Poland, Congress sees religious employment as a dog-piguracy, and LGBTQ freedom in the public. This is basically barring away from those public speeches, these are the harms that will not exist on our side of the house. Then we see, oh, the other one may exist, sure, but that doesn't respond to their impact, right? All of our impacts that we outlined here from first, about how individuals cannot simply go to college, or how things like education are the worst thing on their side of the house, is still of obvious magnitude. On practical way, one, this impacts everyone within the public space. Think about how Darwinism is like, the reject to science in the US Oklahoma. Literally 10 commandments were actually mandated to trust everyone. But secondly, public spaces is a day, like something that affects your daily life. But on principle, public spaces actually create on tax money, which is why I think this has to be accessible to every single person. Finally, let's talk about why it's really their business that they wouldn't be burdened by harm if you go to contact with them. The problem is that they assume that when you contact with them, you will get along. They miss the nuance two things. One, you can also contact with them on R7 and R well. It's just that they're not wearing the hijab, right? But secondly, note that religion is contradictory. Who is God? What is a good believer? Those things are contradictory, which means that when you're talking for them, you are more likely to identify them as a threat to your religion, which is why you can't place verses on their side of the house. So on our side of the house, Muslims and Christians are going to sit in the same classroom and talk together harmoniously. But on their side of the house, when they simply talk about religion, when they simply put up religious symbols, that is an ablution to argue the disproportionate and hard minorities on their side of the house. This is why I think we are winning on my youth as well. Finally, when they speech laws, they ask and always will not work. Because of blurriness, does note how uninputed and moving back what this analogy is, this is not ripping in a sad scope, which is why we have to take a small seat."

Thirdly, which world protects the most vulnerable? But before that, I have two clarifications. Firstly, the main debate about how we vowed to only go against Binoils, that's literally not what we tell you. We tell you that this is likely to happen against all these religions. But the moment in time it happens, in Western liberal democracies, because Christianity is so integrated into the culture, which looks like the Christians being celebrated everywhere because it's their important culture because if they're in this car, because of all of these reasons, it's highly that even if you do banners, if you stay in regard to culture, which is exactly why it's unlikely to work, there's another wrong. Secondly, we tell you that on their side of the road, all their beliefs look like religion is bad, it's just that case, fine. If religion is so bad, why don't we vanish into public spaces? Why don't we be there?"

                "text": "Moving on to my first question, which world better protect the fundamental rights of individuals? They come here and tell you that people's principal right to go outside is barred because now religious people lobby politicians. I have three responses to this. Firstly, understand that this literally cannot be taken away in the first place. Why? Because these governments need these individuals to give their votes. Which is why they will literally not wire them from most democracy spaces. Or on second, these are Western liberal democracies which care about the international reputation which comes from media houses, right? The more time you are lacking in these religious organizations on a national large scale, you will have backlash no matter what. Secondly, they claim that we do not bring the motion, but I wish they did that, because their claim of WLBs having this is literally flawed. WLBs, by constitution constitution literally cannot side with religious organizations to such an extent that they are lobbied to the great extent that it cannot be. Thirdly, even if we take another best-case scenario, even if this principle stands, it still takes away individuals' autonomy. The one thing that matters the most to individuals is human dignity. What do we tell you then? First thing, we tell you that competition's world snatches away your most fundamental right for religious orientation. They attempt to do some evil rebuffles to it, but why does it fail? Because, first thing, their only rebuffle that comes here is that with science, you come to normalcy. Firstly, you never come to normalcy. Religion has been integrated into your identity and into who you are from the very beginning, literally from your birth. All you have known about yourself, all of it, is a part of that religion. No matter how much time passes by, even if you're on your deathbed, you will never come to the market scene. But secondly, even if you take the matter-of-the-space scenario, even if that happens, you still lose your autonomy, which is the most important thing in this debate. Because understand that this principle stands no matter what utility they can show you. Because I, as a human being, my dignity matters the most. My autonomy matters the most. Whether or not I can stay within my religion, I can show my religion to the world, whether I can fulfill my religion is something that I hear about the most. But why is this extremely important in that panel? Understand that religion changes people on an individual level, right? It gives them solace and hope that they need on their darkest of nights. It ensures that it acts as a self-defense mechanism against the afterlife and against hell. But most importantly, it protects you from individuals because your identity is not flawed anymore."

Because now, wheelchair is directly doubled down in their side of the world. Why is this so? Because of two reasons. Firstly, because on their side of the world, you literally don't know what's going on in regards to these wheelchairs. Because all of these happen through a closed door. You don't know which extreme group has come up. You don't know what these politicians are doing. Because you literally cannot let them talk in public. There is no check and balance mechanism to ensure that they are true. But on a secondary scale, understand that now on their side of the cross, preachers do not get to bring people back to religion. What is it that they do then? They ensure that the limited amount of people that they have, they double down on these people. How do they do so? They tell them that you are in danger, that you need to protect your identity, which is why they are likely to become even more radical. Why is this bad? Because it leads to even more political tensions within these WLPs, which ensures that these people are acting hard on their side of the world."

Here, I can come to you and tell you that minorities on their side of the world are sage. I have five responses to this. Firstly, understand that no, minorities are not sage. They are oppressed even further. Why is this so? Because the only form of identity, solace, for these minorities is their religion. Understand this panel, no matter how much discrimination you face as a minority within these WLBs, you still choose to stay within this religion because you actively care about this religion. The moment in time they bar these individuals from literally expressing their faith, that's exactly when they feel even more oppressed. On the secondary level of balance, even in their best-in-scenario, they do say to these minorities, to a certain extent, that comes at the cost of the autonomy of these minorities. Even then, these minorities, even according to them, are the most vulnerable individuals, understand more than they can to take away another layer of vulnerability from them, which is their own economy, you make that even worse. The more time they talk about polarities that exist, understand that polarity is even harder on their side of the world. This is because majority now have communal sentiment to only cater to themselves. We talked about the us and them, us versus them mentality which is why they double down on minorities. What do we tell them then? us versus them mentality, which is why they doubled down on minorities. What do we tell them then? We tell them that on their side of the world, these religious organizations, which cater to the most vulnerable of individuals, are likely to downsize. Why is this bad? Because these are the religious institutions which cater to people within rural areas, who will never be catered to by governments. We tell them that these individuals are the most vulnerable. These individuals are the white who are likely to be orphans, who are likely to have free education or free food. These religious institutions are the ones who literally build the infrastructure against the plurality of gay men from the funding that they get.

So from this you can see that the identity or religious identity is inherently subjective and that the changing of these identities is not forced in any way whatsoever. And at best it only incurs very short time humps from their side which we are willing to concede. Because they still have the option of operating five times a day at home, they can still talk to us, they can still get the emotional salvation inside, through private religions, which we think will mitigate all the harms that they provided to us today."

We think that the religious entanglement with politics is the most important issue in this debate. Just as we get to pass these, religious entanglement with politics harms everyone. Just notice how in the meeting of the state, Matt aided everyone to teach creationism and to teach the Ten Commandments regardless of what religion they were. So basically, these kinds of policies hurt every single person on the ground regardless of whether you're religious or not. But secondly, we say that religions entangled with politics is most important because it's the most certain impact in today's debate. When strict secularism is implemented, it will substantially lower the ability of politicians to entangle with religion. Because we've told you stuff like public funding, they can't get money from lobbyists anymore. Parents literally cannot go to school boards and request the curriculum to be changed. We think that this is the most impactful impact in this debate. But lastly, we think that the right to religion is not absolute. We restrict the right to freedom of expression all over the time. We think that this looks like, you know, just limiting like, vandalism, limiting like, hate speech, limiting all these forms of expression. Insofar as the right to freedom and the right to religion is not absolute, we have to weigh this below the state responsibility to provide accessibility and accessible public spaces for everyone that is based on everyone's tax money. But lastly, on minorities. We think that we are required to host a host of reasons from our backspeaker that the reason why minorities are being discriminated is because the majority of people feel threatened by more minorities when they see these black, when they see these kids' jobs. That people feel threatened because politicians fan the claims of anti-Islamic sentiment. We think that, uniquely on our side, this is not possible, which is why on our side everyone can sit together, everyone can coexist in a school, at their workplace,"

So, the conclusion of all of this is that the political and instrumental politics is the most important impact in this debate and should you should weigh in over any fluffy harms of religious freedom or any fluffy harms of minorities when they can't even protect minorities on their side through like discrimination or like anti-disclimation laws that do not even work."

This includes railways, bridges, and seaports to make two passages that give China infrastructure projects throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. This includes railways, bridges and seaports to make passages that give China direct access to 70 nations. Along the historic Silk Road, as a part of Xi Jinping's grand strategy, what are the key characteristics of this? It is financed through billions in debt that is not conditional on economic or political reform. Debt that is funneled through Chinese state banks and China-run AIIB, making it subject to purely and exclusively Chinese oversight. These construction projects are also exclusively run by Chinese state-run firms with Chinese workers. If a loan is not repaid, China will forgive a part of the debt in exchange for ownership of the infrastructure like we saw in Sri Lanka. What is the context of this debate? Over the last five years, China could have gone down two roads. They could have worked with existing systems of development using their increased influence in the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the BRICS Bank to strengthen the systems of collaborative lending, or they could have gone at it alone where the terms are dictated by their self-interest. We regret that China didn't take the first road and took the latter road. It's not that we think China is malicious, but that they are self-interested. And it makes sense for them to go do what gives them the most soft power. But this debate is about whether we, as the recipients of these projects and the world community, think that they have created a net harm. We say yes."

Two, the Belt and Road Initiative is the road to upsetting the international power, balance of power. And third, the BRI is the road to entrenching in liberal regimes. First, why is the BRI the road to economic harm for its recipient nations? These projects are funded through loans. Given how projects are run by Chinese corporations with Chinese workers, nations should have already been cautious about the debt. But the BRI targets small and economically vulnerable nations that are unable to reject Chinese loans when it comes to mounting pressure. They fear that non-participation will cause that the trade deals that China will have will be something that they lose out of trade deals that China will have will be something that they lose out of, and that they will lose these generous Chinese aid. So when Beijing comes knocking on Mongolia's door and threatens to end their cooperation on tuberculosis in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Mongolia isn't really begging for the bridges that get built in their nation. When these nations take this step, default is the most likely reality. Why? Because the speciality of Chinese loans is that they don't require economic reform. So the governments take on loans, but don't rein in on spending and then struggle to repay them. Their infrastructure, set up under the BRI, also does not pay for itself, because they are often white elephants, vanity projects of leaders that duplicate existing infrastructure. That's why when Prime Minister Rajapaksa builds a second Sri Lankan ad board, which he names after himself with the money from the BRI, he saddles the country with debt and the world's emptiest ad board. What are the consequences of this default? China could graciously forgive this debt and so generously take over the infrastructure but that means they have control over ports, roads and airports."

We've seen debt defaults in developed nations like Greece fracturing the spirit of the people and leaving people who aren't employed. Imagine this in Kenya. Crucially, default in the wake of an unfinished project is devastating to other countries in the BRI. You can't build a road from China to Egypt if Kenya in the middle defaults. That's why this would invalidate anyone's investment because when one nation defaults, it puts the entire project at the risk of default. In the comparison, the alternative is borrowing from multilateral institutions like the Asian Development Bank, Br the comparison, the alternative is borrowing from multilateral institutions like the Asian Development Bank, BRICS Bank or the African Development Bank. Sure, China might have inflated the total amount of debt, but all debt is in good debt. What does multilateral debt look like instead? No one country has exclusive power. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa each have the same equal share of 20% in the BRICS Bank. In the Asia Development Bank, the US and Japan account for 15% while China, India, Canada and Korea have the rest. Maritime lenders each want their money back and use their power to check each other. So even if independently they are self-invested, together they can't design a system that cedes monopoly over infrastructure to one country. So default is mutual loss in such an investment for the investor and the host nation. So in each of them asking for their money back and holding these nations accountable, they lend with sustainable preconditions."

The unifying factor of the BRI is not that nations are linked with each other, but overwhelmingly linked with China. We regret that. The BRI uniquely empowers the Chinese global hegemony. If the projects are successful, it entrenches their military. The corridors are designed to allow Chinese troops to mobilize at the borders of any nation and scare them into submission. But remember, the project passes through territory that is undisputedly disputed, especially border areas like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that passes through Indian territory that's claimed by India. When China is already incursing on this region, it's unacceptable. It allows them to force smaller countries into trade deals. When the giant that you owe a billion dollars to says, you can't join that trade deal, better join this treated area, that's a choice that vulnerable nations can't make. Further, like we explained, the deliberate plan is to allow default and takeover infrastructure. In such a world, China has unprecedented influence over global trade and over Western nations. Because if China controls major trade routes and hubs, controls Pakistan, Sri Lanka and South Africa's hubs, then Nigeria, America, India, all of these regions are economically hurt at the point which they can hold that port as leverage and say we will not allow you to access this. The BRI crowds out regional powers and regional cooperation. We see this when Philippines was pushing for ASEAN multilateralism but then had to cede into the BRI. Now, all without the BRI, the US, China and regional superpowers check each other. China has a trillions in US debt, participates in the BRICS Bank and is committed to the UN 2030 agenda and other in their speeches in the World Economic Forum and even checked the US and international organizations when they took over the Paris Accords.

                "text": "Before that, three points of rebuttal. Firstly, they tell us this is financed off of risky loans and oftentimes is unwilling to benefit these other countries. Three responses. Firstly, sure, maybe some of these loans are not assessed to be perfect in impeccable risk analysis. But note the fact that on both sides, that there's an incentive to develop these countries. Because China understands that in order for it to have a proper market for its products, the individuals in that market need to have jobs. They need to be able to afford the products that they want to sell to them, and at the same time they need to have products that they can buy from the countries that they create trade deals with. Note that examples like Sri Lanka or the Ghunar port in Pakistan may be specific examples where it was strategically important for China to annex these areas. We think the comparative then is that on their side, China still has these hegemonic and expansionist ideals. But the unfortunate reality is they won't be doing it through the peaceful means that the Belt and Road Initiative forces them to do it through. Secondly, note that the long-term benefits that oftentimes still accrue. It was honestly ridiculous for India to say that these roads are only connecting China with explicitly countries in unilateral fashion, because when you want to make a connection between Kazakhstan and China, you necessarily need to go through all the rural China that lacks development. You go through all of the bordering nations, and you connect all of the countries that oftentimes want to trade with each other, but lack the infrastructure to do so. Thirdly, we think that when they lost this point, the point at which they decided to make their alternative examples like the Asian Development Bank, banks and development banks that China has equal control over and are just as likely going to have the same malicious intent if that is the picture that they want to paint. So ultimately, note that the comparative on their side is that they get the exact same policies, the economic extortion that they talk about, but without the Belt Road Initiative. I'll explain to you what that uniquely helps on our side. The second point of rebuttal is one on dumping. They tell us they economically did a rude disaster because they dumped into these countries. Know why this is patently false. The first reason is because there's an incentive not to do so, because China is trying to create economically prosperous areas around them because it also benefits themselves. But secondly, even when it does come to dumping, note the fact that the things that they're dumping are categorically not the industries that these countries are trying to grow. Things like technological dumping are actually oftentimes beneficial, because at the end of the day, it's not much of a travesty if the individuals of these countries are able to buy cheap products. But importantly, these cheap products are oftentimes the way that they can utilize themselves to develop industry and the future things like Electronics and are able to allow for the entrepreneurship for these countries to actually develop the industries rather than belonging them to succumb The primary industries that they're currently stuck in thirdly they tell us about this sort of hegemonic goal of China Ultimately at the end of the day we think that this hegemonic goal exceeds far past Belt Road Initiative. It's still likely going to exist. We're going to characterize it by its substantive. Why it is so that this hegemonic interest is curbed for the better with the Belt Road Initiative."

                "text": "So then, three points to our substantive about why China is in a unique position to benefit these countries. The first thing to note is the context of Western isolationism. That is to say, populist rhetoric and American first rhetoric in all countries across the West has caused a global pullout. That is to say, they're unwilling to engage within these countries because, honestly, at the end of the day, it's not politically expedient for them to engage with poor, neutral dictators. We think because of this, oftentimes these countries are in a state of destitution or neglect. Why then does this change? Secondly, China has five unique incentives that we say means that they're a better actor than any other competitor. The first one is the context of peaceful rights. That is to say, whilst many Western countries may have built themselves upon war and colonialism, China has always taken a very unique approach that has continued into Xi's non-interventionist principles. That is to say, the focus on things like capital or technological or resource exchange that bolsters the inner economy without taking militaristic or aggressive stances. The second thing to note is the internal priorities of China. That is to say, there's a lot of class struggle and ethnic struggle within China. Because of this, it prevents them from being able to take very controversial stances because they can't have excuses for countries like Taiwan or areas like Taiwan or Xinjiang from annexing or leaving the country. These internal struggles make sure that China has to keep itself in check because that is the only way that it ensures stability on the long term. Thirdly, there's a unique trade incentive that exists in China because China used to be on a model of internal consumption. They produced for their own people, and their people consumed what they had produced. But unfortunately, the transition to a secondary and tertiary industry has oftentimes meant that they have an oversupply, and they need to tap into the foreign markets of other countries. That is why China uniquely has an incentive to trade with the countries around them, rather than economically exploit them like they talk about. Because China doesn't need resources as much as it needs in a market that is able to purchase its products. Fourthly, we think China is uniquely politically flexible. That is to say it has a track record of being okay with dealing with dictators and authoritarian regimes. Because Turkmenistan remains a dictatorship on their side. But on our side, they get to prosper their people and the development that is crucial to the livelihoods of those people can actually happen. Fifthly, the Belt and Road Initiative is a test of soft power. And this becomes extremely important, I'll take you in a second. Because the image of constructing a very constructive economic policy and being a benevolent hegemon is in the interest of both China and Xi. The instance in which Belt and Road is used as an instance of soft power is also the instance to the point in which they're willing to do things like compromising on more moderate deals because they understand they want to protect their image. Sure."

What then do we think these benefits look like? Because they often come in a plethora. Things like the 150 million tourists that have been traversing this belt and road project. Things like the 4.4 million people who are connected in a technological and cultural exchange. Multilateral and long-term deals between countries that are now possible because the roads exist and you cut down time that transports materials by 50%. You increase the production and the ability for these people to access things that they previously were never able to. Access to consolidated markets like the stock markets in china that people in azerbaijan never had access to before but also things like educational importing how the 130 universities have been built across all 70 of these countries ultimately china is empowering these individuals because these countries never had an alternative they were unable to aspire to grow and at all because they had no way that they could have done so without the Belt and Road Initiative.

And secondly, a line about how this benefits China and that's good for the rest of the world. Firstly, the honest idea that China is in a uniquely better position to help these forced nations. A number of responses. Firstly, on the idea that China engages in a peaceful rise to never engage in military aggressions. Great. It's peaceful in that they're not sending their armies in. It's not peaceful in that they're inducing poverty into these regions by crippling structurally disadvantaged countries with massive debt. We think poverty isn't peaceful. We think the suffering of a vast majority of individuals in these countries doesn't count as peaceful. Second, they say China has a unique trade incentive. Yeah, you know what they mean by unique trade incentive? Flooding markets with cheap goods and destroying local businesses. Stealing infrastructure from these countries. The things we told you in our first speech, that's what they mean when they tell you unique trade incentive. Don't let them mislead you with their language panel. Thirdly, they say the Belt and Road Initiative is an instance of soft power, and therefore China will be willing to compromise on other things. Except, one, if China gains more power, as I talk about when I get to the second issue, they're not going to be more able to compromise on other things, no thank you, at the point where they become more powerful. But second, that doesn't engage with the sheer economic devastation that their policy does. What do we say in our speech? We told you that alternatives exist, and these alternatives are significantly better for countries on the ground. Firstly, because each of these organizations which are multilateral want their money back, which means they're less likely to be okay with these countries being in crippling debt. Why is China okay with that? Because they can seize those points, because they can extract natural resources from those areas. The fact that these multilateral organizations aren't exclusively controlled by a single country means they're able, no thank you, to check each other. Lastly, they say the comparatives, China engaging in even worse economic expansion. Firstly, we regret that too, right? On our side, we're not saying that the Belt and Road Initiative is bad, but whatever else horrific thing China might do is good. We're okay with regretting that as well. But second, that concedes that the incentives of China are in pure self-interest. And it is okay with undermining the most vulnerable nations on the planet in order to advance its self-interest. All we are saying is the Belt and Road is an extension of that. We told you that debt default is devastating to these nations, at the point where 8 out of 23 nations in the Belt and Road programme are marked with elevated debt risk. We think that's something they never bother to engage with and that's devastating for most vulnerable individuals on the ground. Then on the second idea, this benefits China, that's great for them. First thing to note is that it's bad for the vulnerable individuals within China when China can no longer be held accountable by international actors. This looks like the Uighur Muslim populations within China. We think that's incredibly problematic. Secondly, insofar as right now, as they themselves explain, the US is undergoing a decline and therefore we don't have a concentration of power in particular regions, we don't want there to be more concentration of power. We don't want the US to be replaced by another superpower who can repeat all the atrocities that the US engaged in. That's what we told you in our second argument, that they crowd up, no thank you, regional powers. When China gets massive control over ports, massive military access to things like military to be able to coerce nations into accepting the Belt and Road Program. We told you that we don't want another country to get the same concentration of power that China once had. If it's just one road, it's a dead end."

                "text": "Two responses to that. Firstly, as I already told you, we regret that too. Let's be clear, this debate is not about what China should do. Ask China what would we do in order to advance the population to the world. This debate is about when presented with that choice four years ago, what would have been better for the world? Whether it had gone with the BRI or whether it had gone with multi-lateral organisations. But secondly, insofar as China wants access to soft power, absent the BRI BRI not wanting to piss existing global powers off, they are more likely to go into the multilateral organisations we talked about in our first speech. The Belt and Road Initiative is a road to entrenching illiberal regimes. We've already shown that the economic calculus of the Belt and Road Initiative isn't exactly healthy. But let's take to use China as their best for a moment and assume that it is. The political costs are still devastating because governments are likely to become more corrupt and less accountable as a result of their policy. If economic development is unlikely to ever come to fruition, we don't want illiberal regimes to be more entrenched. That's a significant thing to regret. Three ways in which the Belt and Road Initiative entrenches illiberal regimes. First, it provides unaccountable leaders access to cheap credit. The Belt and Road Initiative's laws don't place any conditions on political reform of authoritarian countries. That's why they themselves told you, ah, we want money going into these poor dictatorships. One of the biggest incentives for countries to engage in political liberalisation right now is the fact that organisations which provide aid and provide infrastructure loans right now place conditions on these illiberal countries to politically liberalise. On their side of the house, they provide these regions access to cheap credit and there's no cost, no thank you, to staying authoritarian, to checking your power even more. But secondly, the Belt and Road Initiative has directly strengthened illiberal regimes. Why? Because it is in China's interest for more countries to join the initiative, to accept these loans and not constantly change their position on them. When a country is a democracy, there is always a risk that a protectionist party wins the next election and ends their cooperation with the Belt and Road. However, a more illiberal regime, on the other hand hand is likely to stay in power for a long time and is likely to be able to hold a strong stance on the issue of the Belt and Road. How does China entrench governments which are favourable to the initiative? First, things like oil investments for the exclusive purpose of propping up Omar al-Bashir's Sudan, giving massive foreign donations to finance the LDP in Uzbekistan to win the 2016 election. All of this is so that the countries don't back out of the extensive Belt and Road projects. But thirdly, the regimes right now rely on tax money to sustain themselves, to fund things like infrastructure projects. But in a developing country, it's really hard to enforce a meaningful tax regime. Therefore, they pass policies to ensure things like economic growth, to expand the trust that people have in these governments so that they pay taxes. Now that they have an alternate source of funding, they are less likely to have that incentive. Why is this pernicious? Outside of the fact that it's deeply morally problematic for China to erode democracy, we think strong institutions are critical to the long-term development of these countries. because an illiberal dictator doesn't really have an incentive to improve conditions of low-income populations on the ground at the point where they are not voting. We think this is a self-perpetuating cycle when international aid organisations also cut these balances out of the point where they are forced to compete with the Belt and Road Initiative. On our side, those multinational organisations are more likely to reinforce standards of democracy and enable the long-term development of these vulnerable countries. If it's just one road, it's a dead end. We're very trusted."

And finally, I'm going to bring to you a new substantive argument as to why benefits to China and dodging China away from its own internal politics is beneficial for the world. Before that, just a bit of framing. I'd just like to point out that the Belt and Road Initiative, i.e. opening up your borders and pursuing free trade as a means of economic development, is not mutually exclusive to China as well. India, their nation, has pursued economic liberalisation and foreign reform by opening up its borders. The USA and the EU were able to achieve large amounts of economic prosperity precisely because they were able to use free trade agreements to use and get access to foreign markets. But moreover, note that the Belt and Road Initiative was created in 2013 with the frame to say that the large majority of its benefits would actualize in 2042. This is five years."

                "text": "No, thank you. We told you that the incentives of China were not inherently extortionate. They framed the Boiling Road Initiative as purely on economic means as a result of infrastructure, but they didn't engage with any of our analysis as the idea that China has used this as soft power to improve its image. The fact that they've signed more than 300 cooperative deals and action plans and cultural exchanges shows that this is not just for economic means, but also to improve its global image. And we told you that this global image is a moderating factor, that because the Belt and Road Initiative elevates China's economic means and China's image towards Western scrutiny, the scrutiny of Western media, and also the improvement of the image in the eyes of every other button-mode initiative, they have the incentive to improve their image and not be so extortionary on their side of the house. Don't let them get away with the three examples of Sri Lanka and Pakistan and South Africa. Because the majority of the examples which we'll go into later are beneficial towards the people. Their main response was that economic harm leads to dumping and exploitation of these nations. That's not true. But when we told you the context of China, that China's economy used to be based on internal consumption, but as a result of China producing and overproducing goods, we have an oversupply of goods, which means that China's going to sell it anyway. So without the Belt and Road Initiative, you are still going to have China dumping their goods and exploiting local industries. The problem is that there are going to be shady deals that happen behind closed doors. Their only response to this was, we regret China's foreign policy. But you cannot regret China's foreign policy. Because without the Belt and Road Initiative, these incentives will exist on either side of the house. The difference is, it's more exploitative on theirs. The next response was the idea of alternatives, that the ABB and BRICS are better. Well, we told you that China precisely has more control over this. But the next response was to say that the AIIB is not multilateral. But that is factually incorrect. The AIIB includes China, but it also includes nations from a wide variety of demographics, like the UK, like Canada, like multiple African nations, and like multiple EU nations as well. For them to say it's multilateral is disingenuous on their side of the house. But moreover, we didn't understand why there was an incentive to create stable markets. Because China does want to sell its goods. And it seems intuitive to us that if you do want to sell your goods, you should not unemployed everyone within that nation, because if there's a 100% decrease in wages, what else is the fact that if goods are cheaper, people cannot afford them? There's an incentive for stability within these nations."

Given that they will remain dictatorships, we'd rather benefit the people to create thick middle classes. Because you know what the best way to take down dictatorships is? It's to benefit the people, expose them to liberal ideas as a result of globalization, and to take down that dictatorship. Not to leave them in poverty and only enhance the legitimacy of these dictators. But secondly, note that supporting dictatorships is not mutually exclusive to China. Western nations do this as well. The U.S. supports Saudi Arabia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Iran. So unclear to me why China is the only nation that will do this. So these incentives are not inherently extortioners."

But know that this is the beginning of the initiative and beginnings of initiatives will always be set with hardships. But they neglected the other parts and beneficial initiatives as well. Three things that they provide. First, energy. China is a leader in green energy and provide things like useful energy grids that provide nations without electricity and without the grids to power things like basic hospitals and provide some to these nations. That's why Pakistani hospitals finally got power and were not able to be exploited because China provided this energy as well. Secondly, infrastructure. And no, if you want to connect it to China, you also have to connect it to other nations as well. They built railroads in Laos that made transportation within those nations far faster. Thirdly, you facilitate local industries like agriculture. Kazakhstan used to be a nation that could not feed its people because of the winters and the cold season that happened there. That changed on our side of the house when China was able to build a railroad that connected Kazakhstan to Xinjiang and finally gave people food that they inspired better on our side of the house.

This debate is centered around the vulnerability of certain actors and how we can best help minorities and best help vulnerable people around the world. The Ball and Road Initiative has brought and will continue to bring massive benefits towards the Chinese people. And it comes to you with 1.5 billion people should not be ignored. But more importantly, I'm going to prove to you why because this is good for China, it is good for the West as well. China used to have double-digit economic growth, but that has slowed in recent years. Now economic growth is stagnant, and because the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party is contingent on providing economic growth for its people, it is focused on internal struggles and de-status quo. What are the benefits to China? Three things to say on this. Firstly, you help oppressed minorities within China. So you help people like the Uyghurs, the Hui minority, and the Tibetans, who are surveillanced and systemically excluded from opportunities on their side of the house. But on our side, you give them jobs in Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, because they are able to speak the language we finally give these people stable employment. Second, you benefit poor provinces in China, because free trade agreements and infrastructure go through provinces like Xinjiang and Yunnan, which otherwise would be isolated from China as well. So you get things like new jobs, which has created $2.5 trillion within the industry in China as well. Finally, economic development. So you're able to have greater exports. You're able to create a thick middle class. Why is this important? When you have a productive society and people are in poverty, that's when China is removed from its internal struggles and can focus on bringing aid to external countries. That's what happened with Japan, where after establishing a stable economy, they were able to get a lot of oriental development aid. China is particularly good because they value the peaceful rise to power, they were able to create stable foreign policy and nations, and fill a vacuum to the isolationist context that my first speaker gave me. So, because we benefit people, and because China does not have extortionary incentives, proud to oppose. Thank you."

                "text": "Three questions in this debate. Firstly, how does this affect developing nations? Secondly, how does this affect the global balance of power? And thirdly, how does this affect the most of us? On the first question of does the Belt help developing nations, their main push is to listen to China as an incentive to get their loans back. But we clearly showed to you how it is deliberately planned by China that they don't need to get their loans back. That is, that they can seize the ports and resources that these people have built, when they can actually control the trade flows. When when because of the fact that now they have a railway line running through Kenya they can literally take the mine equipment that they have the mine resources that they have leave them in the retrain and ship them off straight back to Beijing these are huge incentives to actually allow these projects to fail and they are huge because it means that a debt default is not a 100% against their interest. Their only response to this is, oh, well, it's in their global image. Here's the thing. If Kenya fails to build a railway, it's Kenya's fault. China can just push it off saying, listen, this is a project with 70 countries. Obviously, there will be some failures. Like they said, stop cherry-picking examples. It's just a poor developing country. They don't have any harm on their global image. What they do have, however, is a lot of trade and resources now open to them. Not that huge. But then after that, they come up and say the alternative is a Western put-out. But is that true? Did they literally do anything other than just say Trump exists, therefore this argument must be polished? Because the World Bank has given $60 billion just last year. The IMF $90 billion. We also see the rise of the BRICS Bank or the ADB, regional lenders like the African Bank. At the end of the day, there are a lot of regional powers who are stepping up and giving up investment. We accept that we don't have as much. However, it's not that all debt is good. We tell you we have more than enough money to actually tend to the most struggling countries on our side. Their only response to this is to say, well, China's in there, which means they must be evil and try to control them too. But here's the thing, China doesn't control like around 80% of the funding in there. That's where the difference lies, panel. They say the AIIB is multilateral. Here's the thing, other countries exist in the AIIB, but almost all of their voting shares together are still less than China. We told you how the BRICS bank has a 20% distributed across every single shareholder. That's where it was true. We weren't saying that Germany had great incentives and was wonderful because they were white. We were saying everyone was self-interested and we balanced it out by making them act as checks on each other. That's why our alternative of lending was far better. But for what panel? What benefit were they standing for? The only thing they gave us in their first speech was now it's interconnected. But we told you why that's a horrible thing. Because it means that when you plan your finances such that you need the railways to be interconnected to other countries in order for it to turn a profit, if it's actually not interconnected, if Kenya's railway stops, it means that you start paying more for the railways than you actually get from it. That means because of the fact that it's interconnected, the BRI is uniquely harmful to us and it hurts these countries more than anything. And then after that, let's get to assuming that these projects get constructed, what does it look like? They say China has an incentive to not flood it. Here's the thing. There's a difference between acting wonderful to an economy and not destroying it 100%. China has an incentive to actually monopolize the economy over there. They speak of cheap products, and we agree, but those cheap products will only exist for a short period of time. After that, they get a monopoly over the markets of Kenya and Nigeria, and can start raising up prices. At which point, the milk is not cheap anymore in these extremely poor countries, final. And as a result, we tell you, they don't need to destroy the economies of these countries in order to hurt the lives of the most vulnerable over there. At the end of the day, boy, the incentives of China, not because they're horrible, but because they're a single actor, are perverse. And we would rather a world where at the end of the day, different actors check themselves and care for the developing world in a system that we worked. Second clutch, does having all roads leading to China help the balance of power? Final, they literally accepted this. Their little first speech was, yes China will go around annexing a couple of ports and harbours here and there, but that's fine, they'll do it anyway, China will be China. Here's the thing, final, at the end of the day, the BRI is uniquely harmful. Note what alternative methods of oppression they pushed. Nearly nothing. Bilateral trade agreements. Bilateral trade agreements does not get you unilateral controls over the major trading ports all around the world. Something they conceded China would strategically try to do. When China can say, I will not allow the US to trade with the entire Asian continent, that is when they have a skewed ability to control the balance of power. No response to that. Furthermore, what are these alternative things China is going to do? Not only did we tell you we regret them as well, but they literally rebut themselves when they say China cares about its horrible image and so won't be horrible, when they say Xi Jinping is built out of pacifism and actually has that narrative. They themselves in their first speech tell you why the alternative is likely to be co-operating. Because of the global image, they're likely to try to be a leader within the ADB. And we're happy for that to happen because there's a balance over there. Let's impact the South Channel because it really matters in this debate. Because when you have a superpower who has military stronghold over you, who can scare you into submission into any free trade deal, who can control the way your country works politically and economically, it means people on the ground have no control over their countries. It means that people are hurt and waste, that China simply wants them to be. That is not a word that we were willing to support. A word that we gave rise to as superpowers. We stand for a word from Buddy Rappers."

They needed to respond to that somewhere in their two speeches if they wanted to make that response and that point of information. AASAI is the one with sustainable loans which actually work for countries. On the third flash, does the belt help the most repressed in the world? Quickly, let's deal with their funky argument on benefits to China. In an interesting way, this hurts India. Three reasons why. Firstly, because we're really scared of China having military control all around us, which means we need to spend a lot. Which means money doesn't go into healthcare. Which means money doesn't go into education. Also because of border violations we told you about, it hurts our ability to keep our soldiers not dying. Furthermore, on weighing, India will have more people than China will after the BRI is over. Which means also, the more work. Which means we'll means more vulnerable. We took that argument at its best, panel. Now let's get on to the actual debate on the comparative for illiberal regimes. They told you, oh these will be illiberal all the time. Here's the thing, panel. This is a debate about countries like Philippines, countries like Kenya. It's not true that you're either a dictatorship or Denmark. There are people in the middle who actually can change if you incentivise them to do so. What their side does is literally give them an incentive to become worse when Duterte sits next to Xi Jinping and gets no condemnation for slaughtering 20,000 people in a war on drugs in his country. That is a world where you incentivise them to go further. Not that they don't benefit the people by giving them loans either. Because the loans aren't going to the people if it's truly a strong man who doesn't care. We are the only side that helps the most repressed in society. We are the only side that looked at developing nations, didn't coerce them into half-billed deals that would rob them of their resources, and actually allowed them to prosper. We were the only side that maintained a balance of power. If it's a one loan, we think it's a dead end."

And because it is a form of soft power, soft power cares about publicity far more than extortionary economic deals that happen behind closed doors. That was the comparative of this debate. Their response to this was, China always wants to seize maximum power, right? We agree. But in this particular instance, China is far more willing to trade off economic profit with cultural perceived advancement. So without the BRI, China would be likely to negotiate bilateral deals that focus on maximum financial extraction. That's far worse, and that was the comparative they had to deal with. Then they came up in third and had this weird response that countries can negotiate better in bilateral deals. I'm sorry, but I don't think Kenya has very much leveraging power against the country that has the second most GDP in the world and will threaten to get rid of it if they don't agree.

I think that's premised on the idea that these countries are already prosperous. We don't think that's the case. Because if you look at countries like Kazakhstan, like Tajikistan, those countries were already in poverty before the BRI came around. It was only after they came in, they connected them to the world, that they were actually able to prosper. But more importantly, we told you about the trade incentives on our side of the house. That because China wants to trade with these countries, it means that they simply gain nothing from bankrupting them and putting people into unemployment. We told you about how to test of soft power. We told you how oftentimes they have internal priorities. We told you about the flexibility of their loans, no response to any of these reasons. But more importantly, there were tangible benefits on our side of the house. And it's not enough for them to say we had no examples, because we clearly did. We told you about the inter-country trade that had happened on our side of the house, because of the roads that link Djibouti to Ethiopia. Because contrary to what they say, you don't need to simply be linked to China for your roads to work. As long as you're linked to nations around you, it still lets you trade with other nations. No response to that. But secondly, we told you that it allows for the integration of economies. What does that mean? It means that even parts that are created in China are assembled in places like Kazakhstan because these types of countries can coexist and use their competitive advantage. What did they tell us? They told us two broad ideas. The first one on dumping, and the second one on loans."

Number one, that China has an incentive to keep industries afloat because you can't buy cheap goods if you're unemployed and have zero income. But secondly, you enable countries and industries to grow because roads systematically work both ways. And that means that when the country's on their side of the house and they compare it where no roads exist, it's far worse. But thirdly, because the products that China dump are categorically different from the products that these countries and industries produce, what does it mean? It means China primarily dumps things like cheap technology, things that these countries generally don't produce. But fourthly, we told you, consumer access is particularly important. Because when a smartphone is actually accessible for a poor man in a rural community, it means that you can now, for the very first time, allow them to improve their standard of living, no response to any of that. Their only response was, well, first China tries to monopolize, and then it raises prices in the long run. Here's the problem. When you raise prices, local industries can now compete again. This means that China, if it raises prices, will make sure that local industries can grow up. No response to that."

Number one, if loans are so extortionary, if there were so many clear-cut examples of loans, countries clearly wouldn't voluntarily sign into this type of agreement. The reason why is because countries benefit themselves and they're clearly able to benefit. But secondly, just because you default on loans doesn't mean China benefits. Because China clearly still loses millions of dollars on a failed project that they cannot recoup even if they claim a port. But thirdly, let's say defaults exist on both sides of the house. Defaults are far better on our side. Why? Because China is far more lenient under circumstances of default. Because when you default on our side, China will just say, it's okay, we'll just claim this port. On their side, what default happens when you go to multilateral banks, is they do things like impose austerity, which is far worse, which hurts citizens the most, and means that normal people are hit the most. Before that, sure."

Number one, we told you that in the context of an isolationist West and an insular EU, investment would have never come to landlocked countries of Eastern Europe. Secondly, we told you that even in places where multilateral banks were available, that it was simply infeasible, because they impose things like stringent environmental regulations that make projects economically infeasible. Secondly, we think they're far worse. Why? Because they seem to claim that condition A is far better. Unfortunately, condition A is a euphemism for structural adjustment. It is a euphemism for austerity that hurts citizens the most and cuts welfare spending. But thirdly, they say it crowds out other people without really explaining the mechanism. Why? That is simply not true. In places like Southeast Asia, Japan still outspends China. In Central Asia, the ADB and the Asian Bank also compete alongside China. And here's where we directly respond to what they said. Because they tell us the World Bank funded millions of dollars. Yes, the vast majority of that funding only occurred after the Belt and Road Initiative. Why? Because on our side, there is now an incentive to compete. Because if you don't give loans out, it's seen as losing the opportunity to gain that land. So what happens now is there is a race to the bottom. People make loans far more accessible. Because on their side of the house, the places they're talking about never get those loans. At the end of the day, what otherwise would have happened to these types of countries is they wouldn't have loans. There would be no incentive to outreach to them and people would be stuck in the very conditions they were born in. Conditions of abject poverty. We provided the ability for people to get out of these areas and that's why we were proud to oppose."

Tourism, technological and cultural exchange to over 4.4 billion people. Access to consolidated markets like stock markets that countries like Azerbaijan would never have on their own.

But the comparative on your side is that they default on AIIV loans on themselves, but they don't get the support from China because China doesn't need to rectify their own image. Secondly, they told us that China was extortionist and hegemonic. Problem is, they are too on your side. And importantly, throughout this entire debate, the comparative needed not to rely on the BRI versus the best possible case scenario of any sort of loan from some magical institution that is multilateral and going to give you the best of deals. Because even if we took them at their best case, when we engaged our grounds like the SAPs from the IMF, we told you that the exploded economies of Chile and Greece probably mean that those are not suitable for most countries. Their response was, this is minimum standards. But we think that just laughs in the face of the people who are dying within those economies because they were ruined by even the most best and glorious actors on their side. Then, they told us that dictatorships are going to be perpetuated. But the unfortunate reality is dictators exist on both sides. And this they told us that dictatorships are going to be perpetuated. But the unfortunate reality is dictators exist on both sides. And this is very simple. Why? The thought calculus of a dictator goes as such. On one side, I get loans, but no power. On the other side, I get no loans, but I get power. They always choose power, and thus dictatorships existed on both sides. That was why it was extremely pertinent that our side was able to bring the development, to actually help the individuals within these countries. And we told you that even when it comes on the metric of dictatorship and democracy, the best way you get democracy is when you can bolster the middle class, one that on their side is impoverished and starving and never gets access to the benefits of the Belt Road Initiative."

On our side, China has unique incentives, because the Belt Road Initiative is a soft power that they need to retain. It is an image that they have crafted that they want to keep. On their side, that image dissolves. But the economic interests stay the same, and they're likely going to conscript the countries around them and turn them into the destitution that India had pulled us about. Ultimately, their case in itself, because the only alternative or comparative we saw was one that was much more bleak and one that never cared about its reputation, we were very proud to oppose."

Secondly, on opposition, the westernization of elites looks like them traveling to the UK and to other western states to live, to work, to study, all because they prefer the culture in those areas and because they prefer those societies. Lastly, we say when we're talking about post-colonial states, these are often states that are still rebuilding and they have the active incentive to build a functioning state. We would say Western institutions aren't the only ones that work. We can have institutions that are specifically tailored to these individuals, to those cultures. For example, we still have public education, but instead of 40 students all reading pro-colonialism propaganda in one classroom, it is tailored to the multicultural setting of these countries. Democracy in the United Kingdom, for example, was based on a racially homogenous society versus our kind of society is one that's built on having multiracial identities within the society."

                "text": "Two arguments then to forward from proposition. Firstly, on why it's principally egregious to be compliant in a system of oppression. Secondly, on how this leads to the degradation of development of state institutions. The first argument, the principle, three parts here. Number one, colonialism was an oppressive structure imposed onto every post-colonial state, involving ruthless divide and conquer of our society, pillaging our land of resources, our potential to build cultural erasure and erasing the identities we hold true to our hearts. This is something that's objectively wrong and we should objectively oppose. But the rhetoric on opposition is that these Western ideas are fair, that these institutions are good. They excuse all of the abhorrence when we welcome those institutions as something we should mimic and something we should replicate. In the status quo, it is already extremely difficult for developing nations to get compensation for the horrors of colonialism. Opposition makes it far worse. Secondly, we say elites are a culturally normative force. They hold positions of power. They hold wealth. For example, when they're political or financial leaders within the country, people automatically associate them with success. Therefore, in opposition, individuals associate these elites with success, with Western culture, with Western languages, with Western religion, like Christianity. On opposition, you idealize everything associated with them, idealizing then these Western ideals. Why is it so principally abhorrent, the third layer of this argument? Because what opposition does is idealize Western cultures at the expense of our own by putting Western culture on a pedestal. We say the purpose of independence post-colonialism is autonomy over your identity and over yourself. But what opposition does is impose this idea that many post-colonial states lose the basis of their culture and the key to self-actualization, the roots of their identity. When you view your mother tongue as unimportant and when you view, for example, speaking Chinese as something that's not going to make you successful, you have internalized feelings of inferiority under your side of the house. This empowers the colonial colonizers' rhetoric that they came to our countries and civilized us by bringing us humanity devaluing our value as individuals saying we only have importance because of the west this argument is independently principled i should be allowed to feel proud in my mother tongue and my religion of western imposition without feeling failing because i am not subscribing to their ideals of what successful is. But before I go on, I'll take that point. Given that elites tend to overwhelmingly come from one ethnic group, why is it that your likely comparative is one of multi-racialism rather than promoting the narratives of the ethnic group the elite come from? We think that when elites stay within the country, there's a higher probability of them interacting with different racial groups. Under your side of the house, we'd be bringing an elitist and a kind of view that doesn't take into consideration any of the suffering of anyone within the country on a scale we are far better for people within these countries the second argument on how this leads to the degradation of the development of state institutions also in three parts firstly we see the westernization of elites in the past and trench western norms for decades for example we see our final goal as replicating their system and their system to be the one that is best. After assigning ideas of success with the west for generations, we always feel our system is inferior. This leads to harm and impacts the institutions of states in two ways. Firstly, how this harms local education systems in two ways as well. Firstly, we say the reason why local education systems in post-colonial states like ours is developed so slowly is because elites leave and they don't come back. They don't build up local institutions because a bad local education system doesn't affect them when they know they're just going to move to Harvard because they perceive that to be a more successful institution. On our side of the house, when they stay within the countries, when they invest their time and money into it, this creates investment into the local education system. If you attend local universities, you will give endowments. Your success as an individual in a position of power, for example, an elite is more likely to be successful, gives credence to the success of the university, which begets even more smarter minds to enter these universities. It is a vicious cycle that elevates the intellect of everyone in society that opposition never gets. Local universities are important to make education accessible to everyone. Opposition exacerbates the wealth gap, for example, when wealthy individuals can achieve education and can achieve quality education when local institutions are never meaningfully developed under their side of the house. Secondly, they have brain drain on opposition. This looks like post-conflict. They need the brightest mind and the highest capital in order to develop. These nations have nascent government structures. They don't have wealthy coffers, for example, to kick off innovation and new industries. Therefore, you're relying on your local talent pool in order to develop and grow as a country. On opposition, this never happens because these individuals leave and they don't return because you don't even develop the local institutions. But if opposition wants to say that these elites will come back and they will bring with them ideas that help the country grow, we have two things to say. Firstly, we don't think the West is the only way for you to be able to achieve success and development. But secondly, we say that these individuals are likely not to return. Your wealthy individual will go to, for example, the UK, form connections overseas, have memories and lived experiences there. And after the entrenchment of Western ideals that say that those societies are superior, they're going to stay there, they're going to bring their wealth and influence there, and you will never meaningfully develop your countries. This is why education institutions in countryside hours like Malaysia are so underdeveloped because of this idealization of the West. The last part of this argument is about how this impacts the political system. And this directly clashes with your POI on how we get more inclusive systems. We see that your political systems will never fit the people on the ground for three reasons. Firstly, because those in charge of nation building, for example, the elite, don't know the context of the people there. For example, you went to boarding school in the UK, you have no idea the racial tensions in the country. You have no idea that people need, for example, welfare. You just want to bring ideas of like fiscal conservatism from the country that you came from. But secondly, we see the imposition of things like the common law, for example, from the UK is not fit for locals. The system of land ownership with indigenous individuals versus that of the United Kingdom was vastly different. Imposing Christianity over local cultures, these are things that individuals don't want, don't need, and we think that you should not support under their side of the house. But lastly, we would rather have, for example, quotas under our side"

Notice they give you absolutely no reason why this multicultural society is a likely comparative, and given that this motion is retrospective, they have no fiat to do so. There are a few reasons why this is unlikely to be the comparative. First, because the elites in many of these countries are ethnically homogenous. As a result of colonial divide and rule tactics, where colonizing powers designate one ethnicity to rule in their place after they leave or during the period of colonization, these elites on their side of the house that shape society and shape governance overwhelmingly come from an ethnically dominant and majority class that is not representative of the entire society."

First, they tell us that western ideas are seen as superior to those of your local country. This is not true because this argument assumes that western culture is only concentrated among western people and their descendants in these post-colonial countries. As I'll show you later in my first argument, this is not true and therefore this idolization does not occur. Second, they say Western ideas inherently propagate colonialism, whereas local ideas don't. This is just untrue. Many of the anti-colonial narratives that led to the downfall of colonialism were propagated in Western societies and Western universities. For example, Ho Chi Minh was educated in Paris and brought those anti-colonial ideas back to Vietnam. Finally, they say there is cultural inferiority on out of the house.

If these elites want to move overseas, Isagenix is likely because they think they can lead a better life overseas, regardless of the kind of culture they have. Moreover, their comparative assumes that there are no poor, rich geographical divides in local countries. The likely comparative on their side is a brain drain from rural areas to urban areas, where these urban cities are overwhelmingly developed with their local universities and rural areas are still left out. So their comparative is not any better. Second, they say a brain drain is likely to occur. No, these elites are unlikely to stay in the West precisely because they are elites in your local context. Within your local country, they have overwhelming social and economic influence, which they don't have overseas. If, for instance, no thank you, elites from Nigeria move to the UK, they don't have that kind of overwhelming social influence in the UK, thereby creating an incentive for them to remain in Nigeria. Finally, they say, well, the political system is different. Firstly, because these elites will impose ideas upon the population which they don't like. First of all, these are probably not the people who are going to be voted in, insofar as these people continue to support things that they support rather than these colonial impositions. Second, on their side, it is likely a comparative of private schools and gated communities, meaning that the same harms of being unaware of the local community abound.

The premise of this argument is on team proposition side, the culture that they propagate must be the culture of the dominant social group. I've already given you an incentive as to why this dominant social group exists and why they want to propagate their own culture. Before I move on. Yes. When elites go overseas and say that they are superior, they have education and they have knowledge that enables them to entrench their racial superiority over others. What is the comparative on your side? I'll prove to you later in my argument why there is an incentive for these elites to spread English to the rest of society. Listen out for that. On this for the house, therefore, there is exact kind of cultural hierarchy that they decry in their argument, especially because it is incredibly difficult to create the kind of syncretic multicultural narrative that they stand for, particularly given a history of ethnic conflict between these different ethnic groups in many of these societies. The upshot, therefore, is that social opportunities are unequally distributed on their side of the house, because members of minority groups find it far harder to access any opportunities. On their side, when you go to school as a minority person, you are confronted by a language that you have no exposure to, which your classmates have been learning since birth. In job markets or in politics, you have to converse in a language or observe customs that you are foreign to, compared to your colleagues who have been speaking them since birth. This ossifies a race-based social hierarchy, where members of the majority race are overwhelmingly dominant in politics and society, which is not only unjust by their metric, but also leads to a large amount of discontentment on the part of minority communities. This discontentment could result in a spectrum of responses. On the milder end of the spectrum, it could lack social stereotypes and discrimination, a self-reinforcing cycle, because when minorities are locked out of opportunities, they are perceived as inferior because of their failure to rise to the top of society. On the more extreme end of the spectrum, it could look like outright ethnic conflict, where members of the minority feel that they're so discriminated against, the only way to resolve this issue is to rise up against the society. The comparative on our side is Western culture used by elites. At the very least, accessing these elite rungs of power is now equally easy or difficult to all because no one has preferential access to English on our side. Moreover, elites do have an incentive to increase access to Western culture for the rest of society. First, in order to increase their economic competitiveness, to ensure that the broad majority of society, for instance, can work in your civil service or your MNCs. And second, because there's often no way to prevent it due to the globalized spread of Western culture. For all of these reasons, these harms are mitigated on our side of the house.

Without Western culture, governments can coach their governance in traditional values. So for instance, the national culture of your country. The harm is therefore that this empowers governments to silence critique in two ways. First, because authoritarianism is justified based on twisted interpretations of your national culture. For instance, the Asian values discourse in Southeast Asia in the 1960s, which said that authoritarian political systems are Asian values, and hence these kinds of Western liberal ideas are foreign imports, and democracy is something foreign to our society. This also looks at India, for instance, where criticism of the BJP is coached as criticism of Hinduism, and therefore silenced and cracked down upon. Authoritarianism, therefore, abounds on their side. On the comparative, Western culture is not seen as belonging to your nation or your government. Governments cannot use Western culture to shield authoritarianism, not only because it doesn't belong to your society and therefore you feel no harm in attacking that particular culture, but also because empirically most Western countries today are strong liberal democracies without these authoritarian tendencies. Therefore, on this grounds, we ensure that authoritarianism is strongly devalued on our side of the house because we support racial equality rather than racial hegemony we are proud to oppose.

They say that the reason why they leave is because they would leave under our side of the house as well, because they consider it to be better elsewhere. This does not deal with the nuance of the argument that Nganing brought out to you from first. First of all, because the only reason why we believe there is a better quality of life coming abroad is because of the fact that we idealize Western states. So if we were able to pour money into our own institutions and develop our economies they will also be able to attain a similar or even better quality of life this is what we told you if we make our educational institutions better if we pour money into them into their endowments or if we just stay here as elites like in totality this means that we'll be able to access that very same quality of education this means that uniquely this only happens under your set of the house where you're brainwashed into thinking i may get a better quality of life in New Zealand, for instance. It's not symmetrical as well. I'll take a point now, if there's one. Why would a local elite move and stay overseas when he is an underclass in a Western country and an elite in his own country? Look, have you read the motion? Like, this is literally about elites going to other places and going to attain Western like educations and institutions. Also, if that is the case, that is simply not the case and it's empirically untrue. We also see that, for example, in Malaysia and Singapore and tons of countries, you do have these business and politician elites going to British boarding schools and going to migrate to other countries as well. That essentially deals with everything that you're saying."

And the only rebuttal that they have towards our case is to say, number one, that elites won't be elected anyway. This is empirically untrue. We think that first of all, the reason why they're able to be elected is because they capitalize on this idea of being better than other individuals because of the fact that they have gone to these better institutions. That is what we told you from first. Additionally, because of the fact that they are elites, we need to say that the colonial institutions already entrenched you within that, like entrenched you within those structures of power because of the fact of due to things like divide and conquer. That means that you're able to tell them that you're better than them already. But also what they tell you is just that it's about the fact that instead of staying in my own communities or being able to stay in this country, I've gone abroad. I've gone to British boarding school. I'm never able to understand the kinds of struggles that people go through on the ground. This is a huge difference that they never wanted to deal with. They didn't tell you that you're silencing critique. I would note that first of all, this uniquely happens under your set of the house where they're able to entrench the idea that they're necessarily better. If your characterization is that there's tons of multi-ethnic groups in this society, I'm not able to draw upon my own religion to tell them that I am better than you because of the fact that they are multi-ethnic. So this argument automatically does not stand. We think that actually it's far worse under your side of the house where they're able to install this prejudice when it's exacerbated, when wealthy people go abroad, get better education, come back and able to monopolize not only all these opportunities in terms of things like jobs and essentially lock other people out of being able to access institutions, but also just monopolize things like positions of power to begin with. What do they not deal with from our case? Number one, we told you that you're able to sanitize your obligation of colonial powers to people. Instead of doing things like reparations, apologies, and cultural objects and repatriating them to societies, you just give commonwealth scholarships and they say, look, I've already benefited you, and because the elites necessarily buy into this, and they tell you this as well through media, through the political institutions, that is something that is necessarily perpetuated."

Second of all, but before that, I'll take another point. You tell us that only a small minority of countries have racial diversity and racial hierarchies. Given that many colonialists wanted divide and rule tactics, why is this not the majority scenario in this debate? Look, first of all, the point of pointing that out was to suggest that your case is highly circumstantial, meaning to say that it only operates within these contexts. If you do not want to deal with all the other cases, you necessarily lose the debate. Second of all, given that this is the case, I've already told you why you exacerbate all of these things. If it was true that they were going to draw upon their own culture simply to tell people, look, I am part of this culture and therefore we should follow all these rules, it is highly unlikely that they would suffer harm to the same extent as to when you have Christianity and Catholicism that are entrenching these power structures and people can draw upon them to say that I am better than you, and to implement all of these things. What else did they not deal with? Second of all, we told you about how they impose moral compasses onto you, whether this be, for example, through instituting common law and British law, which is, by the way, in the info slide, so they literally have to deal with it, how they infiltrate civil service societies to impose values onto you that you never wanted to deal with. Third of all, they only wanted to focus on outliers, meaning to say that they did not want to deal with how textbooks are telling you that colonialism is okay, that it was okay that you were being oppressed. Instead, they only focus on the small minority of foreigners who resist the West in the West, like Ho Chi Minh. Look, panel, this is clearly not the majority of cases. And in fact, in the majority of cases, in fact, they are telling you that this oppression was legitimate. They say that it is beneficial to teach all children English. I am not sure why this is was legitimate. They say that it is beneficial to teach all children English. I am not sure why this is the case. They want to sacrifice us being able to connect with our culture for the expense of the oppressors. Finally, at the end of this debate, what was he recognized? That under their side of the house, they uniquely idealized Western culture. It is not true when they tell you that it is symmetrical, because they, in fact, entrench the power of the elites that they say are so bad."

First, I want to take out their claims about the elites going overseas and not coming back. This underpins all of their argumentation on brain drain. First, we told you why they have no incentive to go overseas, because they are already very influential in their home countries. We heard no direct response to this claim. Their second speaker said they would respond. They never did. Second, honestly, I think they can probably maintain a comfortable standard of living in their local country as well, given that they can do things that have gated communities, given that they can live isolated from the types of slums and poverty that everyone else lives in. Third, it's worse to live overseas because people overseas are incredibly racist to you. If you are Nigerian and you go to the United Kingdom, I suspect you would have a lot of racist backlash towards you, making your life very uncomfortable because of rising xenophobia and people believing that you are tribal and primitive. That's why they will come back after going overseas. That's that dealt with. The next thing they try to retreat to is a claim about how elites will not know anything about the national context because they've gone to Oxford and therefore they're not going to know about what's happening on the ground. Again, this is very uncomparative. Given that these people are often immensely wealthy and influential,"

                "text": "by majorities. We told you this was because elites were ethnically homogenous. We gave you two reasons. First, because of divide and rule and how historically this has meant colonizers prefer one type of ethnic group over the other. I'm going to give you another reason now. Often when governments exit these colonial countries, they want to ensure stability. That's what the British wanted when they exited all of these colonial countries. Here's the problem. In order to get stability, you cannot give power to different ethnic groups because this leads to a lot of conflict. Therefore, you only give power to one ethnic group, again meaning that elites often tend to come from the same ethnic group. See, for instance, how political elites in Malaysia largely come from the dominant Malays. Now, the only response you get is an assertion. They say, we are running a very small case because most post-colonial states are not multicultural. One, this is false. The reason most post-colonial states are not multicultural. One, this is false. The reason most post-colonial states are multicultural is because when you exit a colonial country, often colonials tend to blend, for instance, the kind of borders that previously existed. They tend to do away with these borders, just like they did, for instance, with the Indian partition initially. They tend to draw borders arbitrarily, they do, which means that often there is a lot of multiculturalism. So this is why structurally most of these states are multicultural. Second, they actually conceded to this in first. When they set up, they considered that by and large they would support a multicultural identity. What I've proven thus far is that this multicultural identity is structurally impossible and does not apply in the majority of cases. Why then is this homogenous identity from the elite worse on their side of the house? No. Here's why they said that all the harms we gave were symmetrical. No. We give you two unique harms that apply to them. Number one, accessibility. The culture of the elite, for instance, the language of the Burmese, is significantly more inaccessible to an ethnic Rohingya than English for two reasons. First, in terms of the amount of resources, there's significantly more resources available to do things like learn English because you have hyper-globalization, meaning you can watch English shows. You often have far more articles in English on the internet, meaning it's far easier for you to learn these types of things. No response. But second response, let's be very charitable. Let's say it's true that it's very difficult to learn English. Do you know why we still prefer this? The reason is because English is something that is equitable. It is equally inaccessible to everyone. And outside the house, the thing is, no one is explicitly privileged because this is something that is hard for everyone. It means at the very least, we have a principle of equity. On their side, this is one of rampant inequality, where if they teach Malay, you know who is privileged? It is the Malays in school because they've been speaking it their whole life. They create a system of inequality when you are a Chinese boy in school and you don't know how to do the exam paper, but your Malay friend can because it's written in Malay and that's the language he's spoken his whole life. On their side of the house, they create rampant inequality. So even if English is inaccessible, at the very least, we create far more equality than that. This is important because the lack of equality in this context leads to massive social backlash, which brings me on to my second question, or rather my second part of this, the harm of resentment. On the other side of the house, people are going to feel resentful because minorities feel like, at the very least, on the other side of the house, everyone has lost their culture. Everyone has benefited or has been harmed by westernization. Versus on their side of the house, we heard no response, especially because this is very harmful. Here's where I'm going to clash directly with their principle. Where is more resentment caused? Is it caused when you adopt the colonial culture or the culture of the majority? I'm going to break that principle here by proving why more resentment is caused on their side of the house. The reason is because majorities were also oppressive to minorities. So look at the difference. The difference is that on their side of the house, they allow the oppressors, which were the majority, who have oppressed these minorities for millennia, to benefit off of this system. On the other side of the house, even if minorities are still oppressed, at the very least, we don't allow majorities to benefit off this principle of oppression. So that's why on this clash, they lose. No. I'm now going to move on to the second question. Even if this is not a narrative and they stand for multiculturalism, no. I'll explain why they still lose. Here's why. Because thus far, the only thing they've given us here is they say importing Western ideas is just very, very bad. That's all they've been telling us thus far. Number one, they've not given us a lot of analysis for this. Why is it that these Western ideas are necessarily bad? No, thank you. But oftentimes they tend to look like things like democracy. But second, this is outweighed by our second argument, which we heard no response to. Our second argument told you that even if that comparative is a multicultural national identity, these identities are very difficult to criticize because often when you criticize the government, then you are castigated as a traitor. You are castigated as someone who's criticizing the new national narrative that was created, which means often on the outside of the house, governments become very autocratic when you cannot criticise them. Comparatively, on outside of the house, you can criticise these governments. Why does this outweigh their argument on all the harms they want to tell you, for instance, specifically about common law? Because you see, right, under outside of the house, when we have more democracy, this means that people can shape the types of policies that exist. So if these policies are very harmful, they can vote them out. Rel to the death of the house, where you have no ability to do this. I'm not going to move on to my argument on improving foreign relations. No. The premise of this argument is that westernization often occurs across regions. For instance, look at how the United Kingdom colonized entire regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. We argue that this means there are two unique harms to the death of the house in terms of foreign relations. I'll take you in a moment. First, this means they often bridge historical enmity because both countries tend to share similar local cultures in our world. On the other side of the house, countries like Vietnam and Cambodia that have been historically feuding share a similar culture because they were colonized by the same country. Versus the other side of the house, where they resort to the prior national identities that existed, that reinforce past fault lines. Before I go on, I'll take the point. If it was a system of divide and conquer, then Malays are majority groups that have already learned English. If they have more money, they can obviously still get more westernized education. How are you saying that westernization is not gatekept? No, but the point is that on our side of the house, first, I've given you reasons for why it's more accessible. And secondly, and more importantly, many of these Western cultures often have an incentive to, when Western colonizers have an incentive to spread English as a language, because when they came in, that was the explicit purpose they said they were coming in for. Back to the argument. This is important because it means that these local countries, which in the past might have feuded, can now reunify, or rather at the very least, not be at loggerheads with one another. Copy the death of the house, where this is what they resort to. Second, language barriers are broken under our side of the house. Countries are far more willing to trade when they have things in common. They're far more willing to engage in economic blocks"

It means even Chinese and Indian individuals propagate and practice this language previous, prior to colonization. It is untrue for them to just say, if you're Chinese, therefore you don't learn Malay. They need to understand how a country actually functions. Last year on this really flippant and like absurd idea that I can't believe existed in this debate, which is the idea that diminishing language barriers enables economic blocks and some idea of having the English language allows you to fight your oppressors. Panel, do we literally build trade blocks debate, which is the idea that diminishing language barriers enables economic blocks and some idea of having the English language allows you to fight your oppressors. Panel, do we literally build trade blocs because we all speak English or is it just an economically salient policy? I think it's the latter. Individuals in post-colonized states all suffered plunder and therefore work together. You don't need to speak the same language, panel, in order for you to have the benefits. They're saying don't buy the material from opposition just because it sounds flashy. But lastly, props racial equality is tantamount to cultural erasure because the idea of trying to solve these ideas is to make everyone Western,"

We've literally made divorce, for example, illegal within these states because the West deemed it to be so, and we've embodied Catholicism within our states. That is why they didn't get their first argument. Ethnic equity is far worse on your side when you're able to use legitimacy of Westernism to impose your racial ambiguity and superiority.

Your second argument on how you're going to be in a green sector system does not stand, therefore, because of this as well. Before we move on to the third point. Why aren't elites likely to say that? Because they are richer and have significantly more social advantage. They are therefore also just better to rule on your side of the house. We think that first it's a scale, but secondly, because after post-colonisation, individuals need to work together. If you're only going to be basing it on racial lines, even if you're the majority, if the collective minority don't align with you and you want to institute racially biased policies, you're never going to win. The difference was this idea of education and Westernism transcended racial boundaries. It wasn't that I'm racist, or I want to prioritize the Malay race, it's that I'm more educated than you through Westernism, and through these kinds of policies existing.

                "text": "proven why this was any better. I'm going to look at three areas in this speech. Firstly, on the culture and principle, which to be fair is the bulk of their case. Secondly, on which side reduces conflict. And finally, on which side increases development. Firstly, let's talk about culture and principles. This is essentially what they default to in third speaker. They say we should not accept colonialism because this is a thing which is extremely abhorrent. We probably agree, colonialism is bad, but this does not mean that we should erase everything that colonialism has brought. For instance, Western ideals of democracy was precisely what was used to criticize colonialism, and therefore I don't think this necessarily means an erasure of the pre-existing culture. Simply because you choose to accept some motifs of Western thinking does not mean that you become completely Westernized. So for instance, although 40% of Filipino Chinese might speak English, many of them are still Buddhists and celebrate Chinese festivals, so I don't think that this is something that wins them this debate overall. Moreover, they have this small line about reparations, but given that they have not proven why it's likely that you can extract those reparations on their side, they cannot claim this as a substantial benefit. So many of the one-liners that they give us fall out of this debate. Moreover, they tell us there's an idea of a moral compass that is imposed by colonialism. For instance, the idea of sodomy and divorce laws. I'm sorry, but those things occur during the colonial period, not during the post-colonial period. So given this, many Filipinos are already Catholic at the point of decolonization, and thus it's very likely that it will still impose those laws regardless of whether or not they were more westernized in culture. Therefore, there's something that's probably symmetrical and does not win them the debate in terms of ethical systems. But where I want to make the sharpest attack is the idea of their comparative. Because on their side, they have colonialism as well, but simply through other means. Culture is still taken away when it's the majority culture that gets to decide whether or not you go to school and learn a specific language that you want, or whether or not you get to read certain magazines or books, because you can simply ban those things. So if they want to hang their case on the idea of kowtowing to your oppressor, I think this is a pirate victory on their side. On their side, the minorities in Burma have to choose between Burmese erasure and British erasure, and they have not shown why the first or the second is preferable. But in fact, AUSA actually told you explicitly in second speaker that it's worth to have this imposed by a majority culture in your country. This is because the minority elite benefits when that occurs, and we think that it's a bad thing that happens. This is not something you responded to in the previous speech. I think it's a concession that perhaps our side is better in terms, even on the case of that principle. But moreover, that principle is also hinged on the idea that it is inequitable, that only some people speak English. So, if we're able to prove to you that there are incentives to diffuse this culture throughout the entire population, we win. But we've already shown you this since first, when we told you that some people oftentimes want more people to speak the same language so they can work in their company, so they can staff in their civil service. Therefore, the elite has the incentive to diffuse those languages and norms, which means that on our side of the house, it is very likely that the entire population will have access to this rather than simply a small sliver. What I've therefore proven in this first clash is that their principle is out of this realm. And in fact, there are huge incentives for this diffusion to occur."

They say it's highly circumstantial that there's racial diversity and hierarchy, but it's simply untrue because the way that borders were badly drawn because of divide and rule tactics employed by colonizers, which we told you in first and second in which they had no response. So we accept this is the majority burden and DESA has to defend that majority. In this comparative, no thank you. The homogenous elite group is likely to seek everyone else to assimilate. There are a few reasons why there is a homogenous elite group. Firstly, because of divide and rule, and because colonisers wanted to establish a permanent elite they could work with. And secondly, because when colonisers left, they gave it to a specific group to ensure a degree of stability. What this therefore means is that there is one elite group that is able to push their culture onto everyone else. Their only response, and this came late in Third Speaker, is the idea that a path to independence requires racial harmony. This is in fact untrue. First of all, racial homogeneity in the army tended to be a good thing. So for example, in India, it mostly tended to be people of the Hindi race. But moreover, many colonial powers"

For example, in Philippines, where it was hoisted upon them rather than something that was actively fought for. Therefore, a homogenous culture is imposed on their side of the house. What does this mean? This means that on their side, they have this homogenous culture that belongs with indigenous roots rather than something imposed by the West. This in fact has huge differences on the way in which people live. In Malaysia, where you impose Bahasa as a national language, the Malay and the Chinese boy go to school and the Malay boy already has the head start. There's I can say Malay might be easier to learn, but this is cold comfort towards the Chinese boy who sees that his classmate is already so far ahead of him at a point at which they reach the age of seven. But on our side at least, it is a language that both cannot speak, a language that perhaps they can use to learn together, to build a new history rather than base themselves on those divides. English, a language that you can probably learn far easier due to globalization. Well, compare yourself to living in a Karen city, Burma, where it's very unlikely that you get that exposure to Burmese at the end of the day. So, what I've proven in this clash is that we greatly reduce racial conflict. Perhaps there might be still a 1% who speaks English better than everyone else, but we think that having a 1% versus 99% divide versus a 50-50 divide between races is something that is at least preferable. At the end of the day, we get that far better racial preferences. Before I move on to my final clash, I'll take your point. Why are these individuals who care so much about racial lines on our side, after westernization, still not going to be imposing the same kinds of things? How does teaching English to an entire population mean that they're not going to divide and conquer as well on your side? Because the fact that they want westernization means that they want people in their company who are able to do their job, who are able to speak English. Therefore, they have an incentive to educate people across the board. So I think that there's in fact less of those ties of kinship and patronage on our side of the house compared to on your side when this is how you get money, when this is how the way your system works. And that is the only way that you have been able to move up the social ladder. Moreover, Desai had a very flippant response to my second speaker's argument. He told you that there's actually more conflict on their side of the house at a point at which countries against each other fight because of animosities. They cannot simply reduce this to language, but it's also about animosities, for instance, between Vietnam and Cambodia, which they"

In fact, we've already given you many reasons why the elite will remain in the country given that they're an elite rather than being a small fish in another country. So, elites tend to be in those countries permanently, and this is probably not something that wins them the debate. But here they hang their idea about fitting things to the local context. We agree that this happens, but they have not shown us why structurally it is likely that they'll fit into the local context in a way which benefits the local people. Common law, in fact, might be a very good thing in many countries where there isn't this idea of property yet. But I suspect that when you mean fitting to a local context, they mean what my first speaker already told you, that a state is able to impose authoritarian structures at a point at which criticising that is seen as blasphemy. On their side of the house, it's far more difficult to criticize a particular structure when it's seen as epitomizing what your country stands for, rather than if it's a westernized system that is seen that can be critiqued. For these reasons, we believe that it's our side that ensures racial equity and protection. We are proud to oppose."

Their world must be one in which the majority culture abounds. We hear a very late response in the third speaker as to why this is not true. He claims a cultural alliance is necessary to end colonialism, therefore there is multiculturalism on their side. My third speaker already proved why this is not true, but we also preempted this, because even if this is true at the point of decolonization, a lot of these cultural alliances fail immediately after, because these elites see no reason to work together after the colonial enemy has been defeated. Therefore, their world is one of cultural dominance and hegemony. There are a few harms of this. First, they harm democracy. We gave you this argument in our first speech, and they largely did not respond. We showed when your governance is tied to your national culture rather than the universal culture of westernization, as on our side, it becomes increasingly difficult to criticize those policies, because criticism of your government is seen as criticism of your race, or of your religion, or of your culture. We gave you examples like India, for instance, where criticism of the BJP government is cast as criticism of Hinduism and therefore easily shut down. This strategically outweighs their argument on bad Western policies. Even if it is true that elites on our side impose policies that are not tailored to their societies, it is easier to change those policies on our side of the house when you have a stronger, more functioning democracy that can get rid of those particular policies. On their side, you have authoritarian rule that guarantees that these policies can never be rooted out. Second, their side is one of regional conflict. This was the argument I second speaker gave you to no response from them. The pre-colonial era was not some idyllic time of universal peace. Many of these pre-colonial cultures have long histories of conflict with one another, and when you force them to default to those identities, these conflicts will re-emerge. Finally, proposition collapses to their principle. They say it is wrong to impose the colonial culture. We say it is no better to impose the culture of people who have been oppressing you for millennia before colonialism, like the Burmans to the Karens in Myanmar, for instance. So that principle is not something they can default to in the reply speaker. What about our side? The key attack they make on our side is the argument of brain drain. We showed, contrary to the accusation from their third speaker, there are structural reasons for this brain drain not to occur, precisely because these post-colonial elites are viewed as underclasses of society in the Western countries that Proposition claims they will move to, and therefore there's a structural incentive not for them to move.

Self-defense can look like bloody wars or cracking down on protesters could look like maintaining control. These are situations that are fair game in this debate. Second point of setup, this debate is not about things like peacekeeping, joint training ventures, or intelligence sharing mechanisms. We are perfectly fine with these things, so we are not leaving these countries alone. We just oppose the unaccountable and inflammatory method of international military aid. And then finally, this debate is not just about the US giving aid. Countries like Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia give a ton of international military aid too. Opposition must contend with the states who don't necessarily have the best incentives. On our side, we prefer a world where no states give international military aid."

                "end": 633.88,
                "text": "On my first point then about more war. So there are two reasons why the states who give military aid often give it poorly, even if they don't actively have malicious incentives. Firstly, these states often prioritize consolidating their strategic alliances, not necessarily focusing on good or humane military objectives. And this is because the donors of aid are far away from the conflict. They're very insulated from it. So they don't necessarily have a direct interest in whether people who are a thousand miles away or very different from you ethnically and religiously are dying. Instead, this aid is often prioritized to strategic locations because that is an impact that actively manifests in your country's politics. For example, the U.S. funds Israel because it's the one democratic country in a sea of Middle Eastern countries, or Russia and Belarus are quite close because Belarus is a staunch ally of Putin. This means instead of caring about humanitarian ends, as opposition might claim, this aid is often effectively unconditional because that alliance matters more than the result of the conflict. Secondly, on economic interests. So the Israel lobby in the US, oil interests in Saudi Arabia, Turkish control over the Black Sea and wanting to have access to the Black Sea often means that you give aid to some countries that are strategically important to you over others. You want to curry their favor and establish control within those areas. So instead of this aid going to states who are actually vulnerable, you prioritize the countries that can help your country the most. Why is this aid going to escalate conflict then? There are four reasons for this. Firstly, because there's a lack of accountability. So the recipients of this aid are often quite unstable just by the nature of the motion, like they are in a conflict, so they need the aid in the first place. This often translates into there being a lack of democratic checks or legitimacy to the government, things like ethnic divisions within the country. This means that the government that uses this aid is both unaccountable, but often uses this aid poorly and has the incentive to use it to entrench its own power. So this looks like Israel using US aid to bomb Palestinian villages, Maduro using Russian aid to roll tanks down the streets and quash protesters. The second reason why this aid will escalate conflict is because you give them more sophisticated weaponry. This is just definitionally true, given that you're receiving money from rich countries and you're now able to buy weapons from their companies. So instead of pistols, you now have machine guns. And even in opposition's best cases with things like terrorism, terrorists are notoriously hard to find, especially with the lack of intelligence gathering mechanisms, which is often the case in these poorer countries. The only addition with international military aid then is that you get more bombs to throw around that kill civilians, that rip families apart, that turn hospitals to rubble. And those are far more sophisticated and destructive. The third reason this point is true is because this funding is two-sided. So there are international rivalries that often manifest in proxy conflicts. China and the US butt heads in the South China Sea by funding opposing countries. The US and Russia fund opposing sides in the war in Syria. This means that it's not just giving money to one side that they can then use this money to just stop the conflict. You are highly unlikely to end the conflict at all because both sides get bankrolled. And so they just clash against each other and that conflict gets worse and worse. The final mechanism here is that you have no incentive to negotiate and actually have an end to the conflict. To come to the table, both sides need to be vulnerable. They need to be unable or unwilling to withstand the economic costs of that conflict anymore. So both sides are like, let's come together and put an end to this. But when you are both being bankrolled by different wealthy countries who seemingly have unending reserves of cash, there is no cost to this conflict or not as great of a cost. So you are then just showing weakness when the other side is being paid and you are saying, let's negotiate. This means that countries have no incentive to come to the table and conflicts go on and on. International military aid merely adds fuel to the fire and causes more death and suffering. But for my second point, I'll take the POI. The premise of your argument is that these countries only care about strategic partnerships when giving aid. If that is true, why are they likely to give humanitarian efforts or share intelligence in a mannerism that helps the most vulnerable on your side of the house? No, no, no. Don't let opposition make this debate into either you fund entirely one thing or entirely the other. We are saying that states incentives primarily align with strategic objectives. So the states that are strategically important to you will receive more aid and receive it more often, which means the scale of the harm is greater. Of course, there might be isolated instances where there's humanitarian aid, but this debate needs to be one of weighing. Second point"

                "text": "then about why military aid leads to harmful leverage. The prior point talks about cases where the aid is given by countries without malicious incentives, which is opposition's best case. This point is about the very real cases where countries want conflict. So these are different situations. The two arguments aren't tense. Opposition must contend with this point as well, instead of engaging in a very narrow framework. The characterization here is that the states who have the money to give military aid, while the recipients become dependent on that aid because they need that aid to resolve their conflict, have huge amounts of leverage over the countries that receive that aid. There are two problems that manifest here. Firstly, that these states often have an active incentive to create conflict. This looks like religious incentives, like wanting to expand the influence of your particular sect of Islam, or wanting control over strategically important regions, such as being able to get more control through creating instability, which precludes other countries from getting involved or just knocks other countries out of the area. So this looks like Qatar, who funds the central government of Somalia, while the UAE and Saudi Arabia fund other regions like Somaliland instead, because both actors want control over the Red Sea shipping routes. This means that these actors end up clashing within the country, where Qatar's military aid goes towards bombing other regions of the country for their own power trip and to kick Saudi Arabia out while entire villages go up in rubble. The second problem here is that aid often creates loyalty, which is harmful. So elites are given power and often enriched by the aid that they receive. Corruption is common in these countries, and there's often little accountability by a state that is embroiled in war, especially when the other side is bankrolled too. There's no incentive to back down. These actors actively want to keep being involved in the conflict because it benefits them. They're receiving a continuous stream of cash. So this looks like Russia funding the Belarusian government's ability to buy arms in order to get closer access to Crimea in order to resist NATO influence in Eastern Europe. So when Russian troops are now able to move more freely within the Belarusian border, this increases the chance of conflict reoccurring, and it extremely harms pro-democracy efforts around the world. On proposition, we believe that military aid can be abused and is actually counterproductive to its aims. International military aid donors claim to be firefighters, but in reality, they're the arsonists. I'm so proud to propose."

                "text": "to say about the characterization of the comparative in this debate. That is to say, proposition cannot make out arms deals so that guns and bombs can still be bought on their side of the house. What that means then is that when they talk about actors such as authoritarian governments, when they talk about actors like terrorism, it is very likely that these individuals and groups will still be buying arms on both sides of the house. Why is this the case? Because authoritarians are rich. They often have a huge amount of resources, which is why they're able to put down their oppression towards their people because they have, for example, money that they spend on the military. Authoritarians have control over industrialization, which means that they can start producing guns and arms instead and start buying guns instead of having them as aid. And terrorism, for example, can have money through the black market, like the way that the Taliban sells heroin, or they can employ child soldiers and other ways of grassroots levying arms on their side of the house. So they have to tell us necessarily how these dangerous actors are stopped from getting dangerous weapons when individual aid pulls out. That being said, the comparative in this debate is about vulnerable actors who don't have the money, don't have the capital, don't have the resources and infrastructure to have military assistance when that aid pulls out. Firstly, then, why do we protect vulnerable actors? What do these actors look like? Firstly, it looks like in post-conflict societies that are ravaged by insurgents. It looks like South Sudan who deals with Janjaweed, who are killing innocent civilians. It looks like Ser post-conflict societies that are ravaged by insurgents. It looks like South Sudan who deals with Janjaweed, who are killing innocent civilians. It looks like Serbian extremists in Kosovo who want to kill the Albanian ethnicity group there. Secondly, it looks like oppressed minorities and stateless groups, like Kurdish individuals inside of Turkey, who for every day have to struggle for their right to sovereignty. The Chechnyan freedom fighters who have to stand up to the entire military of Putin. Thirdly, it is those countries that are surrounded by hostile actors are incredibly vulnerable positions. South Korea after the Korean War, Israel in the 70s, when America came in and supported them with the Iron Dome and THAAD, that necessarily means they have the creation of that state. So they have to tell us necessarily then uniquely how they help these actors. What do we think the incentives are to help those actors on our side of health? And note, if they want to mech for things such as humanitarian aid and peacekeeping, then those incentives are symmetric, that there is a strategic resource. But listen, why do strategic incentives and altruistic humanitarian incentives usually align?"

                "text": "Firstly, because of the factor of stability, that many times what it means to be strategically embroiled inside of a nation means that you want things such as economic stability, means you want things such as political stability within those nations, means you want reliable trading partners who for some, have a running economy. To that extent, then, you have an incentive to make sure that terrorist groups and insurgents don't run amok because that hurts your bottom line. Secondly, when you want to secure actors, when you want to secure allies, you have an incentive to make sure that those allies are not rogue nations. You have an incentive to make sure that they are not looked down on the international stage, that they have a say in the UN because they don't oppress freedoms of human rights. So if you want to build strategic allies, then it probably means you have an incentive to democratize, liberalize, or make these actors more reliable because that means you have a better ally in the global stage. But thirdly, it is about global perception. The hegemons in the status quo are fighting for a perception of trust. When you look at comparatives between American aid and the BRI, China and America are trying to bolster their PR in terms of helping these nations and helping these stateless groups to the extent that they have an incentive to make sure that they want to secure long-term allies. It has to be done in a good way. So everything I tell us about strategic reasoning is correct. Those strategic reasonings often align with altruistic incentives."

                "text": "Why is the comparative insufficient then? And why is aid uniquely the only mechanism to help these vulnerable groups? The first thing to note here is that the political capital in the status quo means that if you cannot send them aid, you usually send them nothing at all. Because these issues are too macro for voters to care about. When you worry about the dynamics in regional areas and the conflicts that are happening in places far away from the world, it is very unlikely that a politician can belittling say that we are going to send troops on the ground, we're going to endanger the lives of young Americans, young American men and women, and send them over there. It is a much more unreliable way to support these individual countries because there's an irrational reaction at the point in which you become much, much more involved, which is the comparative on their side of the house. That means they probably do have to support a world in which these people aren't helped at all, or in the case in which it's like UN peacekeeping, it's helped to an incredibly ineffectual extent. But even if they have other alternatives, why are they not as good as aid? Firstly, because aid has the flexibility of cash. The solutions are incredibly different for different countries, and that cash is the best way to empower those nations to make that country. They can invest in different things like artillery shells if it's for defensive, or for AK-47s if they have to do more guerrilla fighting. These are things that are different when you look at the individual context. But secondly, aid uniquely upholds the sovereignty of the places that these countries are going to. But secondly, aid uniquely upholds the sovereignty of the places that these countries are going to. The fact is that these countries understand the specific plans and context better than American soldiers. It means that they themselves can have their own control over where that money goes to and over where those arms are controlled. But thirdly, it's about long-termism. That upon their side of the house, they support things such as military intervention through sending in troops. Then eventually, at some point, you have to pull out, and when you pull out, you leave a vacuum. When aid doesn't do that, because instead it builds up a slow amount of infrastructure that can continuously be used. So right now, if America were to pull out all aid from Israel, they'll be allowed to survive even in the most hostile settings because of the fact that they'd already built up that infrastructure when they're an incredibly fragile state. What is the impact of this? That you need these military arms in order for these countries to survive. Because while they talk about things such as building infrastructure, buildings and hospitals don't do anything when ISIS is running around killing civilians. When you need that military aid, then establish the humanitarian aid that they want to protect the peacekeepers, to protect the contractors, to protect infrastructure development, only we get that. When we bolster the defense of young nations and vulnerable groups, it means the Kurds can stand up for one more day against ISIS and Erdogan. They can hold their village against these foreign actors. It means that the territory captured by Boko Haram that kidnaps and tortures young women can get pushed back and those people can finally be liberalized. It means that people in Korea in the 70s can sleep safe at night knowing that they do not have to worry about an imminent evasion coming from North Korea. All the things only happen when you empower those governments to have the arms to protect their sovereignty before i go and i'd be happy to take a poi so i don't think you listen to our model we had joint training ventures intelligence sharing mechanisms to find the terrorists that are far more sophisticated than throwing cash at the problem why do you need machine guns and bombs that end up mowing down the civilians you want to save okay firstly like that's symmetric that's symmetric, right? If you can have intelligence sharing, we have that too. But secondly, what good is it knowing where a terrorist is if you can't shoot them?"

They make proxy wars worse for three reasons. Firstly, it is more escalatory because instead, when these governments still have an incentive to, for example, meddle in the politics of the Middle East because it's incredibly important for their oil trade then they'll have to do something about it like american jews will still push for the lobby to do something about the issue of the palestinian antifada to the extent that it is much more likely that you send individual troops which even further worsens all of their problems of proxy wars because now if you kill an american soldier that in and of itself is a declaration of World War III. But secondly, they have less accountability, because if these nations instead turn to other forms of military assistance in terms of funding their own militaries, it means that there's no way that America can ever reel them back in the point in which human rights abuses get too bad. That is why, for example, Saudi Arabia has been curbing their human rights atrocities inside of the Yemeni war because of the fact that there is international backlash from America. But thirdly, you have less control at the point in which you pull out at any point means that these countries turn into a vacuum. We would say that it's better to have necessary interventions at some point when that inaction leads to the death of a million of people.

We wouldn't support, therefore, having military aid. And that's why it's something that is devastating. And I want to note that at the end of their refutation, they do seem to run into a bit of a tension. They suggest that authoritarian actors are extremely rich, profiting off of the"

That is to say that humanitarian aid is likely to be given only when it's the case that there is sufficient stability for individuals to enter in the first place. But crucially, funding leads to conflict for all the reasons that we provided you, that funding leads to increased tension and funding fuels conflict between sides. But furthermore, it means that states are unlikely to make the calculation in the first place, that obviously there is a substantial cost to the AU deciding whether or not they would like to send in peacekeeping troops. But if it is easier and more possible to send in hundreds of millions of dollars, then that is the more likely thing for them to do. The question is, which solutions do they make more available to these actors? We would suggest that they allow them to brush off humanitarian aid, where that is something that would be useful by saying,"

North Korea is a hostile actor who is funded by the USSR, and that suggests that this very nature of military aid is what is leading to these conflicts in the first place. So crucially, then, there are cases where there isn't that symmetric incentive to be humanitarian. So it is the case that Russia has a unique incentive then to do things like fund Maduro to allow him to quash protesters or do the same thing in Belarus. So what that means is that this example doesn't apply in the vast majority of circumstances where there's huge amounts of funding that occurs through pernicious actors. But thirdly, we agree that is unlikely to happen in most cases. But peacekeeping is what we think is likely to occur in lots of cases. And the reason is we think that these types of conflicts are likely to secure widespread buy in. And the reason is because there is spillover. In the context of Africa, for example, there is spillover between Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea. And that suggests that there is huge amounts of incentive on the part of peacekeeping actors to engage because society writ large is being affected by these conflicts. This is true of the UN as well, where the notion that a multiplicity of states within that union are being affected leads to international pressure to engage in the first place.

We would suggest that this is much worse on their side, because on their side, if conflicts are resolved, weapons are around. People have access to weapons, they have access to money, and that is used to fuel things like terrorism, which is why we've seen the emergence of terrorism in the aftermath of huge amounts of engagement on the part of the United States. But I do want to bring back some of the analysis that we suggest. There is a collective action problem because the problem is that states are funding both sides of the conflict. Therefore, the need for defense is raised by this policy. So our states might otherwise be more protected and more capable of dealing with these problems, they become less able to do so because we fund the conflict on both sides. So that means where the United States and Russia are funding two opposing sides of the conflict, that you increase the risk to either country, and that increases the need for defense. If you eliminate that in the first place, these countries are much safer and much better off. Our argument then is on more war. And this is important to note that oftentimes, even where this aid has conditions attached, that it often is functionally unconditional. And the reason is because there is a reactionary funding mechanism and a huge strategic interest to provide these countries with huge amounts of aid."

This allows conflict to spread and continue when terrorist organizations can now fill power vacuums and seize on the instability with huge amounts of force that have been provided to them by foreign actors. So that suggests that vulnerable actors have two things. One, they are made worse off because of the long-term effects of having these weapons existing in the country in the first place, where you have machine gun now where terrorist organizations otherwise wouldn't have access to them.

On to the second area of this speech on how states exercise leverage and on our argument or on the arguments on comparative. I'll take a POI quickly. In the status quo, what is your comparative for assisting the Kurds and stopping them from being genocided by the Turkish government? So we think there are things like in the status quo that currently exist, like joint training missions, which are already accommodating for that. Okay. On to how states exercise leverage. So their argument is broadly that you will go in and you will engage. And that will be negative, although this is slightly tense. But I assume there's like a they're operating in different circumstances, like taking it as our best or something. We think that foreign intervention is unlikely to happen in most cases because there are substantial incentives not to do this. First, because the substantial human and economic cost of war. This is particularly true of all actors in the debate, particularly a side like Russia, which doesn't have the domestic capital to be able to engage in wide-scale war. But second, because the cultural trauma associated with interventions like that of Afghanistan and the huge amount of failures that have resulted from them. So these are unlikely, but where these conflicts do happen and intervention does occur, we think it is better. First, because often funding through aid precludes positive intervention like AU peacekeeping forces, and this is especially true when funding increases. But second, because greater accountability checks exist through media attention and public scrutiny when war is a massive cost to your image as a leader. But lastly, on their notion of backlash, we think that it is far more true of money because accountability checks are far removed. First, because it often occurs through private contractors that are separated from the state. But second, the governments are far from the actions. It isn't actually their troops committing the human rights atrocities. And so in that sense, they are far more immune from all the damage and all the backlash that stems from that. So that suggests that comparative won't arise. But our argument on leverage is much more important, that there's a significant desire to create tension in these regions. But more than that, even if the money is going to these vulnerable actors, it isn't being spent correctly. Instead, it is going into the hands of elites and it isn't being used to benefit vulnerable people. For that reason, then, proud to propose. I thank second proposition."

But versus small groups like Kurds, when it's just about a humanitarian stance to stand for their country, they're likely going to be very weak later on and there's no practical benefit of us helping them there's lack of incentive to fund them so in their house they'll just trade with Assad or trade with Saudi Arabia because it makes a lot of money and gains of an ally but no one is there to like help the Kurds this only exists when you think there's a necessity to check the other side and you can easily do it by giving them some money and people wouldn't fight back against you because you're not sending in troops and troops of people and sacrificing your own people so if anything we help the most vulnerable of individuals like stateness minorities second of all let's talk about the actor of terrorists because what they said is that we will give them better weapons on our side of the house firstly again they need proof to why this is exclusive when they can go to the black market and get things but two even if they are given better weapons like we also get more information when we can set up alert systems we can have better weapons to target them so we don't do lower the collateral damage of when a like grassroots government is trying to target them you have a lot of collateral damage because you have to go through the civilians versus when you have proper arms proper alert systems proper gps tracking devices you target the terrorists without all that collateral damage that exists on their side of the house but thirdly regarding the like inflaming of these terrorist sentiment it's worse on their side of the house. But thirdly, regarding the like inflaming of these terrorist sentiment, it's worse on their side. Because when American troops are sent in on these peacekeeping missions, then American soldiers are bombing your houses. You will demonize the West and buy into the terrorist narrative.

But two, if they see that incentives of the global actors are bad, these effects will actualize in a worse way on their side of the house when there are actual troops being sent in, actual commanders sent in, and actual tanks sent in. And this is why. Because ultimately, the tanks and troops answer to Russian command, answer to China command, versus when money is transaction, I can't just wire it back to my own bank account with my own will. You get obsolete control over what you want to use it for. So in the example of Kosovo, for example, their goal is to establish their own country and protect Albanians from ethnic persecution. That's what the government is going to use it for, because that was their goal with the money their own country and protect albanians from ethnic persecution that's what the government is going to use it for because that was their goal with the money versus if russia gets to control the troops that are trying to achieve this mission they'll focus on their own strategic regions as they want to talk about and focus on protecting only the resource rich areas the oil rich areas instead of protecting the albanians because we're not a government trying to establish coastal well we're just trying to take care of our strategic regions so that control on their side is a very bad thing that undercuts all their positive impacts.

What we're doing is we're bridging that gap. The people with power, with money, they're going to launch wars on either side of the house because they see a window of opportunity. Aid doesn't come in those circumstances because aid are like these two countries are ready to fight wars when they've accumulated that wealth. Aid comes to counteract that.

                "text": "rebel groups for fear of alienating other more powerful state actors like Turkey, who would be very, very mad if you do so. This is why the overwhelming characterization in this debate and the overwhelming amount of military aid that is actually given is given to countries like Syria by Russia, to Belarus or Israel or Saudi Arabia. So let me engage now with the example, and the overwhelming amount of military aid that is actually given is given to countries like Syria by Russia, to Belarus, or Israel, or Saudi Arabia. So let me engage now with the arguments they give us to why states have good incentives. Firstly, they say states have an incentive to create political and economic stability and reliable trade partners. There are a couple things to point out. Number one, geographical distance means you do not bear the cost of instability. The U.S. does not bear the cost of buildings being bombed in Gaza. Congressmen in the U.S. simply say it was just self-defense. Second, the state being backed may want economic stability in a vacuum, but you have to consider two additional features. Number one, oftentimes it is possible to use instability to actually rile up your base politically. Take the example of Israel. It's people who are closest to the Iron Dome in Israel, closest to rocket attacks coming in from Gaza, who are most likely to support Netanyahu, because the instability and fear of their lies actually emboldens strongman leaders like Netanyahu. So it's not even clear if those strongmen themselves that an opposition is necessarily backing have an incentive to de-escalate for those reasons. The next thing I tell you is you don't want allies that are rogue countries. Like, I mean, I just question this on face, given that the U.S. effectively partners with Saudi Arabia. And my prior response on accountability, I think, deals with this argument. All right. Then what we told you is that the actual incentives of states giving aid are this, that it's a way of consolidating strategic alliances, not a way of accomplishing inherently good objectives with respect to minimizing human casualties. One, because you don't face the consequences of war very far away. Second, because you often have strategic incentives to consolidate influence. For example, Gulf states face the consequences of war very far away. Second, because you often have strategic incentives to consolidate influence. For example, Gulf states in the Horn of Africa, where Qatar, for instance, has an incentive to kick out Saudi Arabia and the UAE, because whoever controls Horn of Africa controls the Red Sea and therefore can shut off shipping routes to the rest of the world for their enemy in the Gulf. So often vital strategic interests, even if it causes instability to necessarily consolidate your influence and back other states. Thirdly, because we told you there are often political and economic incentives like the Israel lobby in the United States or oil in Saudi Arabia, no analysis with this whatsoever. All these reasons suggest that on balance, you're going to be funding worse actors rather than the good ones. The next thing they claim they give is you need money for vulnerable actors. I already outframed their example on the Kurds, but a couple of additional responses I want to give. Number one, this doesn't engage with our collective action problem analysis, which is that one country might back a region whose aims are desirable, but if that country's enemy funds the opposing side in a quasi-proxy conflict, on net, this simply leads to more conflict. We gave you the example of Saudi Arabia and the UAE backing semi-autonomous regions in Somalia, and Qatar backing the central government of Somalia in opposition. So even if in theory you can back good groups, the only reason you need to back good groups is because your opponents are funding and backing groups that are oppositional to them. This is why we'd be better off with no aid whatsoever in a world where you wouldn't have these military conflicts at all. Secondly, because in cases where there are existential conflicts to the region and threats abroad, like jihadists or piracy, there are active incentives for other forms of assistance. For example, like AU peacekeeping or coalitions to crack down on terrorist efforts. Note, in these cases, there is a sufficient mass of other countries interested in preventing these harms, and that is why you actually end up getting the positive forms of interventions we talked about. But finally, we told you that oftentimes preferable alternatives like peacekeeping are actively crowded out by the amount of conflict that exists within these countries, an argument that was given in second and that was unengaged with. That when you back countries to actual military aid, you are less likely to get the types of humanitarian interventions that we talked about, which oftentimes happen effectively due to the amount of multilateral efforts and accountability that you have in these cases. They could try to wash out the entirety of the debate. They didn't engage their actual analysis as to why these states have poor incentives. Second theme, irrespective of what the donors incentives are, here's why conflict gets worse. Before I go on, I'll take the POI. How do you resolve the underlying causes of wars that happen before military aid comes into the picture? That happened before military aid. Well, we gave the analysis in second, which I'll get into now, but why there's an active incentive to deescalate on our side of the house, which is eliminated on your side when you get bankrolled. But I'm going to get into that in a moment. So on their argument, which is now proxy conflicts are going to get worse. We told you this is massively unlikely, given that there are strong incentives not to go to war in the majority of cases. It means you're losing your troops. It means you're losing your soldiers. It means you're enduring massive economic costs. But in the relatively few cases where there is broad international support for humanitarian interventions, we think those cases can be desirable. And crucially, this is the link. States have realized that self-interested wars are never in their own interest, given the massive cost of their own soldiers, given the political costs where it's more desirable to spend money at home. This is why the wars that are fought are actually the good ones. They end up looking like PSC peacekeeping missions in Africa. Because what we told you is that for the most part, states don't have the vicious proxy war incentives to go into war and fight terrible conflicts because they realize in the long run that will come back to bite them and it won't be politically palatable in any way. This is why in most cases, it's unlikely to be the alternative. But in cases where it is the alternative, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Finally, our analysis on why conflict gets worse. They never actually engaged with our analysis, which is that if both sides are being bankrolled, you have no incentive to mediate. Their response was money allows for de-escalation, but this was literally just a counter assertion and second opposition. I have no idea what the analysis actually was there. Our argument was very simple. Two sides only have an incentive to mediate, to negotiate, and to de-escalate when they can no longer endure the economic and military consequences of staying in and prolonging that conflict. They are able to do so when both sides are being backed by international aid that they are capable of receiving solely on the basis that it has aid and that it does not arms deals. And that is why on their side, you completely undermine any prospect for negotiation and de-escalation. Third theme then on leverage. And I don't leave much time for this because we still have not gotten a response after 16 minutes of opposition. What we told you that sometimes aid is unconditional, but sometimes where there's huge asymmetric leverage that a country holds over other countries, there is the ability to implement conditions on the way that is used. But crucially, that allows rich states who don't necessarily have the best incentives to use this leverage for malicious reasons. One, we told you about how often states give aid as an incentive to create conflict, to consolidate control over strategically important regions. We gave you the example of Qatar and the Horn of Africa. Second, we told you in the first speech about how this creates a sense of loyalty, how you feel as though you owe Saudi Arabia favors as an elite who's being enriched by the aid that they are giving you. And as a consequence, you are willing to spark military conflict in your region. Now, crucially, authoritarian regimes abroad that are funding you, like Saudi Arabia, do not care because they do not face the actual consequences of instability because it's far away and geographically isolated. But the people on the ground do care when they face the massive cost of economic instability, when they face the massive increase in human casualties that occur, when faraway actors are sparking conflict at their expense. We're very happy to propose."

When you talk about Israel, America is likely to send troops in because the Jewish lobby is very, very powerful.

                "text": "the two types of conflicts we have talked about in this debate. First, on proxy wars, and second, on the protection of the most vulnerable actors. First, let us discuss the point about proxy wars. Understand the characterization of proxy wars, which is usually regime to regime conflict. So this is Saudi Arabia versus Iran. This is Ethiopia versus Eritrea. The proposition claim we get under here is that you create an escalation of warfare to the point where the US and Russia found opposing sides. The first thing to understand is that those proxy wars will still exist on both sides of the house, right? Because Saudi Arabia wants to be the Sunni protectorate. Iran wants to be the Shia protectorate. Those religious fault lines still exist. Those wars will still exist on both sides of the house, right? Because Saudi Arabia wants to be the Sunni protectorate, Iran wants to be the Shia protectorate. Those religious fault lines still exist, those wars still exist. But second, we mitigate this argument to a huge extent when we told you that states like Saudi Arabia and Israel do not need American military aid. They are rich enough to buy the weapons themselves. Saudi Arabia can just buy from Lockheed Martin directly instead of using American military aid. Then proposition comes back and says, well, the difference is that they are more armed to the point where America is giving military aid. But the deadlock breaker in this clash isn't the amount of guns Saudi Arabia has, but rather it is the way we use them. And we proved to you from the offset that Saudi Arabia would use them better, the point in which America was involved in the conflict. The first thing we told you was accountability. That yes, first proposition is right when they say that Saudi Arabia is not a democratic state, but that rogue Saudi Arabia is still going to exist on their side of the house. In contrast, we have a leveraged bargaining chip on our side, the point when the United States is giving aid to Saudi Arabia. That is a point at which we can use the threat of pulling out that aid as a threat to get Saudi Arabia to come to the negotiation table. Is this threat perfect or is this threat huge? It's not, but it's a leverage and bargaining chip that simply does not exist on their side of the house. This is why you got the Abraham Accord signed, right? The reason why you got the Abraham Accord signed between Israel and Saudi Arabia was because the United States had some leveraging power there because they funded Saudi Arabia. But second, I think like Western weapons are good, right? Like the India-China debate three years ago. Like I think that those Western weapons mean that they're more accurate and it means that you're able to kill the target that you want to kill. In contrast, if Saudi Arabia doesn't have Western military assistance, that's a point at which they make chemical weapons. That's a point at which they make barrel bombs. That is when they use child soldiers and suicide bombers, right? Because those mechanisms and those weapons are cheaper, but those weapons also cause a lot more collateral damage, the point where they're unable to be regulated. Whereas in contrast, if you're giving them money to buy advanced US weaponry, at least you can target the right people. But third, let us talk about negotiation and peace talks, which is why we win this debate the clearest. The first thing they say is that you don't want to seem weak, and therefore you don't want to come to the negotiation table. Yeah, like weakness is a symmetrical harm, right? Like on either side, you don't want to seem weak. That's a symmetrical reason as to why you won't negotiate. But then they say that the point where both sides are bangful is also the point where there isn't an incentive in the negotiation. No, we think precisely the opposite is true. Because if state one in the conflict is being bangful by Russia and state two in the conflict is being bangful by the United States, then neither one of those two actors sees an end to the war. The point where they think that their enemy is very, very powerful because they're being banged by the other superpower. The point we're in that you create wars in which the U.S. funds one side and Russia funds another side, that's a deterrence as to why they'll come to the negotiation table. That's a deterrence as to why they'll be more likely to have peace talks. That is why there were peace talks in Vietnam panel, because like American troops realized they couldn't push on anymore because the Viet Cong was too wealthy and funded by Russia and China. So if anything, they only want to come to the negotiation table when they think that the other side is equally as powerful as them and therefore there isn't an imminent end to the conflict. Thus, that is when they can no longer see any positive gain of the conflict and why they're more likely to come to the negotiation table. In contrast, that incentive doesn't exist on their side of the house because the point we're in, your opposition isn't being funded by a superpower. That's a point where you might think that, hey, I might be able to take them out. But furthermore, on their side of the house because the point we're in, your opposition isn't being funded by a superpower. That's a point where you might think that, hey, I might be able to take them out. But furthermore, like the losses of the war are just bigger on our side when you're being funded by Russia and the United States. An incentive as to why you have to go to the negotiating table to prevent that from happening."

                "text": "In conclusion, we think proxy wars isn't going to win this debate because Saudi Arabia is still rich on both sides of the house. The bigger delta in this debate is when we talk to you about the protection of the vulnerable groups. Understand that there will always be an asymmetry between the powerful authoritarian despots versus the vulnerable minorities. This is because of numerical strength, so there are more Muslims than there are Kurds. This is also because Assad controls vital resources that the Kurds don't, and this is also because there are historical fault lines. Therefore, Assad will go after the Kurds with or without Russia. Saudi Arabia will engage in Sunni conflicts throughout the Middle East with or without the support of the United States or other actors. The difference then isn't whether or not those wars exist in the first place, but rather how you protect the vulnerable minorities. Because here's the thing. The marginal increase of Assad's capacity when Russia funds him is a lot smaller proportionally than the increase of the Kurdish capacity to defend themselves when America funds them. Because the difference between making a powerful actor on their side of the house more powerful and making a powerless actor in the status quo have some power on the other side of the house. So the Kurds on their side are going to be destroyed because those Kurds don't have the resources and the money to buy military supplies. Their response is, one, you're going to have joint training exercises. But what's the point of teaching them how to shoot a gun if you don't have the money to buy a gun, right? And furthermore, if you want to talk about humanitarian aid, humanitarian aid can only occur when these regimes trust you and you build that trust through giving them military aid. And you can only have humanitarian aid when you know for a fact that your peacekeepers won't be attacked. You can only get that security when you give them military aid so that they're able to have a powerful regime there, right? Therefore, the comparison isn't a world of peace, but rather a world of genocide on their side of the house. Peace, our proposition is a masquerade for the suppression that the Kurds will go through on their side of the house. There's a world in which Israel would be dead after the Six-Day War and wouldn't be a state today. This is how you should weigh this clash. Their highest impact is that conflicts will be prolonged the point we're in the US and Russia are paying for opposition sides. Here's the thing. The majority of people who die in those conflicts are combatants, right? They're the people who are using guns. In contrast, the people who would die on their side of the house, the point where Kurds stand stops getting funding. And as a result, Assad goes in. The people then that would die on their side of the house are not combatants, but rather children, mothers, and the entirety of their culture. So we think if you're the Kurds, it is preferable to fight a war against Assad than for Assad to literally suppress your entirety of your population.

Why are strategic incentives inherently a binary between what is good for the people? By their logic, they would oppose trade as well, because all trade happens through economic self-interest. So by their logic of strategic incentives was that bad of a thing that they would oppose trade as well. We told you that in many instances, the strategic incentives that side properties and things are problematic often align with what is good for the people on the ground. America has a strategic incentive to have stability and democracy, and because they want to have a good reputation, because they want to prop up actors that are predictable, which you only get when you prop up democracy, because authoritarian leaders can do whatever they want with or without American impunity. Therefore, that is the reason as to why America will prop up the right regimes in those areas. And furthermore, you have an incentive not to prop up terrorist groups because terrorist groups are unpredictable. So the choices between funding a terrorist group and funding a democratic actor, you would choose to fund a democratic actor. So their idea of strategic incentive is only a masquerade. They have never proven to you what a strategic incentives are inherently diametrical. There will always be the powerful and the powerless. But on all sides of the house, we give weapons and the support the powerless need to defend themselves. I am very proud to oppose."

The only thing they proved to you is that some bad authoritarian actors are currently funded by a military aid. Yes. And a status quo, they are. They've done thorough impacting on how this aid is bad. But what they didn't prove is if aid is removed, they will still acquire the same weapons through trade because of a few reasons that I did not disprove. One, Saudi Arabia is rich. They can use oil money to get the arms they need. Two, these are strongmen who control states, and therefore they have an incentive to build alliances and therefore still give them arms. And three, they can literally build their own weapons. North Korea is not rich, have a low GDP, but it can force people into building nukes anyway. So that is parallel when it comes to harms and the human rights impacting they thoroughly do about how they want to start wars with authoritarian regimes. What they don't answer to is like Kurds and Albanians issues. They're very, very much in the minority will be popular enough that Americans will support humanitarian aid or their own men, their own son, their own uncles going into fight wars for them. That if they themselves say this is a very distant issue, very small issue, why they will do anything at all to peacekeeping these regions. Exactly. Because men, exactly. Because Americans don't want to sacrifice their own like soldiers, their own people. That's why they will do nothing for the Kurds and the Albanians want to establish Kosovo and like stateless minorities, terrorists are not fought and new states are not protected. Lastly, on proxy wars, they assert that ending wars are good, but the risk of prolonging war increases on their side when one accidental injury of an American soldier sent in versus just American money means you have to declare war on their side. But two, when do negotiations happen? Negotiation doesn't happen when one side is destroying the other side. They'll just eradicate them completely. It happens when two sides are close in terms of ability, equally funded, and therefore we want to find a way out before it gets out of hand. It comes when there's mutually assured destruction, that USA and China are both involved, and we don't want to erupt into World War III, and therefore we come to the negotiating table. They don't mechanize everything they want to talk about around negotiating wars. But lastly, it's that opposition says short wars are not necessarily good. Because short wars exist when the powerful destroys the powerless, that they don't need to negotiate. They don't even have a fighting chance. The existing structures of imbalance actualize in the fact that they will destroy those who are powerless. Those who are powerful will find their ways to start wars and get weapons.

Like, I don't understand why we have to do that. That escalates conflict in the same way that international military aid does. We did say that we supported mechanisms like intelligence sharing, peacekeeping, and joint training. And sure, I agree with Op. This is not a magic wand to stop conflicts. But neither is bankrolling war, and they never explained why their side worked. Opposition gives them bombs that can blow up villages more efficiently, machine guns that will indiscriminately mow down civilians by accident, vast reserves of arms that actually end up strengthening terrorism because they can be used in the aftermath of war. That was the response we gave in Second that wasn't taken down. It was just an assertion that giving a country some guns will alleviate suffering, but actually we explained that this often precludes humanitarian aid through escalating conflicts, making it unsafe and undesirable to deliver that aid, which means more suffering for people on the ground when they're"

We just proved that it does more harm than good, and we went on this alone. But also, this was a weird burden for AAP to push on us, because if we prove that military aid creates and escalates conflict, we won't need to see millions of people die before we can ever resolve it. Secondly, then, on the nature of conflict. They keep talking about the Kurds, ignoring the fact that we framed out their main examples about things like rebel groups by explaining that military aid often never goes to non-state actors, as we said in third, because of the same accountability mechanisms that they explain in first off, and because of the risk of alienating allies such as Turkey by funding rebel groups or funding the Kurds. They're powerless, the powerless here that remain powerless, but the oppressors, which are the governments actually get strengthened. Like even if they say that they will somewhat go after minorities either way, like they have more accurate machine guns, which is the example that opposition gives, but also billions more dollars to purchase bombers. So people get killed faster and in bloodier ways and to a far larger extent. We also give you structural analysis as to why the primary givers and recipients of aid would be problematic. Firstly, on strategic interests, that's why we give more money to Israel than the minority groups in Africa being persecuted by Boko Haram. It's because the US cares about one and not the other. Secondly, on economic aims, we have more to gain from Saudi Arabia or Turkey than by funding the Kurds, so we end up funding the actors that are oppressing them instead. But thirdly, we said that these conflicts often don't end because countries fund opposing sides, which means you don't end the conflict, you just escalate it and make it bloodier. So the end of the day, you escalate conflicts and you fund the oppressors, flipping the opposition case. We also brought up a claim about negotiation, which is when both sides are continuously bankrolled and enriched by state actors, you have no incentive to come to the table. Conflicts end far more slowly. I'd also like to bring our second point back up, which has still not been refuted after the entire opposition case. This is about leverage. We explained that some states like Qatar and the UAE fund opposite sides of the conflict in Somalia. You find the government, for example, and the other side funds Somaliland. These actors both want control over things like shipping routes in the Red Sea, so they actively fund the bombing of the other side. The same thing happens with Russia and Belarus, where it means that Crimea is far more vulnerable. They need to engage with our actual analysis about how we are only strengthening conflict and strengthening oppression onto vulnerable groups. Donors claim to be firefighters, but in reality, they're the arsonists."

We would say that these constitutional conventions would happen less often than an election cycle, but probably more frequent than a generation. If they want an exact window, we would say it's probably somewhere between the periods of 20 to 30 years. Secondly, the people framing these new constitutions or framing revised constitutions would consist of bodies of legislatures all the way up from the federal to local level, judges, executives, all members who make up a government. They'll propose, and if they're reasonably popular, they will agree upon and hand a new minted constitution for it to be ratified. Thirdly, the ratification burden is probably going to be the same as amendments on both sides of the House. For example, in the United States, that would be two-thirds of the Congress and three-fifths of the state."

Firstly, then, why are amendments insufficient in the status quo? Three important reasons. Firstly, because the perceived sanctity of constitutions in the status quo make it incredibly hard to create structural change. There's a societal belief that constitutions are holy, and it shields legitimate discourse. To say that whenever there is a mass shooting in America, we never have a discussion about whether or not it is actually right to enforce things such as gun ID laws because of the fact that there's an intrinsic resistance to changing the constitution or removing the second amendment. But on our side of the house, the comparative is that we employ higher standards to the constitution. We say that it isn't just you have to have a really, really huge reason, a huge social impetus as to why we should change the constitution, but rather you need to be able to actively defend the amendments and the clauses within the constitution. So it isn't just a thing about allowing to subside forever, but allowing it to be actively defended. But secondly, there exists a political trade-off in the status quo, which means there's little to no attention placed by politicians in terms of changing the constitution. There is no incentive to push amendments because politicians are inherently short-termists and they have other issues to care about. Their voters probably won't care if they can get a constitutional amendment through in the next like eight to ten years. And because of fact, there's a collective action problem. They find it incredibly hard and daunting that it's probably infeasible for them as a singular politician to be able to push through amendments or be able to push through some sort of proposal for that amendment. On our side of the house, what we do is we force discussion. We guarantee that at some point there is a reviewing and checking mechanism to say that even if there is no political incentive that exists, this is something that's important for the procedure of a country. And for that very reason, there is constant checks and balances. But thirdly, it's that the amendments in the status quo are incredibly tunnel vision. They look at specific clauses. They look at specific things. They look at specific issues rather than a comprehensive investigation of the Constitution on a whole. That means that when you have structural problems in the Constitution that make up not just like a singular clause, but about the structure of the government as a whole, for example, the Electoral Congress. These things never get looked at because they don't encompass the narrow scope of what happens in the status quo. On our side, we have a much more comprehensive vision to look at. Before I go on to why the constitution needs to be more representative, I'd be happy to take a POI. In case that these conventions have local particular issues, would the current provisions be preserved or would the current provisions be lost? Yeah, we think that maintenance is like a perfectly reasonable thing to happen on our"

If there's a conclusion to come by, there is there is nothing that should be changed firstly why do constitutions need to be more representative what is the intrinsic point of a constitution it is the framework that establishes the social contracts that governments and citizens abide by it establishes the values that your country support establishes the laws and procedures that establish a trade-off between individuals and the government implicit consent the tacit consent that you have in the status quo of being born into a country and paying taxes and following laws, is simply not good enough for the high burden of proof the government has to meet in order to make sure that people are consensually agreeing to that contract. Because at the point in which you give up your intrinsic rights to own, for example, land or to have, for example, anarchy, then that is the point in which there needs to be a much more active agreement from the citizens to the government, when that relationship needs to be much further cemented, because it is such a high-browder point in which you take people away from the state of nature. Why, then, do we have better generational consent on a whole? The first is that it's continuous. Every single contract has a term. Every single contract has an expiration date. The reason why this is the case is because values are constantly updating, because individuals do not foresee what they're going to care about in the next 10 to 30 years in the same way that a country cannot foresee what their values will be in the next 50 to 100 years. So to that extent, then, it is incredibly important that every single person who is born into society at some point in their life has the ability to have a say in how the government works virtually by voting in their congressman and legislator who support these sorts of bills and support these type of proposals. To that degree, then, we better uphold that generational consent when every single person, no matter where you're from, no longer has to rely off of the arbitrary framings of some people who were born 200 years before you. But secondly, it's demographics. The people who wrote the constitutions are just implicitly, like,"

That's why it's incredibly important, then, that these shifting demographics are represented by new legislative bodies, by new judiciaries, by new executive branches. But thirdly, it's that people's ideologies update, and to that very degree, that needs to be represented. I think this is enough to win us this debate on face because the fact is the principle of a constitution is what first and foremost to uphold the rights of citizens and if those people get a say in it then we win on that clash alone."

                "text": "But secondly why do we make the constitution more modern? The characterization here is incredibly clear. The constitutions are intrinsically archaic because they are written hundreds and hundreds of years ago. They're much more likely to be conservative because the values then were less progressive. Their language likely to be outdated because people back then literally could not predict the types of social contexts that we live in now. Why do we make this better? And why are these issues so important? Firstly, because we incorporate a modern context of modern issues into the new signings and new frames of the constitution because framers could not foresee the change in context, which is why, for example, when you look at the second amendment, it might apply for if you have muskets, for example, but the dynamics are completely changed when you talk about automatic weapons like AK-47s and how that changes the relationship between a militia and a government. When you look at the right to search and seizure, for example, that might be incredibly clear in a world in which the only thing you own lived inside your house. But now when we have a digital space, how much right do you have to your own information and How much right do you have to your own privacy in that digital setting? These terms all need to be updated because in the absence of that updation, you get an incredibly ineffective constitution on a whole. When we have new concerns that we have to worry about, things such as global terrorism, things such as cybersecurity, these fundamentally question the nature of the state and what the responsibilities are in the protection of individuals. To that degree, then, these new issues need to be taken into consideration when looking at the way that we frame our society on a whole. The comparative is, on their side of the house, what they do is force broad interpretations of the Constitution. It means they give the judiciary a lot of power in this sense because of the fact that there is incredibly inspecific clauses in the Second Amendment about how we should deal with the modern context of firearms, for example. To that degree, then, it is incredibly unrepresentative because it's nine individuals who you never voted for, who you never elected, who have no incentive to please the popular demand. But secondly, it means that they get to make their decisions in the ivory tower based on what they feel the current situational context is without us having a say in it. But secondly, it's also the semantics of it, right? The fact that the Constitution is written in incomprehensible language sometimes, and you cannot resurrect Thomas Jefferson and ask him what he meant. The fact that the Second Amendment literally changes depending on whether or not you thought a smudge was a comma is in and of itself a terrible thing to do. Because at the point in which we're worrying about the individual decisions that people made back then, these grammatical errors that change the way that we live, that's an incredibly arbitrary metric to base a society off of, which is why we don't allow those individual errors and those individual mistakes and clauses to be cemented forward, but rather we individually come to agreement every generation to say what is best for them. We would say that tyranny is allowing a contract you never signed to be beholden to, incredibly proud to propose."

Their model seems like the perfect recipe at best for a deadlock, at worst for political chaos the media can make a spectacle of. Laws that are only valid for four years already create mayhem in the status quo. Imagine how much tension and polarization will arise from something that will last 20 to 30 years when it's something that's constantly happening.

The reason they haven't done this is because progressive policies in the status quo benefit from the solidity and egalitarianism within the constitution, like bodily autonomy to maximize the right to abortion and egalitarian principles that allow LGBTQ plus members to sue people when they're discriminated against. More importantly, they never proved why people who will make these constitutions every 20 years will be equitable representative people. Because for just like to clarify, we are in a situation where populism is on the rise. The right wing is growing. I don't understand why they cannot suddenly claim that the people who will make this are going to be progressive people who will create good policies.

                "text": "up to that. Now, moving into my first argument on why most constitutions are good as is, and on their side, you achieve nothing but risking the loss of what we already have. But firstly, why are the vast majority of current constitutions very egalitarian? Four independent mechanisms to this. Firstly, historically, all constitutions have been written by liberals. There are structural reasons as to why this is true. Constitutions emerge in newly established democracies. That means they are written after the overthrow of absolute leaderships like monarchies or like dictators. Think about the US founding fathers or Thorbecke in the Netherlands. The ones establishing the constitutions are the ones who were successful in disempowering absolute leaderships in favor of democracy. They are the ones who believe everyone is equal, everyone is worth the same, and everyone should receive the same opportunities. Given the context in which democracies are formed, their clauses are there to ensure the equitable treatment of everyone. That means people who shape the constitution on our side are more likely to be representative than arbitrary people on their side. For example, the European liberal revolutionists of 1748 across Europe, liberals took control and created broadly egalitarian constitutions. Think about Spain, Prussia, Belgium, a bunch of places. Second independent mechanism. In the historical context of new states, where a political elite has just been disempowered, there was simply not an elite that could simply empower themselves because no one had the political control to do so. Thus, to actually have a constitution be passed, these founders need to appease many groups and thus end up with broadly egalitarian laws that are representative. But thirdly, given the high threshold of changing a constitution on our side, the only clauses that are changed are the bad ones that have allowed democracy to fail. They represent how we have learned from our mistakes. For example, after the Holocaust, Germany established eternity clauses to ensure the same thing doesn't happen again. Bad clauses lead to bad outcomes, which is why they are already eradicated, given these constitutions are ever-growing. Anything new you implement has not gone through that growth and that checking barrier, which is why they're more likely to be worse, especially when they don't have the time to mature or grow because they're constantly being changed. Fourthly, these constitutions are built have the time to mature or grow because they're constantly being changed. Fourthly, these constitutions are built up over time to represent universal moralities and not subjective preferences that come and go with the momentum in the political landscape. Therefore, they are much more a product of universal morals that apply throughout time and not only what is convenient in a certain snippet of time. The reason Trump was never able to blatantly discard minorities the way he would have liked to is because of clauses in the U.S. Constitution that states everyone gets equal rights. On the proposition side of the house, if the fixed change period happens during a radical presidency with a political right-wing majority, you risk losing important constitutional values that ensure human rights are followed. Think about every time you elect a Supreme Court justice, but it happens to be during a red presidency, right? Especially with the rise of populism and growing polarization and animosity, it is vital we do not allow the momentum of radical movements to override the one barrier we have that overthrows non-egalitarian policies. Given these constitutions are good, it's good that they are difficult to change. It's good they can't be overthrown, and it's good we cement them in our society. Every LGBTQ plus lawsuit has leaned on this constitution to gain legitimacy, to be enacted, to receive justice. Through these reasons that firstly, the people who set up constitutions are egalitarian people. Secondly, the flaws in bad constitutions are organically amended and improved through time, which you lose on their side when it's that short term. But thirdly, that they are more inherently more representative of universal moralities like human rights, rather than what would be decided at arbitrary times in politics. How does this affect this debate? Firstly, the arguments rely on the assumption that most constitutions are bad. Given we've proven they're good, their case has no tangible merit. The better the constitution is now, the less you achieve by changing it. Secondly, given the constitution, it's currently creating positive impact, you risk losing that, in the chat please, on-site prop when you can allow temporary surges and like xenophobic political majorities to overturn good clauses we already have. Those risks of unwriting are not likely to be worth it. Moving into my second substantive on how constitutional development over time is crucial. What does this look like? We think in the current amendment structure, the constitution adapts itself and improves itself, and more importantly, strengthens itself. This happens in a few ways. Firstly, the institution centered around it. Think about parliaments, courts, executive officers. They define themselves as well in relationship to each other. There's only so much a constitution can do when it comes to dividing power in the government or limiting the power of each office. The strong division of power is largely set up by limited constitutional provisions, but by court precedent, internal legislation, and unwritten principles. For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court Madison case in which they established the principle of judicial review, i.e. the right and duty of federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws. This was a power not defined or constrained in the constitution, but one that developed over time and is now central to keeping other branches in check. Secondly, we tell that their provisions of the constitution also develop as courts interpret them and set important precedent. This is why many countries in the provision that was passed as a means of establishing equality between all white property-owning men is now the provision on which equality for people of all genders, races, sexual orientations is based. That means even if the constitution itself doesn't change through amendments, people interpret them differently, which is vital for setting precedent. For all these reasons, we urge you to oppose. Thank you."

And lastly, why we are principally winning this debate firstly on the comparison because basically their argumentation is that longevity is good two things one most things are universal morals as they characterize which means these politicians wouldn't go through the unnecessary process of opposing it if it's something that's universally recognized like for instance we should have votes one person one vote everyone has an equal voice. Everyone gets free speech. If these are such universal morals as they characterize that are good, then no politician would go through the effort of going against something that's widely recognized and change the constitution. So the very backbones they talk about, like electoral processes, won't be messed up on our side of the house. But two, if longevity is so good and the original constitution is so well written, they need to tell you why they support amendments in the status quo or proposing laws to counteract things in the constitution. Because if they think it is so perfect and like permanence is the most important thing, why do they also have mechanisms to change the constitution? They need to resolve that contradiction on their side of the house. The next day they talk to you, I would say that there's going to be a tyrannical abuse of the system where politicians like Trump are going to shape politics. There are a few things I want to note. Firstly, that is a contradiction to their case because they shape politics and characterize politicians in vastly different ways. On one hand, on their side of the house, politicians wouldn't be abusive at all and will use the legal system to forward positive change. Versus on our side, they're suddenly so abusive that they're going to institute undemocratic measures the second they're given this chance to change. So they need to choose if politicians are good or bad on their side of the house. But two, they don't respond to the two accountability mechanisms that came out of our model. Firstly, that is a very, very balanced bipartisan board. And therefore, it's not going to be abused by one side when they politically win. Because this includes the legislature, which currently the House is held by one party. And the Senate is literally held by the other party. They include the judges, which is literally split on a 5-4 mark in the status quo. And they include the executives as well. So in aggregate, it balances out the two parties influences and therefore no quote-unquote bad it's going to be too great but two the threshold of passing something is so high it's not just a simple majority it's an overwhelming majority and the status quo where it's a two-third majority and therefore it's not going to be abused just because you won one election but moreover what"

Versus currently, if there's a constitutional convention right now, they're going to receive pressure from the social movements that currently exist, not just the ones that existed in 7076. And therefore, the hashtag MeToo movement will make sure that they make the politicians realize you have to include something explicitly about gender. That's where the link to Roe versus Wade is going to be something that's way more concrete. And it's about women and men deserve equal rights. And therefore, it's unlikely to be overturned. So with regards to changes like probability and permanence, we win when we get more updated constitutions in this sense, and it's influenced by social movements. But we already proved to you why their mechanisms of change all get better on our side of the house. They want to rely on the legislature. They want to rely on the judiciary. But the problem is when you only have one issue being voted in an amendment process like the conservative senators are unlikely to swing and help you because that means they're literally showing their devotion and commitment to the democrats versus they're more like a left-wing slide when it's an overall convention like revising and re-examining everything because that means it's a necessary part of compromise or they're hiding in a crowd and therefore they can like even more easily sway that moral responsibility when it's not a tunnel vision of a single issue and therefore let these conservative progressive policies pass but secondly there's a mechanism they do not rebut under this argument which is discussion just got way better for all social movements for all activists for all progressive individuals because currently the right wing can easily say gun rights should be upheld because it was written in the constitution that abortion and everything just saying it's that is quote not get progressed because it's written in the constitution we don't push them further and demand for extra justification or actual reasons as to why they oppose for women having their choices all they need to say is this document is very very like holy because it's say the same since the foundation of histories of our nation and because of the heritage we don't need to explain to you anything else we get rid of that sanctity when we like regularly revise this constitution and show you it's a living document, which pushes the right wing to say more. This at least makes the left wing way more compelling and gets rid of a positive tool used by the right wing to shut down discourse with the left wing, and therefore discussions for progressive politics get much better."

The fact that there are just archaic mechanisms that we don't question. The fact that the electoral college is just this way because that's the way things have been done. But right now, this is the difference on the two sides of the house. Amendments will only occur when there's an obvious glaring problem, but that is already too late. That means the glaring problems have already shaped our politics in a negative way. It's so much so that everyone feels versus our side of the house, we upgrade the burden of the politicians. You can't just prove to me why something should be changed. You need to also justify maintaining something in these every two years, that even staying the same is something you need to rethink about. And like, we make you think about it again and double check if this is what you want. And this is where we're more likely to keep good policies and get rid of the ones that are going to become glaring problems down the line. This is where we're going to become better because we upgrade the threshold of discussions for the right wing. We upgrade the threshold of maintenance and we better society as a whole. But lastly, even if you don't believe what we're saying about politics and progressive policies, we win in terms of the principle because this is a democracy and democracy is supposed to be run by the people."

The fact that your ancestors shouldn't be opting you into a political system when you don't even have the chance to shape the backbone of it as they characterize. Why are you forced to live in the society if you don't have control over the very definition of it? And lastly, the fact that demographics, such as the progressive demographics, are not even going to be things that are considered when the very framers in history are writing this constitution. The fact that they don't know this would happen means they don't have the knowledge to write and represent you. This means you're forced into obeying something that you never even signed. You're forced to surrender your monopoly over violence and self-autonomy to obey laws, even though you don't know what was going to happen back then. You have no control over this process. That is why all contracts have a term of expiration, because you have to revisit the terms when you have better information and when you have changed as a person over time. They don't respond to that, which means they impose rules onto individuals and they get rid of the consent of the government.

Firstly, this idea that amendments are just insufficient in the status quo and are hard to change. I have two responses. Number one, know that we've already told you, most of the time it is just unnecessary. The Constitution is something that is supposed to be timeless and reflect basic needs. The fact that they constantly point out these tiny little changes that need to be made already sort of proved on our side of the house that it's unnecessary. You need to go through the complete process of a constitutional convention, rather than oftentimes most of the ideas are things that deserve to be preserved and are things that are timeless. But secondly, constitutional conventions being easier to change is just not necessarily a good thing. They keep on saying, ah, we keep it modern. We change it every 20 years. But they've never proven to us any of the benefits. Note that amendments take time because you have, for example, things like committee hearings that takes a lot of time"

                "text": "because you want expert opinions, et cetera. The reason why it takes time is because you have proper procedures in which you are fundamentally changing the principles that everyone follows within your country. We think these are things that don't need to change every now and then, and there are good reasons for that. But onto their second argument on how they're just more representative. The first layer they give to us is this idea of how this, of the social contract and how it's unrepresentative. I'm just genuinely unsure why they are better to fulfill the social contract on their side of the house, given that it's still a small group of politicians that are likely to be elite writing this sort of new constitution. I'm unsure how this is any more representative, and given that it is still going to be elite writing this sort of new constitution. I'm unsure how this is any more representative. And given that, it is still going to be arbitrary forever if it's always still this random group of politicians writing it every couple of years. I think especially given that if you didn't elect those politicians ever, if you didn't ever consent to them writing it, I'm not sure why they're better able to fulfill that social contract. But secondly, on their idea of how this is written by very elite people in the past and aren't representative now. I think, sure, some, it may be written by very elite people, but oftentimes the principles are still timeless. Sure, like many years ago, the constitution was made for white men who owned property, but I think as time has progressed, the fact that these fundamental basic rights still went on, but now just apply to different people, regardless of your race, regardless of your sexuality, regardless of your religion. But the fact is, it's still preserved and things like the freedom of speech is still something that everyone deserves. Even if it was only like targeted to a small group of people, the fact that we have adapted now and change means something. So now what did we prove to you in our speech? Our first speaker, Anna, told you two things. Number one, the constitution is already good. We gave you structural analysis as to why this was. We told you there are trends of liberalization, oftentimes liberalism, in which these constitutions are created, but also that you just need to cater to a wide group of people when you're writing it. So oftentimes it is something that is already very equitable and nice, but even in the worst case, we told you we have checks and balances, such as amendments. The fact that all the time, most of the times, these are things like universal moralities, means these are just fundamental ideas of equality. And we think that's fair. What did they respond to? They said, firstly, if constitutions are so good, you just don't need amendments. I think this misses the nuances of our arguments, right? We told you a majority of the times, you don't need to change much given that they're already good, but that is especially the reason why you just don't need constitutional conventions. In their worst-case scenario, in which you might have a subclass that is still somewhat, like, problematic, I think that's something we can simply change with amendments on our side of the House, but the point is, this is generally good, and it's just unnecessary on their side. But the second thing they said to us was, ah, the constitutions are just problematic in general. I have a few responses. Number one, know that constitutions are not the only law in these states, right? So the enforcements are not always problematic. For example, the European Human Rights Convention can invalidate any European constitutions with inequitable clauses pertaining to human rights. That is to say, most of the time it's not invasive and it's just simply unnecessary that you need to go through this entire process of rewriting everything. But secondly, note that even if we debate on their grounds, it is just simply not worth it to change this. Political chaos is what you create. The fact that you prevent constitutional provisions and you weaken democracies are all things that are net harms on their side of the house, which is unnecessary given that like on their side, the small changes you need to make are something that's so"

                "text": "unimpactable. So then what was the second argument we told you? We told you that constitutional developments over time is crucial because on provisions on their side of the house will just change much more and therefore you have less checks and balances. But also, constitutions just get less strength when institutions know that they're going to constantly change. We told you what this means is that overall, you just lose out on these crucial developments that are needed for democracies. We never heard a response to this. I think this still stands. Before I move on, I'll take a point. Do you think it is likely that moderate Republicans would vote to repeal the 14th Amendment that gives equal rights to all citizens in America? Look, here's the problem with that, right? If you're talking about problems that would never change on either side of the House, I'm just not sure why you would fix that either. But I think what's unique about their case is when you do make constitutional conventions, you just create political chaos in which you lose out on the fundamental checks and balances we currently have. You lose out on the fundamental basic ideals. And overall, it's just unnecessary to begin with. So what is our third argument? We tell you this creates a dysfunctional media spectacle. We say currently when you compare conventions to amendments, they're very different in terms of the attention they get. We say constitutional conventions attract far more attention. Even in the 18th century, when a constitutional convention was held to establish the Bill of Rights in Philadelphia, that was already a huge media spectacle. Given nowadays, in the current day and age of sort of like social media and digitalization, we see the size of this is going to be a far bigger spectacle. Note that this is a group of politicians gathering together from all over the country, and therefore, realistically, the convention will not take too long, a couple weeks probably at most. But this is also something in which you're making big changes, where you fundamentally change the principles that a country governs with. We see comparatively, amendments gather far less attention, because these are changes made over a period of time that is usually quite a long period of time, meaning it's less exciting. But also these are committing theories that just don't get attention because you involve a lot of experts and you talk a lot and discuss about these changes. We say what this is likely to create is a media spectacle on their side of the house. This is reporters waiting outside of your discussion room. This is cameras televising your decisions. This is media recording and writing down your every move. And we think the effect of this is twofold. Number one, simply just more political polarization. When the media makes a spectacle, they tend to write the most eye-catching headlines and twist words so that the stories are shocking. We say this is likely to worsen the divides between two political parties or two sides, given that the media now forces themselves into this discussion, and therefore you're able to heighten a lot of the conflicts and tensions that already exist but secondly we say politicians start acting the way they want to be televised not the parts they create not necessarily how they can create the best constitution so you pass things based on appearance rather than how it functions because note that if you stand against a group you will be blamed and seen as controversial if you vote with the group you're just unlikely to be blamed. An example of this is the Stolen Valor Act, in which someone in the U.S. wanted to pass a law that criminalized people becoming veterans. This clearly violated an individual's right to free speech, yet was passed because politicians didn't want to seem unpatriotic. We think this is problematic on their side of the house. When you constantly involve the media, this is something you don't get with amendments. I think we win this debate."

If that constitution is so good and that constitution won't be changed at the convention, people will agree with it. The politicians will say, you know, this is a good constitution. It's representative. Therefore, we want to maintain it. So even if the original document is good, we can have that benefit on all sides of the house as well."

But second, given that you have a plurality of politicians, amendments against the most extreme policies won't happen on our side of the house as well. So this debate isn't about like the freedom of speech, but rather it is about the more controversial parts of the Constitution. There's like the Second Amendment, which is the right to bear arms in the United States, or the Eighth Amendment that used to be an Irish constitution, which banned people's right to an abortion. But thirdly, there's a contradiction in their case, because on one hand, they say organic change is good. But on the other hand, they say that politicians are subject to short-term whims. If their case is true, and you believe their response to our case, which is that politicians are short-termists and that politicians will do crazy radical things, it's unclear as to why that they can stand for amendments and organic change on their side of the house as well."

No. First, which side is more democratic? They say that the original constitution is great because the founding fathers of almost every single country are liberal. Three responses. One, if it's great, then we can maintain it on our side of the house. Two, we think that we don't reject their premise that all founding fathers are liberal and that all revolutionaries are liberal. Conservatives can also find countries in the same way that liberals can. If conservatives think that the status quo is too liberal, they can revolt for the same reason that liberals revolt, which is that the status quo is too conservative, right? Use their own example, the revolutions in 1848, right? The precursor to those revolutions in 1848 was the Asia-Mediterranean, in which you had a conservative backlash towards the French Revolution, in which like the European monarchs got together and basically said, when do you curtail future revolutions? So it just isn't true that all revolutions are liberal, and therefore all constitutions are liberal. But third, and this is the most important response, is that the liberals that they want to talk about that wrote constitutions 200 years ago are incredibly, incredibly conservative by today's standards. The reason why is because political beliefs and preferences shape or change over time, right? We are exposed to more information, our opinions change over time. This is why the founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson were slave owners. And this is also true in Ireland, for instance, in which the Eighth Amendment prohibits a woman's right to an abortion. Because of their mechanism as to why constitutions were good 200 years ago, is that they have to appeal to the broader members of society. That broad society 200 years ago was defined by white property owners. In the status quo, that broad society is defined by a plurality of people from different creeds, from different races, and from different ethnicities. So if anything, our constitution was more representative. In short, in their best case scenario, this constitution is great. That constitution will be maintained through conventions. In their worst case scenario, if this constitution has problems in it, we're able to fix it on our side of the house. But let me now attack their counter proposition."

If you think that politicians cannot be good at a constitutional convention, it's unclear as to why politicians will be good when they do organic change on the US side of the house. But second, this organic change, if you really want to talk about it, is empowered on our side of the house. Because on our side of the house, the organic evolution of the constitution that they talk about is a guarantee, the point at which you have to renew the Constitution every 30 or 40 years at the Constitutional Convention. Whereas on theirs in the House, there might be organic change, but there also might not be. Because Eddie tells you that politicians care about the short term. They care about passing laws. They care about imminent issues. They're not thinking about the Constitution in the short term, which means that the organic change that they talk about is empowered on ours in the House, and we can guarantee it by cementing periodic constitutional conventions."

I am happy to accept that in our worst case scenario, politicians will get it wrong, right? That politicians might do stupid things to the Constitution. Insofar as that is the case, and insofar as politicians can also do great things to the Constitution, that tie and that deadlock is broken when you look at the question of representation. Because our status quo is a lot more representative than theirs. The point where politicians in the status quo have the power to the interests of the voters in the status quo was in contrast, the people who founded the Constitution in the past did not have the power to the voters and the interests of the present. And furthermore, I would also note that people who like vote constitution were elected, right? They won a war. They weren't elected. So it's unclear why they had the approval of the people then as well, right? What does that mean? Is that even if you have bad change or even if you have good change, that is regardless because we have better representation in the House. Furthermore, we also told you how the social contract is only legitimate in the House, but people continuously sign and approve it instead of it being a once and for all generation in conclusion our system was more representative and therefore we ensure democracy second on a political process the first thing i want to do is engage with the argument they say that will cause a media spectacle like that's an argument against everything right it's an argument against supreme court cases because they report on supreme court cases it's an argument against elections because every election is a media spectacle like i would say that like media spectacle isn't that bad of a thing because the media was designed to keep politicians in check if the media is recording their conversations politicians are likely to conduct their mannerisms in a way that is popular with their voter bases because the media is checking on them unclear why that is a bad thing but they just don't respond to all the practical benefits we give you down the bench right the first thing to say is that even if change doesn't happen you get better discourse on all sides of the house the we give you down the bench, right? The first thing to say is that even if change doesn't happen, you get better discourse on all sides of the house. The reason why you get that better discourse is because the Constitution is seen as less salient and sankient on all sides of the house. When the right to bear arms in the United States isn't seen as an entrenched right that is holy, but rather as something that is subject to constant debate and discussion, that is a point at which Republicans can't just say you should have guns because of the right to bear arms. That's when they have to give you logical, concrete reasons as to why they should be right to bear arms. And those reasons have to be given at these constitutional conventions. So even if there isn't change, you get a better political system, the point when politicians have to present arguments defending and refuting each part of the controversial constitution. Before I move on, yes, your POI. In your world, how can you protect individual rights given that you don't have sufficient court procedures and legal certainty? We can, no, we can protect individual rights because in order for you to pass anything in a huge legislative body, you need the appeal of the vast, vast majority of individuals. But like court procedures aren't exclusive to your side of the house as well, right? Like the judiciary can still exist on our side of the house if they want to do things, they're able to enact against that. of the house if they want to do things they're able to um they're able to um like enact against that but the other thing i want to know is what exactly is the comparative on their side of the house because on their side of the house as society progresses the constitution becomes increasingly vague so the right to free speech that was written in a context in which the social media age did not exist the right to bear arms was written in a context in which assault weapons can't kill a whole school of children, right? Therefore, these rights, because they're so vague, they leave the interpretation up to justices, which are sometimes good, but are also problematic because those justices were simply not elected. So yes, the justices in the Supreme Court did support Brown versus Board of Education, but they also supported Plessy versus Bogus in 50 years prior, which legitimized and legalized discrimination based on race in the first place. So justices might get it right or wrong, and justices might get it right. Those benefits are inconclusive and symmetrical to both sides of the House. But a unique difference is that, one, we're able to check those justices in a democratic manner, the point in which the people as a whole are able to say yes or say no to the Constitution. So even if we don't get positive change, the system on our side of the house is a lot more democratic. But furthermore, we also tell you that those justices are inherently biased because those justices come from very elite backgrounds. Those justices, because you need to be rich in order to go to law school, that is also a reason why the minorities don't get represented in the justice system. Whereas in contrast, politicians need to cater to minorities because the vast majority of society today is not racist. In order to win an election, politicians need to cater to minorities because the vast majority of society today is not racist. In order to win an election, you need to cater to a coalition of people. So white farmers, Black, I don't know, Black middle class and the white middle class, right? That coalition of people you need to cater to is the reason as to why the Constitution is likely to be more reflective. Our side will get things wrong and our side will get things right. But the reason why you vote for us is because you get the continued consent of the government. I am very proud of our post."

They talk about the importance of representation, but still they say, well, if not a two-thirds majority agrees on scrapping a particular provision, then we're going to maintain it. They said in reply to my POI in their first speech. I mean, then you don't really want representation either, right? Then they say, well, we have to liberalize and modernize. But they still allow a one-third minority to prevent liberalization or modernization of constitutions. Again, they want to have their cake and eat it. We say that's a strategic error. We were very clear. We say most constitutions are currently good. We would like that they wouldn't be changed unless those changes are so uncontroversial that they would already happen in the status quo. We see a much clearer stance in that regard."

Otherwise, they take an enormous risk for a very small potential benefit. And second second even if they prove that current constitutions are broadly bad they have to prove that they have better change than we have at our side but first let's outframe the principle in this debate they say that they want to maintain generational consent and that just tacit consent is not enough two responses first as a model mechanism mismatch if they allow a if they allow a one-third minority of a generation to maintain constitutional provisions, then they have equally no generational consent as our side, because they only allow provisions of the constitution to be scrapped if there's a two-thirds majority in favor of scrapping them. Therefore, I think that would at best be uncomparative. But we also don't think this is a standard we hold any set of laws to. We don't review treaties every 20 years. Regular laws are not reviewed every 20 years. Therefore, we're unsure if constitutions uniquely need this generational consent that no other set of laws needs. That is something that they were unable to prove. Therefore, I think that principle"

                "text": "falls out of the debate. Let's look at the quality of constitutions in the status quo. The BM says that constitutions are often archaic because they've been written by old people. We say, on the one hand, it ignores the historic context in which they were written, which we'll get to later, but second, it ignores the way that constitutions are written, in the sense that constitutions often write about principles rather than very specific provisions. So even if they aren't as specific, and in that sense not as specifically applicable to the status quo, the principles that underlie these constitutional provisions often don't change. Often these are broadly good principles, and therefore we support that. Then we say, in our era, that constitutions are broadly good, because these constitutional democracies, the constitutions that were written, are often good, because first of all, they're often liberal authors. Notice the people that overthrew a monarchy and created a constitutional democracy because this debate takes place in constitutional democracies. Therefore, these are often liberals. Well, they say, well, but these people aren't liberal by modern standards. But that again ignores the way constitutions are written. Sure, they still believe in equality for all people. Yet they wrote classes that ensured equality, and these principles were later extended to more people. Given that constitutions are written about principles, given that these liberal others were broadly based on liberal principles, therefore we can simply extend those principles to more people. Second, we say that it was often, and that's something they were unresponded to, that after these absolute monarchs etc. were overthrown, there's a lack of a political elite that could simply take power. That's why the constitution had to be written in a way that broadly appealed because the political elite was just defeated. There was no political elite to take power. Thirdly, we can simply, the really wrong clauses can be amended. That's why broadly no wrong clauses exist anymore because they have been long amended. We also say there's development over time. That's why we uniquely have more universal values than just the values that the current political majority agrees on. And fifth, there are simply treaties that even if a constitution has a really bad clause, there are broadly treaties that would take care of those. By the way, I think that this is the most important clause because one, it broadly marginalizes proposition case. Insofar that if the current constitutions are actually quite good, then any potential benefit they have of making them better is much smaller than they frame it to be. But second, that it increases the inherent risks, I see your POIs, it increases the inherent risks of conventions. Insofar that the moment that these constitutions are already good and you lose parts of those constitutions in those conventions because you create a media spectacle that's the moment that you lose incredibly benefits that we have on our side they say well but all these very important classes are bipartisan but i think it ignores the fact that there are broad that are broad political groups that don't actually agree sure no one's going to reinstate slavery that's not what the debate is about but i think there are important things about gender equality etc that are often written in constitutions that are certainly not the sort of broad political support for in all countries. Therefore, we say that's a risk they take at their side. But I'll take a PY. Yeah. So if constitutions are as good as you say, is that a value judgment you can make or if it's something that people should vote on and decide"

I think they ignore, we say, if a majority of people want to reinstate slavery, we say that's wrong. We say constitutions uniquely exist to restrict the will of a political majority because we recognize that representation is not the only value that should underpin our judgment on laws. Individual rights exist even if the majority believes that certain individuals are not entitled to rights such as freedom, such as equality. Therefore, we say the constitutions shouldn't be as representative of current political will, but that it is fine if they restrict. That's uniquely why we have a constitution rather than just only regular laws. Okay, let's talk about the change of constitution. They say that amendments are insufficient for two reasons. First, they say there's a belief of holiness around these classes that prevents us from changing them. We say that we don't necessarily disagree, but we're actually seeing it as a good thing because it works both ways. Sure, there might be some provisions that they dislike that become harder to change because of the belief of holiness. Similarly, there are a lot of constitutions that we very much like. In fact, we say most constitutions are probably good that are more unlikely to be changed the moment there is the belief of holiness. And then you say it's simply too much effort for politicians to change a constitution. Look, if there's an important amendment, obviously you're going to change it, even if it's an effort, because you're a path to popularity. And politicians can work together, co-sponsorship also happens with regular laws. Then we say, on the other hand, that we uniquely have constitutional development over time, even if there are no amendments. It's a part of"

Look at the Madison case of the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted themselves the right to constitutional review, thereby holding other branches in check. We also say uniquely precedent of courts develops itself. Look at Brown v. Board of Education in which the educational segregation was ended. They say, well, judges are not representative. First of all, we say, as I explained, the representative is not relevant. We're talking about protecting backbone rights. But second, we say that judges are the way of more likely to protect individual rights than politicians. First of all, judges are often well-educated people that tend to be more liberal, tend to be more protective of individual rights. Second, they are not subjective to populist ways. Note that that uniquely targets the most vulnerable, because even if you're incredibly vulnerable and people don't want you to have individual rights, politicians won't grant you judges' will. But they're not simply a feeling of duty. Broadly, judges feel a duty to protect the Constitution. That's why even the very conservative Supreme Court now rejected an appeal to Anne Drophy Raid by Luciana just like two months ago. But even if you don't believe any of that, we saw a third argument you explained because of media surrogates. We say if you look at how elections are surrogates now, that's what you get. Political polarization, where you don't pass any of the reforms they want, it becomes show those politicians that pass bad laws because they think that makes them popular, that they don't have to take a stance against those laws, we say incredibly proud to oppose."

Constitution outlines most basic rules as to how you surrender over your autonomy and your freedoms. And if that isn't even up to the scrutiny of yourself and accountability, we don't know what should be. And that is the difference that they do not engage. So just on the fact that we don't impose things under the consent of the governed, we win. But secondly, let's talk about politics. The first thing I want to note is that all problems they identified undercut their very own case about organic change through courts, organic change through legislature, because if they say politicians are bad and abusive and racist, that's exactly why the legislature can just pass the Muslim ban, or Trump can issue decrees equally on their side. When they say there's going to be pushback from conservatives, when 51% of people wake up and want to persecute minorities, they can do so by imposing laws of segregation again, and they want to dirty the house as well. It is all equally symmetrical. So why does this problem actually not apply to our policy and not apply to the Constitution? It's exactly because of the lack of POI response we got from second speaker that would the Republicans nowadays just get rid of the 14th Amendment that gave everyone equal rights. They said it wouldn't change, which shows you that because of the fact that constitutions outline very universal principles as they characterize, that it is usually going to be sustained in most cases as well. So if it's good, if it ain't broke, we wouldn't fix fix it either but the difference is they can see that there are some cases in which things should be fixed and therefore they have amendment practices in place as well to propose amendments so if we prove to you that in these cases where things need to change amendments are insufficient we get those better changes that are actually needed and that's why we win we told you why it's into fiction one because on their side of the Constitution seems too holy, seems too permanent, and therefore amendments will get huge push-packs automatically. Two, the fact that the political efficiency of proposing a single amendment is not worth it versus we force them to do this on our side of the house. These are reasons why amendments are not enough. But moreover, they don't address our mechanisms. They just say LGBTQ individuals or women can sue. Yes, but when they're suing, they get a more direct amendment if current day social movements can pressure to include women in the Constitution and not cite a very tenuous link from the right to searches and seizures that can be overturned any day. Suing and all these mechanisms get better on our side of the House. We think that on their side, this is not just about progressive policies either. There are archaic questions that don't answer. Why the Electoral College is still relevant? Why are gun laws still should be the same when AK-47s came about? and why is the current legislature on privacy in the constitution enough when the internet exists they're all cake things that I do not address and we need to keep up with the times lastly on discussion like they think it's going to be made a spectacle because of televization and therefore polarized one very symmetrical to passing laws in the legislature that they support but two it is good because if we get spotlight onto gun rights and abortion debates, it is good because debates become better on our side of the house as well, and we actually lend spotlight to these good debates. They don't respond why the right wing can't just cite the Second Amendment like they do in a status quo because the Second Amendment is not an automatic good. We're revisiting the Second Amendment, and therefore we present real arguments, not just assertions from the past. Constitutions have always been the political will of the people. On their side, it is the will of anyone who happened to be in a tennis court in the French Revolution and the will of Virginian politicians during 1783. Versus on our side, it is the will of everyone. We can scrutinize and check it every 20 years. So mistakes will be inevitably made at some point. At least we have the time to fix it. We're so proud to propose."

At the top of my speech, I want to note four points of framing. First of all, what do we think that this is likely to look like? Note for A, that this is going to be amendment-like changes to the Constitution, whereby they are rewritten periodically over time from 30 to 50 years, and the comparative that they have to support is frequent minor amendments that change them semi-frequently. Note then that the Constitution forms a guiding principle toward the way that laws are formed. On our side, we think that that ought to be updated frequently. Secondly, that this happens on like a three-fourth basis, similarly to how it does under status quo. On their side, they have to defend things like Supreme Court justices and constitutional courts being the individuals that make these kinds of decisions. Thirdly, that this is likely to be done through delegates of certain bodies, i.e. religious, political, or regional bodies, similar to how constitutions were originally drafted in the past. Fourthly, note that most people are happy with the foundation and they're not likely to support constant change. So instead, we think this is likely to be minor things like enshrinement of past laws or creation of new things to keep up to date with newer social standings, i.e. things like technology,"

One, that politicians are somewhat interested in the good of the country. This is because they as individuals are incentivized to be good so that they can, A, upkeep somewhat decent legacies within their specific political parties, but secondly, many of them want to run in the future and they need that good reputation, that good perception from the public to be able to maintain and get by. But secondly, that you're likely to elect good people because it could go horribly wrong in future. This is why the US did not change the number of Supreme Court justices in their state, because they were fearful that this damages the existing democratic structures in such a way that leaves the country some sort of failure as a state. Secondly, thirdly and finally, what does this mean for our case? One, we think that opposition cannot run a case talking about how we get no change and radical change at the same time. We think if they do that in terms of responsive work, then they're largely going to contradict and undermine the mechanisms. But secondly, it means that our stance is simple. We think democracy on our side is most functional, not only for the people, but also for the principles that it ought to abide by. We want to forward three arguments in support of that. One, that we get better constitutional creation on our side. Two, that we get better democratic engagement from the people. And thirdly, that we create less reliance on things like precedent. Before moving on, I'll take your point of clarity. You're at the same time saying that you're only going to change commonsensical things that most people agree with so what what is the fundamental difference between this and just changing them on our side when most people already agree so one i'll explain to you why an argumentation but briefly we think that you're going to do more than just change like minor things that people agree on because it's quite difficult to do things like make amendments that create entirely new clauses in the constitution or do things like enshrinement within the constitution and outside becomes substantially easier and i'll explain why in my substantive first argument then on why we"

One, that it enshrines, that it upholds largely old values because of the times that they were made. The U.S. Constitution is roughly 100 years old. The reason this becomes problematic is because the kinds of problems that they faced at the time were nowhere near to the same as the kinds of problems we face now. Now we have to ask ourselves questions about things like AI and whether or not tanks constitute as weapons of arms, whereas at the time they had more simplistic things to worry about. Secondly, that we face new societal or economic problems because the economy has become substantially more complicated as we've progressed, the way that it interacts with society has changed and the needs that we face in terms of social progress have changed. Thirdly, let's note that there are different cultural contexts within which manifest themselves in terms of a language and ambiguity within that. So you have things like really difficult to interpret things. But secondly, note that when you frame and talk about the problems within the constitution, you oftentimes change the narratives and notions surrounding them. And you cannot ask these individuals who created the constitution whether or not this is what they meant. Thus, you land up seeing really inconsistent applications thereof. Note this is harmful because it creates control. This is the thing that controls laws and rights on all sides. So when you have the underlying premise of how your country is functioning being set up on a somewhat wishy-washy system, we think it's quite difficult for you to progress going forward. The way we change this goes twofold. One, we think that we get more constructive rewrites of the constitution because single amendments, as they have to defend on their side, are controlled by individuals like"

What that then means is when people are trying to create change, they're likely to be more accepting of these things and more willing to adapt. But secondly, we think that this idea of constitutional change, so just infrequent because they stole government function, this is because you need to do things like consultation or win over bipartisan voting on their side. On our side, what you do is you create things like committees or delegations that are dedicated to these things. But secondly, because it's an expected slowing down of your government, you give people the capacity to prepare for these things. So we think that you're more likely to be able to say, let's default back to the old one whilst this is changing. This isn't something that stresses us out. Thus, we're more open to the old one, whilst this is changing, this isn't something that stresses us out, thus we're more open to the notion of doing it. Why is this important? One, we think that self-defense in terms of democratic functioning occurs through the constitution, because it's an individual's primary mechanism of holding the government and the lawmakers accountable. Insofar as we weigh that up against any form of stability, we think giving people access to the idea that their government is something that can protect them from border state and the fact that they can engage politically far outweighs that. Thus, we get better constitutions on our side. Second argument then on democratic engagement. What we say is that democracy is largely problematic. People aren't buying into it as it's on the state score. We think it faces problems like populism and all sorts of things. We make that better three ways. One, we get a better connection to the constitution because things like language, things like We make that better three ways. One, we get a better connection to the constitution, because things like language, things like the time that it was made in, and the cultural context are now more directly connected to individuals. In South Africa, our constitution was made roughly 25 to 30 years ago, yet individuals already see problems as to how things like property laws are enshrined by them. They feel they disconnect the very thing that is designed to create a connection between them and the government. Secondly, the constitution feels more flexible and modern. This appeals to the trend that people think politics are an elitist or outdated and never changing space. Insofar as you show in the picture that this changes and their political vote means something, we then think that you create the idea that they can't buy into this. But secondly, this gives them the idea that they can now change the focus of the nation and make it determined on what society and the state wants. I.e., do you want your state to be focused on freedom and acceptance or other more dated ideals? What are the impacts of this? One, we get more individuals represented within our constitution. That means that people themselves feel like they can engage more frequently. Two, we reduce apathy because people no longer feel like democracy is determined by arbitrary things which were decided by old people hundreds of years ago. And they feel like they can make a change. But thirdly, there's less populism because now when people feel angry at the state, they no longer feel like they have to go riot and become radical towards one end or the next. They understand that these are things that can change over time. This is important because, A, we get more stability on our side, given the fact that people are more likely to buy into democratic systems. Two, it impacts every citizen within these states. And thirdly, the quality of change is great. On proposition, we think that changes in society need to be represented by changes in the Constitution. Never been prouder to propose."

People know that this is one particular challenge to have their voices heard and what they think should be the founding principles of this society, we can claim that.

Let's assess why that's not true. One, let's understand that laws themselves are capable of being repealed, which is innately very difficult. This makes it very difficult to make longstanding regulation. This is particularly exacerbated when we see instances like the US, where you have two-party systems or even multiple party systems, who are actively attempting to undermine the legacy of other individuals. We think that lasting practices, binding individuals to specific laws is necessary. Secondly, let's also understand that amendments and also their alternative are not sufficient. Why do we think that that is true? Because we think that at the point of which you're consistently amending something, you're still struggling to replace, and you said actively remove the harmful legislation, right? This means that even at their best, that their best harmful legislation, such as This means that even at their best, harmful legislation such as gun rights, allowing people to continue access, are still going to exist. They haven't shown us how that is going to exist, how that's going to be changed on their side, or how that's going to be changed on their side of the house. They literally contextualize why they haven't responded to us and why that's harmful. Because what we told you coming out of Proposition 1 was that it's essential for a representative society to occur with an ever-changing constitution note here at our worst we accomplish absolutely nothing except rewriting that constitution in itself this means that making it more accessible to the public maybe and making it much more conversation of discourse where people can see that the foundation of law that exists within the country is one that's built within your lifetime and actively feel represented within the government increasing buy-in to the ultimate government structures increasing the maximum output we get into democracy because people see themselves in the founding principles of their country but they don't actually understand how we get better institutions on the outside because they don't actually respond to what we told you in terms of the removal of harmful practices we think our rebuttal has also shown.

First response, let's mitigate it because we don't think that all these values which they say are completely beneficial are going to be changed on our side. If anything will be reworded and made better on our side to look at specific contexts as how society evolves so this looks like merely saying that freedom of speech is a right to stating how freedom of speech is a right existing in the age of social media and how companies who are then in charge of that right would need to monitor it as a guiding principle then let's also understand panel most of the case is literally hung on constitutions being good why i don't understand because most of the case is literally hung on constitutions being good. Why? I don't understand. Because most of the time, these constitutions are written by people who are out of date with society, people who have values such as being racist, such as actively bigotry and trying to make principles which might not actively harm those groups, but are literally preventing them from being able to access basic fundamental protections on the basis of their identity not being accounted for within those constitutions. Then in terms of these politicians let's take them at their best if politicians are going to some level of power all they tell us here is that politicians won't get scrutinized the voters can't access the laws. Now either they think people are extremely stupid under their side where you can't understand that if a politician is literally making an infringement to change how gun laws work, that you won't be able to access a certain amount, how that changes. We think that people do have that basic understanding of the law, but we think that there are more than enough news sources from different sources to account for the bias that they claim will be present in order to make sure that that large amount of public scrutiny, which is essential to hold politicians accountable, will change. We think that we achieve that on our side. Before I move on into how we get a significantly better precedent and how a better functioning legal system under the constitution, yes, I'll take it if you like. At this point, you wash down your case to some rewording and some limited changes here and there. So why isn't the constitutional court enough to constantly remind us what the constitution should be and reinterpret it just as it does in the present?"

Because no, most of these presidents, considering the people who wrote it, are likely to have some form of bigoted practices, have things that people draw from that constitution or draw legislation which is permissible under a certain constitution under that, using that precedent as a way to back it up. Which means that comparatively, when you fight for a minority's rights, who have not been historically protected, having to continually fight matter, which is difficult, and finding an illegal precedent and finding portions of it to aid you, is a consistent harm that is placed onto minorities, right?

We don't know if there is any democratic process within that. But furthermore, note that this is fundamentally relevant in flawed democracies, in countries like the Balkans, which are democracies. But really what happens is that the politicians in power can actually incentivize them or pay them or threaten them to make the changes that they want. This means practically giving more power, changing organic laws, like giving more power to the prime minister or the president, dissolving parliament and stuff like this. These are not risks we are willing to take. But secondly, they bring a point about how people are going to be more engaged in politics because now suddenly there is civil society within these councils. And they say that that's really false.

In Romania, we have voting presence about 40 percent. In Norway, it's 80 percent, and that has nothing to do with how things are, but rather it has something to do with the level of democracy in those countries and how happy people are or how much trust they have in their governments.

We tell you that the U.S. Constitution, based on it, Obergefell was drafted. This is the on it, Obergifel was drafted. This is the legislation that actually awarded gay marriage to gay people. Roe v. Wade was awarded because it was based on the right to privacy within the U.S. Constitution. We say there are methods to spill things around, especially because the Constitution has the basic of things in it.

But still, panel, South Africans less than 30 years after the inception of their constitution criticize it for being too heavy-handed on protecting property right laws, which means that it has been impossible so far for the South African government post-apartheid to redistribute land that was stolen from black people in the 1950s because the constitution enshrines white people's rights to that land in its property clauses. It would be much better for South Africans if 30 years after the end of apartheid we could reroute our constitution in a way that is more relevant to struggles that we didn't even know we were going to have 30 years ago. Apply that logic panel to a government that wrote their constitution 200 years ago when they couldn't even conceptualize things like data as a mechanism by which to evaluate privacy. Things like whether AI are considered sentient or deserving of human rights. Even things like the fact that my first speaker tells you that the founding fathers couldn't possibly have known what it would be for modern Americans in the South that they said they are allowed to bear arms.

Note, all of those impacts on people feeling represented and voting more often and not succumbing to populism and not taking that POI are not contingent on us actually having to change the constitution is fine from the outset and the only thing that happens every 50 years is that you review it and you decide that it's fine and you move on with your life which is plausible on our side you still get all of those benefits independent of their best case scenario the impact of this cash is huge because the constitution as they as they concede from the outset governs everything to the extent that it is necessary that it's changed often and become representative to the extent that they have lied to about this consistently throughout the debate, this ought to be where it is important and ought to be winning immediately. Go quickly."

And that's why, from the outset, a lot of the claims about politicians being politically motivated and evil aren't going to stand because they don't even have the power to do this. It would be absurd that they suggest that we have to defend the politicians who will be held to account by the Constitution, the treaty being the ones that write it. But even if they did have some power, number one, we'd say that bipartisanship probably means that there will be a balancing out of incentives and we're not going to get things like gross human rights abuses. Because like we say from the outset, constitutional agreements on our side during these periods of rewriting are going to require enormous majorities to be passed. So we're not going to see outlandish policy. But secondly, if we get conservative policy sometimes, that's fine. Number one, it's symmetrical. They probably get conservative amendments and laws on their side as well my second speaker tells you why things like precedent are likely to be better on our side which minimizes the impact of conservative things number two even if even the most conservative politicians in the usa today are less conservative than the founding fathers who literally wrote women and black people out of the constitution even if that's our only impact we'll take it but thirdly panel there's this narrative and debating that conservatives are always evil and we just don't think they are think conservative policy because it existed before it will exist again probably isn't going to cripple human rights on either side given that this debate ought not happen in autocracies that in either world would would abolish term limits and destroy human rights this debate ought happen in autocracies that in either world would abolish term limits and destroy human rights. This debate ought to happen in places where it is actually likely to happen.

Well, we could have a constitutional court which actively reinterprets what the constitution is saying so that it is more in tune with what we have. And the only thing that still stands from team proposition is that the founding fathers never expected AIs or AK-47s. Okay, but they set up some principles that we should guide ourselves from, which means that the constitutional court can then think of those principles and figure out what we should do about AI or AK-47s or any other thing in society. Moreover, if the constitutional court is actually unable to do all of these things, we still have amendments on our side of the house.

Now, before I enter the clashes, I want to do the wing at the very get-go so you see where I'm going. Why you should care more about stability and avoiding risks than about their marginal changes on their side? Because if you're not changing a lot on their side and you only do it 30 to 50 years, the impact is essentially zero. But you are increasing the risk of something terrible happening to the entire democratic process, to breaking checks and balances, to breaking people's freedom, something we said from Op 1, that marginalized communities can be actively targeted and it can be enshrined in law. You're creating all of these risks with not a lot of impact. So if by the end of my speech I manage to prove that, one, the motion is not the only way to do this, and secondly, it is a high risk that we destroy the of our society within this debate. You can hold me accountable at the end of my speech. Before I move on, please. Do you think that news organizations and human rights groups are simply going to allow human rights? Yes, thank you. We already dealt with this from op one, when we explained that there are a lot of ways through which politicians are able to introduce things that are not accepted by society, although we should be outraged about it. We already talked about the $2.3 trillion bill that they passed in the U.S., which included a lot of money for the U.S. Army, which no one wanted. We already gave the examples from OPCON. This latest response from PROP doesn't even stand to our first OPCON. Let's first enter the area of clashes. And here they try to know of changes, and here they try to tell us that they are necessary. And although we agree that maybe some changes are necessary, the fact that they diminish their points to we won't change a lot, only some things, essentially destroys their own argumentation. Because we managed to prove that we have, one, amendments that can also do the things they're doing, which is the small, sensible changes that they want, because that's what the case is resumed to. But moreover than that, we explained the point on OPTU that was uninterrupted with about a constitutional court losing legitimacy, because now people don't see it as legitimate to reinterpret the constitution the moment that we constantly change it. This is important because the constitutional court is a big mechanism for change, especially for disadvantaged groups. This takes down the entire point on precedent because the constitutional court, if you want to play on America, has done a lot of good for these minorities. But moreover than that, in all countries, it is generally the one that keeps people in check. So regardless of whether things are changed or not, if politicians have incentives to change the constitution to benefit themselves, the fact that a constitutional keeps people in check. So regardless of whether things are changed or not, if politicians have incentives to change the constitution to benefit themselves, the fact that a constitutional court loses legitimacy is very important because that means you lose a mechanism of checks and balances in democracy, which is very important and would have provided a lot of changes for the people that we want on our side. That's why we win that clash, because we still have this legitimacy. But now let's talk about stability. And Prop is very scared of this point, because that's why they keep diminishing their impacts panel. That's why they keep telling us that you only have small changes, that people are not going to do a lot of things, and only the commonsensical ones, because they're scared that politicians might have incentives to change it. And there is a risk panel, because one, there are active incentives to do it because you have people that put you in that position. Even as a delegate, you have people who put you in that position, who pressure you to create small advantages for their side. That means that you are likely going to succumb to those pressures. Moreover than that, you might want to maintain power. You might want to have advantages for your social class as well. Not only that, you might think of a future prospect in politics, so you want to please the electorate. This is especially important when we're talking about minorities, because if you live in a conservative society, you have all of the incentives to enshrine into law that minorities should be subjected to discrimination, because that gives you electorate for the rest of your life from all of these political parties that are very conservative. All of these mechanisms have nothing to do with corruption or the bad will of people. They're just incentives. The only thing that stands from opposition, from proposition that we can weigh this against is that people are more engaged and there is less populism because you feel connected to the constitution. And I don't know, personally, I don't think of the constitution that often because it is a document we write so that the society can work. And from then on, we can do everything else. Laws are more into people's focus than the constitution itself. But moreover than that, I think that people are not going to feel represented when a group of delegates that they have no idea who they are,"

And oftentimes they come out being relatively bad due to bipartisanship. Their only response is just asserting that, no, this is really, really bad for democracy. I've already pointed out why this is contradictory. What they said underneath this is that politicians will be bad because they have perverse incentives. We gave you four layers of response. One, that they desire good PR for the future of their careers. Two, that they value democratic principles for the future of their parties and democratic alignments. Thirdly, that they fear public scrutiny because they are reliant on that for their mechanisms to change. But fourthly, that the likely comparative is not politicians making these changes, it's just delegates whereby politicians form a small part of the group but lastly in terms of like framing and set up there's only three quarter rules so they can't just run around saying oh we're going to change everything but at our worst case it's we have to ask who represents these individuals"

Second question on democratic engagement we told you a people get better connection because they can change underlying premises of democracy and b that it feels more modern because 30 years is less than 100. The idea that it is happening in your lifetime and that you can set the focus of the country. Their response was rather shallow. They said 30 to 50 years is just way too long. That's non-comparative because 30 to 50 years is just less than 100. We think that was the premise there. They did not dispute this. Their argument was that constitutional courts worsen and lose legitimacy. A, my second speaker's argument is largely dealt with. I don't explain why precedent is better on our side. B, we explained to you why this is difficult to get to pass. Thus, you lose viability on their side.

There are two key differences that both sides are going to have to concede in this motion. Firstly, the immediacy in degree of change is higher on-site proposition. The reason for this is that amendments can only amend a specific change to the constitution. In that, you either put up a new amendment, you change the wording of an old amendment, or you strike that amendment entirely. On-site proposition, what you are allowed to do is rewrite the entire constitution. What this means is that the people in charge, that is to say delegates, have to go through every single part of the constitution and either have to approve it, strike it down or make an amendment to it. So the immediacy in degree of change is higher. Two, frequency is higher. Because in order to have a discussion of amendments, you need a large degree of public pressure because of the lack of a fixed time that everyone adheres to. When we on our side have a fixed time, the public knows when the change is going to happen, and thus it is regular. Opposition has to do both the actions of getting people into a convention and then also getting that amendment passed. Those are the two big differences that will occur once this motion goes through. Second thing then, in terms of delegates, we're talking about elected representatives or individuals in legislative bodies. The important thing to note is that these are people that individuals have consented into the representation of them because you vote them in to power. The most preferable option of pushing for constitutional change than in our world is likely to be that of the Constitutional Convention because it is the most frequent option. We recognize a trade-off in this debate in that we are likely to have fewer ad hoc amendments, but those come in favor of pushing those same ideas through in the form of constitutional change in the Constitution. For my arguments, sure. How often will these fixed periods be in effect? It will be roughly every election cycle. I don't know whether it will be on the election cycle, but roughly once every election cycle. First argument then as to why we are better able to get constitutional reform and why we get better forms of constitutional reform on our side. The context in this argument is to recognize that there is a significant time gap between the writing of a constitution and its implementation. Because in many, and thus in many instances, constitutions do not reflect the social attitudes of status quo. They reflect the social attitudes of when they were written. In the United States, the Constitution reflects the views of white rich men that own land in the 1700s. And because society is constantly changing, there is a necessity to reform the Constitution. The problem right now is that there is a massive barrier to entry in achieving that reform, because you need both political capital in order to call a vote, as well as the ability to overcome bureaucratic barriers to exist. Thus, on site opposition, there is a higher threshold needed to enact constitutional change. The problem is that that is disproportionately used by powerful parties parties because they are the ones that have agenda setting capacity, not just because they have the most votes, but also because they have things like incumbency advantage, because they are able to have other bureaucratic factors that give them a greater degree of power in being able to set up barriers to entry. Comparatively, we are better because we can see that in either world, opposition parties are going to be a minority. But at least in our world, we are able to get discussion of these issues in the first place. Thus, the marginal change you are able to receive is greater in our world. This is a debate-winning argument because the core reason you have a constitution is to enshrine the ability of people to represent themselves through change. secondly it's comparatively better because voters themselves feel better able to change the constitution when they realize that they have a greater degree of change in being able to do so when it becomes a voting priority that you are able to elect people that directly change the constitution second level under this argument is as to why we get greater public scrutiny of amendments because the problem with ad hoc amendments is that there is often a sense of urgency when they are proposed and thus they because they come about as a swell of public pressure thus there is very little time for the public to either understand the importance of it or for parties to rally sufficient support of it. Thus, even when you do have amendments, there's often very little scrutiny of them and thus they end up either being vague or shallow. Comparatively, we are better because the constitutional convention creates a greater pressure to make change when you are forced to take a stance on every single amendment and thus we are able to force for greater degrees of change in the amendments. The problem here then lies in social movements and that is the third part of this argument because in the absence of being able to read the constitution, the social movements in society are forced to defer to other methods of getting change. The main way they do so is through the legislature and doing things like passing law. This looks like the passing of Roe versus Wade. The problem with this is that it is very unstable because they can easily be reversed through other votes in the legislature."

Comparatively, even though minorities have no guarantee of success on either side of the house, on our side, when they have the political capital to be able to get that change, instead of channeling it into the legislature, they channel it into a constitutional change, which means that when we do get change, it is more stable. Second argument is why we get better political accountability. Two levels. Firstly, because we are better able to correct for institutional weakness, because in many constitutions, there are old documents that are open to interpretation, and thus are interpreted in ways that are beneficial to the political establishment. This looks like the interpretation of free speech laws as allowing for almost infinite amounts of campaign spending. The problem with this is that it creates a collective action problem in that these forms of clauses are beneficial to all parties and thus the issues do not become, are not even discussed in the first place. Thus, politicians can skirt accountability by never even discussing the issues and thus are never forced to take a stance. Comparatively, we are better because when politicians are forced to vote on every part of the constitution, they are forced to take a stance. This is more transparent to voters who now know exactly what part of the constitution their elected representative supports. Thus, if they do not want their representative in favor of things like extra campaign funding, they are later able to actually vote in an individual who opposes those ideologies. Secondly, is that we create an image change in that the constitution is no longer seen as a sacred document. Right now, politicians leverage the perception of the constitution as one that is a sacred document to prevent change in putting it up on a pedestal. In our world, the constitution is not only a document that can be changed regularly, it is one that should be. This means that individuals have a greater capacity in fighting for their rights through the best method of doing so. Because we make sure that constitutional democracies and democratic constitutions propose."

                "text": "So first on some stance, we prefer amendments instead. The difference between amendments and constitutions is twofold. Firstly, that amendments organically arise via political preferences. So for example, an MP proposes an amendment, you are not forced to relook the constitution every couple of years. But secondly, there's a much higher bar to get those amendments passed. For example, in Canada, it is a super majority in parliament and then a referendum vote. When you are talking about whether individuals have rights, we don't think proposition can say bureaucracy is bad in this case. Presumably, there should be a ton of barriers when you're talking about whether or not people have the right to live. We stand for a constitution that serves its purpose to enshrine rights without being susceptible to abuse. On rebuttal then, so firstly, proposition makes a differentiation between amendments and like this convention via the frequency and scope of change. I don't think this is sufficient differentiation. Like, I don't think it's a good thing that when the like, sure, the amendment might be outdated in some respects. But why not just make an amendment towards that specific clause than looking at every single other clause that happens to be good when the next guy can easily change it back when they're also talking about the frequency of change. Them justifying this by saying the Constitution was written by rich men is insufficient insofar as, yes, there might be some clauses we change, but we amend those when those rich men also enshrined our right to life, to a fair trial, to liberty and the security of person. I don't know why we need to look at everything else. Then they say that constitutions can be changed and that's a good thing. Four responses to this. Firstly, constitutions are fundamentally not supposed to be democratic. Laws are supposed to be democratic. The constitution is supposed to challenge the rule of the majority. If the majority wants to take away your rights, if they want to vote for a politician again and again and again, that's where term limits come in, in the constitution. That's where you say that you can't discriminate against people. We don't think that democracy should be the fundamental point of the constitution. Secondly, though, on scrutiny, this point is just a lie. Like if the constitution has existed for 200 years, why is there urgency now? If the constitution is so important, why don't you take your time? The Meech Lake Accord in Canada that attempted to change the constitution took months. And that's because you have far more scrutiny when there's only one amendment that happens only once every couple of years. People pay more attention to it. We went on scrutiny. Thirdly, constitutions and laws are for different purposes. This isn't a trade-off. The constitution, it's the structure of the government and the limitations. Laws are for specific things. Lastly, I don't know what this thing about politicians being forced to take a stance on issues mean. Presumably you learn what a politician's stance is through debate on votes and the part where they're actually running for office, where they have to explain their stance to get elected."

                "text": "First point then about politicization of the Constitution. Firstly, I'd like to frame that constitutions are already quite good at enshrining basic rights. Note that proposition couldn't give any illustrations as to why, like, a time that we need to change the constitution to improve the rights of the minority. That's because they're already quite good at it. Three reasons for this. Firstly, structurally, they're designed to enshrine limitations on the state's power to protect minority rights versus the majority by putting a cap on what the powerful can do. Secondly, amendments require a lot of support. So when you amend the constitution, it has to be extremely broadly popular and cross party lines. That's why amendments aren't just all shot down because of the bureaucratic system that prop hates. It's like past amendments such as women being able to vote in the United States or the 14th Amendment that created anti-discrimination in the Constitution. Those types of things were passed through amendments or things like the selfish aims of politicians aren't. Thirdly, there's something called analogous grounds in constitutional laws where existing rights imply other rights. So even if we don't specifically have a right to water, the right to life implies that, and the right to food and all of the right to life entails. The right to security of person was used in the debate in favor of abortion, meaning that even if we don't have specific things in the constitution, they can already be accessed through court interpretation. This breaks the deadlock in the debate then. Constitutions are good at protecting people, but these rights can easily be taken away."

                "text": "Three mechanisms as to why states can abuse the constitutional convention. Firstly, there's a pressure to make changes every time this convention happens because politicians want to do something. Like even if you inherit a good economy, you are still expected to pass things. Parliament getting held up for a month, like debating the constitution and not having anything to show for it will lead to huge backlash, meaning politicians will make up issues where they don't exist. Secondly, this is subject to short-term democratic cycles. They talk about Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade could be overturned by like a conservative politician. This is because politicians can rile up their base around constitutional issues. The sentiment of the current political party can be applied to the committee that they appoint. So a tough-on-crime administration or a transitional democracy with a power-hungry government can change the constitution in its favor. Thirdly, on political horse trading and lobbying. So of course, this is everywhere in politics, but it's worse than the Constitution in two reasons. Firstly, constitutional law is more consequential as proposition concedes. But secondly, the stakes are much higher for lobbyists because the Second Amendment is existential for the NRA. And this is because the only way to get things passed is to make concessions in Parliament to other parties. So the Constitution will probably be a big deal to lots of political parties and will become the focus of negotiations, which means there's lots of political horse trading, lots of lobbying, which means that it's actually not as democratic as proposition states. What are the impacts of this then? Governments can abuse the constitution to do things that they want. This looks like changing political rights, term limits, or campaign caps on, sorry, donation caps on campaigns can be changed to screw over minority grassroots candidates in favor of the wealthy majority who can get a lot of donations. Things like legal protections, like discrimination against gay people in a homophobic country, or protections for indigenous people when the government wants to build a new oil pipeline, all of these things can be overturned. But thirdly, on legal rights, in a country that is fighting against terrorism, striking down protections against torture or access to a lawyer can easily be changed. All of these protections that currently exist can be undone. It is better for constitutions to be rigid. But for my second point, I'll take the POI. Given that if in a specific country, supermajority is the threshold that is necessary to change the constitution that remains symmetric, why don't all of these harms equally apply to ad hoc amendments? Well, no, it's not symmetric because you are saying that changing the constitution is far easier. We're saying that when there's a supermajority, people generally only amend things that are based on the fundamental rights of people. Now you allow politicians to do whatever they want. Second point on the convention, this convention is a political opportunity cost. It will take up a significant amount of time. Firstly, because constitutions are incredibly long and interpretable, every single word has to be examined. It has legal implications. Supreme Court cases take weeks to argue over the application of one clause. If proposition wants this to be thorough, imagine how long they will take, especially given its once-every-election cycle. Secondly, this will take up a disproportionate amount of political attention. Politicians will talk about the Constitution instead of other issues. It will take up a huge amount of time in the media. The impact here is that it will overshadow other political issues that will actually change lives for people on the ground. The impact here is that, firstly, it slows legislative change. We're going to be debating about a 200-year-old clause instead of passing essential infrastructure bills that will give jobs to people on the ground. We'll be trying to interpret whether the right to healthcare exists instead of expanding Medicare and Social Security. If Prop wants things to be thorough, they must sacrifice these things. But secondly, it clogs up the courts. The government is essentially paralyzed leading up to the convention, because once you change the constitution, everything just gets appealed. This means people have to wait months in jail waiting for a trial. The essential laws, like legalizing abortion that they want, wait for months as the government tries to put a stop to it through the constitution. Ultimately, we think polarization makes constitutions worse, but even if not, this opportunity cost is unjustifiable. The Constitution should be a basic outline of our rights, not an extension of political fights."

We have already done things like abolish term limits or abolish, not term limits, but in the vast majority of the world are existing issues that exist due to constitutional interpretations for which there is a collective action problem where no reform is likely to happen.

Notice that even things like political debates are controlled by the established elites, which means that if neither side is pushing each other to be able to talk about these issues, then the probability that you get politicians taking a stance on these issues is far less likely.

Firstly, that in a world in which there is a fixed time to discuss these issues, you are far more likely to have politicians need to take a stance on these specific issues. This is because voters want to know how politicians will vote when there is an opportunity to examine specific clauses within the constitution. This is why it is necessary that you discuss every element of the constitution, because in a world in which you only have ad hoc amendments, politicians can simply deflect on the fact that they will never have to discuss an issue because a vote will never have to be passed in the first place. So their side of the house is one in which politicians evade accountability. The perfect example of this is the US. Many politicians probably want to seem like they support reforms of the existing system, but they are never forced to take an independent stance on things like campaign financing, and they often leverage the fact that there is an opportunity cost associated with discussing these issues in parliament and that this comes at the cost of attending to the more immediate needs of individuals as a way to deflect accountability, as a way to say that these issues don't need to be discussed. That is something that we can uniquely correct for when there is a fixed time and there is a guarantee of a discussion. Finally, they say that they have greater political accountability on their side of the house because they will be held captive by the fact that this is an ongoing constitutional assembly. In those instances, that is simply a regulatory barrier that we can correct for. Given that we don't have to hold people indefinitely in prison until the constitution is passed, we are happy to try them under the pre-existing constitution in those instances. There's largely technicality that we can avoid entirely. This is a debate winning argument because importantly the need for reform is something that is immediate and compelling and cuts across all political parties. We recognize that partisan politics is also an important part of this debate and both sides need to talk about"

Spending hours thoroughly discussing their stance in all 200 clauses, or actually drafting and passing laws that will help people on the ground and also allow voters to react? Okay, so depending on what stance politicians take, the time sensitivity of the constitutional assembly will change.

We began from the premise that constitutional reform is a necessity in any constitutional democracy. They concede to this fact when they support ad hoc amendments as the alternative to be able to reform constitutions. The question in this debate then is that given that politics is inherently majoritarian and that there is majority capture of political institutions that is likely to exist on either side of the house, which side is more accommodating of the needs of majorities? The first thing that they say here is that constitutions exist as a cap on what the political elite are able to do. The first thing that I want to note is that just because there is a greater frequency of change for the constitution does not mean that people are alluded to what the importance of the constitution is. So I think in instances where we do call a constitutional assembly, people will be aware of the implications that that might have. Uniquely, this is something that we access on our side of the house because ad hoc amendments allow individuals to not take a particular stance on these issues and not preemptively prepare for when they want to vote. This is why our analysis on voting preferences was so important because on their side of the house, ad hoc amendments will still happen. But when they happen, they happen without the consent of people or even without their awareness because it is unclear whether a politician will have an opportunity to vote on an ad hoc amendment."

On either side of the House, conservative politicians are probably going to be against furthering things like minority rights, but that is a harm that is entirely symmetric. Politicians that self-identify as progressive, however, are now forced to take a stance on these issues in such a way that it is beneficial for minorities. The second quibble that they make here is that supermajorities prevent capture of political institutions. If it is true that in Canada, you require a supermajority to pass an amendment, that will probably happen on our side of the House as well. It is only that that supermajority is achieved in a constitutional assembly. So that was not an independent mechanism that they could claim for their side of the house. The second thing that they talked about was political horse trading. But this becomes worse on their side of the house because the NRA and other organizations that have deeply motivated members are able to leverage that fact to push for change outside of the public eye. This means that backdoor channels and political negotiations become far less transparent in a world in which it is not the constitution that is changing, but an interpretation of the constitution for individual laws, for example. If we are able to centralize change into the constitution, the ability for opposition parties to be able to rally support against the NRA and other organizations is far higher. The final quibble that we get here is that politicians want to do other things. The first thing that I've already covered is that these assemblies are likely to be time sensitive. But secondly, it is uniquely on our side of the house that minority parties have an agenda setting ability. In order to have a discussion of an amendment, you first need to pass a vote in order to get the political elite discussing this issue in the first place. It is uniquely on our side of the house that minority parties have an opportunity to leverage their stance on particular amendments. On their side of the house, majority parties retain an agenda-setting ability. This breaks the deadlock in this debate because it is on our side of the house that we better cater to the interests of minorities for all of these reasons side with side proposition."

Three things that I want to talk about in this speech. First, I want to talk about scrutiny and accountability. Second, I want to talk about the abuse of politicization. And third, an independent constructive argument on reducing international certainty and cooperation on their side."

                "text": "First of all, on the material on scrutiny and accountability, I have a few sets of responses. First, I want to point out just how laughable a claim this actually is. Politicians take thousands of stances in any given election, break thousands of promises over the course of their career in office. It seems ridiculous that people genuinely hold you to account on these promises and that they will do so on their world. But second, you get a huge amount of scrutiny on our side because singular issues have, because we are supporting singular issues, getting things like amendments and they have overcome a support threshold. This is good notably because it prevents things like conservative abuse, the abuse of minority groups who are extremists and are trying to implement negative policies. And this is key. Notice that on their side, it is easy to escape responsibility because of the reality of party politics, that it is not the case that you can control a single electoral outcome. And for that reason, you aren't blamed and you aren't held account for when it fails. And this is precisely why you don't need to be held to account on your stance, that politicians can take any stance that they want and that they aren't actually held accountable and that doesn't fall through. So what that means is even if politicians are actually holding and taking stances on their side, that doesn't provide them with anything meaningful at the end of this debate and it doesn't lead to any particular sets of changes being made. But their claim is also ridiculous, because everyone isn't going to memorize every single clause in the Constitution and won't be able to make an informed vote accordingly. Like, realistically, people do not have the time to memorize economic policy, which affects them on their day-to-day life, much less the Constitution, which has hundreds of clauses. More. Why aren't laws an acceptable alternative in the absence of this? Note, they understand that they don't actually access any asymmetry here because they end up trying to win on discussion in their first argument and even more so in their second speech. And the reason is because we already get immense political will to access democratic reforms as far as amendments. What that suggests is that there is a huge amount of political will that we can access to achieve amendments, but when these social groups are in the minority, it is highly unlikely in their world that they will actually be able to influence any forms of amendments in the first place. Lastly, the question is then, where are laws easier to change? Is it in a context where the constitution can be amended and changed and rewritten every four years, or is it via an amendment which is permanent, or even in a law that is constitutionally protected by a constitution that is again permanent? What that suggests is that the best protection for the groups that they want, irrespective of any considerations of accountability, end up coming on our side because of the permanence of the constitution that we create. Let's weigh this up against our second argument, which suggests that negotiations and the process of creating these constitutions aren't actually a referendum on people's will. What it is, in fact, is the process of mass amounts of course trading end up not realizing people's democratic preferences in a meaningful way. That suggests that when policies and constitutions do not look the way that individuals actually thought they would, that A, politicians are not held to account, but B, that it doesn't realize any of the benefits of their accountability argument, because in the end, it is not a democratic representation of people's will. On to the second theme on the abuse of politicization."

                "text": "There are a couple of things to say. First, this is incredibly unlikely. Your job as a judge who has studied the constitution is to follow that constitution and interpret it in just ways. That is why even someone like Neil Gorsuch can support things like constitutional protections for LGBTQ individuals because of the fact that it abides by the constitution that he has been trained to study. Second, there is a long-term disincentive to act in political ways. And the reason is, if politicians manipulate the Constitution in our world or manipulate the courts in our world, there is an extreme likelihood that their successor will do the same thing, that they will overwrite and override every single policy that they ended up passing in the first place. There is a massive disincentive to have that because politicians want their policies to stay in. But on their world, there is an expectation that you will actually manipulate the Constitution because you are given permission to do so by the four-year cycle. And they suggest that there's a huge amount of public pressure for you to make changes in the first place. All of that means that politicization is much stronger on their side, whereas there's an active disincentive against it on our world. And let's talk further about their mechanism on establishment. A couple of things to note. First of all, you can actually aggregate people's preferences meaning is a collective action problem because politicians want to benefit themselves. That would suggest that they will continue to want to benefit themselves in the process of creating stances for these constitutions. So then let's break the deadlock as far as the worst types of policies that actually happen in this round. Our two thirds majority does a better job of protecting against the worst excesses of the constitution. But furthermore, the fact that our frame, which isn't challenged, is that constitutions are broadly quite moderate and protect good liberal rights, means that we can get liberal policies that are passed on our side legally, but you can't get harmful conservative policies passed on our side because they are constitutionally illegitimate. So then, our argument on politicization wins this theme."

This is an independent principle of good, but it is also something that is structurally meaningful for a huge number of people in society. But second, our claim on horse trading is incredibly important. And the reason that it is worse, as opposed to what second proposition suggests, is that it has a much greater effect. It is the constitution that affects every single legal case, every single law that is written. That is a massive effect. And so if horse trading is going to result in bad outcomes, which they do not challenge, by the way, it means that it's going to be much worse for people. On the third argument on reducing international certainty and cooperation. In order for cooperation to be possible between international actors, there needs to be certainty over how they will act. This is because otherwise countries can be screwed over, alliances can be broken, etc. Because there are information barriers now, countries become fearful. This is, for example, constitutional democracies potentially demarcating greater territory in the South China Sea, or Japan potentially repealing Article 9 and having a military. This raises tensions because countries are worried about these changes and don't know what to expect. Further, this creates an incentive on international actors to influence these processes. So China threatening Japan in the lead up to a constitutional decision to prevent changes that threaten China. This means negotiation and cooperation becomes much harder, but also that by reducing certainty, this increases tensions in the world because there's a huge amount of uncertainty between international actors. Alliances fall apart, information falls apart. On that basis, I'm proud to oppose."

But the uniquely pernicious harm of this motion not passing is that you only have ad hoc amendments to pass these constitutional reforms. There is no ability for other parties to even enter this discussion, and that's what we think is so uniquely harmful. The second observation I want to make is about the ludicrous third argument that they want to present about foreign relations within countries. The reason why I think that this has no ground in today's debate is oftentimes foreign policy changes from term to term anyway. These aren't things that you encode into your constitution, and they're done primarily based on a specific political party as opposed to the constitution of the United States.

But thirdly, in terms of the impact this has on broader policies pushed by political parties. First then, on which side is more conducive to constitutional reform? And we told you one key thing that they have yet to respond to, that there's a necessity to act because of the way that constitutions are formed. Because we told you that the unique problem with constitutions is because of the historic inability to make them change. They still have extremely archaic, racist laws encoded into them. This looks like eminent domain clauses that allows you to seize minority properties as political parties seize fits. This looks like right to refuse clauses that haven't changed since they were entered into the constitution. They can see that the barriers of entries to change the constitution is high because of things like bureaucracy and an inability to muster political will. We told you that this was uniquely pernicious for two reasons. One is because we recognize that if the harm that they wanted to peddle today is your ability to subvert minority rights, I think they're being far too charitable with what constitutions actually look like as of status quo. Because I refute the claim and the premise that constitutions as of status quo balance minority rights well. If it is true that minority rights are catered to at all under existing constitutions, this is probably going to be the same in our world, because they're primarily based on popular will, as they tell you. And if popular will exists to care about minorities, that is something that will still exist in our world. So that phantom harm of you reversing all of these progressive politics, progressive amendments, is a harm that only exists in their mind and in their prep room. The second thing to notice here is that if pushing your own pernicious agendas is a harm that exists, this is a harm that exists more perniciously in their world. Because think of the political parties that actively do have the power to change and include amendments, right? These are political parties that have huge amounts of political capital that can sufficiently put through ad hoc amendments. So if their harm is things like exceeding term limits, this is a harm that is made more pernicious in their world."

We recognize that there's still some degree of greater power given to some political parties, but the unique differentiating factor is that we have more political parties that can enter this discussion. The second thing to note here is that we have voters that are able to hold them accountable, because they might tell you that politicians need to justify their stance in either world, but this is false. This is because inso far as you can change amendments as in when you see it, and this is not something that is seen as a important voter priority as they can see it, the ability for voters to even know what is happening with their constitutions is relatively low. We think that this is crucial. But the last thing they push us on is the frequency of change. And I'm just going to bite the bullet here. We're completely fine with the frequency of change being relatively higher in our world. Why is this true? Because even if there's an ability to change constitutions, it does not mean you always act on it. In instances in which you do change the constitution, it is probably because those constitutions are repressive and oppressive and do not accurately measure your needs. So even if we have to bite the bullet of constitutions changing more, we think that this is perfectly fine. And this is something that we're actually winning on in today's debate. So we win this first clash on being more conducive to constitutional reforms."

Doesn't that suggest that things get worse on your side because coalitions randomly form which don't end up actually reflecting people's democratic preferences, so the things get worse on your side because coalitions randomly form which don't end up actually reflecting people's democratic preferences so the abuses get worse? If your counterfactual is ad hoc amendments then political coalitions will exist in your world and push their majority will. In our world we have the ability for minority parties to have their own political coalitions so thank you actually for the good analysis. Second metric here on political accountability. First thing to note is that they didn't respond to any of our analysis on how this creates a collective action problem that you cannot subvert. Because in that world, if you benefit off of things like loopholes in constitutions, you can simply brush this off. Insofar as this becomes a voting priority and voters are aware of this, you have no ability to do so. The second thing that we told you is about greater scrutiny. In that world, it is only uniquely ad hoc amendments. You cannot predict voter awareness and you cannot even direct their attention to when these things occur. When there's a specific date and time, the ability for you to recognize when these issues are happening and for you to divert media capital to them is far greater. The last thing they tell you here is that in response to this is that political parties can break promises anyway. We think that this is a completely symmetric harm. This is why we have voters voting you in and out of political parties anyway. We think the comparative of constitutions that was formed eons ago is simply non-comparative. The last idea that I'm going to push them on here is that having broad constitutions is a good thing. We think that this is absolutely problematic because if it is true that broad amendments means that there's interpretative ability on part of judges, this is probably something that is going to hurt minorities themselves because if the benevolence of judges do not align with what is necessarily in line with minorities, this means that you can use interpretative measures to actually oppress minorities. In our world, when there's more clearer understanding of what amendments are, which is the point of our debate, we told you that you have better constitutional reforms. Third and last clash that we clearly win on. And this is the impact on broader politics. All they told you here is that there's an opportunity cost in pursuing this, and this means that politicians make something up. Two responses here. First, politicians won't arbitrarily make up stances if it's something that cuts across their interests, but two, political parties have an inherent incentive to remain popular and pass things like infrastructure bills if there is something that actually does help them and brings more voters to the ballot box. The deadlock breaker in this particular metric is that they can see that in the absence of being able to change the constitution, all of your political efforts are going to be focused through local governments pushing laws. The reason why this is pernicious is all the harm that they wanted to talk about, because if their problem today is that the frequency of change is too high, do you know whether that is the most pernicious? It is precisely in local governments where individual courts can overturn laws, when there's less political capital needed to actually overhaul the laws in place. So if their problem was frequency of change, it is something that is worse off in their world, where local governments are their only alternatives. We told you that democracy is not perfect in either world. The only way to correct for this is when you have more voter accountability. For all these reasons, propose."

We point to the example of Gorsuch in the United States, who frequently votes across the aisle on textualist and literalist interpretations of the Constitution. For example, ruling that protections against trans discrimination follow logically from protection against sex-based discrimination. But second, we told you that presidents don't want to appoint their ideological allies because then the same could happen with later political successors and opponents. So, for example, Democrats saw the cost of doing this when a few years later, Amy Coney Barrett was nominated by Republicans. The difference is now on their side. You have to politicize it because it's now an expectation and other parties are doing it as well. On our side, we do have a resolution of that collective action problem where parties do not want to engage in politicized nominations because it'll come back to bite them. So that takes out the first part of their path to victory, which is that politicization is symmetric. Clearly it is not. The second part of their path to victory is if politicization is symmetric, the biggest deadlock breaker is on public scrutiny. Two things we point out on public scrutiny. One, there are so many different clauses in the Constitution that it's unlikely you have strong democratic pressure or input into any given one of them. This is how parties can very effectively escape accountability placed on them in campaigns. But second, we told even second op that it's easy for the ruling government and ruling parties to escape accountability and campaign promises to modify the Constitution on the basis of political realities within the legislature. This is analogous, for example, to Joe Manchin refusing to do basically any good thing on the basis that, well, it wasn't bipartisan. So we don't think just because you introduce something to the political spectrum, that necessarily means there's going to be massive accountability and public scrutiny and parties are actually going to be held to their promises of how they promised to modify the constitution. Then the response from second prop is, well, the real difference is no one understands the importance of ad hoc amendments. Really? No, thank you. When they are so infrequent and when they are considered most important and when they happen after significant national reckonings, for example, in the case of Article 9 in Japan, I find it massively implausible for them to suggest that nobody understands the importance of these massive changes to the constitution, which both sides concede are extremely important. Then they say politicians won't take a stance on our side. Obviously, they have to because supermajority is needed. So by necessity, they end up doing so. This eliminates both assumptions underlying their path to victory. The final claim we get from them is constitutions are super outdated. The first thing I want to point out is they never engaged our mitigation about why constitutions generally enshrine broad rights and protections. The reason is because they were drafted with supermajority amendments and agreements are only made on broad and generally accepted phenomena like the right of women to vote, for example, like enshrinement of basic rights of equality or the 14th amendment against anti-discrimination. Constitutions were also designed as a form of contract, a way of ensuring that states have reasonable expectations of their citizens to pay taxes and citizens have expectations of their states to give them benefits in return. So we think broadly they enshrine broad and respectable principles that cannot be manipulated in the way they set. The second thing I want to point out is on the weighing here. They might point to a few cases where outdated protections on things like free speech, for example, lead to difficulties in limiting political lobbying. But this is marginal for a few reasons. One, we demonstrated an important normative claim about the function of constitutions,"

So regardless of left or right or which policies are passed, there's an inherent good in protecting against government coercion and ensuring that human rights of minorities aren't trampled on by majority rights. Second, for every outdated clause that they can reform, there is a politicized conservative clause that they can implement. On the margins, we told you bad policies are more likely to be implemented on their side because constitutions enshrine broad notions of equality that are compatible with liberal values, a response given in second opposition that still has gone unengaged with. But thirdly, any benefits they get to social movements are short-term and can be reversed. For example, Roe v. Wade when the next Republican government comes to power. And that's especially true if there's going to be huge political pressure on each government in each election cycle to reverse, which is necessary if you believe any of their arguments on political scrutiny to happen. So any benefits they get are inherently short-term, which is why in this debate, you should prioritize protecting against the abusive power of governments and the ability to subtly manipulate laws that are A, bad in themselves, but B, regressive because we've proven that on net, broad values enshrined in the Constitution allow for liberal values to be promoted. Before I go on to the second theme, I'll take the POI. Beneficial rights like universal suffrage are unlikely to change through Constitution in either world. What ability do minorities have to introduce amendments if they do not have popular political will of majorities? Yeah, so I'm getting to that now. On the opportunity cost theme, their argument seems to be that minority parties now have power. I really don't understand this argument because they are still minority parties within the legislature. So they lack the democratic control and influence to pass policies that appeal to them anyway. I'm completely unclear as to where the asymmetry is. And this is a gaping hole in their argument that they've still not proven. Our argument on the political opportunity cost was essential. We told you that constitutional amendments are likely to capture media attention, are likely to be very long in terms of reversing and changing and modifying every single detail within every single clause. There are two important implications to this. Number one, that politicians can distract from pressing issues by pointing to trivial fights over the constitution in a lead up to elections. But number two, the legislation that is crowded out on their side is actually better. Note that campaigns aren't good from a perspective of public scrutiny when it comes to constitutional conventions, because there's too much fights over specific wording that aren't prone to democratic input and to an expression of values in the same way that you have when you're voting on broad legislation like infrastructure bills, for example, that are passed in the United States. So if this crowds out legislation, which is comparatively more capable of being prone to public scrutiny because it's less prone and less susceptible to these specific battles that necessarily capture political attention on their side of the house, it is better in that respect in respecting public will. Thirdly and finally, I want to put certainty on the terms of engagement internationally. The response from third prop is foreign policy is decided by governments anyway. But what we pointed out is that they need to operate within the scope of constitutional requirements. For instance, where the lines of your land are demarcated, which islands you control in the South China Sea, or even important changes like Article 9 that are enshrined in the Constitution. Our argument was very simple. Constitutions enshrine broad things that states need to respect in the way that they engage with other countries. When there is now massive uncertainty over that, you risk inflaming tensions within the international sphere because there's no guarantee that you're going to respect, for example, your territorial expansion. For all those reasons, we oppose."

Second, Prop largely concedes this when he says, we will probably just keep most of the good stuff in constitutions. They bring this up in a POI to Matt as well, and we'll just change everything else. Great. Why not just amend the bad clauses? We broke this deadlock in three ways. Firstly, that amendments already only pass things that are extremely popular, such as basic rights, such as your right to not be discriminated against, while there's a far lower bar on proposition if they wanted efficacy and if they wanted to hand power to every political party that ended up in office. Secondly, when you normalize changing the constitution every four years, when parties are given permission to do it every political cycle to change and strike down constitutional clauses, even if we have an equal ability to make good changes, our changes still last for far longer because theirs will just be flipped in the next political cycle. Thirdly, there's a lot more room for the constitution to get worse than there is for it to get better. And this was the framing that we brought up in first that was never engaged with sufficiently.

Like, I don't know how your right to having security of person can be interpreted in a bad way to oppress minorities. But we can certainly narrow the constitution and strike down important things, which is what happens on Proposition's world. We can undo all of the good progress that has been made. We explain two mechanisms here. Firstly, on political cycles, some politicians are corrupt. They're tough on crime. They're racist. They're homophobic. Proposition hands them a golden ticket to enshrine what they want in the constitution. This wasn't taken down by third prop's thing about lobbying being symmetric. But secondly, on lobbying and political horse trading, constitutions are important and politicians will compromise for support in legislature, meaning that it actually ends up being unrepresentative. Third prop says it's symmetric to amendments. This ignores all of our analysis about how amendments only happen once in a while, how there's a far higher bar to change them. So nobody would support one politician trying to improve their own standing or violating the sanctity of existing rights. They never analytically refute our case. They need to deal with these impacts. A tough on crime party getting rid of restrictions against torture and modifying access to fair trials. The Republican Party overturning campaign funding limits to drown out minority candidates. A government who wants to build a shiny pipeline and getting rid of land protections for indigenous people.

But if it's true that they want thorough examination of the stance of all MPs, if they're going to have a lot of media attention for awareness, and if each word in the constitution can be interpreted 10 different ways, you are going to take months to get things done.

We do not need to correct for future preemptive harm. The priority in this debate and what can be tangibly weighed is correcting for existing status quo harms. The analysis we gave you went unresponded to because we told you that there's an incentive for politicians never to set the agenda on things like campaign financing because they don't have to. Majority parties retain an agenda setting ability which means they're simply able to deflect discussing certain constitutional amendments that might do things like put caps on campaign financing on the basis that those things are unlikely to change. They use opposition's tools of analogous grounds in order to continue to justify things like campaign donors on the basis that it is a form of speech.

Let me elaborate. First of all, our definitions. We define autonomous as robots that search, find, and execute a target on its own, essentially a robot or a drone that is pre-programmed to make decisions instead of human controlling it. Lethal is something that is used to attack and kill and we must ban development and not just regulate. I will demonstrate why in three layers of analysis. First of all,"

The fundamental technologies behind killer robots is computational power and code, which is an intangible thing. Therefore it is easier to replicate these and therefore it is necessary that no nations develop this technology whatsoever. And see, why solve a problem when you can prevent it? Less money and effort to control it, less money and effort to control something that hasn't even been developed yet in the first place. Let me introduce the model that I'll be working with today. Firstly, I will show you three precedents that have already taken place where such bans have worked. The 1983 Convention on Conventional Weapons, the 1995 Protocol on Blinding Lasers, and the 2004 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 on weapons of mass destruction. These bans, yes? In these kinds of situations, we think it's far more likely that a robot will follow things like the laws of war because that can be programmed. The same guarantee does not exist for humans. I'm not sure I exactly understand how that point comes here, but we'll actually get to robots following the rules of war in my first argument, which they cannot do, and I will demonstrate that."

                "text": "Even if only one of these layers holds up argumentation, any and all use of killer robots is illegal and a crime against humanity. Now first, let me get to proportionality. The international humanitarian law prohibits disproportionate attacks in which civilian harm outweighs military benefits. These concepts are abstract, not easily quantified, and highly relative to specific contexts of subjective estimates of value. Humans are better suited to make such value judgments, which cannot be boiled down to a simple algorithm. Military necessity dictates that military force should only be used against the enemy to the extent necessary for winning the war. Imagine a scenario where a killer robot has already shot a person once. How would they know that it is necessary to shoot them again? For safety reasons, it might shoot them again when it's not necessarily humiliating the dead body. Now this will have impacts I will get to later. No thank you. But first let me get to distinction, the bedrock principle of international humanitarian rule. It says that the Geneva Convention states that combatants must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants. Attacks that fail to distinguish are indiscriminate and unlawful. It is as simple as that. Fully autonomous weapons will not have the ability to sense or interpret the difference between soldiers and civilians. Especially in contemporary combat environments, asymmetric conflicts in urban populations has become the norm. They offer no true distinguishing uniform or insignia. Firstly, insurgents could trick these robots by concealing their weapons, but most importantly humans understand one another in a way that machines cannot. Cues can be subtle and there are an infinite number of circumstances where lethal force is inappropriate. For example, imagine a frightened mother may run after her two children and yell at them to stop playing with toy guns near a soldier. A human soldier could easily identify with the mother's fear and the children's gain and thus recognize their intentions as harmless, while a fully autonomous weapon might only see an angry person running toward it with two armed individuals. Now the first level of impact is that this would break international law, but even more importantly, that innocent men, women, and children would be killed unnecessarily. And a third level of impact would be that it is shown that if civilians are killed or even humiliated, then there will be greater retribution, greater resistance movements, and thus prolonged conflict."

But this is especially important in war, where the stakes are so high. If someone does something bad, they must be punished and their mistake must be corrected. Now, not being physically close to a person you're harming makes it much easier to do harm. The Milgram experiment in the 1960s showed that people are willing to incur surprising levels of harm on others if they are separated by them and ordered by an authority figure. Programming killer robots is also rather impersonal. You work with criteria, algorithm and lines of code, but that have the same impact as pulling the trigger. Now, first of all, programmers this way will not experience PTSD, which otherwise would force people to think twice. Furthermore, just like in video games where you can die repeatedly, you can act irresponsibly without fearing the consequences. A programmer might be reprimanded, but they're not going to feel the guilt of 10 years prison or the guilt of having killed two innocent lives. Now, the impact of this argument is that it breaks the UN Chapter 7 and the Geneva Convention because it causes unnecessary harm on these people, which is especially important because, well, we may never stop warfare. We can make it more humane. And that is what we stand for today. Thank you very much."

It means that all of their argumentation about robots being completely incapable of judging these sorts of things fall because we would extensively, extensively test this technology to the point where it is able to do this and would not deploy this technology if it failed to do so. With that, let's introduce some rebuttal to all of their case. Before, they had two main arguments about humaneness and increasing distance, but they also had this one-off line about increasing arms races. We think this is true of all military technology, not unique to LAWs, and not really important in this round. Well, let's talk about their first argument about improving humaneness. Let's just point out, we have a number of responses. First, that humans have violated literally every single one of these standards. They say that if LAWs violate even one of these standards, we do not deploy them. This is just kind of an inevitable consequence, and we think it's actually more likely in a world where humans are engaging in this warfare. That's the comparative. Second, we already talked about our model. If it is inconsistent with any of these ideas, we wouldn't deploy it. But third and finally, let's just talk about what humans do on the battlefield, right? When you're under fire and are under super stressful conditions where you're having to make split-second decisions about whom to kill and whom not to kill when you're fearing for your life, you're very unlikely to be able to think in split seconds about proportionality and military necessity and distinguishing between civilians. We think that LAWs, because they just are technologically superior, are able to account for all of this much better and actually adhere to the laws of war far better. We'll explain more about this in our first argument. On to their second argument, they told you that by increasing distance, we increase violence. This was kind of a bit assertive, and we think actually the opposite is true, that when we have programmers deciding about the parameters under which LAWs are going to operate, they're much more likely to be more conservative and avoid things like civilian casualties and the like, decreasing the irrational decision-making on the battlefield that we think is so problematic. But our second response to this is basically their argument civilian casualties and the like, decreasing the irrational decision-making on the battlefield that we think is so problematic. But our second response to this is basically their argument is that we need soldiers to feel ridiculously traumatized after they kill someone in order to reduce their ability to do so. We don't really think that that is principally justified. We don't think that subjecting millions of people to mass amounts of PTSD is a legitimate way to reduce conflict, there are other ways to do it that our side does better."

                "text": "With that, let's introduce our first argument about how LAWs reduce wartime atrocities. Two ideas under this. The first is that they prevent human atrocities because they don't have human fallibilities. Again, the comparative here is humans, who are worse for two reasons. First is fear. In life and death situations, when there are bullets and bombs whizzing by your head there is overwhelming incentives to act irrationally. This leads to soldiers doing things like flinching and shooting a civilian and projecting that fear into other situations. One of the main reasons that sexual assault is so high in conflict zones is because soldiers attempt to regain power and control after feeling helpless and terrified in violent war zones. The second problem with humans is with retributive rage. Governments use nationalism to motivate soldiers to demonize the enemy, to get them to do all of the horrible things that are necessary for soldiers to do in war. This explains how soldiers come to see eventually their enemies as effectively non-human, leading them to commit some of the worst atrocities in warfare. This looks like the atrocious torture that happened in the Abu Ghraib prison during human engagements in the Middle East. Could bad governments not use this technology to kill siblings the same way they do now? We think that bad governments are going to exist on both sides of the house, and they're going to use the same dehumanizing tactics for their soldiers to get them to commit these atrocities and worse. We think it is incredibly unlikely that a cool-headed room of programmers, military officials, and civilian leaders who all have to buy in to the kind of programming that LAWs have to have in order to be built are going to do things like program robots to rape or torture civilians, which are incredibly unstrategic things to do. All of this buy-in limits the possibility of that happening. In contrast, when one terrified soldier on the opposite side of their home country, who literally does not think that a Vietnamese woman is human, decides to rape that Vietnamese woman, all it takes is buy-in from that one terrified soldier. That is much less likely in a world where we have to have all of this accountability before deploying LAWs. Let's Vietnamese woman, all it takes is buy-in from that one terrified soldier that is much less likely in a world where we have to have all of this accountability before deploying LAWs. Let's get to the second idea under this argument, that we record and report atrocities that happen when human members of the military would otherwise stay silent. Platoons of soldiers are often incredibly intensely loyal to one another, they're in conflict zones together, and they really don't want to inform on one another, even when they do horrific, atrocious things. We think this is less likely in a world where LAWs are directly monitoring the situation. We'd even be happy to send this footage directly to civilian leaders to ensure that accountability happens."

                "text": "But our second argument is that LAWs enable militaries to better protect all people. Two ideas under this. The first is that they increase defensive capacities. Remember that this debate is not just about offensive military robots. It's also about defensive things like, say, the U.S.'s Phalanx system, which is an LAW that automatically shoots down missiles without any kind of human intervention and does so way more effectively because of technological limitations surrounding humans than they possibly can. These defensive mechanisms are really important because we think it's government's obligation to defend their soldiers in a way that human operators technologically can't. They have an obligation to protect the citizens who pay taxes to them, follow their laws, fight and die for them, and we think improving defensive capacities in addition to offensive ones is very important. Our second idea under this argument is that we improve choices about when to use offensive capacities. Intervention without LAWs is worse because we fail to intervene in humanitarian cases because there are political risks from soldier casualties. There are already plenty of incentives to go to war for geopolitical reasons or things like resource extraction, and we already see governments doing that on their side in the status quo. What we don't see governments doing is intervening in things like genocide in other countries that don't pose a direct threat to their own security and means you're in protected time and means that it's really hard to justify politically for soldiers to intervene. This looks like things like missions the US not deploying troops to Rwanda where there's a horrific genocide happening because they fear political backlash akin to political backlash that happened in the 90s when a humanitarian mission was shot down in Somalia. We do not have these risks on our side of the house. Saving millions of people like Tutsi minorities that were massacred during these genocides, we're very proud to oppose. Thank you. Thank you.

Basically they came up here and tell us that actually they will only deploy these killer robots since there's extensive testing and that we can be 100% sure and actually we will just shut them down if they do something bad. First of all, they hugely mischaracterize their whole case. Basically, what we know about killer robots is that they can search, find, and execute, right? So they are basically thinking on their own, acting on their own, meaning that they cannot only just develop their own language and act on their own. The people who are actually over them, we lose, actually, in the end, a certain kind of control over these robots, right? So we tell you that this is only an ideal world where this can actually happen. And if team opposition tries to make this case, they're actually conceding from their burden where we are actually arguing about lethal autonomous weapons which are actually 100% AI, who can actually think, do stuff for themselves, and actually harm citizens on their own and think on their own. So what did we hear as a rebuttal from them? So basically we had this first argument about how we have right now three pillars of international law in the current international framework about proportionality, necessity, and distinction. And they just disregarded our whole argument and said that, no, these will actually be better because we'll have killer robots which will be 100% sure and doing everything what we do. But ladies and gentlemen, the main issue is that even if we have those very good killer robots, we are telling you that they cannot really fit into the current international model of law, right? So we tell you that there's proportionality, that there will be actually certain cases where these robots won't be able to determine that when to actually shoot someone or not shoot someone, is it actually needed to win that certain war, or is it not needed? And we tell you that it's very hard to distinction in these cases where we don't have this, right? And lastly, our first speaker already told you that we see that the main issue here is not only that this does not fit into the current international law, and we need to reform that before, but also that we will lose a certain kind of responsibility because we don't know who was the person who actually didn't make the distinction before that competent or the soldier, right? We won't know that who will be the one who actually harms citizens unnecessarily because there will be only programmers sitting behind the screen. No, thank you."

They are characterizing humans as savages, basically, who just go out because there were certain atrocities in certain wars, and therefore they characterize humans I will take you, as savages all over.

So what do we see? I will give you three levels of analysis on lowering the barriers of war. So we'll tell you why is it easier to start a war when there's actually these killer robots in place, why there will be civilians disproportionately suffering after this motion is in place, and why there will be a bigger backlash on especially developing nations. So what we see is that right now in the status quo, actually their states are not starting wars because they see the human casualty, right? We saw that in the Second World War, in the Vietnam War, and in war that people will, states will first think about how many humans can they actually kind of sacrifice for this cause, right? So if we won't have these casualties, then it will be much easier for states to just start the war, right? Because there won't be anything to think about. In the Vietnam War, as I already told you, people were protesting because their brothers were dying. So we tell you that if there's not such an issue for a country it will be much easier for them to start the war and they will, and they will actually. So what we are telling telling you that there will be civilians actually bearing the consequences right because we tell you that war is bad in itself even if it's fought with robots even if no so to speak combatants or not so to speak civilians are dying why because there will be devastation in the area where the war is happening right infrastructure will be damaged and all shipping will get into the certain era businesses will go out of operation as a result, people won't be able to have access to water, food or anything, the environment will be damaged for years, the shells will need to be collected and landmines will be all over the place. So we are telling you that even if in the long term we see that these areas where wars were happening, even with robots, CBNs will actually bear the backlash because they will be the ones suffering. Lastly, developing countries will be the ones bearing the backlash because countries who are rich won't be fighting on their own lands they will just go out for proxy war for example to Syria and have their own robots fight there because it's much easier and their infrastructure and their own civilian population won't be harmed that's why it's much easier for the US to start wars in the Middle East because there's no harm on their harmed. That's why it's much easier for the U.S. to start wars in the Middle East, because there's no harm on their side, and that's why Europe was devastated after two world wars, because it actually happened on their land. So because on our side, there are ways for more humane warfare, we are so proud to propose that. Thank you."

This is not what the debate is about. We think they have completely missed what the heart of this round ought to be about. We think we're already ahead. In this speech, I'm first going to be engaging with all of the material that we've heard so far, coming out of the proposition, before secondly delivering our third substantive argument that analyzes the human cost of going to war. But now let's get into this first idea. They talk about how lethal autonomous weapons violate international law. We have a number of responses. First off, note that in their last speech they never once engaged with it. Ella tells you and makes very clear in her first speech that actually having lethal autonomous weapons decreases conflict overall. Why is this the case? We talked to you about the idea that lethal autonomous weapons can be used in specific instances and more surgically to actually have better identification of what actual targets are. For example, if we think a soldier comparatively is on the battlefield and they see someone approaching them, they're much more likely to actually depend on things like fear, anger, and self-preservation to act retributively instead of actually defensively. We think that on our side of the house, we actually help civilians more. But the second thing that we told you underneath this pragmatic point is that weapons will still be tested before they're deployed, meaning that we can actually test to ensure that a robot can distinguish, for example, between a farmer holding a pitchfork or a rebel holding an AK-47, or a child holding a rock and a militant holding a pitchfork or a rebel holding an AK-47 or a child holding a rock and a militant holding a grenade before deploying it. We think that all the mechanistic quibbles they have are just that and we don't think that's the actual comparative in the debate. But now let's really get into this issue about violating international law. We think that first, similarly to any time international law is violated in war, accountability can still exist for lethal autonomous weapons. Note, the proposition never gives us a reason for why lethal autonomous weapons would not be held liable to the same international law. In the highest ground, we first tell you the idea that lethal autonomous weapons are less likely to commit these kinds of crimes, but if they were, we assume that in some cases, lethal autonomous weapons might malfunction. We still think we can hold two actors accountable that in and of themselves prevent these kinds of crimes from occurring in the first place. The first actor that we would be happy to hold accountable is a programmer who caused a lethal autonomous weapon to perform an operation that violates international law. Similar to how one can track individual edits on a Google Doc, programmers can individually be held liable. We think that for that specific code they contribute. The second is the war general who chooses to deploy an LAW. I think we already talked about this enough in our model in our first speech, and we think that generals have an incentive to be selective in deploying LAWs, meaning they're less likely to put them in situations that warrant these kinds of international law breaking in the first place. But let's really engage with the comparative. If a human soldier breaks international law, what do we tell you in our first speech? For example, with the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, where U.S. soldiers murdered and raped 500 men, women, and children, even in spite of the fact that they believe that humans are all benevolent actors that are capable of complex decision-making whenever they feel threatened. We think accountability relies entirely on fellow soldiers reporting on their friends. Human loyalty prevents accountability. That wasn't our first argument. They failed to engage. But now let's compare that to lethal autonomous weapons and prove why we went on this point. We think lethal autonomous weapons create a concrete trail. If you believe their argument is true of accountability, that's a reason to oppose. But now let's engage their second argument on distance."

We think that rather it continued in spite of the will of the people. But now, engaging with their third argument on this idea of decreasing the threshold for war. First off, we think that the threshold for war is already pretty low. They give us no distinct reasons why lethal autonomous weapons will distinctly actually lead to this impact. But secondly, we think that in some cases, yes, it does happen, but those cases are actually beneficial to the extent that we actually see a conflict, that we actually see intervention be more likely. It actually looks like what we tell you about in our second argument with things like humanitarian intervention. Why is this the case? Because nations that did not have an incentive before to intervene to conflicts that didn't actually threaten their own national security, now are able to do so without putting the lives of their own civilians at risk, for example, in the Rwanda genocide. But we think that on this final argument they give us about developing nations, it has internal tension with their armed race argument. We think that yes, wealthy countries probably will always have an advantage but if their arm-wrestling argument is true we think that having greater production of lethal autonomous weapons then means that countries that are developing are able to access them even more. But finally on these two other arguments they give us about tech about about the actual machines being unreliable we think they can be tested in the first place programming resolves the problems. And on this issue of lethal autonomous weapons being costly, we think comparatively it's less costly to have an entire military training and deployment. If anything, LAWs protect the economy trade-off that governments otherwise have to make with the military while still being able to actually help to preserve the lives of their own soldiers and civilians."

Before I go on, I'll take a point of information if you have one. Yes, so... Go on. Go on. So in such a case when there is a self-learning device, how could you hold a programmer accountable and responsible for such an act? Because we think that you can track specific pieces of programming that individuals do. That's why I gave the example of the Google Doc. We think it works in a much similar fashion. But now let's get into our third substantive argument about how it's immoral for governments to deploy humans. We think first off that these autonomous weapons limit the situations where governments have to put their citizens at risk of substantial harm in the first place. Obviously, war has massive costs. Sending soldiers into a field with potential landmines is unjust whenever we could be sending an autonomous armed robotic vehicle. Additionally, soldiers that do survive often face massive trauma, such as PTSD, shell shock, or actual anxiety and depression that can last them a lifetime from either having to see their own fellow soldiers die or nearly be threatened to kill themselves. We think that that has not one deterred war, but secondly, these costs are augmented by the fact that the most vulnerable people are often likeliest to become soldiers. People who face extreme adversity in their lives and often have less to lose by going into the military or have no other option for financial reasons or because a court has given them the option of military or jail often choose to join the military. We think militaries around the world deliberately attract high school age teens. For example in Britain they had a deliberate campaign to attract teens from low income communities. The wealthy often can avoid military service entirely, such as whenever the Peruvian government reinstated the draft in 2013 that allowed for a $715 fine to skip military service. Given that a person's life is their most central right as a person, because it's a precondition to all other rights, it should only be sacrificed whenever it's absolutely necessary. We think lethal autonomous weapons eliminate the need"

But the second is subtle coercion, including recruiting heavily from vulnerable communities, but it also means engaging in misleading nationalism and actual misinformation campaigns. We think this unduly coerces individuals into fighting, depriving them of the ability to make rational and informed decisions.

So first of all what they said just in the first speech, in the developing speech, is that they are going to monitor this monitor technology, they are monitoring these weapons and these little autonomous weapons so humans can shut it down. I would like to really shortly say as the motion said, that's all you can read in this room, that a clarification with the motion was these weapons operate without human intervention. This means humans are out of the loop and not on the loop as the side opposition has presented it. So this means that no humans cannot even shut these weapons down. We let these weapons down on the street and they can decide what to kill and they can decide what they want without any human interaction or shutting down. And second of all with testing these devices because it was something that they continuously brought up and we just want to make a comment on that. No thank you you. No, thank you. I'm going to take it later on. With neural networks and how these systems actually work and how it makes testing actually impossible because any interaction with this environment means unanticipated interaction with this environment and new data implemented in these self-learning machines. What it means basically in practicality is when we put right data, they can identify right targets. For example example the other enemy's military devices or the soldier's clothes they can identify them because of the good data however when we test these devices they can implement wrong data such as a civilian's clothes and no thank you and the next time what they're going to do is because we do not have control because this is how this stuff learning of external intelligence works they're gonna identify these civilians by these testing methods and they're gonna shut those one down and this is something we cannot prevent and even the highest professionals within this industry say that this is going to be one of the biggest problem with this AI so second"

Let's take two scenarios in this point. A, what they are saying, there are two possibilities. We let robots out on the street and also few soldiers and humans. Let's say it is a short-term solution. So what it causes is that there are these weapons that we are not sure we can control and also these human soldiers, so the brutality will not be solved. The second scenario, Scenario B, is that there are no soldiers in the long run, only these robots. So what happens is both countries only use robots and not soldiers so we can prevent brutality more and more. That's why I'm going to explain with a short analysis now to you dear judges. So why, let's imagine in a word what they are saying that there are only robots and protecting. This works on the short term until one side has these robots, no thank you, and can protect their citizens to be friends. However, imagine when both sides have these robots and because we can actually make these robots very friends because they're not humans and not giving birth, we can reproduce these robots and they simply just be bombed. So what is the next value in our society that we must attend? Civilians. Because we cannot reproduce human rights that fast. So the barriers of war and the meaning of war are only robots, no thank you, is first of all yes we might bomb others robots. But does it lead war anywhere? No. It's the resources that lead war and what the sides are war. The societies, the members who pay taxes, who actually go and have the economy. And this is what is going to be at risk by their model. Now I would like to move on to the amount of debt that I said. First of all, it's short term that only one side has these weapons. It is okay. However, we in our case would not allow even the development, so it is impossible in our case to have even one side of these robots and this is why we solved the problem at the very beginning."

When it comes to strategy, programmers and war generals have no incentive to deploy LAWs only to kill civilians, especially if international law is such an effective check. First of all, the first problem with this POI was that self-learning part that I've already elaborated on, that we do not know exactly how these weapons are going to work. And second of all, yes, programmers might not have this belief, however what happens in real life is really different what they are trying to say. So what happens is that first of all, I'm not saying that these weapons are gonna attack civilians because they are programmed to. I'm saying that in a world where robots target each other and kill each other, the only value in war is gonna be taking civilian lives because there are no human soldiers on the battlefield anymore. And it is not going to be the weapons that should kill them because they are programmed to do so. It is supposed to be a really positive future. But then the whole scenario of a war will change because the only matter will be resources and human lives. And this is what Ornstein's proposition would like to prevent. And even what they're saying is that we should not solve this problem because humans have fear, but they think that it is good. We are saying they're for their side, but they are saying that it is good for our side because it prevents actually people from killing more and more people. And what we have provided to you is that our scenario when someone is really distant from someone being killed. Imagine a video game."

It's hard to believe that an intensely programmed piece of autonomous technology that can siphon through information within a matter of seconds is supposedly a worse actor than, say, a 19-year-old kid drafted into war, holding a gun, watching their friends die beside them, having bullets grazed past them because they, quote-unquote, have compassion. They belong there. We don't think that that's a justifiable response to being able to pull millions of people a year into war scenes because supposedly they're going to act rationally. We think down the bench we've proven that that's not the case, and I'm happy to do even more analysis of that in my speech. But in this speech I'll be doing a few things. The first is I'll be going over one major clarification for today's debate so we can truly address the true comparative before moving on to discussing two key questions such as to summarize it. The first, on which side does what's best for the protection of people? The second, on which side does what's best for the advancements in war? But onto the first thing that we really need to clarify in today's debate. We think that Psy's proposition has given you a complete mischaracterization of what the usage of LAWs truly looks like. What have we heard from their side? LAWs are simply slaughter bots that raise havoc all over areas, they simply kill innocent mothers and children, they want to ultimately harm everybody, and the worst part, they can't be turned off. There's no way to be able to place a check on them, there's no way to hold them accountable. We don't think that this is necessarily what the reasonable ground is in today's debate, insofar that we've given you two very, very rational responses. The first is that when they efficiently, we think that LAWs are designed to efficiently commit lethal autonomous actions that would have been committed by human beings in the first place, so much so that they're programmed to act and under certain jurisdiction that has already been announced from certain countries. All the laws and regulations that they speak of is something that would be programmed within these lethal autonomous weapons, not something that you can simply program within a human being who is simply trying to save their own life. But secondly, we do think that there's certainly a clear reason as to why we can shut them off. I think it's completely irrational to think that people would create this killer bot that would go out there and find a third being, but simply wouldn't be able to be turned off."

                "text": "Now, on to the first question in today's debate, which is which side does what's best for the protection of people. Two major central ideas emerged under this point. The first idea is under soldiers. Now, under this point, we gave you a very, very crucial argument that Emily delivered to you very well in her second speech. We told you that when governments are faced with the choice between a piece of technology or hundreds of thousands of soldiers living within their country, they should always have the obligation to choose the viable alternative to ultimately do that. What we heard from side of proposition was no response. They completely dropped this in third substantive that was very, very crucial to today's debate, especially because soldiers are sometimes the most vulnerable people within society. One, because of drafts, we think that a lot of times deferrals for drafts only go to the privileged in society, keeping them protected. We're the most vulnerable within the nation or have to go out and fight these wars. Furthermore, we think there's a lot of coercion that's involved within these military campaigns. It looks like poor people going to war so they can escape poverty. That's what their war looks like. Ultimately, we think that the choice for LAWs guarantees two key things. The first is a massive reduction in the amount of casualties. Why is this the case? When LAWs are actively replacing human combatants, that means that there's less human combatants out on the battlefield to die. That's very simple and intuitive here. We think that we're ultimately saving massive amounts of lives. But secondly, we told you that you're actually able to prevent massive amounts of mental disorders from people that do escape these wars. They often suffer from things like PTSD and shell shock. It speaks volumes to these disorders that only after wars or atrocities were occurred, people discover what these true disorders really were. We think that ultimately, when side proposition tells you that you need these in order to stop war, that's not the case. War would have stopped years ago if people truly stopped wars when people got PTSD or when people got depression or anxiety attacks after leaving the war scene. Countries will always go to war. We think that that's something that's inevitable. We have to evaluate who's going to be beneficial. But the second central idea that emerged here was based on civilians. Ultimately, we gave you a lot of analysis on why there are discussion about human descent can be able to stop wars altogether. We told you Vietnam War did not end because people protested in the streets of America. No, it ended because America lost and wasn't supposed to be there in the first place. Secondly, we think that all the atrocities of rape and violence are unique to human beings being in the battlefield because of the three key reasons that we told you down the bench, but I'm going to get into that further in the next question. Lastly, we got this new argument in the third speech talking about how civilians will simply become the new target because there's less LA dogs, because there's less humans like soldiers in the first place. Three key responses. Firstly, we think that human soldiers don't completely disappear in our world. We think they just substantially decrease, meaning that there's still going to be engagement with human beings. Secondly, we think that the target is not going to become civilians ever because LAWs are programmed to act under international law, where international law distinctly says that civilians will never be the target. Furthermore, if we truly want to talk about saving civilian lives in wars, pull humans out. Humans constantly target civilians in wars. We've seen it in the Syrian war right now. We've seen it in the Vietnam war, which they would like to talk about. We've seen it in the Korean war. It's always been a target. We think that humans distinctly don't have a problem with doing it because they always see them as the enemy. But now, before I get into the second question, I'll take a point. There will be no humans actually involved anymore. Don't you think that it will be easier for states to start the war? We don't think that the necessary argument about people not being going to war is really a reason as to why there will be a decrease in the amount of war. Ultimately, people go to war regardless of whatever the thing is going to be that's holding them back. We don't think that human cost is the true reason that holds people back from going to war. That's why there's still massive amounts of war on a day-to-day basis."

The first is the amount of time that you spend in war. The second is the amount of time that you spend in war. The second is the amount of lives that you lose in war. And lastly, the destruction to the regions caused by the war, right? How does LAW uniquely solve these kinds of things? We think that they process information on military operations extremely quicker than humans ever could, making sure that things get done quicker, ultimately saving the amount of time that people have to spend in these regions. That's how we're actually truly able to prevent this in the long term. But furthermore, we are happy to engage with the true comparative in today's debate. We gave you three key reasons as to why humans are always going to be a significantly worse actor in times of war. Fear. They told you that simply, no, they'll dissent.

That's where you actually see irrational decision making. That's where you see a decrease in mercy. Why do you LAWs uniquely work better? We think that they have no emotions. Simply what they're programmed to do within the confines of what standards have already been given to them. They autonomously act with the constraints that have already been given to them. But secondly, we think that there's massive amounts of accountability. Every LAW has a paper trail. They're always going to be able to see every single action that LAW has made. That means that you're going to be able to hold them accountable in the long term. At the highest ground, we say LAWs are risky and they don't act humane.

I'm angry, I'm scared, there are bullets whizzing by my head, and I miss my mom. It is hard enough for me in this round to juggle all of the arguments that are going on. It would be exponentially harder for me as an 18-year-old on a battlefield to juggle bullets whizzing by my head and every single code of international humanitarian law that they expect humans to uphold on their side of the house. The comparative in this debate of LAWs that can be programmed to take all of this into account is far, far better. We're so"

                "text": "proud to oppose. Two questions in the speech. First, which side decreases atrocities? Second question, which side betters conflict? First on atrocities. Again, this was their argument about humaneness and distance. We've sufficiently proved that neither of these things really happens with humans. We tell you that LAWs that are created by an army of civilian programmers, in addition to civilian leaders and military leaders, are far more likely to be cool-headed when they're removed from the conflict and they're able to just program LAWs to operate strategically to perform missions to the best of their ability. They're not going to program LAWs to do things like rape or torture civilians at the point where that's really unstrategic. But even if the technology misses and fails on the battlefield despite extensive testing and does something bad, here's the difference. I can pull the plug on that LAW and take it off of the battlefield. When Soviet soldiers are massacring 350 civilians and disemboweling pregnant women, we can't pull the plug on them. We can with an LAW that is monitored by an officer. And we'd be happy to hold that officer accountable if they watch while an LAW commits all of these atrocities and stand by and do nothing. Furthermore, we can take that technology off the battlefield and reprogram it to make sure it never does that again. You can never do that with a human. On the point of decreasing atrocity alone in a world where conflict to some degree is inevitable, we take the debate. But second, let's talk about which side betters conflict in both worlds. Their main argument here was that we decrease barriers to war. We had a lot of responses to this that didn't receive practically any engagement. We told you governments already go to war for massively problematic geopolitical reasons like getting resources and things like that. But second, we told you in our third argument, it is the most vulnerable populations in these countries that are sent to war. Those who can't afford to pay the fee to escape the draft. Those with no other options. Those that governments explicitly target to pull them into war. Those with the least ability in society to stand up and say, hey, please don't send me to war. These are people that are disposable to the government. We think it is, first of all, wrong for the government to deploy them when they have another option. But second, it's unlikely that rich people in society are going to stand up for these individuals. But third and finally, third, we told you that protests of the Vietnam War weren't the sorts of things that ended it. And finally, the cases where we do go to war because we have to reduce the threshold are things like humanitarian interventions. But they also told you that we're going to increasingly target civilians because some futuristic machine-on-machine exclusively war is going to happen. We told you in Layla's speech that for the foreseeable future, this technology, note, in a lot of cases hasn't been developed yet. There are still going to be human soldiers on the battlefield. But second, we told you that if it is the case that these technologies are just being programmed to shoot down civilians, we obviously would not deploy them. We still believe in humanitarian standards. Third and finally, let's talk about civilian casualties in the Vietnam War, in World War I and II, and any other conflict. They are massive. Because soldiers, scared for their lives, don't care about civilians, we think it's far more likely on our side of the house that LAWs will, very proud to oppose."

Taking opposition at their best still means that the amount of conflict is going to increase, which is our third argument, which they basically haven't addressed at all. Because they agreed in their first and second argument that because there would be LAWs, humans wouldn't have to be used, and therefore people would intervene more readily, for example in humanitarian crises. then in the third speech they said that human cost doesn't actually impact and the human cost doesn't and hold people back into going to comfort first of all that's a direct contradiction in terms which country completely undermines the first and second arguments of the first and second speaker and but even more importantly it means that they agree with us and they concede that the actual likelihood of people going to war with LAWs now being government is significantly increased because governments don't have to hold their people back this means that our third argument which means that the amount of conflict will increase has the conclusion and the impact that even if conflict, even if conflict becomes a bit better or significantly better, if there are no impact of war, if people can go to war with the same kind of casualty as opening up your Xbox and playing a video game, then people will go to war. Because it is worth it for economic economic reasons and for other reasons. But as we already agreed with team opposition, war is horrible. And we must do everything we can to limit the amount of war we have and to increase to the maximum the humaneness of that war. So even if the humaneness is undecided, because the amount of war will increase, which they have conceded,"

And therefore, because we've won this debate on all accounts, and even on the fifth flashpoint, which didn't come up because they didn't address our distance argument either, no refutations on that, by the way, I hold that we have completely won this debate in the better conflict. But even if they have gotten that, the amount of conflict will increase. And therefore, you must vote the proposition. Even if we can't stop war, we must make it more normal. Thank you very much."

Honourable panel, the Belt and Road Initiative is a Chinese immensely ambitious development strategy which purposes to control world trade and change the global power balance towards China. China plans to invest $900 billion into connecting the Eurasian and African countries with China through six land-based economic corridors and an ocean-going maritime support. This is done by investing into expensive infrastructure projects in other nations."

Either the states find themselves in debt traps to the Chinese government, or if they have no hope of paying back alone, they would have to give away their infrastructure to China, ports, roads, railways, or even their territory. Both of these options are horrific, and Team Estonia is very proud to regret the Belt and Road Initiative. But let's let the filter into this Belt and Belt and Road Initiative. Most of these nations are emerging economies, and even without the Belt and Road Initiative, are experiencing economic growth and moving towards a positive direction. Ethiopia has 10% and Pakistan has 7% of GDP growth. And the same is in most of the nations that host the initiative. Now the growth means that they are fighting without Chinese investments in the long run and will likely build the same scale infrastructure with their own capital without taking loans and giving away their infrastructure just after 50 years or so. But notice that there are also other alternatives like international government banks or private capital that has always incentive to help the cheap workforce. So now our whole case for today is why the initiatives of HARP are much worse than waiting for these nations to get on their feet by themselves or with the help of other actors."

Before we move on to my first argument, do you think Donald Trump would provide better trade opportunities for Pakistan? We believe that, of course, Pakistan has other trade opportunities rather than with China. We don't believe that China is the only one who is able to provide trade opportunities for the belt and road initiative. But notice that we don't regret China doing bilateral agreements with separate states, which states have the legitimacy to control them themselves. We just regret the initiative where these individual states have very little capability of deciding for themselves."

States care mainly about two things, their sovereignty and their economic prosperity. Here are three reasons how the host nations' economies will be damaged. Firstly, China offers predatory loans to these nations, which means the high interest rates that drain these States' budget are in place. Now, China gave Sri Lanka a low interest rate of 6.3%, while the interest rate of the World Bank and the National Development Bank were only 3% for similar loans. So the unfair loans make states directly poorer in the long run. Second way how it harms the economy is that China takes hold of their infrastructure and hence damaging them. Sri"

Furthermore, China now dictates what products flow through its ports, roads and railways, so it prioritises China's stations and current interests instead of bringing these states benefits. China is currently bringing in her manufacturing groups, while the Sri Lankan economy actually needs raw materials so desperately. China also does this in other countries like Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and the states are earning more benefit from the infrastructure that they will build, hence leading them in debt just to serve the interests of another nation. Now, the very last reason of how their economy will be damaged is that the initiative influences local markets and manufacturers very negatively. The Belt and Road Initiative makes it key to Chinese growth and more accessible in these nations, which means that these nations' own products often can't compete and local sectors and companies are pushed out of the market. Madagascar's tech side industry suffered after China's company started exporting their own product into Madagascar through the Belt and Road Initiative. So their impact is that if you come close to China, the local people are left poor and jobless, even more than they were before the initiative."

There are more of them due to the increased business of China now with the Belt and Road Initiative. In Kazakhstan, the only kindergarten in the area was shut down due to Chinese government lobby in order for Chinese workers working on a Belt and Road Initiative project for building them a hospital so the kindergarten was closed. And it was also the Chinese size of other issues in foreign policy. China can now influence other nations to support its actions in the territorial disputes because they are economically dependent on China. China offered development aid to Brunei and Laos so it could support its controversial actions, militarily seizing other nations' territories and assault China's sea in order for them to get development aid. So this means that small states are afraid of lagging behind China and hence they obey. So this allows more parts of China to exercise an aggressive foreign policy that before you had an incentive to do that right now."

                "text": "But now, let me move on to my second argument that describes the global impacts of China expanding their power. Military expansion is an inherent part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The reason why China is willing to execute a project that's so expensive and yet likely to fail is because it enables them to expand their power militarily. China needs to protect its economic rights and guarantee the stability on the way. So China has already said that in order to afford the Djibouti that they build to work, they need to keep their military present in order to protect it. They have already put this in Djibouti, they have brought into Pakistan 150,000 special security division to protect the road. They have plans to build military bases in Afghanistan, in Poland, and they are likely to build more bases all over the world once the initiative advances. Two very destructive impact from that when China builds these bases. Firstly, it raises tensions, and secondly, it increases the risk of a direct military conflict. Firstly, it raises tensions because political tensions and worries of other nations are very unlikely to support China's military expansion. My sons, America has over 800 military bases stationed all outside its own territory, including in Guam and South Korea. So why should America be allowed to do that and not China? Sure, I got your point. We believe that yes, the USA has already very many military bases. However, the less military bases you have in the world, especially from conflicting powers, the more secure to have. And this is exactly what I'm talking about right now. So firstly, political tensions are likely to increase because other nations are not very happy with China's real estate basis. Vietnam and China already have tensions due to China expanding their influence in the South China Sea. So that means less cooperation between the states, economically and politically, possibly meaning sanctions and inability to solve regional problems together. But furthermore, it increases the risk of a direct military conflict, something that the POI is answering to. In South China Sea, China often sends its warships to counter foreign forces. USA is protecting their bases in Guam, and China is likely to do that with other bases also. The more military bases next to each other with armed soldiers, the likely is a skirmish or a military accidental conflict between them. So, panel, the Belt and Road Initiative is only beneficial for China and very destructive for our little nations and also the whole world if it doesn't bring security. For all these reasons, I beg you to report. Take a deep breath. I would like to thank the first speaker of the commission for their speech, and we'd like to invite the first speaker of the commission"

                "text": "Because what they wanted to tell us was the alternative for these countries was some sort of natural growth, and these countries were doing fine anyway because Pakistan's GDP is on the rise. The fact of the matter is Pakistan is only experiencing GDP growth because China has been investing in it in the Belt and Road Initiative. And the fact that it has a GDP of less than 1500 US dollars per capita shows that there is an inability for them to do that on their own. The alternative for these people is subsistence farming and abject poverty. We don't think that's something you can stand from today's debate. It was quite telling when they said there were other trade opportunities which they could have. This is simply false. No country wants to trade with, like, Tajikistan except for China because it has a road to Europe. There is no incentive for the West to develop that area. Their first argument about regionalized impacts. Firstly, they wanted to tell us about predatory loans. We think that the conditions set by these loans are particularly fair, especially when reflecting the risk China has put in, into investing into these countries that might not be all-pronged. Their argument about debt-to-equity swaps. We tell you firstly that this is a small minority of cases. The studies have shown this is only at risk in 8 out of the 63 mountain road countries. But secondly, that these countries still get the benefits from these things. So say there was a hydropower dam that China did a debt for equity swap. Citizens in that country still get the power from that dam, even though China owns it. The third sub-point in this point about China dictating which products go to the ports, like in Madagascar, we say that this is not usually the case, such as in the Guadalajara and Pakistan, where Pakistan is able to put its own first through. But even in software, it is that Madagascar gets raw materials from China, and that's good for them as well. Their second argument is about global impacts. They told you that these countries wouldn't have much, would be aligned with China and all their foreign policy, and that's fair. We think the reality is these countries don't have much territorial power anyway, and perhaps it's probably good for them to have an ally that is powerful in the first place. But then when they told us that that raised tensions because of military bases, we think it was quite telling that in response to our point of information they supported the US global hegemony over international military alliances. We say that on the counterfactual, China will still always pursue strategic interests. It is not that by removing the Belt and Road Initiative you get rid of all the incentives for China to devalue militarily. So they don't solve that anymore. And we will prove why we do the way we actually de-escalate tensions in the South China Sea later in my hour."

Recognise that these nations often find it very difficult to attract investment from the West, because the West's investment is tied purely to its geopolitical goals. That's why we saw the United States investing in South America, because they helped reduce the global war on drugs, and that directly helped America. But states like Kazakhstan are of no relevance to America whatsoever. They're on the complete other side of the globe. But even in the rare situations if they did invest in these countries, we think that governments and organisations like the International Monetary Fund often attach policy changes as conditions for these loans, and these are terrible. You see rapid liberalisation and privatisation of markets. This allows for the West to sweep up the resources in these countries at a fraction of their true value. You also see policies made with that to cut government spending, which has literally destroyed healthcare systems in Africa. We don't think that's something the opposition has found. But the West is also turning increasingly in. We see Trump pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, and the rise of nationalism in Europe, meaning these people are unable to provide an alternative for these countries to attract and place power."

For example, as I talked about in Kazakhstan, because it's their geographical route to put a trade route to Europe. But secondly, because the West has different allies, then it won't invest in transformational infrastructure in Pakistan, because Pakistan has a conflict with India, and the West will never invest in the enemy of their ally. At the end of this point, what do we get for the people actually living on the ground in these countries? We get employment for these people. So when we saw the Carrot Hydro Power Project in Pakistan, the Chinese company building the power, building the dam, hired thousands of local workers from rural areas and created spin-off jobs in local industries and maintenance jobs on that deck. This meant that the Pakistani farmers that previously wouldn't have any opportunity to better themselves now do. I'll take a few more now. These people have no use of these created jobs when their own economy, their own sectors and manufacture are pushed out of the market due to these cheap Chinese food. You better answer to this question. Okay, firstly that's not a reality in today's space. It's not like their economy is suddenly shut down. But secondly, that they can get employment in Chinese industries as well. We also provide industries, so that Pakistan's poor areas now no longer get 20 hour blackouts, and now people actually have an ability to get to power and live their economies of mind."

China is increasing its military power and not trying to give the world itself. We don't think that this is equivalent to the Martian camp. The typical war jobs will be created in those countries. Two responses to this. Firstly, the extent that many of the construction workers that China is currently using are actually Chinese. China has an over-the-top service of people that they are trying to get working to other countries, so that people are in the city idly. Moreover, other investors could also go into those countries because they have profit incentives because of the cheap workforce in those nations. They would be using the people in those places and they would actually create more jobs, something that China doesn't actually do because they can use their own cheap workforce, something that's more beneficial for them.

Firstly, I think that this argument simply doesn't stand because of the fact that economic benefits from China under the Belt and Road Initiative inherently come with some kind of military impact. China goes to those places and builds bases in those countries when they are trying to make some big economic capital in those places. There was a recent announcement from a company, by building bases in Turkey, by getting 150,000 troops into Pakistan, they go in with military not to make an economy, so I think that this argument is more satisfactory with its assumption. Furthermore, now it has an incentive to protect all of the things that it has with military. It has an incentive to try to protect them at all costs and try to use this military, something that it didn't have before. But finally, this is not an inherently true theory. China already has a very good response to economic relations with Vietnam, for example, but it's still bombing their ships in the South China Sea. The economic dependence has always been that military conflict is going to exist, and they need to prove to the whole world that the status quo, that logic, have flaws."

                "text": "Moving on to the next. Firstly, let's think about the regional impact on economic development. We get a few answers from side oppositions. If I was to tell you that they don't always go to China and that the infrastructure projects don't go to China, those are the main instances they do. Also the fact that these loans are predatory. Even if it doesn't happen in the first years of the infrastructure project, then in the end, if you don't have enough money to pay for China, you're forced to do your part, for example, because you can't pay back the loans. So it's a predatory result, first people told you, and they don't give you're forced to give your poor twin, for example, because you can't pay back the loans. So it's a predatory result for us people to go to, and they don't give you a response to do that. Secondly, the Taylor Society is in spate from the fact that we're saying hydroelectric in the country. They've established that they're not going to take the side, they might do that, but eventually they simply don't have the funds to maintain those things. The laws that China's given them are enough of the law to keep that stuff working, but in the end, those loans simply run out, those countries can't afford it anymore, because they're so far in debt. In those instances, those people don't get those benefits anymore, and they want to deal with the long-term impact. Finally, they say Japan also gets raw materials from China. They are already responding to our argument. We take it home, it's not beneficial for China to give raw materials, and they only want to give products. This means that China needs what these countries need, but only what they need, because these countries don't actually get any benefits. In the long term, all of these things will be worse for these countries, because this infrastructure won't be beneficial for them, and for future sustainability, you always need China, which is not going to be that in the long run. Australia is going to take these things away because these countries can't afford the loans that the Chinese need out of them. These countries are simply wasting money they could have used for local development as we are telling you that they have this money to some extent already. They are wasting money to make money from these creditors loans the Chinese are doing to them and the Chinese are enslaving them in some kind of debt trap. Second point to reveal, how these countries have less sovereignty. They don't actually provide you an argument of any rebate or concern in this argument. They don't tell you how these countries can maintain illegal sovereignty. How they can still make their decisions for themselves. But so, China is using their lobby power to influence the decisions these countries are making, to force them to give their infrastructure to China, and to make foreign policy decisions that really benefit China. Because they are forcing countries to make harmful economic decisions for themselves. And in the end, it will be worse for these countries that they are so hard trained to protect. Before we move on to my point, I want to review the government. There's still a choice for these countries to accept these loans, given that they still have internal domestic pressures, not to accept the types of crippling debt loans that simply sell their sovereignty away. Why is that not enough to provide a counterfactual for the vast majority of countries in this space? It's easy for them. They can take these loans and make something better for themselves, but they are taking into consideration the fact that these loans are predatory and won't be able to pay these liabilities back. They don't have to provide for any human rights service, for example. They can take this money and run with it. Final point about global military expansion. It's fair to say that China still have those incentives, then we might agree. We think that the Belt and Road Initiative has provided an excellent opportunity for China to make all of those military incentives become true. Furthermore, it answers the point about tensions, how the U.S. has more tensions under their sovereignty caps. They take heart with how the United States currently has hegemony in the military sphere, and we can agree to that. But within its class, we have two competing powers with very competing incentives and agendas"

Now, I'd like to be ruling on tomorrow. This has been proved to be how the Belgian-Jewish initiative is likely to fail. It's a huge risk and the negative impact that that's brought from the Belt and Road Initiative actually fail. Lastly, a few reasons why it might fail. There is no cooperation from Western nations. Nobody from Europe turned up to the Belt and Road meeting and there is a strong US opposition to the whole plan. There is also a lack of cooperation from many non-Western nations. Bangladesh, for example, chose a Japanese to be over a Chinese one when it really did point to their capital, something that's really important for the Belt and Road Initiative to succeed. These countries are often corrupt. Afghanistan is fortified in the Corruption Index because of the war between 2014 and 2010 Finally, there is massive backlash from the people. In China, small processing plants were set on fire in the south of Kurdistan because of the fact that these people know what's happening to their countries and how it's harming their economies and their sovereignty. This is harmful for the Belt and Road Initiative, which means that it's more likely to fail. In the instance where China can't build the infrastructure necessary for the Belt and Road Initiative, this means that they can't actually make one of these economic trade routes happen. They also can't have cooperation with the West, thus the main objective of China accessing the Western market won't be achieved with the Belt and Road Initiative. This proves that the Belt and Road Initiative won't be as successful as they want it to be, thus won't actually benefit China and the host nations. Why? Firstly, China is going to go into massive voucher recession, and we have given out many non-reforming loans, and thus billions of dollars in plus-advis. The companies that have previously settled their price, thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative, are stuck with the surplus of products that China currently has. They will be economically stagnated because of the fact that the products are inflowing out of the country, but staying inside, and China won't be able to keep up with the economic recession that we're in. But moreover, the partner nations will have huge loans with no benefit. For example, huge volumes of Chinese food will be put to retirement in origin. They will rely heavily on Chinese loans to make their country work. But these loans are given out to the world because China can't afford it. The Belt and Road Initiative is relatively unsuccessful, and in that instance, none of these countries that they are trying to protect will benefit. Asian text on the Belt and Road is predatory, the others in this country are in any tune of policy. Thank you. Team Estonia made the line"

I'm going to bring a single argument about why the BRI facilitates increased competition which assists developing countries. But firstly, I have two points of clash to address. Firstly, the impact on BRI countries, and secondly, the impact on global community intentions. So firstly, let's look at the impact on BRI countries. Because we both agree in this debate that China isn't simply doing this for altruistic reasons. So then let's talk about whether or not it actually benefited the countries in this debate. Because what we talked about first was that the difference in this debate is that countries like Pakistan and like Myanmar literally have telecommunication lines. The people who were previously living in blackouts for 20 hours a day now have electricity which can power their farmland. Now they have electricity which can merge their industries and actually mean that they can have forms of employment outside of simply rural agriculture or all the types of things that have constrained the land issue behind all of these other countries. So what did we hear from Team Estonia in this debate? They told us that there were predatory loans. I mean, they couldn't really decide whether they wanted these countries to build infrastructure themselves or whether they wanted to have them get loans from the IMF. Firstly, in terms of whether they wanted to get loans from other types of actors in this debate, we want to say that this is a regressed debate, which means that Temastonia actually needs to engage in realistic counterfactuals. And the counterfactual in this debate is that the IMF has not invested in these countries. That the IMF invests insofar"

                "text": "as that it is important and it is strategic for the West's geopolitical incentives. We told you that there was no incentive for the IMF to ever invest, and even if they did, it is often accompanied by the things such as economic liberalisation, through which the West can crowbar their way in and enter into the economies of their countries. So we don't think the IMF is this perfect actor in this way, that they can stand behind under their side walls. Third of all, we told you that these loans in actuality were very fair, that many of these countries do enter into the types of loans where they know what they're getting into, and the majority of the countries, in fact, over 55 of the 63 countries, have actually not entered into these seats to have any risk of not being able to pay those loans back. So what do they want to tell us? They want to tell us that they want these countries to build their infrastructure on their own. Let's be clear, when Pakistan has a GDP of less than 1500 per capita, that is a sign that they can't build their own infrastructure. The types of massive economic growth that Pakistan has seen, it comes to the direct result of the type of investment that the Belt and Road Initiative have brought. The types of high speed, like transport and high-end ports that have allowed them to get their goods right throughout Asia and across the world. The types of ports like Guadal, that have allowed them to actually access European markets. Because unlike what you might believe if you were listening to Tim Stoney, it is not an exclusive right for China to use these ports. They can be used by the entire economy. So secondly, they told us they enter into debt-to debt to equity shares, and this is bad for those countries. Firstly, we tell you in many cases China doesn't do this, they actually enter into debt relief, thanks to such a strict shmoe to these countries. Secondly, there is large internal domestic pressure not to accept that rule. There are local politicians who are actually seen as being selling their sovereignty away if they do indeed grant China access to these goods. The fact that they have to lean so heavily on one single example where one Sri Lankan politician was able to be coerced by China into giving that quarter where they couldn't make their loans isn't indicative of the wider picture of today's today. Why do countries do a conceded to maintain their own sovereignty? Finally, even in the worst case scenario, if we take them at their best and tell you that they do exchange things for equity, these countries still gain benefits, right?"

It's not like China that controls the hedging of that dam and prevents the benefits of that from ever flowing down to the people that we want to tell them this is bad. Finally, they told us that local workers are published out. They're often in terms of these conditions and negotiate so that local workers do actually build the infrastructure in the first place such as the dam in Huggastown. Secondly, they tell you that there are additional jobs brought to that country which fire away the actual number of people building that dam or building that infrastructure in the first place. So if you think about it, when you build a dam, especially the builders that may be going from China, it is the local concrete industry, it is the local people who have been employed to maintain that dam, it is the people who can build industry off the back of that. Finally, I wanted to say that local manufacturers are pushed out. Look, we're happy to say that there can be anti-dumpin' laws in that scenario, but furthermore we tell you that often in these countries they're able to have a comparative advantage in what they do produce, and that can contain and maintain into the future. What did we hear from the second speaker? He wanted to essentially say that there was backlash, and we were going to make it way, way worse for China and Spain. They were going to enter into voucher recession. Look, we're actually very happy for China themselves to be able to weigh up the risk. We tell you, we benefit people, especially in West China, who are able to now get that close to the structural business. Secondly, let's have a look at the impact on global community intentions. Because let's go on what was brought to us and our first speaker about the tensions in the South China Sea. Because the reason that there are tensions in the South China Sea is because it represents the only trade route that China can get all of its goods to European and Asian markets. What does this mean? It means that above all else, it needs to have military tech and pressure to try and exert its control and influence in that region. We told you that the types of things that can prevent that are in China as alternatives, where they can ship goods through other ways. They wanted to say that they wanted to build bases and they thought that China wanted to build bases and that was really damaging. We told you at the point when they were supporting the US global hegemony in this debate, A we see that it was perfectly legitimate for China to pursue its own strategic interests, and that it would continue to do so under either side of the house in this debate."

China is building a highway in Montenegro, the cost of which is 80% of that country's GDP. Montenegro have to pay a majority of the cost of that highway themselves. How is Montenegro going to essentially duplicate that GDP, and why would that money have been used better? Firstly, I disagree with your claim that it is 80% of GDP, and simply we tell you that even insofar as it is a large percentage of GDP, quite clearly A, Montenegro knew what they were getting into, and B, the types of investment and infrastructure that they can have in terms of actually being able to access outside markets is far better than the alternative in this regard, which is no investment. So now let's move on to my point, because understand that Western aid, or the US aid, constantly seeks to advance its own geopolitical objectives. However, this is often accompanied by onerous conditions such as policy reform or opening up the country to Western investors. Right now, Western powers have essentially no one else to compete with them in giving loans to these countries. This"

This is because the West does not want to exert the type of diplomatic influence that it can if it does have exclusive rights. So as a result, countries that previously didn't get aid from the West will now have access to aid. This looks like the USA actually paying attention to what happens in places like the over-starting Central Asia. But secondly, the West must also give better conditions on those ones. That means instead of having these types of incentives where they have to liberalise their markets, the West now has to give better conditions, like not high interest rates, not trying to change the policies of those countries to compete with China. For example, when Bush came to shove recently over an internet cable linking Australia to the Solomon Islands, the Australian government, instead of allowing the Chinese company Huawei to invest in that,"

                "text": "So first off, how is trade limiting the influence? We were told that we were given this characterization that Asian countries have been left behind, and that Pakistan is only growing into China. Well actually, foreign direct investment in many countries is greater than the Netherlands, then China. This is true in many of China's neighbours, China is usually the fourth, or like the seventh largest vendor in these countries. Which means it is obviously, isn't true, their characterisation. Before the Belt and Road Initiative, China was also like still trading, and a number of countries were still trading, but all these countries still had some sort of autonomy over what this trade should look like, and China couldn't tell them, like what sort of trade they should be doing, and they didn't have control over a large and very important infrastructure in these countries. There obviously is spending, and in the cases where there isn't some sort of spending or some sort of loan giving, it is obviously because the risk is too large for more legitimate investors to actually take. No one decides not to trade with China because of certain neo-colonial spites. Private investors don't want to take that huge risk. What are these loans? However, China is willing to take that loss, as they will just take over these infrastructure projects. It is a loss for China. No, thank you. This is also the reason why predatory loans are so beneficial for China, because at best these countries will just have to pay off these loans and have incredible debt, and if they don't, then China fair. Now, when they talk about the fact that it's true when Madagascar gets more trade, then we think that this is a very good analysis, like, obviously, we talk about the fact that the textile industry is disrupted in these countries, which is much worse. For example, Madagascar's textile industry was completely disrupted and almost lost because of China's incoming imports, which Madagascar now couldn't say no to, which means that obviously Madagascar's own economy, or at least the people in Madagascar who are also involved in this debate, were suffering and they were the ones being harmed. And people who only like to like larger companies in China were getting their benefits. And we don't think that it's very justifying. Yes? Do you think it will actually help grow Madagascar's industry to the point where they have a port that allows raw materials from China to go into their country? Well, yeah, but the problem is that Madagascar can't dictate what sort of materials it needs. We talked about this in our first speech, about the fact that Sri Lanka wants to rely on these raw materials, but it's getting manufactured goods which isn't actually beneficial for Sri Lanka, and if the other dictates can have more autonomy, then they can get more benefits, which is obviously better under our side. We'll also give you a lot of analysis in our second speech about why the Belt and Road Initiative is likely to fail, about how there's no cooperation from Western nations, and there's also lack of cooperation from non-Western nations, or that partner nations fail to pay back loans, corruption and also local backlash because sovereignty is being infringed upon in all of these cases. We also don't really get a response to the fact that why it is justified also for China to infringe upon these countries' sovereignty so much? This is a huge problem that they haven't really answered to, that these countries now can't dictate what their overall foreign policy is, and we increase the amount that Chinese lobbyists can actually use, and this is an incredible harm also in itself."

We don't really agree with this, and we don't think that the overall people can get as many jobs as they're talking about. But then they talk about the fact that, now let's talk about military and show you why actually China is more likely to become militaristic. They bring out two reasons why it isn't. Firstly, that now China is more economically tied to all sorts of different countries. This doesn't work in the South China Sea. China is still tied to all of those countries, but it's still willing to be militaristic and show that own military power, because this way it's more economically beneficial for them. They don't need to go to war for them, they only need to like bully these countries with their overall much larger navy, just so that they can have more beneficial overall training and get more power over the South China Sea. We also think that our own argument talks about why economic ties always lead to increased militarism, in the case of China. We've brought you three examples of that, how there is a military base, how Pakistan has 150,000 troops and that there are farm bases across China's farm and Poland. When they say that China still has the incentive for all of these things, then this isn't true. How will China justify a military base if it doesn't even have any sort of trading routes there, or if it doesn't even have any sort of trading business there? We don't think that they can justify it. We don't think there's an incentive for China to increase their nitrogen around the world. We think we've talked about this quite a lot. But the second point that they talk about nitrogen is that now the South China Sea is less important. I mean, this just isn't true. The South China Sea will always be a huge trade route with unexplored oil and gas also. We think that this is true, that China now won't care about and we think that they'll have to deal with those statuses same. No thank you. But now on their extension that countries that previously didn't get aid now will, we don't understand what countries they're talking about. This is a hip-hop characterisation. No thank you. But we think that now these countries are less likely to accept aid, which often comes with human rights conditions with them, because now they can get very easy loans from China, which means that it's more likely that they don't have to accept the aid. But we think that if these loans do fall down, no thank you, then our own harms of these countries are getting worse. They are going to be heightened. But let's look at the comparative of what is actually happening."

If you don't have some of the Chinese investors telling you, or lobbyists telling you that you have to lower your taxes, for example, or you have to make your kindergarten into a hostel because then humans If you don't have some of the Chinese investors telling you, or lobbyists telling you that you have to lower your taxes, for example, or you have to make your kindergarten into a hostel, because then it's just a transaction to human benefits. Or we talk about the economy, they would say that money at the moment, with these loans, it would be wasted on paying back Chinese debts, which could have been used for sustainable development, for example. Or they also would have lessened the ability of these countries to, in the future, invest in much more better infrastructure projects that might not be so risky, or that this disrupts the overall local economy from production with the large impacts of Chinese trade, which means that in the long run, it will be much harder for these countries to actually bounce back and actually get to sort of a more clean path, for the fact that these Chinese lobby power forces states to undertake unfavourable economic policies, which will also in the long run make it harder for these countries to actually have good economic policies and actually benefit from the overall growth of the country.

Because the only line that we heard from Estonia was the assumption that politicians took deals blindly, that they just shut their eyes until whatever deal came their way, because they weren't accountable to everyone. We say that given the fact that Estonia conceded that these nations are burgeoning democracies and burgeoning economies, we say that there's an intense amount of internal domestic pressure not to accept those terrible deals. Insofar as they want to talk about predatory loans and accepting horrible deals that mean it's all Chinese workers, we say that there's huge incentives to not accept those loans. So how does that work? Well, what we say is that in these countries like Pakistan, the money of many of the politicians actually run on an anti-corruption, anti-steal and sovereign platform. That's what we have with the Prime Minister of Pakistan in Ramkhan running on that platform. That's what we have with Malaysian President Mohammed running against their sovereignty being stolen. What that means is that those politicians are disinclined from taking horrible deals, especially given the fact that those countries are still recovering from having their resources ripped away by British colonialism. It means that that public is particularly pro-sovereignty and particularly going to push away from the deals that they feel threaten them. What does that mean? It means that they're unlikely to accept those deals. Furthermore, we see that China cares a great deal about its international image, which means it's unlikely to offer those horrible deals in the first place. What we say is that it's not enough for them to talk about a single country where China forced a hospital to close, though that's an extreme minority of cases. Instead, we see that China has huge incentives to look good on the global platform, given the power backing created by the declining West and the EU. What that means is that given the fact that we have far-right politicians like Jaroslaw Kaczynski in Poland and Viktor Orban in Hungary, what that means is that there's a huge position for China to be a good actor on the world stage. What that means is that they have incentive to make those deals less terrible. Further, we see that there's a huge media market in these countries when there's a huge amount of infrastructure being put on, which means that those countries' deals are under a huge amount of media scrutiny that's shown to the entire world. What that means is that insofar as they accept foreign deals, those politicians look bad and China looks bad. That of all that it's actually very expensive for China to import all of their workers to all of these other countries in terms of maintaining maintenance for the next 20 years. We say it's unrealistic for China to put their own workers to work with that. It's a lot easier actually going to put pressure on their local politicians to only accept the deals and actually employ them. That's why countries like Malaysia, they were able to turn down military bases that didn't employ Malaysian workers, but were able to accept the deals and provide the jobs to those people. At the end of this point, we see that countries do not accept terrible deals, and even if they did, were able to get these sorts of industries that are actually valuable to lifting people out of poverty. So what then is the impact on developing economies?"

                "text": "Here I want to say the huge tension that existed in starting this case all down the line, because they told you that they were happy to have private investors. They were happy to have the IMF, the Western pro-bar, and buy up the institutions that were so valuable to those countries. But then they also wanted to say in the same breath that the most important thing was the sovereignty of those countries. We think that they cannot support private investors buying up valuable institutions. We'll also say that the most important thing was sovereignty. We think that is something that they cannot accept in this debate. What we told you is that this gives these economies an opportunity for development. Interferes, they wanted to say that they can simply build themselves up. They need to engage with the reality of the space. Because the fact is that if they did want to build up those industries, the fact that these countries were formed 20 years ago means that they have extremely limited capital to afford to develop those industries. What that means is that maybe they do build a port. Maybe they do build a single rail line. What that means is that it comes at the expense of a huge amount of social services that everyone will be providing at the same time. So what we say is that it's very difficult for those countries to develop their own infrastructure, so it's much preferable to rely on China. We've done enough down our line to show you why the International Monetary Fund is obviously not a viable option for China or for these countries to take. What did they then tell you? That China is going to control everything in certain ground industries. Let's be very clear on this. China may have a steel surplus, right? But the issue is that Pakistan is always going to have a comparative advantage in some fields over China. It's not the case that China can simply import every single thing that they want out of those countries insofar as China obviously relies on a few industries that countries like Pakistan and Myanmar do not have. What we say is, well, this actually opens up countries to importing their goods and exporting them. What we say is that in Pakistan, the railways actually gain access to Asian markets as they would before. It's not enough for them to simply say that they can just trade, because the issue is that you cannot trade in Asia if you have no infrastructure to do so. If you have no trade to literally bring your goods to the rest of Asia. We are the team that actually provides those rail lines and opens up their economy. Further, we say that ports give access to European markets. Is that it isn't the case that Europe is simply going to buy things from China as if they did. They'll be doing that in the status quo. But comparatively, is that we actually give access to European markets because Europe wants to buy goods from Pakistan, from Myanmar. What that means is that Myanmar can rely on their own industries and get a huge amount of development there, yes. China's not building any industries or jobs in these nations. Rather, when they produce the goods still in China and sell them to these nations, pushing local manufacturing and industries out of these nations. Okay, that factory-operable, modern manufacture and industries onto these nations. Okay, now, it wasn't a question, that was just a statement. But further, we say that the Guadalquart actually employed 3,000 Pakistanis to do the work, because China saw that it was cheaper to simply employ close, local individuals. We say that they do have trade, that they are able to work on those fields. And so far, it's as if they want to talk about the Madagascar court. The problem is that China dictating the sole purpose of those courts isn't actually how trade works, right? Countries choose what they buy, which means that those countries, like if you choose to buy from the European markets, you say that they do get growth. No thank you. But let me say that we actually heard no sufficient response to Nick's split, which is that the"

They told you that China will still become reliant on that. What we say is that that's literally incorrect. We can point out that the Eurasian land bridge and the Arctic route are the biggest infrastructure things that China has ever played in the last 50 years. What it means is that it's obviously clear that China doesn't necessarily have to rely on the South to act as they did before. And so far, as they do have increased militarization, we see that a lot of these countries are actually nuclearized, right? Which means that it's not likely that China is suddenly going to go to war with India. And so far as they both have nuclear weapons, and they see it as a lose-lose game, what that means is that it is okay for China to have military bases. We say that it's not enough for them to simply say that less military bases is a good thing. It's not realistic to simply demilitarize the world. What instead is realistic to do is provide infrastructure to the communities that need it most and actually help these developing countries crawl their way out of the ground."

Because the question was, how else would these countries actually develop this infrastructure? And if they couldn't do enough to actually prove that they could develop that infrastructure, they lost the debate at that point. First we told you on whether they could develop it in themselves, we told you that they simply cannot afford it at the point where their GDP could no longer, is so low that they simply cannot afford it at the point where their GDP per capita is so low that they literally cannot even service their own citizens, let alone build an entire telecommunications system that comes to the entirety of the country. That was not realistic. At the point where their case was reduced to saying, well, maybe in 50 years, if their economy does develop, then they'll be able to do that. We told you that their economy develops when they have the infrastructure that facilitates the development. And that was what you got under our side of the house. So then they wanted to support the IMF and things like other international institutions. They wanted to support the West. The West, with through leaders like Orban and Trump, has constantly been turning inwards, which has become more isolations and less inclined to give a care about these types of countries of which they have no strategic interest in. Why would they want to align with the West that tries to profile their way into these countries and tries to liberalise their economies and allow for private investment in a way that is not beneficial in any way, shape or form? We told you that the types of loans that are accepted are those which are gratified by these emerging democracies. The local politicians have incentives to accept the types of deals which will actually benefit their types of economies. When you have people literally running on anti-corruption platforms in Pakistan and Malaysia, that is an indication that these countries do care about their sovereignty and aren't engaging in bad deals. At the point where we told you that the vast minority of countries weren't ever actually engaging in it, we were quite happy to stand by these laws in this way. So the benefit that we got is that we created jobs. We created jobs in the infrastructure of these countries, both directly through the fact that many of these countries employ these workers, but also indirectly through the fact that there are many industries which build off that. Their only counter was quite a gloom characterisation saying, oh well Pakistani farmers can't be civil engineers. Well quite obviously not all of them can, but there are people who have to work in the concrete industry. There are people who have to service that line with quite a lot of people, like quite basic jobs. So quite clearly there is a range of skills which can be needed by a range of people."

Finally, the point is that even when good infrastructure comes, they say that it's good when it comes from other places, but you don't have to pay for it. But each of this is answered by our own case. We tell you that you can provide these services even if you have less amounts of these huge loans. One or two members could have provided their education with more money if they hadn't taken that highway deal and they couldn't make that second part of the service. China forces them to take these huge loans they're never going to be able to pay back. Finally, these countries don't exist in isolation. Kyrgyzstan can only do trade with respect, and other countries around them, they have other opportunities besides these loans. Finally, even if these economic benefits are true, three things. Firstly, we don't know how they are going to be short-term. These loans end at some point, and countries won't get those benefits anymore because they can't maintain the things that they have in ports or in hydro plants. All of these things will run out of the money because these countries aren't getting loans from China anymore, which was the only thing keeping those infrastructure projects alive. Secondly, these benefits never go to the people. The total of China is using its own local power to influence the political decisions in those countries. And even if they have economic benefits, these economic benefits will use better China.
