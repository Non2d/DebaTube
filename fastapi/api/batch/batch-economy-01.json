We're living in a world with greater consumerism, which means that people are likely to purchase things not necessarily because they need those things, but because they want them. And most of the times, our desire for a certain product is manufactured by producers because they market their products in a way that ties the product to your own identities.

And these are things that are explicit in things like brand loyalty by saying that if you want to live to a certain life standard, you should always buy a fancy watch or go to a fancy restaurant. And explicitly do that by asking a celebrity to eat in your fancy restaurant and put that advertisement on TV. The second thing we think is harmful is because it disproportionately harms the poor. Why is that so? Because first, advertisement exclusively creates a consumerist lifestyle, which makes your self-worth to what you can purchase or what you can buy in life. Why is that harmful? Because the poor in the status quo have less purchasing power, which means that they're less likely to buy, to fulfill that kind of lifestyle, and thus they will feel less self-worth simply because they cannot buy that fancy product. We give you the example of how a Chinese student sells his kidney in order to buy a new iPhone because of the pernicious impact of consumerism that he thinks that no matter at what cost, he should get that new version of iPhone."

First, because what we need to recognize is that everything is a zero-sum game, which means that the more you can get directly leads to the less the other person can get. This means that if we have a consumerist society, we will never have a scenario in which everyone is happy with their life, in which everyone will feel a kind of meaning tied to their life. You're always going to harm a group of people. Second, because we say they're making life as it leads to an end, which is consumerism, rather than an end in itself. What does it mean? We give the example of a lot of people who would choose jobs that will give them more pay instead of jobs that they actually love. We give the example because people are more likely to choose jobs that make better pay as they can get more money and reach the consumer's goal that the society is pushing forward this narrative.

First, we say there is a disparity between wealthy and poor companies, which means that wealthy companies have more access to the avenues of advertisement. They can build brand loyalty. They have more power to construct the stereotype for consumers. And the mechanism of change is that we make it equal, we equalize the playing field by allowing companies to compete with each other based on the technicalities or the functions of their products. That's how we allow things like startups with very little initial brand loyalty or very little access to advertisement to change. Second problem we identified in the status quo is that advertisement often serves as a mask for low-quality products or products that does not actually have the innovative traits that the companies advertise for. We give the example of iPhones. When they get a new iPhone, they probably do not have a lot of innovations, but they brand it or they market it to have a lot of innovations. And it's the judgment of consumers."

First, our side would not allow things like false advertising. If a company actively lies about something that their product does, like cigarette companies lying about the health effects of their products, we obviously wouldn't allow that on our side of the house. But second, again, the core question in today's debate is, is product detail the only thing that consumers should or should have the right to make decisions about when they're deciding whether or not to buy products. This is particularly true in a world where in some cases products are largely just functionally in terms of technical details relatively the same. The difference between a Nivea shampoo and an Olay shampoo is pretty much the same. It is up to consumers to decide whether they want to value things like the company's values or policy when they're making this decision. What does, in fact, advertisements that extend beyond things like, beyond technical details look like? Yes, it does look like flashy packaging and celebrities, but it also looks like companies promoting positive values, companies promoting their own charity work. All of these are things that companies do as marketing techniques to promote their brand. We think consumers have the right to know about these and consider them when they're making decisions. With that, let's introduce some responses to the material that they brought in. They basically had two ideas. First, on reinforcing negative stereotypes, and second, on creating better choices about which products to buy"

First, the fact of the matter is that these insecurities already exist, and to the extent that companies are preying on them. It's not like we're making them more increased on our side of the house, they're just, they already exist. But second, we actually tell you that company messaging is more likely to be positive than exclusionary and negative. At the point where companies have every incentive to promote as many people as possible to buy their product, it's more likely to be inclusive and positive. And third, to the extent that shaming messages were a marketing strategy in the past, we think that society is generally, in the large part, moving away from that. There is huge backlash to discriminatory policies. For example, when Dell came out with a line of laptops exclusively for women, that was pretty problematic. Or when companies engage in body shaming in the status quo to promote their products, there's massive backlash to that. And we see more and more companies like Fenty by Rihanna promoting inclusivity and body positivity instead of shaming women. But fourth and finally, we tell you that actually allowing companies to use things other than the technical details of their product to promote their product actually leads to a check back against those sorts of policies. They talked about the example of De Beers. What we tell you is that when other companies were able to talk about things like the way that they made their product more humanely than De Beers when they were doing advertising, which notably does not include the technical details of that product. They were able to call out De Beers for their massive human rights abuses, and this was something that we think consumers have the right to consider when they're making decisions. But on their other argument about increasing consumerism and leading to better products. First, this argument assumes that all products are super different. We don't think this is true, and we think particularly in these cases, people need to be able to choose other factors. Second, we think disparities in competition with advertising still exist at the point where the biggest companies are still going to be able to put out the most volume of advertising. These disparities are still going to exist. We actually think it's better on our side of the house when small companies are able to differentiate themselves by talking about the fact that they are in fact a"

It basically packages positive things about the product in easily digestible, appealing ways to attract people to that product. It's not just raw product details which can be really dry and boring for people to sift through. By using this packaging, people are able to learn more about the product and decide better for them.

We think that this illustration, these positive illustrations, allow people to, say, buy financial planning services when they otherwise would actually bettering consumer decision making. But on to our second argument in today's round about how we encourage companies to engage in positive social policies. Three ideas under this, but before I introduce them, go.

And we actually see a lot of societal backlash against things like that in the status quo. This sparks conversations about existing perpetuations of insecurities. We think this is very positive. But now onto how companies promote social movements. Three ideas under this. The first is by promoting social activism and charity. Two, boost PR. Companies engage in things like social outreach. This is the Delta example we've talked about. This is Ann Taylor running leadership programs for young girls. They do this to promote their brand, and in a world where they can't use this to market themselves, then the incentive to pursue those programs goes away. But second, it leads to better company policy. The ability to advertise about the practices that your company engages in creates an incentive to better those policies. This is companies like Audi implementing gender equality policies, or fair trade companies talking about how they use more positive labor practices in the global south to produce their product. The fact that companies are able to use these sorts of things to promote their product, which note, are entirely separate from the technical details, incentivizes better labor practices. Third and finally, we get actually more positive social messaging. Why are we more likely to promote positive values than negative values, as they say on your side of the house? We think that more positive values are far more inclusive and more likely to draw more people to your product. Companies have every incentive to do this. This is things like the Dove Like a Girl campaign, which empowers women. The Helpful Honda dealer ads, which promote values of helpfulness in society. And the Coca-Cola Pour the World a Coke campaign, which talks about increasing racial integration and decreasing discrimination. We think all of these would go away on their side of the house. But finally, we think that consumers fundamentally have the right to consider all of these things. And if there is in fact a negative value being perpetuated, that leads to discourse. And it's a legitimate choice for consumers to be able to make not to purchase that product. To boycott that product. Consumers have the right to decide if I want to buy the same shampoo, roughly the same shampoo, from a company that promotes the rights of women in the Global South versus one that does not."

We think that was abhorrent. Because we think the only way to truly live a dignified life was to be able to have individuals focusing on the things that they can access. The way in which they live their lives, the jobs they have, and the hobbies that they adore, rather than the materials that they may or may not be able to buy. Because of that, I'm going to address this debate in two questions. Firstly, on the consumers. Secondly, on social change. But before that, I want to point out two things that Leader of Opposition missed entirely. The first one was the second argument that our first speaker brought to you. The one on producers. That is to say, she explained to you why oftentimes larger companies have an entrenched power when it comes to the competition of advertising. That they're uniquely able to do things like running campaigns off of the backs of expensive celebrities. That means that oftentimes it means that they're able to crowd out other companies at the expense of functionality. That is to say, they disincentivize competition to focus on the functionalities of items, but rather their ability to advertise them. And this then became problematic because it meant that their site neglected the actor that Stone tells you about. The actor that can benefit off of the increased functionality that is the result of competition. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status that are now able to purchase functional items because those are the result of competition. That prices of good items can now go down because companies focus on the functionality of items rather than their ability to advertise them. The second thing that they completely ignore is our worldview that we present to you. One that is much more positive. That is to say, one that rather than focusing on the ends that you try to buy, but rather the means by which you try to get those ends. The lives that you live trying to accumulate the materialistic things that their side wants to focus on. So I'm going to talk firstly about the consumers, the bulk of the analysis they brought to us, and secondly I'm going to give you a unique substantive that addresses the end of their leader of opposition speech, which is social change. We told you three things when it came to consumers. The first thing we explained to you was that they are oftentimes resulted to uninformed consent. That is to say the manufactured consent created by the advertisement is oftentimes manipulative and takes advantage of the vulnerabilities that these individuals have. Because of this, we told you importantly, when it came to sacrificing the money that these individuals earn"

The only response we heard here was at the end of the opposition, where they tell us that individuals should have a right to purchase these items. I have three responses. Firstly, the reason why this is not a right is because the necessity to buy these items is oftentimes created by these advertisements in the first place. That is to say, there is an incentive upon their side to create insecurities and create dissatisfaction with yourself, because that is the motivating force that is most likely to drive individuals to buy your product. That is why, on their side, you cannot consider it a right, because the necessity to buy these products never existed without the advertisements in the first place."

              "text": "Why? Secondly, we tell you that this is also, we tell you that even if this right were to exist to some extent, you necessarily need it to balance out. And the problem with consumerism that Stone highlights that they completely ignore is the fact that it is necessarily exclusive. That is to say, the value of a Yeezy is only valuable to the extent at which not everyone can access it. Because of that, consumerism has an incentive to make the products that they try to sell inclusive to those who can afford it. This then becomes problematic. Because if individuals have a right to purchase these items, they probably shouldn't be coerced into buying the products that they cannot afford, spending their living wage on items that are not actually beneficial for them, but only ones that have been inflated by the advertisements that prioritize them. But thirdly, we would say if there was some sort of right for individuals to purchase the right product, we would much rather have a comparative, where they choose these items based off of functionality rather than the ones off of the advertising that they tell us about. The second thing that someone told you about was the perverse incentives of advertisement. That is to say, things like objectifying women in car advertisements, or things like how models are oftentimes the only way to properly dress clothes and because of it you create insecurities within individuals. The response here was firstly that this was justified because you were highlighting technical goods that were otherwise too dry. We think the unfortunate reality of this is that that's on our side. That on our side we do be able to highlight the best things and products because that's still focusing on the technical details. So to that extent we probably consume that part of their case. But the second thing they told us is often times you need these advertisements to illustrate things beyond the technical aspects of the property you are. The things like the values that your company may want to convey. And we think this is the point at which they concede to our case, right? Because they concede the fact that companies can oftentimes mischaracterize the products that they are selling. Now, the positive matter from opposition's side is solely reliant on this one assertion. The assertion that every single message that is going to be passed is one that is good. Why is that unlikely and why is that even if it is true, it is still a bad thing? The first thing to note here is that this is uniquely unlikely. Why? Because the best ways companies know to actually sell their product is to make sure that everybody wants it. And the way in which you can do that is to create dissatisfaction within the customers. That is why we told you they oftentimes have an incentive to drive in the insecurities of individuals. But secondly, note the fact that even if it was true that some companies are promoting some good values, that these are always delayed in retrospective. That is to say, advertisement doesn't uniquely push forward the brunt of social change. And the reason why that is so is because advertisements want to appeal to the most people possible. That means even in their best case scenario, we're sure sometimes companies like Dove can tell you why their products cannot be uniquely masculine, that only happens after society already accepts things like that because that is the only way at which this type of marketing is ever able to actually reach a target audience. The third thing to note here is when they tell you that there's an incentive to be inclusive because there's often times backlash. But note the thing about the problem with this argument. It's because it conceives the fact that there is a problem and that backlash is the way in which they try to solve it. And note that in this debate, it's not a net positive for you to try to heal the problems that advertisement has already created. It is a net benefit on our side when we tell you that we eliminate the problem as a whole and we can still give you more benefits because we change the way people perceive themselves away from the materialistic world that they tell you. Lastly, I just want to address the examples of things like how Delta promotes their charity. Firstly, if Delta promoting their charity is actually as mischaracterizing as you tell us, we're happy to ban it as well on our side. But the second thing to note is if Delta, if buying Delta tickets has also a functionality of giving people charity, we think that's just a technical aspect of purchasing Delta tickets because the money that you put in also goes to charity. So if they want to advertise that that it's perfectly justified because it's another aspect of the product that they're trying to sell. Lastly then let's talk about social change. We think the problem within society is oftentimes important social messages are contradicted or crowded out by advertisements. That is to say it becomes extremely difficult to empathize with issues like race inclusion when the only thing that you see in advertisements are rich white people because that's the target audience that advertising companies want to hit. Importantly, this then means that corporations oftentimes have a superior incentive to sell their product rather than promoting the correct messages. So even if on their side they can name a few examples of good promotions, we think importantly what the problem is then is that the bad messages can oftentimes contradict the important social messages and then on our side we're able to clear out this headspace. We think importantly what the problem is then is that the bad messages can often have contradicted Important social messages and then on our side were able to clear out this headspace We're able to allow individuals to properly engage with the social messages that opposition side actually approves of because we think Advertisement is oftentimes quite delayed when it comes to social messages and it shouldn't be the way in which we try to change the public's appearance Instead we would rather take away the crowded information sphere that currently exists and allow for the important social messages to exist whilst products do what products need to do, which is focus on functionality so individuals can escape from the materialism that they want to talk about. Very proud to propose. All right. All right. I would like to thank the second speaker of the opposition for delivering their speech."

We ask a very simple POI. Would you allow commercials such as Delta to advertise the fact that they have campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa and support those communities. They said yes because it's somehow distinct. We don't think it is, insofar as they tell you the reason that these commercials happen is to make a profit.

We're going to analyze why we win on both fronts. They talk to us about this idea that we intensify stereotypes and they tell us that advertisements pander to existing stereotypes and thus will be discriminatory towards women and minorities. We have a responses first off in challenge of the current trend of advertising is simply reinforcing negative stereotypes companies have structural incentives to cater to as many people as possible and a moment of embracing positive social movements for example black is beautiful or more diversity or more women in the actual positions of power we think that is why empirically it is true look to the example of Dove's Like a Girl campaign, Audi's Equal Pay commercial, where Yarnas make a brand to service women of color. But now, let's engage them on their highest ground, because we think we want to be as direct as possible. If a company airs advertisements that perpetuate stereotypes, we think actually it can be a good thing for consumers to know those companies have biases. Why is this the case?"

If I know that Avino uses the slogan that white is purity, I have a right to know to boycott them. But secondly, we do think that creates an effective check on these negative messaging through backlash. We gave you two examples of this happening. The first is whenever Dell launched a laptop that was specifically made for women. Within that exact same month, the entirety of the laptop and the website correlated it was discontinued because of backlash. The second example is the Kendall Jenner Pepsi commercial that we tell you led to a lot of backlash and more discourse in society, both of which means the companies are harmed, not supported. On the comparative, why is it so important for me to know what a company values? We think the standard that women, for example, should have lighter skin exists on both sides of the house, but it's only through marketing that we have a mechanism to expose and fight against that. But even so, let's talk about what commercials really look like. In the proposition world, we think it looks like simply having these kinds of technical information and not the message that is associated with it. Insofar as we tell you we are the only side that has a mechanism to do things like spreading these positive messaging, we think that at that point we win this argument on a pretty clear level."

First off, they never explain how changing commercials means that what actual individuals want will change or how consumerism will go down. Rather, consumerism and wanting to be rich existed long before advertisements did. Perhaps materialism has harms, but they do not combat that or explain why this is the case. They tell us that individuals ought to solely choose based off of functionality. We think advertisements beyond technological goods do just that because we think that individuals have the ability to know more about the companies themselves. That was the analysis they did not engage with. But for example, what we would additionally say is we can actually help to have better consumer choices. Look to examples of insurance commercials that display a family in a car crash. Oftentimes, it is these advertisements that, yes, might not simply be about a lot of data or facts, but that help individuals to realize how necessary some goods are. We are the only side that can access that benefit. But now let's talk about the argument"

She directly engaged this argument, even though they didn't get to it in Prop 1 until the seven minute mark. We told you that technological details exclusively being the focus of commercials enables things like monopolization. For example, if only Apple is the one to be able to actually market off of how good their technology is, that means they have intended to do things like aggressively increase patents and be able to actually take over larger shares of the market. At that point, competition only gets worse under their side of the house because of a lack of ability to distinguish themselves. The last argument is about this idea that we have corrects and false advertising. First off, we said regulations promote fact-checking. Second, we can still punish companies through lawsuits and actual heavy fines from the government. Third, we can see things like counter-advertising. For example, with our own De Beers example, we think that actually other diamond companies had counter-examples about how they had more humanitarian ways to extract resources. And fourth, on backlash of the public, deterring negative images. Before we get into the third argument, I'll take a point. Not everyone responds so positively to stereotyping advertisement. Why is it the responsibility of those who react to it negatively to bear the burden of exposing corporations on your side? We think that, for example, if I'm an individual of colour that sees an advertisement for skin whitening products, we think that first off, we can have large societal backlash to that,"

We told you that this leads to discrimination against three groups. Firstly, against women and minorities. We told you that these advertisements are based on an existing power structure, that the companies that are producing them may have some incentive to advertise to a larger group, but actually very often want to advertise exclusively. This creates a necessity to advertise in this way as well. Because when one company is advertising a specific set of values, such as that when you get a car, you also get a girl, which is unfortunately what happens right now, other car companies also have to appeal to the same consumer base who has now bought into this ideology. Meaning that it's very hard for companies to opt out of the existing power structures that they are generating on their side of the house. Their response was that there are inclusive narratives that are generated on their side. Here's the problem. We told you that these companies value the perception of exclusivity. That is to say that when you buy this car, you are part of an elite group, that you are better than other individuals, and therefore you buy into this idea of exclusivity. But also, secondly, we would say that it's in there's an intrinsic need for products to set you down a little bit or say that you are a little bit less than you otherwise would be because otherwise you don't buy their product we would say therefore there is one there's an incentive on their side to create exclusive narratives what they said that is that there's going to be social activism and charity note firstly that this is outweighed by our impact which is that it's fraudulent and deceiving to consumers and their identities."

They do not create change. Which is to say that during the rise of feminism in, say, the 20th century, we would say that many ads that showed women like literally being under men's feet and literally being abused and shackled to them actually regressed change rather than progress change. For the simple reason that their market incentives operate based on existing social beliefs and structures. So you're never going to be the forefront of change, you are going to be the backriders of change, which means that it's much harder to get revolution on their side of the house because the movements that they talk about are actively opposed by advertisements that are not supporting them. Note therefore that it is generally regressive due to the confirmation bias when people see one bad ad that is more influential than ten good ads if people genuinely don't believe it. We think therefore that they don't get social change, It's very, very minor if they do at all. Secondly, this constrains the poor, unresponded to by their side of the house, because you create a more consumerist society.

Because generally, the ones with the most advertising budget tend to outcompete others, which means that all companies now need to dedicate a large sum of money toward advertising, decreasing the product quality. No, information is possible on both sides of the house, right? You can get reviews, you can read technical specifications, and you generally know what you need within your life. We don't need other people to tell us that. Their only response is small companies can talk about how they're small. The issue is that evidently doesn't work. Large companies tend to dominate the market in a system where advertising weighs out lower prices or better specifications, which is to say that they get worse products on their side and small companies cannot compete in ways like lowering their prices or in ways like, for example, having a simply better product. What they need to compare to then is the fact that large companies have significantly better advertising budgets and therefore structurally are better able to advertise.

We think it's a bit absurd, and they went way too far in today's debate to try and say that they've subtly accomplished absolutely everything that they've done, but insofar that they've chosen to do this, they underdeveloped a lot of their material, leaving it very easy for us to choose an opposition ballot."

The second, on which side does what's best for industries? But let's go in to which side does what's best for consumers. Ultimately, down the bench, we have made our stance explicitly clear from the first speech onward. We think that there is more to a consumer's decision-making process rather than just stone-cold technical product details. There's many other factors. Why is this the case? We think that in and so far that we live in an industry where there's multiple companies selling the same products, a lot of products choose to be relatively similar, meaning that if there's only telling you the technical product details, it's all going to look the same. That's why advertising is used in the first place, because they're trying to get a company to be able to succeed, to give unique things about their products that makes it a reason to buy into those products in the first place. But secondly, we tell you that the quality of products can come in many different ways. If the side proposition wants to tell you that quality is something that ought to be uphold, that's something that has to be valued within products, then it's explicitly clear that side opposition is the side that does that best for you. Because we give you absolutely every mechanism to evaluate quality."

That's the kind of information that I would never get on Side Proposition's house. It's not enough for them to tell you that, well, this information is irrelevant and that you should really only care about the ingredients inside my body wash. No, that's not the case. We think that that's an explicit reason to vote for the opposition. But what did we hear from side proposition under this point?"

              "text": "Ultimately, they tell you that you hurt consumerism in essentially three key ways. The first is through consumerism, the second is through brand loyalty, and the third is through self-esteem that is going to be hurt by stereotypes used in advertising. The first two, based off of consumerism and brand loyalty, ultimately is not worthy of being valued in today's debate. Why is this the case? Because they completely underdeveloped this insofar that they gave you absolutely no reasoning as to why, when I only tell you the technical product details, suddenly consumerism magically goes away. They didn't finish writing the substantive. We think that insofar that that's the case, consumerism still exists within this world, Consumerism still is going to happen. We ought to now evaluate whether or not it's quality consumers and whether we're buying into companies that ought to be bought into. But we think that it's actually not necessarily a horrible thing if I, as a doctor, just want to buy a watch. They didn't tell you you wouldn't be made. Why somebody who wants to have materialistic tendencies is so atrocious in society. We think that it's a lot of a human instinct for people to just want nice things. That isn't something that we reject on side opposition. We think it's just inherent to human nature. But furthermore, we don't necessarily think that humans are some irrational actor that's just going to buy like 700 easy pairs of shoes because they suddenly are going to get themselves into like going bankrupt. No, they're just going to buy one pair because they want a nice pair of tennis shoes. We don't need the question point that stands on their side of the house. But let's really get into this issue of self-esteem because this was a really big point on their side of the house and probably arguably their strongest argument. We told you two crucial things that only got engagement within their third speech. What were those things? We told you firstly, as society, especially now in this era with movements such as Me Too or Backlash Matter, there is a push to be extremely culturally sensitive in terms of marketing and advertisements. Why is this the case? Two key reasons. One, because companies are recognizing that they do bad things a lot of times and they're wanting to make up for it, wanting to do the right thing. But secondly, they know that if they do something wrong, like produce a sexist ad or produce something that's super problematic, they're much more likely to have their entire company go under fire. We give you a lot of examples of this happening. Dell, when they produced laptops that were specifically designed for women, lost a massive amount of products being able to be sold to the public because everyone boycotted them for this. That's an instance of backlash actually working. But furthermore, look to the Pepsi commercial of Kendall Jenner supposedly solving racism by sharing a Pepsi with a cop. We think that that's ultimately got a lot of backlash on Pepsi. Lots of people stopped buying the product. This incentivizes companies to make the rational call to not be absolute jerks and ultimately realize the right thing to do is not be racist or sexist. But even if they are perpetuating the stereotype, we think that that shows the company's true colors. When I'm looking at certain lotion brands, such as like Aveeno, and they start selling skin whitening commercials, I as a brown person am just going to be like, what the heck Aveeno, I'm not going to buy you anymore because I recognize that's super problematic in the long term. We think that ultimately now we know what the company is doing, we're not going to stand with them. At worst, we think marginally a few people are harmed by these negative stereotypes but their side will never be able to garner any of the positive benefits that can come from actual positive campaigns that few people are harmed by these negative stereotypes, but their side will never be able to garner any of the positive benefits that can come from actual positive campaigns that happen through certain advertisements, such as always working for increasing women's rights, or Audi increasing equal pay within their business to be able to sell their products further, or Dove with their Like a Girl campaign. Those have massive amounts of benefits on society that improved a lot of things in the long term. The second question in today's debate is which side does what's best"

Even if you marginally expand the right to choice to some consumers, the majority of consumers are locked out due to the fact that they are now locked in to consumer loyalty. No, the thing is that your side of the house never tells us why consumerism or brand loyalty magically goes away when I put my product in a white box. That's too late in today's debate for them to be able to tell you that. But let's dig into why companies selling products, when they know that they only have to focus on"

This means that secondly, they're going to ditch efforts such as social change because they don't benefit from it anymore, meaning that the ultimate stigmas in the workplace are going to continue to persist, and social change is going to be stunted. But lastly, we think that it's not exclusive. If we want to appeal to literally as many, we think that these businesses are not exclusive. This is a false mischaracterization because companies are profit-based. They're going to want to get as much profit as in general. But lastly, we told you of smaller businesses. Smaller businesses always are going to want to have some sense of community. They're always going to want to be able to sell their products. When you only can talk about product details, you shut out small businesses from their key selling point. destroy that market we stand firm on opposition All right.

What if we tell you down the bench, when we actually draw attention to these problems, and allow consumers to make decisions about whether they want to buy into and support such toxic ideologies, we actually create more discourse discourse and can check back against these narratives. We tell you that because most companies are not selling exclusive luxury products and in fact do want to cater to a large majority of people, they are much more likely, particularly as society progresses, to cater to more individuals and beat back against such toxic policies.

Governments that are so coerced by problematic advertising, apparently on their side of the house, we don't think this is likely. But also, we don't think governments can force companies to engage in positive messaging or charitable work. That is only something that comes about when you give them a profit incentive for them to be able to promote these kinds of efforts to be able to sell products. When you allow companies like Delta to promote the fact that they're engaging in charity work that helps thousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa, or a company like Ann Taylor to promote the fact that they're creating leadership programs for girls. But another argument that they came up in response to this was that, well, these advertising campaigns only come up when this movement has already begun, so they make absolutely no difference because the problem has already been solved.

We think that advertising campaigns to overthrow such toxic ideas may follow existing movements to do so, but uniquely promote these ideas. And we think that is incredibly important. But they say that they outweigh this because it's super coercive for me to buy an iPhone because I like the packaging. Well, I was going to buy a phone anyways. We don't think that it is ridiculously coercive, just even if we accept that people are just buying it because they're packaging to do so. But we also tell you that individuals should factor in other things other than the technical product value. They should factor in things like the company's ideology and that they have the right to do so. So on this question alone, we take the debate. But now let's move on into the second question in this round about the economic impact. Their link here is basically that people make more objective decisions because suddenly, because advertising doesn't exist, I don't want a Rolls Royce more than I want a Honda. We think that that dynamic existed on both sides of the house, and people have always wanted to buy better products and things like that. And as Layla tells you, they're not so irrational that they're going to destroy their financial futures in the name of consumerism. But we also told you about the value of appealing to simple, appealing messaging to explain to people what the benefits of a product are, particularly for really technical products that people otherwise wouldn't buy for financial gain. But we also told you about the impact on small businesses and the massive impact on the advertising industry. We think on the economic point, we also take today's debate. The marginal harm that they get on their side of the house do not outweigh the massive societal benefits and economic benefits we get on our side of the house."

Because the incentives of people who run these large corporations and foreign companies is to threaten companies themselves to do things like lower regulations, that's in terms of workers' rights, and in terms of environmental rights, to do things like lower taxation, to do things like often literally give them subsidies. The reason they're able to do this in a way that locally registered companies aren't is because these companies can threaten to move abroad to set up industries, to set up businesses and buy land in other countries if the governments don't concede to their demands.

Finally, because they develop resources in turn to their own interests and not what's in the national interest, i.e. they might build a railway or a road, but that railway or road is going directly from the mine which they own to the port which they own and doesn't actually help local individuals."

              "text": "So let's ask the question, why, if it's so bad for these countries to have these big investors and foreign investors, why do they let them do it in the first place? Three reasons. One, because there is an international consensus around the necessity of multinational companies propagated by the neoliberal global agenda. This is something which we think is just a luck, and nascent economies tend to buy into this because they've seen it work in a few isolated instances that actually is not beneficial for them in the long run. We prefer a lot of countries like China, who by protecting local industries, by protecting local resources, have been able to develop long-term industries that actually have benefited more. Two, because these companies operate in a self-competiting cycle. Because once a few big multinational companies have been let into your economy, have started buying land, they drive up land prices in a way which prices out local competitors. So you have no choice as a company but to accept more land. Finally, because these countries are competing with other developing nations, because if a neighbouring country uses a multinational corporation to develop, they might develop faster but less sustainably. The problem is, it lowers the work of the things that you're developing. So as soon as one country in a region, for example, which is developing, uses multinational corporations, uses foreign investment, that makes it enormously easier for them to live in the short term, which forces other companies to also do that, lest they be priced out, lest they be shut out of those markets, particularly in things like oil, for example, where other companies, like multinational corporations, are able to lower prices in the short term, which means that the countries have no other choice but to turn to these kind of corporations."

One, we tell you there is a necessary opportunity cost at the point when a multinational organisation or a foreign investor is invested in a country and that shuts out individuals. That's because they drive up land prices, because they just have more cash than the locals on the whole. That's why locals are no longer able to buy land, are no longer able to buy key resources like oil fields, and at that point are unable to develop in a way that is good for the locals. Two, because they literally remove resources which would allow for local industries. Because 80% of the Malaysian Borneo rainforest has been deforested at the point when multinational companies have bought up that land and have deforested it. That means there's literally no farming to be done in these areas because the locals have been priced out. Finally, because they're literally just able to out-compete locals by funding them better. So why are locals better? One, because locals are subject to law, because they can't bully countries by threatening to move to other countries in a way that big multinational companies can. Two, because they care about the country in the long term, because these are people who are actually investing in their country. It's not the shareholder of ExxonMobil sitting on their yacht in the Mediterranean texting orders about how many trees to deforest. No, it's locals who are invested in those communities, who genuinely care about the future of those countries, and who are much more likely to do things like corporate social responsibility, who are much more accountable to the locals. Finally, because they're on all levels employing local individuals, that means they have an incentive to do things like invest in the economy and the education of local individuals so that they can go on to be a part of the managerial structures of those companies. Because foreign ownership of money is devastating to the long-term development of these companies, and because local industries are shut up and would ultimately do it in a more sustainable and better way,"

That includes refugees and just regular migrants between countries as well being able to do things like own houses and own small businesses. They failed to engage on this ground as well. But on the other hand, just as we can support things to limit harms of, say, ownership of domestic industries in these countries, we would also support things like safety standards and environmental regulations for foreign actors as well. And note that often these regulations come about when there is massive backlash to, yes, sometimes horrific incidents happening in factories owned by Primark and H&M. Such backlash has often actually created movements to strengthen regulations and things like this. Do we actually think that regulations are in fact possible?"

With that, let's introduce some responses to their first two substantive arguments in today's round. First, that foreign investment harms individuals, and second, basically that local industries are better. These arguments were essentially two sides of the same coin, and we have a number of responses. First of all, we tell you that regulations in fact cancel, that international backlash to massively problematic conditions cancel. But second, this characterization that they tell you of small boutique local businesses owning massive mines in countries is just a little bit false. It is likely that even if mines in industries like that are owned by the residents of that country, it is probably going to be massively wealthy residents who can do things like buy a mine in a country. They're unlikely to be from the small village that is running that mine and are likely to suffer from some of the same structural problems that they identified with foreign investors on their side of the house. This was simply not unique and a very misleading characterization. But third, even if there are some problems with foreign investment in terms of regulatory standards, we tell you that the comparative is worse. There is actually quite a reason and their assertion that, you know, neoliberal ideas that foreign investment is bad or a lie was a little bit assertive because we tell you that the scale of foreign investment is just way, way, way larger than any possible scale of local investment that can exist on our side of the house. The amount of industries that you can create and jobs that you can create is just way, way larger on our side of the house. Why is this important? When the scale of investment is larger, the number of, say, factories and industries that you can create to lift people out of poverty and subsistence agriculture, which is the necessary comparative their side has to defend, is much, much larger. And we absolutely think that this has to happen relatively soon, because the longer people are starving in subsistence agriculture, the more they suffer. We're very proud of those."

This is particularly true in developing countries, many of which have emerged from post-colonial societies. Their borders are particularly arbitrary because they're often drawn just randomly by external actors. Take the example of the Syphs-Picot agreement, where the former prime minister of our lovely opponents on the proposition, Winston Churchill, literally took a napkin and randomly drew the borders of the Middle East. It ignored ethnic lines and the true borders of what these countries should be, and were essentially affected by the grandeur. Similar things happened with the partition of India, the partition of Africa, and this is true of much, if not most, of the developing world. Why does this matter? We don't think that individuals living within countries have an unlimited right, an exclusive right to property, simply because you were born one mile east of the line that says this is where one country ends, this is where one country begins. This is particularly true with immigration between nations in the global south. Immigration between nations like Algeria and Libya. Between nations like Sudan and South Sudan, where the distinctions, frankly, between these countries are entirely arbitrary. They have to defend this as well. It was not enough of them just to talk about the right investment. But our second idea of this argument is about diasporas. In an increasingly globalized world, where there is much more immigration, either because of things like conflict, or just because migrants from, say, India and South America and Japan want to move to other countries for more economic opportunities, they may become naturalized citizens of those other countries and technically be foreigners, but would not be able to move back to the country from which they are from and actually own land there. We think this is incredibly problematic."

With the advent of this kind of investment, yes, maybe labor standards aren't up to Western snuff, but the fact of the matter is this lifted tons of people out of poverty. Also take the example of India. The most impoverished regions in India are rural areas outside of cities out of poverty. Also take the example of India. The most impoverished regions in India are rural areas outside of cities without foreign factories. These are the poorest areas where in the winter, when your food doesn't grow, you literally have to watch your family starve.

I think before I get into the meat of this counter-laphole, I'd just like to note that they stand up and say in their stance that they explicitly support safety standards, and no joke, say that they are fine with incidents like Piranha Plaza taking place because it diverts Western media right from us. No thank you. First, they openly concede all of the abusive characterisation that Arthur brings to it first about how these jobs don't actually lift people out of poverty, they just screw them over. But second of all, and most importantly, they at no point engage with the sophistication that was literally word two of Arthur's speech. The 48 hour media cycle means that it is a method of lifting out of poverty that does not work. The second response we hear to Apple's documentation is one that says that international backlash is a sufficient method. We've already talked to you about this in a little bit in the introduction. But I'm going to provide you an example of this, a light product that was again not working. Foxconn, possibly the best example of their side, one that provides people with low costcost labour, resulted in a 5% share in the price for Apple. It is still the most valuable entity in the world, still has millions and millions of Western shareholders. We just do not think this mechanism is enough. And note, the entire lack of responsiveness to these six minutes of analysis often gives you about how local businesses are themselves able to perform, and why these businesses are so problematic. The second response they say is that, ah, if we have local people owning these businesses, they are likely to be rich locals and they're likely to have the same incentives as foreign owners. First, note that this is entirely an uncomparative argument, but second of all, there is no engagement with the sophistication of the analysis that Arthur brings you. They just cut and paste it from prep time into the debate, because he specifically and explicitly says, because these people live there, because they send their kids to these schools, because they have a vested interest as citizens that care about, for example, Uganda or the country that they live in, they are unhappy with water sources being polluted, with water pollutators being rampant, with their rainforest being destroyed. We just don't think that is plausible."

The first is she says that borders are arbitrary and consequently we should allow people to flow between them. The best example they've provided of this is someone who moves countries, like technically becomes a kind of citizen of that country, loses their right to be a citizen in another country, and can't move back and forth, can't own houses anywhere. What are our responses to this? One, on a factual level, people can open mass courts in multiple places, this justice is true. Second, explicitly in our stance that they clearly weren't listening to, Arthur tells you that if insofar as this debate is about companies, we are un-okay with the ownership of land and the leasing of land. But, when we're talking about individuals renting houses for their own interests and their own working lives, we are completely fine with that. Their burden in this argument was not to show that people don't have a right to enter another country, their burden was to show why a non-citizen has the right to own a portion of another country, something that they did not do. Their second substantive contribution to this debate was about foreign investment basically necessarily exploiting poor people, but providing them with low-cost labour they are able to access economic opportunity. I think I've already sufficiently mocked this latest characterisation in my introduction, but more to the point, we do not think that this is a sustainable model of development. We do not think sending your five-year-old daughter under a cotton mill and picking bits out of a machine with her small hands is a reasonable way to access the benefits, and then we'll talk about terms of education and upskilling. Where we tell you we're more likely to access that education and upskilling is where you have local businesses that employ local people in the upper eschenes of management, provided centres, for example, for universities and schools to be founded. Before I move on to my substantive questions, I'll take a few of them. What are the poorest parts of India? The rural areas that look like much of the country prior to foreign investment and industrialisation, or the cities that you deem as horrific bastions of oppression? Most people are both from un and impoverished areas, people that live in the suns, they're very poor, people that live in rural areas, they're very poor. But we point out that overwhelmingly, if you want to claim that the benefits of international business is investing, they tend not to invest in rural areas, they tend to invest in urban areas. And that's where all of the stuff about the rising of house prices necessarily excluding local developments is so problematic, and it becomes much more problematic if they didn't provide that help in first."

It's good to know that foreign investors are necessarily evil in all circumstances, but when they have unchecked power, that is when they're evil. How do we check that power? Two ways. First, by the mechanism of taxation. When a company has to register in a nation, or when a citizen has to go through the citizenship track in order to own land and action, which I think many people have been sent to do, they are now unable to systematically skirt taxation. This is an enormous problem in massive sectors of the world, where, for example, in Uganda, BP dodges every year up to 400 million US dollars of other tax, and the entirety of the Ugandan healthcare system only gets 380 million dollars of government funding. We're able to access that by encouraging the companies that do remain in these nations to become legitimate ones to pay taxation, but that is the point at which benefits are more likely to be harmed than benefits. Notice, this argument directly responds to and engages with their contention about the provision of education and provision of local services. Because if we on our side can show you how the tax budget of these nations improves exponentially in some circumstances, you're much more likely as a developing nation to be able to afford that investment in your own partners. Second of all, we're going to talk to you about court structures. We think it is an unfortunate reality that companies like BHP Billiton are, by virtue of the fact that they are not registered in Indonesia, but are instead registered in London, are able to skirt their legal responsibilities in many of these states. This looks like when the Indonesian government filed complaints against BHP Billiton for the spilling of acid into local water sources, for the pollution and destruction of rainforests, the BHP Billiton for the spilling of acid into local water sources, for the pollution and destruction of rainforests. The BHP Billiton company countersued the Indonesian government. But they didn't take them to court in Indonesia. They take them to court in London. They take them to court in New York. They take them to court in Paris. And we force these companies, if they want to access resources, if they want to provide social good for themselves and for local people, and we force them to become national organisations, to have headquarters, to employ local people in their management positions, to file for and pay their taxes. That is the point at which we can hold them to account for the abuses that, by the way, both sides of this debate can see exist.

We gave you the example of how in rural India, every single year workers choose to return to store and build factories in the winter because the alternative is starvation. For example, building a bridge owned by a different country means that a farmer can get from point A to point B where they could not do so before. But now, let's answer this third argument on the idea of skirting taxation. Large companies are systematically able to skirt taxation in every country, including developed ones. This is simply an argument for why foreigners shouldn't be allowed to own land anywhere, not specific to developing countries.

We would say around the world, people have no other option but to leave their home and functionally have no state on which to own land. The impact is compounded by the 20.5 million predicted private-chain refugees in the upcoming century. This analytic makes sense considering that we are already witnessing the mass absence of people who are moving away from coastal and air refugians due to flooding, droughts, and extreme weather. At that point, we are dealing with over 3 billion people, largely in developing countries, that characteristically are more vulnerable to extreme weather than to the economic inability to develop adaptive infrastructure, who are currently facing and surrounding states with great political instability. Due to the most significant and critical ways refugees can survive in their new states is through land ownership. Why this is the case? Many countries and refugees relocate for land, substance, and agriculture. Literally meaning that the way a refugee will survive is largely dependent on the ability to own land to farm or establish a business. For example, working-class Muslim populations of Sotoland and Mongolia exist, and countries such as Jordan along the Jordan River or Turkey next to the Mediterranean Sea have high populations of Syrian refugees who similarly pursue land grants in order to have such-and-such agriculture. In the proposition world, this mechanism disappears because they would deny them the ability to own the land. The impact is further"

Look, we're not going to stand up here and deal with their cute little anecdotes about Winston Churchill. Ford is one of the arbitrary, but we think that things that probably aren't are things like tax structures, are things like how you engage with the state, precisely the kind of accountability mechanism that Ed's talking about. We think when these large NNCs are able to avoid engaging with the state on those levels, when we think individuals don't do that, probably the question of whether borders are arbitrary becomes a critique irrelevant. Then they tell us refugees and migrants need the capacity to buy up land. This was slightly strange because they gave us two minutes to believe that these individuals are living on subsistence, that they are some of the most vulnerable people within nations, and then told us they were going to buy houses? Like, I'm genuinely a little bit confused as to how they think it's happening. Probably the most likely mechanism is the things that Ed tells you about, for instance, renting, for instance, being offered accommodations, or actually, if we're being realistic, living in a refugee camp. But we also think that when refugees want to live in countries for the long term, or migrants do, they often just do pursue things like citizenship, which we'd be happy to support up and down our venture.

When these companies, crowding out all other local enterprise, are the only economic opportunity they have and are able to continue to exploit them. We never got any responses to Arthur's contention about non-sustainable use of resources, or any reason to believe that the development incentives of these corporations would align with the development of individuals, we presume they concede on this one. If they want to break down that, it's a little bit later. Then they tell us about the mechanism of backlash. The first issue here is that this conceives a lot of the abuses we told you about. It seems they've tried to prove to us that conditions in these factories aren't as bad as they say. Probably backlash isn't the mechanism they want to go into.

              "text": "Then I took up this issue of what does development look like on our side of the house with that sort of point of information. Our argument is not that individuals are so impoverished that they can't do things like buy a house, which we think they have the right to do, is that they can't do things like build factories, which are necessary prerequisites for economic development in these countries. Don't misconstru our analysis. No, no, no, no, no. Your argument is that people who are economic migrants, living or subsistence, people who are refugees, playing with nothing but what's in their hand, are going to be buying up land rather than renting it or rather than seeking refugee camps. Like, a little bit late for a reframe but I think that's enough to go in your eye. Okay, let's look at what development looks like on our side of the account. Because the first thing that we told you, and this was something we never really thought through, was that under this 80-quote, because of the increase in land prices, the precipitation, whether bidding wars between big NNCs, individuals can't get jobs in enterprises. They told us these individuals on the outside of the house won't be able to have jobs, but what they did is that they're playing with the same dichotomy that actually exists on their side now. That is to say that on one side you have the option to be an agrarian farmer, on the other side you have the option to work abusively for an MNC. The world that we offer you is one where small scale local enterprises, okay maybe they're not quite as large as something that's fancy and high or even as popular, are able to offer people reasonable employment. We also told you that because they have vested and long term interest in these states, individuals who live in them are likely to develop better. We've got two results. The first thing is this idea of scale. Okay, let's actually break down what we mean by scale. Because we think in the majority of instances, what they're probably talking about is corporations that have states in a variety of different nations. These might seem to be corporations doing things like building railways to link up the ports and their different functions. Resources and scales that are inaccessible to most local people. And they're probably being allowed to disobey in their burdens to prove that people's lives get better. Then they tell us that these people have less resources. I've kind of already dealt with that enough in my introduction, but we've kind of got to the point where cost-cutting and monopolies are precisely the things that actually make MNCs less efficient than local people, who don't have those same incentives. Then they tell us that foreign investment uses low labour to convert agrarian economies into industrial ones. Firstly, Ebott's already told you why this is a pretty lazy assumption and a pretty lazy characterisation of what these nations actually look like. But more importantly, they cannot similarly obtainously tell us that there is an incentive to upskill the workforces of these countries, and that their workforces having no skills is the only thing that draws MND here. And this is where the imported material industry may come. Because we think ultimately, if you're a lot to national inspiration, you have no incentive to up-skill or protect or provide infrastructure for a workforce when you're importing the educated part of it, right? And we've also pointed out that when the price of land goes up, it is so much harder for anyone else in those societies to build up the kind of infrastructure that would improve people's quality as well. Finally, their only response to Ed's argument was a pretty like, misogynistic one. If you can skirt taxation anywhere in the world, it completely neglects what we've already told you, that the racist economies, even in their best case scenario, where regulation is beautiful and no backlash happens every day, these countries will never be able to enforce what is in their own interests. and all of our staff. Please, I just want to say, continue to breathe. Hold on to the window, please. Thank you. Thank you. so From the very beginning of the first opposition speech, we gave you a very holistic interpretation"

Two reasons.

At the corner, we already are winning.

              "text": "Now let's go on to the first question you ask yourself in this round. Which side best protects the economy? Now they gave you two arguments, really, that are two sides of the same coin. What were they? They said, well, exploitation increases and local industries are better. Let's first respond to exploitation. We had a number of them that didn't get sufficient engagement with. First of all, we told you that really foreign investment incentivizes greater investment from other countries into these developing countries who need it the most, with the ownership of land therefore help speak to it in a few ways. First of all, we already told you from the first opposition speech that developing countries have become harder to get into labour. Their response was, well, that opens them up to exploitation. But remember, we told you that there are regulations that can exist to stop us from exploitation, to which their response was, well, regulations don't work because these other countries just don't have incentive to follow them. Remember the incentive analysis that Emily gave to you in her second speech that explained But that quotation doesn't work, or sorry, regulations don't work because these other countries just don't have a definitive problem. Remember the incentive analysis that Emily gave to you in her second speech that explained why regulations don't work. We did just list off one example and call it an argument about how regulations work. We told you that these countries, mainly examples like China and India, do have incentives to try and improve work regulations. Why was this the case? Because when you improve regulations and improve labor standards, that's one, it increases the likelihood that people will still work for the companies that they say are so harmful, but two, it gives them the ability to access better labour conditions that will ultimately make their company more productive and thus more profitable. We think that regulations certainly still exist on our side of the house. It's in very lower direction to try and force us to defend exploitation. But third of all, even if you buy, some exploitation does happen. We think that it's reasonable ground for us to argue, from the very first opposition speech, that not only do regulations exist, but that the comparative is infinitely worse. We honestly want to clarify what our characterization of developing countries is all about. We don't think that developing countries want to just stay developing and want to be exploited. They ultimately want to become a developed nation. And so in that sense, when foreign land ownership is one of the most viable avenues to get to that idea, we think that ultimately, your only option is to approach. But let's go on to the second argument that I told you about how land prices will increase and that basically increases the likelihood of economic downfall. We had a few responses. First of all, we took that the places where foreigners, or like foreign companies, which they want to focus on, are most likely to invest, are places that are most likely after the investment to urbanize. And they tell you, oh, in rural areas, prices for land will increase. We actually contest that. We think in rural areas, prices will still remain cheap, because why is this the case? We think that's when cities within these developing countries urbanize. That doesn't automatically mean that lesser developed rural cities will have to jack up their prices to compete. We don't think that was the analysis that actually forged the response. What we told you is that rural areas that oftentimes don't have as much resources, oftentimes have to keep prices low to attract more investment to their own rural cities. Why do we think that's important? Because we have to analyze the scale of the comparative. We told you that the scale of investment that is received from foreign individuals, the companies that they talk about, is much greater than any local industry that they could run by your lives. Their second substantive argument is hung completely on the idea that local companies are able to thrive and help the country's economy overall. We think the scale of investment, the scale of the money that these local companies are able to thrive and help the country's economy overall. We think the scale of investment, the scale of the money that these local companies are able to accrue is so minute in comparison to the scale of investment that foreign multinationals are able to offer that on that coherent analysis alone, they lose the debate. What are we telling them on our side of the house? We told them that when multinational corporations have an incentive to invest, that means that they have the ability to improve working conditions on our side of the house. If they want to talk about exploitation, if they want to talk about lax standards, then you default to the opposition. Why? Because we told you that the prerequisite to get better standards, to get better economic development, is to have an initial stimulus from that foreign investment. What do we hear in response? Very little. Second question in this debate."

Given the structural reason that foreign investments shuts out local businesses, why the foreign investment isn't allowed, won't local economies be allowed to develop from your horrific starving alternatives? Okay, this is again where we beg you to engage with the comparator. Because what we told you is that when foreign companies are not allowed to invest in these developing countries, that means that these developing countries' ability to try and get more money to build up their industries is very minimal. Why is this a problem? Because since these global companies just don't have as much resources compared to their foreign counterparts, that means the likelihood they'll be able to inject enough cash to build up their economies is very low. That's why on the comparative we're winning because we give the prerequisite need for greater investment that foreign companies have in order to try and boost up these developing countries' economies."

We thought it was devastating for the families who were split apart that now cannot buy land in their home state or the states that they move to on their side of the house. The comparative is the most disadvantaged people, who we both agree need to be protecting in this round, the most vulnerable to losing their homes, the most vulnerable to economic inequality, are the ones who will lose out on their side of the house. At the point where they don't do anything to protect them, we take this debate. Their only response to this idea of arbitrary borders was that, well, dual citizenship can still exist. First of all, that's a vast minority of cases, very few countries offer that. But second of all, they literally just told with their second-prof speech that these people can still wait for four years to get citizenship. Tell that to a Syrian refugee who is now living in Lebanon, desperate to have a home.

Because locals suffer from high land prices, they're unable to invest in improving their economy. That is why local individuals are pouring billions of dollars into building factories. We just reject this characterization. We tell you that in the vast majority of cases, actually all cases, it is more true that local individuals just do not have billions of dollars lying around. That is why these countries are developing in the first place. The scale of investment is just way lower. Nikhil told you that in rural areas, land prices are still low. Why do you think that there is not massive investment happening? It's clearly not because land prices are low. It's because individuals do not have the resources to invest. Note that these rural areas look like the vast majority of developed countries writ large before the age of investment. This is the comparative they had to engage in. And it is just factually true that rural areas are poor, suffer from more starvation and disease. It was not enough for them to come up here and simply assert that that is not true.

              "text": "Two questions, development and holding businesses to account. Before that, I think we need to take a quick check in this argument that they're trying to run this debate about, minority groups and individuals moving across countries. We focus this debate on businesses and rich individuals because we focus this debate on the people that actually own and buy land. That is people who are rich individuals that purchase second homes, that is rich individuals who can afford to buy a house. Because God knows most of Team Proposition and Opposition can't afford to buy a house themselves. But most importantly here, they come back and say in the even reply, some people can afford from minority backgrounds, which is they run businesses, to own houses. We told you that was an overwhelming minority. But the reason this argument cannot win the debate is because they never proved why non-citizens have a right to buy a portion of a country rather than simply renting it and co-opting all of the benefits of having a house. First question on development. ARPA tells you that multinational organisations do three things. They own your national resources, which shuts out any opportunity for future developments. They only ever employ you in a subservient capacity, they don't employ you as managers or executives, so they don't send you to school, they don't send you to university. Third, in terms of the IP or land prices, it means that any local opportunity is shut out. We've then told you that the local owners, one, don't do this because they live in these areas, and second, they don't do this because they cannot move overseas. So for their first, second and third speakers to say, oh well rich local people will do this too, is not only not engaging but a direct tension in their own case where they say there is a lack of start-up cash. There are rich locals, there is start-up cash. Second thing they say, and they've got a couple of responses, new and third they say there is a comparative advantage in cheap labour. We're telling you this is just not true. We're telling you these individuals have a comparative advantage in resources, in their natural minerals in the South of America, in the oil fields that populate much of the Middle East and Africa. But they lose that comparative advantage when, in the second half of the 20th century, those are bought by multinational corporations, they are bought by foreign governments, they are bought by wealthy individuals. Again, you inferred, they say that actually these companies have an incentive, rich individuals have an incentive to invest in rural areas and to urbanise those areas. We think if you look at the overwhelming majority of places in which companies like Coca-Cola and Apple invest, it's not like in the middle of nowhere, in like a really small rural area, it's in urban areas, that's where this debate primarily lies. Second, how do we hold these individuals to account? They ran away from this argument in this debate, time and time again. To some extent, I don't blame them. Because in first block, we're talking about the systematic abuse of power that killed 250 people in Rana Plaza. Something they conceived and indeed wants to happen more often, in the words of their first speech, because it is an accountability mechanism. What did we tell you there? First, they said that regulation can happen, but that it gnaws the sophisticated material that ARCHA has to give you. That by virtue of the fact that multinationals can go everywhere, and they want, and second, of their ability to hold your local governments to account. Because they literally own your mines, they own your islands, they employ and enormous manage your population. Because of that, we structurally cannot hold them to account. No response there. But we told you that when we encourage these businesses to play by the rules, we reap a load of benefits. We told you about taxation, they said, oh, well these businesses will avoid taxes anyway. Not an argument in response to the fact that actually some of these businesses probably won't avoid tax and we legally require them to pay them. But, in our second speech, we told you about international legal systems rigged in the favour of multinational corporations and argue they do not comply. If you believe someone has a right as a rich, affluent individual or multinational corporation to own a portion of another country and hold the local people to ransom, maybe you are burning for side opposition."

In the status quo, there are obviously loads of regulations about what data companies can have access to. However, it is crucial to recognize there is a difference between selling your data and the status quo we are proposing on our side. What are the differences? We think when you sell your data, here are what things companies can exclusively do. They can sell your data to third parties. They can get more specific data, i.e. your medical data, your relationship, socioeconomic status, data from other platforms, biometric data, i.e. Apple can sell the photo you use for your face on their firms."

No, thank you. First argument, why is this choice exploitative? Our premise is that a coercive choice may not be bad, but a coercive choice that is exploitative is bad. If I force you to take $50, it's coercive, but no one will think that is bad. If I'm forcing you to give me 50 bucks, that becomes actively harmful and exploitative. Being able to sell your data for a small return per month pushes people to make bad choices when they are unable to make informed and good decisions. We protect individuals when the choice is actively harmful and exploitative. So the question becomes, why is this choice to sell your data exploitative? This is true for about three reasons. One, because of information asymmetry. The average person probably does not know too much about the tech sphere or what happens to digital data. It is unclear where your data goes, who receives it, when your data is monetized, or when your data is sold to third parties and companies. Once you sell your data, you have lost complete ownership of it. This is irreversible, and you do not know the parameters in which your data will operate in.

We already see this in the status quo, but we think it's far more coercive and harmful when you are not able to monetize your data. But C, we think in many cases, people have a short-term gain versus indefinite long-term harm belief. I.e., if I sell my data now, I don't really know where my data goes or what happens. It seems to me the harm is not very obvious, but I do know each year I can earn about 20 bucks. That seems like a decently attractive deal to make, and most people will definitely opt into this.

It only becomes a problem when everyone else is doing it as well, because that is when data and big data becomes useful. This means that you actively leave people behind. When you force all individuals to tend to give up data because of the network. Because for opposition to have any tangible impact, they need to have the vast majority of people selling their data in order to make big data and proper analytics. This normalizes data selling on their side. It becomes more likely that many services will be contingent upon giving up privacy, not just from social media companies like Facebook and Spotify, but potentially crucial financial services, i.e. having a reasonable interest rate bank account or access to retirement saving advertising. These are actively harmful. This means that the most vulnerable people, those who probably do not want to sell their data, some people who have a past they would like to forget about, people who they no longer want to associate with their lives. These are not the people who are shut out from essential services entirely, or they're more pressured to surrender the privacy they hold, as these are the individuals that will fall victim to the system.

But on their side, once you sell your data, it is no longer yours. The parameters as to where your data circulates never becomes clear because it can be sold to any party on their side. You lose control over your data. Therefore, the conclusion of this argument is that exploitative choices are unjust and actively harms people when they're unable to make informed choices. Before I move on to my question, I'll take a POI. Do you support people getting paid for things like professional wrestling or boxing? If their concern is about bodily autonomy, we say on our side, your access to your rights actively infringes on other people's rights and causes massive harm. That is non-analogous.

It is part of who you are and your fundamental right to yourself as to how much you want to expose. The mechanism is why does it mean that it's actually undermined on their side? Because what does the status quo look like? Often when you have regulations, you are absolutely prohibited to sell data to third parties. Even if Facebook can use your data for advertising, they're never able to sell it out of their current company. These are rules that you can set up. If companies violate them, you can punish them retrospectively and enforce deterrence. You can advocate for better regulation. This looks like a lot of class action lawsuits that already happened against Facebook. Advocacy is based on the fact that it is your data. It highlights the idea of consent. It is based on the idea that companies are massive and are exploiting you. The comparative on their side is that you now lose the ability to advocate when companies have bought the data, when regulations are already circumvented and broken. They have sacrificed huge amounts of money to create that business model of selling and using data. If you try to tell them that they need to change it, they're not able to act against you because you have already given up your consent and given up the idea of protection. The conclusion of this argument is that one, you have decreases in regulation. This looks like the regulation of not selling information to third parties, which is often massively harmful. But two, it is difficult to get future regulations, i.e. when you are able to sell things like biometric data, facial recognition, AI, for things like receipts, to calculate risk rates, and calculating who to give mortgages to. This means it's far more harmful if the harm is actively magnified when you sell and monetize your data. Quickly on the"

But ultimately, they needed to justify a blanket ban on this policy, not simply like give you some minor harms that could eventuate. This was a strategic failing of them, and it's something I'm going to analyse deeper in my speech. Firstly, two questions to set up. What do these exchanges look like? We think these exchanges operate on a scale, from cash-in- hand transactions for surveys on the street to companies offering discounts on products in exchange for data collection that might look like lifting a paywall, for example. Secondly, on our stance, because for propositions policy to work, they need some means to regulate how companies collect that data.

That danger is rewarded by providing them a greater income. We even allow people to physically exert themselves to the point of collapse and pay the millions of dollars in athletic contracts for doing so. Proposition must justify their ban not only by proving why it might be bad, but by showing that it is so bad that we should never allow anybody to engage in this practice for money. The damage that selling your data does, however bad it may be, is so much less than a series of 13 concussions that we allow athletes to incur under the status quo.

Firstly, there is a massive congregation of information on the internet that is used in mundane tasks like cooking recipes to more important decisions like information on politicians for voting. Secondly, people use services like Google Maps to find their way around the city. And thirdly, platforms of social media like WhatsApp and Facebook are vital means of communication for people.

Note that under the status quo, under site opposition, platforms could afford to keep themselves free because they were able to collect data from internet traffic. So why did we resolve this? Because we allowed for people to opt back into original profit models where they exchanged data for access that was serving them very well. They were able, additionally, we were able to regulate malicious data collection such that consumers can opt in and out of it, which co-opted a lot of the proposition's material on things like coercion. This allows individuals to access platforms that are becoming slowly unavailable. It allows them to access news that is vital for being informed and make democratic decisions. It allows them access to educational content on YouTube, access to services like Google Calendar for their scheduling, access to communication methods that help them foster relationships. But as subscription models emerge, selling data in exchange for money used to pay for those subscription services is a means of financial compensation for that data. As time progresses, however, it is likely that you see individuals able to sell their data more directly, like selling their search history to Google for fixed monthly rates, for selling their location data for the past month in exchange for Facebook shares. This was additionally a massive benefit in this debate because it forms a means of passive income for individuals that don't use the internet either way. This was a way that they could pay for their daily essentials. It could help them pay rent. It could contribute to their savings for larger financial security."

Because notice how the entirety of Proposition's case hinged on the analysis behind data collection being exploitative and bad. But we can flip this because users massively benefit from data being collected for their personally. Firstly, because it personalizes the internet for them. This is the reason for the popularity of platforms like TikTok that are able to deliver personalized content about things that people actually care about. But secondly, it allows for advertising that caters to people's wants and desires. Companies can generalize and use your personal information to determine what products you actually want. That means you get a constant comparison of things you want to buy, greater competition because you see the best prices and qualities available, and just generally, people enjoy looking at the products that are targeted towards them that they actually want to buy. This also meant that daily conveniences were much more accessible to people because now applications could use their location data to show you how far you walk today, to show you the weather for the correct location. These were all things that operated exactly within companies wanting to optimize their products so that consumers liked them, so that they could make profit. This was the strongest reason those companies had and the reason why this data collection was being used broadly for these positive purposes. These were things that made people's lives easier. This occurs every single day to millions and millions of people across the world. It might be easy for proposition to try and dismiss these impacts, but these make people's lives less tedious, less difficult, and far more fun.

Data is a massive headstart in that sense, and it creates a super uncompetitive market, right? The impact of reducing competition is initially, it might look like it's okay. It might look like you're getting better services, but the harm is in the long-term. When companies are so advantageous and so competitive that they get a majority market share, or at least a substantial amount, that is when they have a chokehold and they can start raising their price. Once they have a monopoly, they have no incentive to innovate in the future. If you sacrifice that monopoly in a truly free market in the short term, it's going to lead to harms in the long term.

Secondly, that privacy is particularly important and thirdly, that other people are likely to be affected. Note on the first one, they give two broad reasons as to why this is coercive and exploitative. They say, firstly, there is an information asymmetry, and secondly, they say that people have a short-term perspective. On the first, is there an information asymmetry? I think that, firstly, note that information asymmetry is not a reason why we ban a vast majority of things in the status quo. I think that, note, that the vast majority of people that participate in very dangerous sports are not actually aware of the particular long-term effects that playing it when you're seven years old can have on your brain 50 years later. I think that also fulfills the permanency that they want to talk about as well. I don't think information asymmetry is something that justifies banning, but even if it was, I don't think this information asymmetry exists. I think that A, we can just mandate that you have more education, but particularly I think that scandals such as Cambridge Analytica in the past have made people a lot more aware of data in the status quo. People investigate that a lot more. It's something people are constantly thinking about. I do not think that, I think this information asymmetry may have existed five or 10 years ago, but under the status quo where people are very concerned about this kind of thing, they actively do seek information out. It's something that does not exist. Secondly, on the short-term perspective, I think firstly, this is again, untrue. People deeply care about data. I think that people are aware of it, but also I think that short-term perspectives are often very justified. I think if you can get money out of this now, and that can help you right now, it is very just to trade off your long term like long-term data safety if you can get a benefit out of that i think that's a choice people do have the ability to make i think they need to give a structural reason as to why it is literally impossible to consider the impacts rather than just say that some people are likely to prioritize one over the other on the second point they say that privacy is incredibly important and the they try and use to do this is like saying that people are like forced to wear seatbelts, even though there is no like active, even though, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you do not allow people to not. I think the first thing to note is that the reason they give for this is that there is no benefit from not wearing a seatbelt. That immediately proves why this is different. You get money out of this. That means there is a benefit to selling your data. I don't think that stands. But also they haven't given a structural reason why privacy is an innate good. I think if someone actively chooses to opt out of their privacy in order to get something else, that is justified. On the third point, other people losing out, I think they still have not proven significant substantive harms as to why that is actively harmful. I think note the material we bring you, the fact that we allow people to incur harms when they get money out of it. We note that's why there are certain jobs that pay more because they are damaging to your body. I think that's why very much it is legitimate to give people personal choice, particularly when we offer them compensation,"

Firstly, they've said surveillance technology can deeply harm people. Note, this is the vast, vast minority of people in this debate. Almost no one actively lives in a situation where they are going out to protest compared to the number of people on the internet as a whole. That is to say that we can scale our benefits here. We can give every single individual on the internet a more personally targeted advertising and algorithm, and that is likely to, on net, improve their lives more so. Note that the small number of people in a surveillance state are also probably worse off under side proposition anyway when they still allow the collection of data. That's something that still exists. I think if that's a harm, they incur all of that as well. Note they also incur all the harms out of Cambridge Analytica as well because they have not given an entirely structural reason as to why they cannot sell to third parties. Note the material that we bring on this issue that has not gotten a sufficient response. The fact that things such as paywalls are becoming more prevalent, that is why it is not justified to just say that the vast majority of sites under the status quo are not paywalls. They are becoming more and more paywalls. That's why like YouTube is adding even more ads to the start of their videos. That means people are locked out from actively accessing important websites and data. That is particularly important for people who are not able to afford to go past paywalls on a constant basis. Note that you can get paid a significant amount of this. Even if in small subsets, this is a small amount, this can add up very quickly. You can get a lot of compensation. Before I go on, I'll take this POI. Why would companies buy the data if they can get it for free right now and can't sell it to third parties on your side? Oh, no, it's because at the moment, people are trying to avoid selling their data, but some people are likely to still be prepared to do that if they can get money out of it. That's why we're seeing the trends that we set up in first to no response. OK, but note that there were also benefits of data collection. We give you all of these benefits. They agree that these are benefits and are still trying to ban people from being able to access to have as much data."

              "text": "I think that means that we're able to win on all of that practical material. Lastly then, on to a second speaker post of substantive, why banning in particular is likely to lead to more malicious data collection. Note firstly, companies are always likely to continue to try and collect data. That is because they rely on it for their algorithms. They rely on it for their profit models. If they cannot do that, that's when they start setting paywalls. That means that if side proposition does not want people to start setting up paywalls for everything, they are likely to go into more malicious forms of data collection. What were the impacts of this? Note that the best case for side proposition was they continue to buy, but in a market that is unregulated. That means that people cannot control rates. They cannot control where the data is going. Comparatively, under our side, we can offer government regulation. That transaction is something that can have checks and balances. That is a transaction that can be followed. It is something that people can be aware of. But note the inside proposition's worst case, and we think this is far more likely because companies are likely to try and avoid bypassing this buying mechanism. They are likely to actively turn to malicious means. That means more companies are trying to buy it from the third parties where you have absolutely zero control over the transaction at any point. You get absolutely no compensation for it. Note that that means that that is worse on all of the principled harms that side proposition tries to bring you at first, but also the practical harms because people are not getting any money out of this transaction. At the end of this speech, the important thing to note was that this was not just a debate about was data collection ever bad. It was firstly a ban-regulate debate, and side proposition did not engage with the regulation that we are able to get that they can't. But secondly, it was about the fact that people can make an autonomous decision to collect money even if they incur a harm. That is something that people have the legitimate choice to do. Side proposition needs to respond so proud to oppose."

              "text": "We told you all the way from first. Data is analogous to your safety in the current age. When the choice of selling data is incredibly coercive, uninformed, and exploitative, we should never allow individuals to subject themselves to this transaction. Four things I'm going to do in my speech. One, what does banning data actually mean? Two, which side protects choice? Three, which side protects privacy? And four, which side improves the technological industry? Onto what does banning data actually mean? Because don't let Australia muddy the waters. It's very clear. We said that companies can still collect data, but this is the distinction. The data under our world is yours. The data is the companies in Australia's world. We said that regulation against data exists right now, even though it's not a transaction. This looks like the fact that you're unable to sell to third parties. It was simply asserted that you can't regulate something unless it's a transaction. We don't see why this is a case, but the example Jeff brought to you about Cambridge Analytica was that the reason why it's such a big scandal is because there were repercussions that were enforced afterwards when lawsuits were brought up, when the companies had to pay. On to the first question then, which side protects choice? Maddy told you that the choice to sell your data is exploitative. And when choices are overly exploitative, you ban them, like selling your organs, like working below minimum wage. So instead of accusing us of not defending the ban, Australia should probably listen to our case. We said that we ban choices if you can't make the choice rationally, and if there is massive harm. We told you that you can never clearly make the choice to sell your data. You lack information about the specifics of what will happen with your digital data, because it's under the guise of technical jargon. Saying that you'll have more education and scandals bring awareness is not sufficient responses. We told you that when everyone around you uses the same networking and social media platforms that you don't want to be shut out, that this is a collective action problem. No response to that. We also told you that your data is inherently linked to others, that the delineation of what is considered your own data is often unclear. Information about your financial status is indicative of your families. Claiming that you might have a joint bank account doesn't take down this argument, and their lack of response is appalling when you don't consent to the third-party harm you're facing. They gave us two pushes. The first push was that people should be able to make a choice, and it may be worthwhile. So, for example, you allow people to make dangerous choices like workers' construction or wrestling. We say that, one, we ban plenty of people from choices in the status quo because of the likely probability of harm. It might be worthwhile in some cases, but in majority of instances, it is not. This looks like banning people from working below minimum wage. There can be benefits, but the harm of them doing so is far greater. But two, don't let Australia get away with claiming that this harm is negligible. Maddie and Jenna told you very clearly in first and second, that it's not about having a little more targeted advertising. It is about the potential for massive harm. Because even if it might not happen often, once it happens, it is irreversible. The fact that once you sell your data, you cannot control where it goes and you never process it. We told you about third-party selling, whether that is to governmental agencies that can use it for facial recognition. It looks like the potential for selling your data to surveillance agencies, or it looks like lowering your socioeconomic conditions and promoting loan shark acts to poor people on Robin Hood. This is all massively harmful. The second push they got from us was that money is beneficial, but we think that this is really laughable when Australia claims that someone who's economically struggling can now pay for their savings. This is unrealistic. The money you earn is probably going to be negligible. Think about the amount of users that use a single platform versus the amount of money companies are willing to pay. These platforms have millions of users they need to distribute costs across. What is the conclusion of this argument? Australia's glib responses were damning because we told you about why this is clearly exploitative,"

              "text": "that measures like education don't get rid of the fundamental problem of the networking effect when you don't want to be shut out of these social media platforms. On to the second question then, which side of privacy? We told you that, yes, the status quo is not perfect. We agree, but it's better than the world of Australia's. There are regulations right now, despite data not being a transaction for data usages. And the reason for that is because data is still seen as yours and the consent is unclear. However, all of this is undermined in their world when the data is seen as belonging to the company. This is the comparative. This is not something that they can co-opt because Maddie made this very clear in her first speech to the difference. The only line of response about co-optation was lethal to Australia. And third is too late because this was debate winning. When there is a decrease in regulation because the data is no longer seen as yours, it is harder to get future regulation for problems we have not even begun to imagine yet. It looks like banking systems being able to use data based on the financial and purchasing choices to deny African-Americans loans when you feed it within the algorithm. It looks like governments using your biometric data to jail political dissidents. It looks like facial recognition that targets people seen as a threat to the state. They gave us three pushes here. One, they said that consumers will need to pay because you can't collect data. But we think that this just doesn't line up with reality because we see that currently most social media companies don't actually charge you. All of these companies understand that user traffic is probably important because it creates a network effect where everyone around you is using the same social media platform that increases further user traffic and increases a company's market dominance. But two, fine, maybe YouTube has paywalls for YouTube bed, but it's still ultimately free. And three, let's do some weighing here. We think that having to put up with slightly more ads or like a small paywall when there's going to be other free services because of market competition is something that is extremely negligible. We told you about the harm to privacy. Paywalls can't win this debate. This harm is something that we're perfectly willing to take on. But two, they told us that personalized internet is positive. But the harm to privacy. Paywalls can't win this debate. This harm is something that we're perfectly willing to take on. But two, they told us that personalized internet is positive. But once again, let's do some weighing here. We said that we're perfectly happy for you to do an extra Google search rather than have your right to privacy infringed when it means that you get targeted medical ads that are exploitative, when it means that you get links directing you to loan sharks because they know that you're economically unstable and that's more likely to take on those harmful loans. This is why privacy is important. For them to just push it off is not going to be enough. But we also say that, secondly, internet personalization for large platforms are going to be symmetric. It's not an exclusive benefit. We said that companies can still collect data. The difference is you don't sell additional, more specific data to companies, and the companies cannot use that data for their other malicious purposes. But three, they told us then that privacy is important. We told you from Maddie's speech that it is. It prevents the abuse of power. We agree, and we are the side that gets it. Before I move on, I'll take a POI."

Your company will be put out of business. This is what Jenna and Maddy have been saying. You should probably listen to our responses. But thirdly, onto which side reduces the monetization of the technology industry. Maddy told you that the largest companies have the most money to buy data, and this itself is debate winning, because they have a chokehold on the industries. They have less incentive to innovate. They're going to do things like focus more on advertising and marketing of existing products rather than creating better products. This looks like companies like Facebook being able to go into alternate sectors like cryptocurrency and being able to monopolize those sorts of industries. This looks like the fact that they have now less market incentive to compete, do less market incentive to innovate. So this looks like the fact that they're going to be spending more money on doing targeted outreach, targeted advertising, as opposed to bettering the product. The fact that we didn't respond an adequate, we didn't receive an adequate response from opposition was lethal because we told you that this doesn't just look like your right to privacy or your right to choice. This looks like the concrete impacts this has on the types of innovations humanity can get in the future. Australia's response was essentially really glib and really damning. And we think that the stuff Jenna brought to you about why this is critical for consumer innovation, critical for the future of humanity, was not responded to. This itself is debate winning. When you get better products because you don't have a monopolization, because big companies can't use their ultimate power of financial products to buy more data to get better marketing and advertising. This itself was debate winning and this is what we get on our side. We told you that exploitation is exploitation and Hong Kong protects choice and privacy."

To the extent that most of their benefits actually come from showing how you can regulate the industry, they don't win this debate because they prove exactly what we need to win this debate, which was that you needed regulation and not banning.

Secondly, on whether data collection is itself bad. And finally, on whether if data collection is indeed bad, who wins consumers in this debate. But firstly, on the principle. Their principle came in two parts. Firstly, on the information asymmetry. And secondly, on the fact that you heard others because it involves information about others. Notice that at the very, very beginning of their speech, they concede that this principle is entirely practically contingent because they say that if you give $50 to somebody who does not consent to being given $50, if you give $50 to somebody who does not know that they will be given $50, then that was fine under their side of the house. To the extent that that is true, the burden was on them to prove that this was practically worse under their side of the house. So this was not actually a principle at all. It simply deferred the decision of this debate onto who wins the practical argument. However, we give you an active principle that wins us the debate under our side of the house, which was this, that the barrier to banning something in a capitalistic society that was able to earn you money was extraordinarily high. That was because money gave you autonomy in capitalism. It was what allowed you to put food on the plates so that you could opt out of things like starvation. It was what gave you agency to choose where you send your children to school and how you engage with society in the first place. That was what money could do for you. So we allowed you to sacrifice a lot of personal liberties in order to make money that was why we allowed people to like engage in professional boxing where large men hit each other with boxing gloves until they remember no more like clearly that was like something that was terrible for you and any impact that data collection could have on you was so so minor compared to that so unless they could meet that threshold they could not justify banning something in this society. They don't refute that down the bench. Instead, they just keep giving you marginal impacts, like things like Cambridge Analytica, which, as Harry told you, was symmetrical anyway in this debate. So they needed to show you why it's past the threshold for needing to be banned. So then the burden in this debate is extraordinarily clear. They don't just need to prove that their site is marginally better on utility. They don't just need to prove that data collection was marginally a harm. They need to prove that it was so large a harm that it would justify banning in the first place. Before I move on to the practical considerations in this debate,"

Your side is the side that permits Cambridge Analytica without consequences. Will data be misused more or less likely on your side? Correct. You are able to sue them because they are banned. You are also able to sue them because it is regulated. You are able to regulate for selling things like customer demographic data. You are able to regulate for selling things like customer demographic data you're able to regulate for selling things like racial demographic data these are all things that you are able to regulate in selling we gave you this material at first if you don't respond to it down the bench i'm really like going to be surprised at what afroply does now so then the second consideration in this debate is is data collection bad because notice if we can win if we can show you that data collection is in fact a good in this debate then then the rest of the practical arguments that they bring you does not make sense. Their stuff on normalizing data selling, their stuff on selling the data of others is all contingent on you buying that there is a trade-off in the first place. If we can show you that there is no trade-off, then we can win this debate outright. So what were the actual harms that they brought you to data selling? Because notice that they were incredibly speculative and unjustified in this debate. Firstly, they told you that there are future speculative harms that you cannot currently conceptualize of. Notice that that can be said of literally anything in the world. And like you have to pay that in a debate. Clearly, that's not enough analysis to get them over the line. Secondly, they tell you about surveillance states. Notice like you have to ask yourself here, how big is the net change in this debate and how much is the policy actually going to affect this? Because we tell you that Google and Baidu's data wasn't what was giving the Chinese government power over regulating protests on its western border. Instead, we tell you that the government was the one banning it. So to the extent that the person informing this policy was also the one abusing these individuals, they could not claim this was a benefit in this debate. The government wasn't going to regulate itself. The government wasn't going to ban the selling of data to itself. Clearly, that was an absurd wish to make. Surveillance states were not a part of this debate because it is entirely symmetrical, because the government is not going to stop selling data to itself on the other side of the house. But notice what we got on the outside, and this is why we flipped this claim, because we told you that through things like social media, you were able to do things like organizing protests. Through things like open sources of media that were not behind paywalls, you were able to do things like organizing protests through things like open sources of media that were not behind paywalls you were able to gain media attention for your cause these were all means by which protests could be more successful under these states and not less that was and that won us the question of surveillance states and that flipped that argument secondly they told you that it corrupts democracies and they just tell you about Cambridge Analytica we tell you that that is insufficient in this debate Cambridge Analytica was a failure in regulation because data was unregulated. On our side, when we could regulate the data, we could also get that benefit. However, what did we tell you? And this is the stuff that gets no response. And this is why they actually lose this debate quite comprehensively. Because we told you firstly, that data could be personalized. And that made your experience of the internet so much better. They try to wave this off just by saying, it's just TikTok."

If they can collect this data, then clearly they lose on scale. Because if TikTok knows something about you, you probably also want Facebook to know something about you so you can get the targeted advertising and so you can get the benefits of personalization on that too. So if you bought their watch, then clearly we will decide that was able to bring you a far larger scale of impact. But secondly, we told you our paywalls. Their only response to this is, well, these paywalls aren't currently up, so why would they come up? That ignores the fact that we told you at first that this was a trend, that Facebook was operating at a loss, that YouTube was operating at a loss, that so many of these internet services were operating at a loss because people, because increased regulations had come in about how much data they could actually buy off customers and how much they could actually sell that data. When you impose those things, that meant that the trend was towards more paywalls and people being unable to access things. That's why YouTube ran mergers out of a system that did not have it before. Why was that particularly important? Because it meant that you locked people out of Britannica, out of YouTube, out of the New York Times, out of the Guardian. And these were key sources of information to these people. The only way you got that back was by restoring the old models of profit on the internet, which was through the selling of user data, which only occurred on the outside of the house. Notice at this point that we flipped data collection. The data collection was objectively a good in this debate and not a harm. To that extent, none of their harms could actually accrue because they relied on a trade-off that did not exist. They relied on a trade-off that said the data collection was a harm and they could not win on that front. So because of that, we tell you that all of their monopolization material also falls because of the fact that it relies on the exact same assumption that data collection is bad. For all those reasons, we're incredibly proud to stand on side opposition."

Two questions done in this reply. Firstly, is this a valid choice? And secondly, let's do a harm-benefit way. Firstly, is this a valid choice? Because we think that all bans on choice, firstly, are largely about weighing up the harms and benefits so we think the second clash takes precedence over this anyways for example with a seat belt people are biased against the unlikely risk of getting a car accident they make that choice out of negligence and just laziness it is not a true choice and the minor benefit of being a little more comfortable having some freedom to not wear something really means a lot less than your safety in the vehicle, right?"

We've told you most people are not tech wizards, education and transparency, the two buzzword counter-model they try to run cannot fix that. Some people are just too old and won't understand it. People don't have the time to understand complex issues. We also told you the consequences of this are going to be unclear because they're long-term. So people don't know what they're getting into. We told you that because these are long-term harms, it's also a collective issue. One person selling their data isn't that bad, but when everyone else does it for years and years, that's the problem. We told you on top of that, that there's massive pressure to opt into these things. They wanted to talk about paywalls. We talked about paywalls too. When we told you that if Facebook starts demanding that you sell the data to you, otherwise you can't use it. That's a massive amount of pressure for you to be able to access that data and for you to sell that data. So we told you this wasn't a valid choice. And other than that bit about information, they actually didn't engage with the four other layers that we gave you. But at the end of the day, so what? If you can't make this choice, we don't think the harms of that are all that bad. We gave you reasons why this probably wasn't going to be that much money so that it's going to change your life, be able to provide food on the table. This wasn't income, right? So secondly, then let's do the way up on the harms and the benefits, because we told you there is massive harms to this. And the fact that they're long-term doesn't mean they're not"

              "text": "real. We told you you were going to get less regulation because in the status quo, you do have some, maybe imperfect, but you do have some regulations. Like you cannot sell your data to third parties. And this is where it gets messy because Australia's whole case basically hinged on the sentence. You can't, you can only regulate something if it's a transaction. They never really explained why. We told you things are regulated right now. You do have to consent to terms and conditions. You do have to accept cookies on a website. You do have to, you can't sell data to third parties. The fact is Cambridge Analytica was illegal. So the harms of not having that regulation then we told you was that you're going to sell it to third parties. They told you, we just won't let them. Let's firstly note that the regulations they talked about evolved throughout the debate and largely only came up in op three, but also note then why would companies buy the data? If they tell us that companies can get this data for free right now, why would companies pay an additional price for it so that they can continue doing exactly what they're doing? We think their response assumed that Facebook, Instagram, and Google were in some sort of data drought right now, which is just factually untrue, right? But also note that when opposition three talks about additional regulations on the type of democratic data you were allowed to sell, it shows that they don't care about choice either because they would limit your ability to profit yourself in the short term, a rational choice they argued because they accept that there are long-term harms that way out that way outweigh it and are far more important. We told you the impacts of this are real, that we are able to regulate better, especially in the future when we are not sure what regulations we need right now, especially because if you don't regulate right now, after companies have spent billions of dollars buying that data, they're going to resist all regulations in the future. Both of these lines came up, both of them unresponded to on the regulation way up."

We told you this is going to harm the AI algorithms used for mortgages. It's going to mean that you have monopolies in major companies, including retail, to which again, we got no response. It limits your freedom. It limits your future access to money. Australia trades off everything that they care about so that you can get behind a paywall, which we told you isn't going to happen right now. Chloe explained why it's not profitable for companies to do that, but also that the people who care about privacy aren't the people part of this debate. But lastly, that you can have a pretty good time on the internet. You know what? I value my freedom more."

Panel, let's characterize an individual who are lured into these data selling deals. First of all, notice that to comprehend what kind of data are you selling, what kind of companies these are and where your data can be used requires immense previous knowledge. In order to process how data breaches happen or how algorithms work, you literally have to be an IT student. Even if opposition will say that you signed terms and conditions, which helps you to comprehend the deal, literally no one ever reads these agreements. It's just books of words that you scroll down and press the check button. But second of all, while society is generally aware of the fact that their data is being tracked, they assume that choosing to be paid for it is liberating charts. Need to understand that individuals do not recognize how much they should be paid for such access to their privacy in the very first place, assuming that any amount is better than the alternative, which is none. However, they completely misunderstand that the fundamental reason why data collection corporations exist in the very first place is because websites are smaller, companies want to have access to more data than they currently do. But third of all, individuals see the selling of data as an easy way to garner profit. At the point at which you Google easy ways to profit and see this as an opportunity, you assume that selling data will lift you out of your financial struggles or will at least help you out of that. We see this as an inherently problematic since it tricks individuals into thinking that they do not lose anything to this, since they do not have to put in efforts or time in order to actually earn this money. You're being paid a lot less than you deserve due to the preconception, misunderstanding, and general lack of IT knowledge. Why is this important? Panel will tell you that data about individual is the most vulnerable thing that you could ever think of. The way you operate on the internet, the types of videos you watch, etc. literally tells everything about you. If you google the nearest hospital, cost of abortion, and made a call to your significant other, the company automatically receives vulnerable information about you. If you watch Hassan Ali every morning, the company knows you're a socialist. If you have just had a baby and google what kind of products you need, these companies will sell your data to Johnson & Johnson for the spam and will spam you with predatory ads. That is the world opposition must defend. What does this mean at the end of this argument? At the point at which the collection of data opposition promotes provides active harm to an individual's well-being and is not a conscious choice until the governments have an obligation to intervene and prevent individuals from making these deals in the very first place. The safe parallel is used to limit an individual's bodily autonomy by governments in current legislative system, giving them citizens unaware of the harms their actions might entail."

              "text": "Hence, individuals actually is the financial minus on their side of the house. Pano, let us take a look at the motives behind purchasing data. Notice how all of these uses are never wholly taken into account by the individual upon making the decisions to sell their data, as I've already proven how the choice to do so is coercive in nature. Two harms then come out of this. First of all, untargeted advertisement. The data sold contains valuable information for commercial entities ranging from Google searches to screen time standing looking at a particular post or article online. This data is then sold to companies who purchase it with an aim of selling the greatest amount of their product or service. This literally looks like advertisements for expensive skincare appearing on teenage girl's Facebook after she reads an article on the causes like of acne. We find this immensely problematic as data collection is such an instance for people to purchase products that you do not necessarily even need with their hard-earned money. The direct answer to be why, how people are better off financially. Additionally, it forces the illusion of an autonomous decision, given that comprehending the complex algorithms of targeted advertisement is impossible for the average individual. Notice how this harm is exaggerating a most socially vulnerable individuals as they are, for instance, entrapped within the predatory practices of debt relief companies who service our advertised upon searching for discounts for basing gods. The additional sub-point of this is targeted political advertisement, which we think presents crucial harms as well. With the collection of data also involves the collection of IP address and their correspondence to the user's zip codes or personal information. This is intrinsically harmful as it literally permits political manipulation and voter suppressions. The policy of selling data increases the amount of data accessible to the profit-driven nature of companies. Hence, you get more information on side opposition. This information then can literally be used to advertise incorrect election dates to Black communities in the United States, or promote populist rhetoric to the lower middle class of Hungary, proclaiming that too many people are the cause of economic insufficiency. But second harm coming out of this argument is on how these corporations are unaccountable with how they store your data. As a regular individual, you're incredibly unlikely to be a target of hacking or a data breach since you're unlikely to interest anyone. Given this, and the fact that corporations do not owe you to protect your data on opposition, and it's their property, it's not your property anymore, it becomes very, very likely that your data will be used for malicious intents. How does this look like? Corporations are extremely vulnerable to the externalities of data breaches and hacking. It is well known that data collection companies often have failing security systems, which makes it easy for anyone with higher IT knowledge to breach their services. Note how even if security is spied, corporations are still actively targeted since hackers are unaware to hack their system, which means they have access to millions of users' private data. This literally looks like over 500 million Facebook users' data being leaked this year due to safety loopholes or the same amount of LinkedIn users' IP address and passwords being sold on the deep web just a couple of months ago. That is to say, even if you consent to actually selling your data, you never know where your data ends up. That's what I'm trying to propose."

Sorry, give me a second to organize my papers. panel in order to survive companies and big tech companies specifically like facebook and google have perverse incentives to gather data under both sides of the house. A set of propositions could not live in a fairytale world where they would just simply get rid of the collection of data entirely. We question them. What exactly does this world look like? If it is the core of FB and Google's literal business model, would they rather prefer that they have paywalls that would result in the vulnerable people that they characterize not being able to access them at all? Or would they just not want these services to exist to begin with? They have to live in the status quo instead of making up a utopia, a status quo in which they're already stealing data from these citizens and we're going to prove in our speeches that it's actually going to get far worse under their side of the house, at which point they ban this kind of financial transaction.

So companies would offer them, like, for example, when you click onto the app to either allow your data to be given to these companies without compensation, to not allow it or to sell it to add compensation insofar as companies opt into this model. But we think they're likely to shift the norm to offer compensation to all individuals to opt in because if Facebook refuses to pay me, then they'll simply go to IG, for example, or Instagram or Twitter. And instead, so companies will all offer to pay money to these individuals. I'll also characterize further in my arguments why that's the case. Second of all, what kind of data are we talking about? We're not just talking about, you know, just generally taking your IP addresses, but it's also on their side, they would ban people taking surveys in exchange for money in which they state their preferences, for example, and their hair type. On their side of the house, it's things like installing certain applications or things like search histories. We also think that thirdly, we think that like what this is likely to look like under our side of the house is constant access. So I subscribe, maybe I get $10 a month, or if I do one survey, I would get a dollar. It is not going to be the highly coercive amounts of money that they characterize simply because this is not a viable business model for companies to do. Therefore, their argument about, oh, all poor people will simply opt into this and not be compensated duly for their money, that is exactly a reason as to why it won't be coercive because it isn't going to be mass amounts of money. Financial contracts are very transparent. The choice is granted to individuals as to specifically what data they want to offer up. So if I want to tell them that I was meant to this specific location, this doesn't mean blanketly that I have to tell them that I'm also a socialist and also risk being targeted by the state, for instance."

Before I go into three arguments on the side of proposition, firstly, a principled argument about why this is an illegitimate restriction of rights. Second of all, why this entails worse corporate behavior under their side of the house. And my second speaker will tell you about how we empower consumers to have more agency over their data. But before that, a little bit of reputation. Number one, what is the counterfactual? First of all, I want to note that just because the GDPR exists in the EU and India has some regulations on data, this does not mean that there's going to be no data collection on your side of the house. What the GDPR does is just makes you read long terms and conditions, which is exactly what you characterize as being the problem with the status quo. So unless proposition wants to tell us that they can come up with a political capital in every single country to simply just get rid of data collection altogether, we do not think that was a charitable context for them to defend in this instance. We also think that the idea that there's a downward trend on collection is highly privileged, and we must debate in the WSDC context, i.e. that this happens globally, not just in India and the EU. Furthermore, that this is the entire business model of literal corporations. And like if Google and Facebook and other corporations, for example, SMEs that want to do targeted advertising as you characterize want to survive, they're going to continue to do this. It just like, how are they going to do this on both sides of the house? I'm going to prove that it's highly unscrupulous on your side. Second of all, is there consent? I know, I just want to note that they just have a generic argumentation that people are unable to consent into this and they don't really give us reasons besides they get money out of it, therefore it is unconsensual. I'm going to prove in my argument that this does not actually meet the standard of banning this, but I also want to note that A, it is not a large amount of money. Secondly, we're going to give them more information. If you believe under your side that you can regulate to a significant extent, so can we. You can make these financial contracts highly transparent so people know exactly what they are getting into and be able to check boxes of specifically what they're offering up. Finally, they say that it's harmful, but they don't really prove this argument besides just saying, oh, there's targeted advertising. We're not through as to why this is bad because of the fact that actually if I consented into it, this means that I probably get better services by people because I get things that I actually want to see on a net. The only real harm standing from their side of the house is hackers. But if I'm on my phone at any time, I can still be hacked very significantly. And in fact, if there's a monetary value placed on data as a commodity, it's likely to be protected very well by companies and have lots of firewalls installed compared to your side of the house, when people just have them on their computers when they're underground and they're much less protected. Into my first argument, which actually clashes with their principle, why this is an illegitimate restriction of rights. First of all, we have to illustrate what the standard of banning is actually under the status quo. It has to do with the severity of harm because the state cannot just go and take away your autonomy from you unless it is significant harm to yourself or to other people. So I'm going to tackle this in two ways. Number one, there's no violation of the harm, i.e. harms to third parties because it is simply my own data. But second of all, we must note that all of the harms that they cause are actually contingent upon there being no consent. So targeted ads are not bad in and of themselves because they make money for businesses and they provide a better user experience for you. Where it becomes harmful, therefore, is where it constitutes an invasion of privacy. When you do not know when they're getting into your brain and subverting your privacy, but it makes people feel unsafe because it's theft of information that happens under the status quo where people do not have autonomy over that information. I cannot tell companies when to use it and when to not, which is what happens under our side of the house. So now that you consent into this, there is no longer such a harm. I tell them that, for example, I have curly hair, but I do not tell them that I am a socialist. Second of all, we argue that it's unjustified, therefore, to violate the autonomy of individuals. The state cannot simply just, like, regardless of perceived utility, it cannot just, like, infringe upon people because they're the best arbiters of choice in their own interests. We argue that the pursuit of individual happiness cannot be dictated by a paternalistic state. Hence why, for example, we allow people to smoke, even though that may be potentially harmful for them. Or we allow them to take risky jobs, like poor people doing drug trials, for instance, because we recognize that people should be able to choose for themselves. Finally, we argue that data is actually an extension of yourself. We argue that, for example, like how we have control over property, like land, you should have autonomy over how to use it. And insofar as you're offering it up to companies, you should be able to get compensation in return. I'll take a point now."

Second of all, whether policy entails worse corporate behavior, I want to note that propositions still have the very same actor incentives, the necessity of collection of big data in order for the business model to succeed, i.e. if I provide a free service to individuals, I have to make money in some way, whether this be through targeted advertising or by having algorithms that are based upon this data to begin with. Those companies will still exist under your side of the house. So things like having dubious terms and conditions that take weeks to read that uniquely exist when there isn't a better way to get this data. What this means is that if I can access people's preferences using surveys and asking them to volunteer that information to me, what I'm going to resort to is reading their texts, for instance, or being able to access data in more unscrupulous ways, which is when all their harms manifest. Why is there an alternative preferable on two fronts? First of all, there's an extra layer of consent for individuals. There are frameworks that cannot be avoided simply because it is a financial contract. So for example, I do not just need to take a box or just say that I consent to this cookie, but instead I have to choose up which sorts of information I want to give up. I have to go through a paywall in which I type in my credit card information. And at every point of this process, I'm going to know what kind of information I'm offering up. But secondly, and most importantly, we're actually able to shift corporate incentives. What do I mean by this? Corporations are less likely to try and steal your data to begin with if there's a legal way to get this. So there's lower corporate liability if I opt for the more ethical way of getting this data. Note, for instance, that under their set of the house, Facebook got a lot of boycotts and backlash and had to pay $5 million as a result of Cambridge Analytica. But now when we allow them a more less risky way, so just paying people money for a very limited amount, their compliance departments are going to recommend this business model instead. And they're going to shift towards better ways of like being able to get this data to actually compensate individuals and does not result in all of the harms and unscrupulous means that they wanted to talk about. So instead of just offering up and give it to me for free or don't use it at all, they're going to offer, you know, to get to invest significantly into this in order to ensure that they don't suffer corporate liability under their side of the house. Therefore, on two fronts, A, that this is an unjustified restriction of rights, and B, that we actually make corporate behavior better. We're incredibly proud to have"

First of all, we disagree with this premise because companies such as Google could be perceived as a general human right and state good as it is in, let's say, China. But secondly, we also tell you that at the point at which you are allowed, you are going to be selling your data is at this point when there's going to be more data collected because more individuals are incentivized to sell the data. But secondly, they're going to get much more sensitive information about you because there's an intrinsic difference between selling off your private property as data. And there is a different legal status than that which they can obtain from simply having cookies or whatnot, right? Because we're telling you that when this sort of contract exists, they are allowed to get more data off of you. Also, panel, notice how we're not just talking about companies such as Facebook, which they are portraying to be like this debate to be about, like tracking your messages or whatnot. However, we've characterized this within our first speech that these are like huge shadowy companies with the people know nothing about such as Cambridge Analytica which the people were like literally not aware of when they were controlling their political ideologies right they're telling you at the point at which people get free money for getting for selling off their data is the point at which people are going to sell off more data. And this has been engaging. Then they attacked our point about coercion and saying that this is mischaracterized because it's not a lot of money that they're going to get. However, at the point at which they did not attack our characterization, when people are not understanding what their personal data holds, and at the point at which they can already live in a world where they freely get their data off to companies, is the point at which they see no live in a world where they freely get their data off to companies is the point at which they see no harm in selling off their data right and also at the point at which the entire news media that you consume that being facebook twitter and the television have a direct incentive to get that data off of you because these are the same companies who buy and use the data, is the point at which you're not going to have a very democratic sort of system where you know what your data is going to be dealt with, right? And also, the conversion point was not attacked for the point, they did not engage with the advertising that these companies are going to have. All they said is that, oh, targeted ads are not that bad because it's going to make money for businesses. However, this is not like in case of our examples of companies being predatory to people who are in debt, like debt relief companies who are scamming these people into further debt. This is not protecting the consumer. This is not good to make the company's money. But when we asked the poi about like cigarette ads they said oh no we can have regulations too but notice how this directly agrees with the fact that targeted ads are intrinsically harmful and that they should be regulated and that they should not exist because they agree with us on this point right but then he also said that oh people choose the data that they are actually selling, like people can choose within their contracts and whatnot. However, this is completely untrue because they themselves said that the people do not read the terms and service agreements. And we're telling you at the point at which these companies are A, predatory, B, have a direct financial incentive to get that data off of you, they're likely to do everything in their power to manipulate you into selling your data, right? We're likely to do everything in their power to manipulate you into selling your data right we're not talking about good build intention companies which will want to show you all the choices and all the options of which data you can and cannot sell no they're going to get they will want to get everything off of you and they're going to make the contract as convoluted as possible for you to not read that and for you to just get a few dollars out of selling your money right and then they said well no we can have facebook and companies like that have like transparent contracts and at the point at which you have political capital to regulate these companies you will also have political capital to have transparent contracts however notice how it is far harder for these companies to avoid a blanket umbrella"

And for them to have transparent contracts is simply a ridiculous analysis, right? And we're telling you that these companies will always have a direct incentive not to have such regulations because they want more money. And we're telling you that these companies, at the point at which they have your data as their own private property, is the point at which they're also going to sell off that data to companies which are even less accountable. And this has been happening for decades at this point. Then they also said at the point at which they like attack hackers and saying that, oh, no, when you don't have these data collection agencies, you're going to have incentive to go into every single computer and to look for data like that. Because that's A, costs a lot of resources, but B, you're not so interesting to all the hackers. However, at the point at which you have a huge data collected database is the point at which there's far larger incentive for these hackers to actually obtain such information. And there is a much larger interest, right? So now before I move on to my third argument, I'll gladly take a POI. So you do agree that companies are going to be collecting data through free means under your side of the house, like through cookies and using that for targeted advertising. Well, yes, but like, notice this panel, how we literally answered this in my intro, right? Staying at the point at which there is a financial incentive for people to sell off their data, there's going to be more data sold off. Also, this data is going to be more sensitive at the point at which it's a private contract of your private data property. The companies cannot have such big amounts of data simply gathering it freely. And also, in that framing, we said that there is a downward trend of data collection that is happening and we are protecting and standing for this. Now, how the selling of data is used to crack down on the most vulnerable individuals."

Number one, note that everything by their own model is then coercive if you need specific knowledge. Because all I have to prove is that consumers have reasonable amounts of knowledge and information to make a decision for it to then be consented to. Because as someone with no medical knowledge, I can still consent to a surgical procedure even if I don't know everything that can happen, even if I don't know the various techniques. Because as long as I consent to the largest harm that can accrue, which is, for example, death, I can then consent to everything in between. Which is why in our side, it's extremely simple for contracts to highlight and enforce and mandate it by the government. If you're selling these kinds of properties, they are going to tell individuals about potential targeted advertising, which is their largest harm. If an individual consents to that, they consent to all of these things happening. You don't need specific knowledge for this to be a debate because by that virtue, I can never sign a contract because I don't have jurisprudence. I don't know how to read contracts properly. Secondly, the idea that money clouds judgment. By that logic, any choice a poor person makes is illegitimate. Everything is highly bigoted from their side because it's a rational trade-off that they need to consider. Because if I told you, panel, that I would give you a thousand dollars, but I would kill you the very next day, a rational individual is able to weigh the incentive and pick accordingly not to take the monetary incentive. So if I, as an individual who needs money, can make a decision that data does not impact my life, that I understand that a targeted ad not impact my life, that I understand that a targeted ad could potentially hurt me, but I consent to it anyways, that isn't in and of itself an illegitimate decision if people opt into it, if there is a monetary incentive.

But lastly, people are more aware about their data because if you ask someone to give you your phone panel, you wouldn't because you understand that your phone is valuable to you. Similarly, when you monetize data, individuals recognize that there's inherent value and it's a property that could have tangible impacts on your life. You create these social discussions, the point to which you're able to sell it, and it has some sort of intrinsic value to it, which means individuals in the future within a scale are going to be more informed on the data that they're selling. Notice how you're not going to sell more data to individuals because you can limit the parameters to what data you want to sell. You can sell your location but not want to sell my name. We don't think this is a gateway to more data being taken away from you. We think more individuals are going to be informed the point to which data is monetized. We think individuals have agency and you create correct social behavior. Proud to oppose."

However, this substantive extension that we get from side opposition's second speaker relies on the premise that companies are innately beneficial and benevolent and only aim to provide the best experience.

Furthermore, notice how they literally debate this entire debate as if it were like Facebook or Google that is purchasing your data in the first place. We have told you right from Patrice's speech as how this won't apply to like social media or like search engines, right?

Firstly, without any further ado, let me move on to the principal argumentation, right? What is the principal material that you panel received from side opposition? Side opposition's first speaker within their first argument essentially tells you how this is an invalid restriction on personal liberty, right? They tell us how companies have no innate violation perpetrated by their practices, right? Firstly, this is an empty statement. What kind of violation are we talking about in the first place? If this is a violation of law, we literally have failing data protection policies which do violate the law. But even if this isn't like a violation of law that they're talking about, and this is more like a moral standpoint, we tell you that even then, we have an innate violation from the moral standpoint because you literally have debt relief companies profiting off of these struggles of vulnerable individuals, right, under their side of the house. This was a crucial characterization that was never tackled by opposition, right? But even if there is no, like, innate violation, we still make it illegal for them to do so, right?

Side opposition's second speaker essentially tells you that everything is coercive, but Noyce already points out in his POI how, for instance, their analogy to doctors. Doctors are literally obliged by law and mandated to explain what the worst consequences of a surgery can be. They have direct incentive to explain everything to you so you're less nervous, right? The comparative that we gave you is like restrictions on bodily autonomy, such as illicit substances, right? Heroin dealers, much like these companies, right, have no incentive to actually inform you of the consequences of your data being sold off. So essentially, this comparative on the prerequisite of knowledge falls under our sort of house. Essentially, they further tell you that, hey, there's this assumption that like, given that these individuals are paid, thus they have, like, this innate good and are more liberated, but Patrice already tackles this in her response to her POI as to how, like, individuals are forced into more, like, detriment and do not actually get the liberation under their state of the house, right? Furthermore, we essentially tell you as to how, like, these individuals are tricked into thinking that this is a one-sidedly beneficial deal this was further asserted by side opposition's first and second speakers but however they fail to tackle the material from our side of the house literally looking like debt relief preying on those most vulnerable right we tell you that doubt about yourself is extremely vulnerable right the precedent of this is literally bodily autonomy restrictions such as that of illicit substances right when individuals can not evaluate the harm right and when the harm is great to big extent, that is the point at which they ban this. And side opposition actually concedes with this when they tell you that cigarette advertisements ought to be regulated, right? That is the point they concede with us, that some harm to a certain extent exists. However, they never tackle the extent of harm presented to you by Patrizia and by Nolayos.

Furthermore, they tell you that somehow corporations are less likely to steal data. But the thing to note here is that the impacts remain symmetrical, right?

However, under our side of the house, we have already told you as to how it is far harder for them to actually avoid this blanket ban in the first place. That is something that regulations cannot achieve because it's far more obvious when it's done under a blanket ban. Essentially, what we told you on side proposition in terms of practical implications was literally an incredibly sophisticated analysis from Patrícia's speech regarding predatory advertisement tactics as to how it literally impreches individuals into a loop of like financial insecurity because they think and presume that they need these products that they didn't actually search up in the first place.

It means that if governments want to enact this ban, as well as other limits, it won't take place to begin with because of backlash. They say companies want to deregulate on both sides. But the nuance we brought to you was that more will opt in because it was cheaper for them to comply with the legal framework on our side of the house. On their side, the only option remaining is the malicious actions like lobbying, and they activate this intent to deregulate on their side the fact that big tech is already in the pockets of politicians um if they wanted to propose this extent of legislation they needed to defend its feasibility or accept that it was simply worse on their side but let's say their best case they are even able to pass this regulation but this is exactly the context where all our harms manifest and note the nuance of our second argument that we brought to you where we said that companies with superior technology will just find other ways to skirt the law and obtain this data. This is when the extra wall of having a ban on payment is especially harmful because in their minds of corporations there is no avenue to legally obtain data and in their minds it's justified. This will become an entire black market on their side of the house. But second then on legal frameworks right, note that we agree that status quo is moving towards consumer data protection because of rising awareness, for example, Google selling their data. But why do they explicitly reverse this progress on their side of the house? One, they have now severely limited the amount of data that these companies can collect. This means even if they are forced to continue working within the law, you have more websites where the terms and conditions are in minuscule text, overwhelming, or cannot be understood by the average consumers. So yes, terms and conditions exist on both sides, but our model of a transparent financial transaction means that people are not only incentivized to read them, more people opting in makes the government tell these companies that, no, you have to make these terms and conditions clear on their side of the house they need to obtain data by whichever means possible and will intentionally make this more and more difficult to understand but it encourages more companies to operate outside of the framework this is because of the way i just gave you about desperation in our world they realize that choosing a legal avenue is a less risky model on their side they are incentivized to take this risk because they cannot obtain this kind of nuanced data elsewhere. But even if there are some companies on both sides always operating outside of legal scale frameworks, we still take this point on scale when we told you about the normalizing effect and how a majority of companies wanting to opt into this exchange will be good, as well as having all the spillover benefits of these regulatory frameworks being established crucially because of the monetization of this exchange. This is why we break the deadlock panel, because we exclusively prevent companies from skirting these laws. On their side, laws are as loose as possible because of the relationship is different, because they are incentivized to do things like lobbying.

Note they actually never gave us an impact throughout the debate about this lack of information that takes place because both sides agree that this data is not the best kind. But the audacity to run that we are the ones which have a coercive alternative when they are the ones that enable this. Because if we have proven that data collection happens on both sides, this debate becomes about which relationship is more principally legitimate. On their side, most of the data is either obtained by a really complex consent agreement or a lack of information. The fact that like on default, Facebook is tracking you. The comparative to this alone is that we enable you as an individual to make money off of this structure where the data is not necessarily always good. They frame this as being problematic. Panel, I don't see anything that that's wrong in making money over selling the data that fundamentally belongs to me as a person. And I am giving away my autonomy. They assert that these people are unable to determine what's good for them. But Evan told you why this is unlikely to be a case because one, in a world where more of these transactions exist and more people take part, governments are forced to set standards about clarity of data and like the levels of payment that you receive. But two, people are rational and wider awareness about this trend means they know about things like perverse incentives. But even if people know nothing, they are satisfied with the money. And so in their mind, this is a legitimate transaction. The assumption is that if you give them full information, they wouldn't opt in. But because of the returns, we say even if they had full information, they would still be opting into this to begin with. But what's the comparative? On their side, they actually enable overriding of autonomy if more countries are urged to do it illegally and people have no idea what they're getting into, what it is used for. Panel, then ask yourself which side becomes more coercive. The impact of this is that I've taken down their only contention to consent because people actually one, do have information and their best case if they don't have information, the worst case wing is that on their side, they're actively denied all information when companies lobby to do things like deregulate or scurb the law. But before I move on to the uses of these information, sure. Is political manipulation of people and not giving data to black individuals where elections are going to be held good? I'm going to answer this in my next class, right right as to what this data is being used for in the future because the only harm they really brought to us today was that targeted ads are bad and not necessarily data in themselves one note they never actually told us how targeted or political ads are different from the subconscious coding that takes place every single second that i am an individual in society we have news organizations feeding you bias and false information you have every single advertisement appealing to your unconscious desires all government statements giving imperfect information institutions are coerced this was too Organizations feeding you biased and false information. You have every single advertisement appealing to your unconscious desires. All government statements giving imperfect information. Institutions are coerced that this was too high a burden for them to say that they exclusively defeat simply by removing payment. They cannot avoid this. They say that we have the same harms, right? But just with consent added onto this. One, we told you that actually companies do do some beneficial things too. They're actually improving their products for their consumer base to access nicer products. And lots of people actually like having recommendations of like the products that they want on their pages. But what breaks this deadlock is that they enable all these harms to take place without consent. When companies skirt the law and you actually don't know where your data is going, right? And then they say that the last nuance is that governments actually have this. But you don't need companies to be involved in order for governments to steal your information. The software used by Indian government to hack into activists' accounts was Israeli state software. It wasn't companies. We also don't think that they saw this in any means or form. Ladies and gentlemen, when you have a case that is based on a single premise of not being able to have regulation and your entire case is based on not achieving feasibility,"

I'm going to talk about two things then under this. Number one, they tell you that a monetary incentive is coercive. We're not sure as to why. I think it's officially rebuttless in second when we tell you it's actually a rational trade-off because they don't give you any reasons as to why this is bad. If people can go to work, if people can work in ostensibly dangerous conditions, that is something that's fine. But the second thing they say that people do not understand the harmful implications of data. Again, we're not really sure as to why this is the case, besides them saying they will just lie to you. This is empirically untrue, because we've told you that we can regulate. If their model is literally things like the GDPR and the EU and India having more regulations, that is something that we can quote under our side of the house as well. Moreover, we proved to you that actually it would be more preferential for them to not lie to you under our side of the house, given that they can then avoid legal liability if there are better ways to be able to make money. Furthermore, it was simply untrue that you could not be, that this was the standard for coercion because people just needed to know what was the worst possible outcome of this policy. So if I'm a socialist and I know that this could potentially fall into the wrong hands of the government, this is not information I'm likely to offer up. Similarly, I can sell a house and I know that someone may be able to trash it, but I don't need to know specifically how they're going to use that down the line. We told you that it's simply about them being able to know that they're going to use for targeted advertising, and that was consent in and of itself. If I tell my eye color to these individuals and to these companies, we're not sure what the large harm is going to be and why people could not meaningfully consent into that. I think that"

Note that their argument in principle was that getting data is bad because of targeted ads, but this is a principle inconsistency. If they want to argue that this still exists and tech giants still exist, what is this marginal skill in which they're defending that data collection gets better under their set of the house? First of all, they simply asserted that there was a downward trend, even though this is empirically untrue. Data collection is a growing industry that is getting bigger and bigger day by day. They have given no analysis to suggest why this is true. Moreover, we think that the only thing standing is that ads are bad, because given that we've proven to you that because our argument was nuanced, that is harmful insofar as you don't consent, but we clearly told you that now you know what is being taken away. You have information and harms uniquely materialize on proposition when people do not consent and you have unscrupulous means of collecting it therefore the only thing left standing was that ads are bad what political advertising okay ban it and it was nonsensical for the second argument third argument to take place in oppressive states because they would oppress you with this information to begin with we rebutted this in second speaker no response do not let them get away with telling you that we had no response then if ads were all so predatory given no analysis as to why this is true then why can't i walk on the street and walk past a billboard? There were benefits that they never wanted to do. It's like Netflix having more inclusive programming, given that they were able to access information, like us having services like Facebook and Instagram that allow us to connect with the people we love uniquely because of these. And if they wanted to stand by their principle of argumentation, they would get rid of all these services altogether. Finally, what does"

And instead of accessing your preferences through surveys, for instance, or asking you to give it up in exchange for money, they would look at your tax. If they really cared about what people, about people, then they would go with our side because it became better in two main ways. One, because individuals consented more explicitly because you could not just click on a cookie. Financial contracts meant that this is better. But second of all, you organically shifted incentives because it's far better to pay people cheap amounts rather than risking legal liability as they would have you believe under their side of the house. If they wanted to argue Cambridge Analytica, that is the status quo, that is the proposition side."

Two points I'll answer. How much data is Gatlin? Money, they said, money does not cloud your mind, and this is a rational choice that consumer can make. Notice how this does not make sense with their own analysis, because they themselves agreed with us within their first speech that people are already giving their data away for free without actually understanding what they're doing.

And that getting this free money somehow is not an extra incentive for these individuals to sell more data than when they already give this data away for free, right? However, they also never engage with the point how you're selling more sensitive data about yourself. Because at the point at which this is a contract of you selling off your private data is much more data can be gathered than simply going on the website and accepting two cookies. They also never challenged our definition of these corporations being shadowy figures who people know nothing about and how they do not have any sort of accountability. They even talk about these big corporations themselves.

These are economic information that has a large impact on society when they're going to be aware of that. To illustrate, these things are probably going to market confidence downfall. These are economic information that has a large impact on society when they're going to be aware of that. To illustrate, these things are probably going to look like information and government bailing out banks and companies, or the fact of bankruptcy of large corporations, or the amount of debt that governments and large companies are incurring. But this could also include things like micro information of the market, such as consumption rates, or the average personal revenue of workers or the employment rates going down. I think the withdrawal of information does, though, differ in accordance to the severity and the circumstance of the crisis. And I think the kind of illustration we're doing is pretty parallel to what the Asian nation did in consideration of the Asian financial crisis. The likely information that should be dispersed instead on our side of the house is the government saying that the domestic economy has high consumer trust. They should continue relying on the stock market, that you should continue your deposits to things like trust funds and a bank. We are going to release information that is likely to increase the confidence of the economy, such as economic growth. No, thank you.

But B, I think the impacts of economic crises can result beyond the borders of politicians. So I think there's self-incentive for any kind of corrupt politicians to first of all stabilize the market as soon as possible before doing anything. So that is a trivial concern. Before I dig in with substantives, I'll take your POI."

In your side of the house, either that information is available, i.e. our side, or it doesn't have those regulations at all. I quite literally do not understand your point because our side of the house is literally just withdrawing information. I think we could fiat say that the government will do that on our side. So I literally just gave you two reasons why that's likely to be transparent within the government. So I'm not sure of the extent of your transparency of this point. Two arguments then. First of all, principally, why this is justified, and second, how we are able to better counter the economic crises. Firstly, on principle, the first thing I want to point out here is that the withdrawal of information in the involvement of national security is already an extension of what we do in the status quo. Things like high-risk operational forces of military tactics or confidential nature or national disasters or waves of attacks by things like terrorism is literally the instances where we quite withdraw information because the operations we conduct is important to prevent the occurrence of things like mass panic. I think this is pretty analogous in terms of economic crises because in terms of economic crises, people are similarly going to be in a state of paranoia when they're going to be doing things like flooding the supermarkets. They're debumping bank reserves by taking deposits out of the bank. So in the instance of a national act of panic, I think this is an extension of the rights that we already grant the governments. But the second thing in principle is that the right to know for citizens is deprioritized during economic crises because the utility and priority of what we have to do drastically shifts. The sheer absurdity and the shock phenomena that economic crises create is the reason why I think every policy the government takes necessarily impacts people on the ground in a tangible manner. So the conclusion of our principle is that governments need the unique ability to accurately determine what political agenda is the most effective. So for instance, it looks like whether you can get employed in the COVID crisis, the Great Recession, and the kind of things like policy cuts for things like minimum wage or bank reserves, or I think just in general, income tax is instrumental for deciding that. So if you do not limit the freedom of citizens, you cannot accurately monitor and predict national behavior. This is a simple reason, and a very good example is the fact that we literally just conducted things like lockdowns, even because at the expense of economic crises, or any kind of national crises, it's important for the government to predict and monitor this kind of behavior. This is the urgency of economic crises in which we prioritize over individuality. Second argument then, no, thank you. Why this is effective at rejuvenating the economy."

              "text": "The first thing I want to point out here is what happens in the absence of withholding information. We identify two sub-crises. Firstly, is the market panic is going to take place and you're going to make it drastically difficult to re-navigate fiscal rejuvenation. Because when investors and private banks are profit-oriented, they're likely to move in the best way in their self-insured nature, so they won't suffer a loss. So the moment in which Wall Street or financial institutions are notified of the threat of market collapse, these institutional investors are going to redraw out of investments. They're going to likely to drop out of trust bonds. Furthermore, we think when the money lent to the corporation is withdrawn or banks are not providing financial aid, I think in general, the impact is the corporations are likely to become or go bankrupt because corporations are already in an unsustainable condition because they needed money. The second sub-crisis that we identify is that the unpredictability of the market makes it extremely difficult for, I think, financial aid institutions like the central bank to intervene. That is to say that when people are in a state of absolute fear and they do not know what to do, you create over excessive information in the public space. The over excessive information comes from the distrust to the market and your fear that your life is at stake. So you're more likely to believe some kind of blog that's out on the Twitter. At the point in which it's hard for the government to predict the action of each individual bank, it becomes much harder to predict the economy. This changes on our side because governments give a positive signaling effect and therefore people are unlikely to have incompetence towards the market. The problem of unpredictability is henceforth that the central bank cannot plan what kind of things like percent of interest rate should we diminish. These calculations are important for disturbing things like stimulus packages or the things of things like bailout. The intervention of the central bank is important because the government is the only entity that has the capacity and the incentive to end the economic crises. They are the only ones that could think about the public economy, and they're the ones who have the unique capacity to invest huge amounts of money that only they are capable of. Why do we get better outcomes on our side of the house then? Because we stop the drastic fall in market confidence by urging people that market confidence exists, that we should continue investing in companies, that we should not lose deposits. This is important because in terms of the economic crises, there's literally no trust. I think the big important here is that everyone uniquely trusts the government, which is a"

That's the kind of thing that opposition needs to defend. Lastly, is a preemption to opposition talking about the likelihood of the information going to be found out? A, we think it's unlikely to be found out anyways, because financial terms are ridiculously hard to steal. So the average citizen is not so informed about things like subprime mortgage crises. But B, I think it's the government uniquely holding power. And just in the same way, we don't know what relies beyond the realms of Area 51. I think the government does a pretty good job of controlling so. When economic crises prolongs, the people who strive and have to drink mud water or those who lose jobs are those who continue to suffer. Stopping economic crises is the most important consideration for all of these reasons. Very happy to propose."

First on framework, our side is largely the status quo, where the government will release important information as it comes.

The first argument was this very shallow principle on why this is justified because of national security. The first thing to note here is that on the grounds of national security, you can maybe hide like direct military missions that you're conducting abroad. But we think this is quite different because there's our actions justifying like affecting whether or not people are going to save or spend. They're directly affecting their own economic standards and their own actions. So we think it's unjustified on those grounds, more in my first argument. Second thing here is that it's very largely hung under practical. It's not really principled. The second argument then was in economic security. The thesis of this argument is that the central bank needs to be able to predict the individual actions of banks, and you need to be able to reduce market panics. There are three things to note here and more of this in my second argument. The first thing to note here is I'm just really confused on terms of the substantiation of central banks being able to predict individual banks. I don't really see an impact on here, but I would argue that you lower interest rates based on the capacity for businesses to actually take out loans, the employment figures that they have. So it's likely it's actually worse actions when you aren't dealing with the reality of it. You're dealing with like how much you're going to have confidence in the markets, whereas the actual like revenue figures and the capacity to do these loans is off. The second thing to note here is that this rests on the assumption that the information is not going to get out. They tell you that the average citizen doesn't understand financial figures, so won't get out. The first thing to note here is that there's tons of ways that information trickles down to the public in terms of like financial figures and the investigative media simplifying the information. They then tell you like you can hide information. The government is great at hiding Area 51. I would note here that A, it is not that great at hiding information in terms of like these are things that are not just in Area 51, an area that they control, but it's also things such as banks failures, such as supply chain failures that people are able to pinpoint. You're able to have media reports, like we had Watergate, we had Pentagon Papers, et cetera. The second thing is that you also set a precedent when people realize after one particular crisis that the government was hiding information. It will probably get out. There's a lot of declassified information on the military. Finally, we are just going to prove to you why when you don't get economic pressure, that leads to a lot worse government intervention."

              "text": "First argument then on why this is a morally unjustified action. We think that people have the right to know about this sort of information. Individuals have a right to know information that influences their most endemic action. That is like a doctor in a health crisis should you give you all the information and the extent of the conditions and prescriptions, et cetera. We think it's likely to make you a better actor, but even if it makes you a worse rational actor, you still think you have a right to action because we regard people as people who are generally dignity, who have dignity, who have autonomy, and should have information that relates to their own life. This applies to economic decisions because these are decisions that will be predicated on the government information that's released to you. We think individuals have autonomy, so they should be able to gauge your own risk-reward ratio in terms of the decisions to make in order to weather a certain crisis. That is first in terms of saving versus spending. You're making decisions in terms of buying a house or taking a vacation. We really don't think you should be taking a vacation during the middle of an economic crisis, particularly when you don't know if it's going to get worse or better. Like they tell you like, oh, we'll just get more spending, everything, it's okay. I argue that that's not always all the case, right? There's in terms of like direct economic shocks and crises that will further. The fact the matter is if there's a supply shock logistic there's going to be a lot of unemployment in one industry and it'll likely spread to other industries in terms of that you can't simply solve for the revenue and the production output problems second thing to note here is on life choices i.e if you want to quit your job or or you want to have a baby there's are particular decisions you should make under the scope of of like an economic crisis. I would also note here in terms of the pandemic, would side propositions hide the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to reduce increased market confidence and reduce fears about how it will hurt the economy? We think these are massive choices. We also think just in terms like we don't know whether an economic crisis will be fixed by the government, so we should have them have the ability to either save or spend, like a rational decision may be to save when their job is lost. Also in terms of the political accountability, this is the second layer of this first argument. We think that this information is important for holding leaders accountable regarding mismanagement. That is if mismanagement helped cause a crisis or it's a very bad response to the crisis. You need to know this information to know how bad your government actually did during the crisis so you can vote them out of office. And oftentimes elections happen during crisis, i.e. America voted out Trump and elected Biden during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. We think hiding the information means that you reduce the political autonomy of these actors, but also in the long term, you reduce the democratic accountability mechanism where you take"

              "text": "out bad leaders and get better responses. Second argument then on crises. I want to be clear on how this beats back Proposition's case, because it hinges on being able to withhold the information successfully. If we're able to prove there's even one marginal chance of it being wrong, all of it comes top-wing down, right? We think it's going to be apparent to the government, to the people, that the government is not being truthful for three reasons. First, there could be independent media watchdogs who report on the fact that there's like a bank failure, like there are insiders in the bank, or there's supply chain failure in terms of governments hiding it. The second thing to note here is that you set a large precedent. That is like events don't become, like hiding information doesn't become classified forever. It's likely like after the crisis, even if it didn't come out during the crisis, that you're going to know the government hid information. The third thing is that your investments don't get returns. The foundation of markets is investors responding rationally to the allocation of markets. I invest in the company because I believe we'll have higher revenue flowing in than other people's predict. When that doesn't happen, that means there's a lot more volatility in the stock market, and that actually loses market confidence in the long term. What does this mean? Once there's a lot of uncertainty, where you don't know whether or not the government is giving the truthful information, you will assume that every hiccup could predicate economic failure. You breed mistrust of the government as the ultimate authority on official sources. Before I move on, I'll take a point if there is one. Your argument about principle rests on the assumption that people make the best possible decision for themselves when they have information. We've proven to you this is a collective action problem. Please respond to this. It does not rest on whether people are perfectly rational actors. We don't have the government control every single person's life at every stage because we believe people generally have autonomy and should make choices by themselves. We say more misinformation will increase rumors, and this does two things. First, it increases the risk of crisis. That is particularly in the internet age where there's a lot of rumors, like we saw the pandemic documentary and people pretending to be experts. Rumors, misinformation, or hiccups could increase the uncertainty that you don't know if the government is hiding the worst information from you. That leads to more bank runs, like Proposition paints you. This looks like less spending in the long term, which is really bad. Second, you increase the severity of the crisis. Again, because when you're in the middle of a crisis or recession, you don't know if this is the worst, because the government has hidden information in the past, so you're assuming they're doing so again, meaning you damage market confidence in the long term and reduce spending, creating a culture of fear and uncertainty uncertainty where people don't know the information and they assume that the information they're getting is either hidden or falsified in order to be good. Intermentalizing people is not only morally wrong, but results in economic damages. We oppose."

It is oftentimes the irrational behavior of people that people do not understand. Just because people think that the market is going to collapse because the government is fear-mongering people essentially on their side of the house with the bad statistics, that what they're doing essentially is making people worse off on their side of the house. We do solve collective action problem by government intervention all the time. Taxation is a good example of this. We think that the state of anarchy is just really, really worse for everyone else. So this is a collective action problem. Hence, we have the government in the first instance. Point in the chart, please. But the second response to this is that this is a marginal principle violation. The reason for this is that the first and foremost, ordinary person in times of economic crisis do not make choices based on the government statistic. The vast majority of people that we're talking about in this debate are presumably only investors. That food's concern is how market is doing, the statistic about how economic growth is going right. Now, this is a principal violation that is marginal and only impacts a very few number of individuals. But finally, we demonstrated already that this is an extension of what we already have in the status quo. We already restrict the right of information that people have through things like confidential information about military operation. They have to demonstrate why this particular increase in the principle violation"

              "text": "was the transparency within the government, democratic rights, all of this stuff. There are three responses to this. Firstly, note that in times in times of economic crisis, oftentimes bipartisan cooperation exists, i.e. what happened after the 2008 financial crisis is that Democrats and Republicans cooperated together. I assume that this policy is going to be an extension of that. Do they do know both of the political parties on both sides of spectrum, knows that the government is essentially changing the information and statistic. That is abatable for every single person in the politics. Therefore, the transparency within the government still exists. So people cannot abuse the system already. Secondly, they have to cooperate with bureaucrats and economies because this is a complex process. So many people of different interests have to see this process. So if this is for politicians' personal interest, this probably cannot take place. But finally, as they demonstrate, this is going to be found out later on. And I want to note the crucial tension in the case. They say, first and foremost, democratic rights are going to be infringed. But at the same time, this policy is going to be effective, ineffective, because it's going to be found out later on. I want to note about example of Canada, for example. Canada literally lied about whether they have bailed out a private bank in times of economic crisis. Later on was found out the mistrust that they talk about towards the government did not happen empirically speaking. Let's talk about structural reasons why the mistrust is unlikely to happen, but why the impact of mistrust is going to be presumably marginal. The first thing I want to talk about is that this policy is not going to be found out during the times of crisis. And this is important because the reason why they say this policy is ineffective is only because this policy is going to be found out in times of economic crisis. Because after the times of economic crisis, even if this is going to be found out, there's no impact on how the government is going, the capacity of government to be able to implement any of the policies about economic stimulus package, for instance. So why is it going to be the case that it's not going to be found out during the times of economic crisis? Because this is the information that only government uniquely have, private entities do not. So the investigative journalism that we talk about presumably cannot debunk this, because this information looks like, for instance, the information that they acquired from income expenditure reports from corporate taxes. This looks like the information about the government run financial organization. This looks at the statistic that the government collects every single year. All of those informations are not available to private entities uniquely that they cannot debunk in times of during in times of the economic crisis. Therefore, the practical argument does not stand. But even if it is going to be found out, the concern about the mistrust is relatively going to be marginal on their side of the house for lots of structural reasons. Firstly, note that this policy is primarily going to take place specifically into a specific industry. So for instance, in times of subprime mortgage crisis, this is probably going to be the information about housing markets, for instance, only concerns a very few number of investors to begin with. But secondly, people are probably not going to care. The reason for this is that it oftentimes uses the technical terms that are very complex to people on the ground. Media probably are not able to take advantage of this issue. But finally, more importantly, again, this is a bipartisan measure, presumably, that Democrats and Republicans incorporate. And here's the structural reason why. Because in times of economic crisis, you have to cooperate together as a political party to be able to advance and to be able to further like sort of appeal to your core constituency. So if Democrats in position of power, which is in 2008, Republicans have to cooperate with Democrats for the simple reason that in times of in the decision about economic stimulus package or health care for instance they have to cooperate with democrats to be able to spread and like spread and make these sort of packages accessible to even the majority red states for instance that is why it is in the interest of opposite political party to cooperate with this individual the implication of that is that there is no incentive for the political opposition for instance to take advantage of this particular issue but finally even if people are going you know if even if people are going to, you know, even if people are going to, but finally, I think that the people are still going to trust the government."

The reason for this is that things like the stimulus package or the aids that government give to people on the ground or directly to investors are something that are tangibly impacting their own lives. They know in many various different ways the government is doing something for them, in which case even the lying that government is going to do can be justified on the ground of, you know, saying that, you know, this is for the sake of, you know, economic, preventing economic crisis, in which case this is most going to function on our side. Before I move on, I'll take a point. So even people find out after the crisis, does this not set the precedent when people become scared during the next crises and recessions that the government is hiding information, so they want to save your money and not spend et cetera? Okay. The time lag between each economic crisis is about a decade, in which case people are not going to remember concretely about the issue, presumably the impact is marginal. On efficacy, and I want to be very stressful, they never explained why the status quo is going to be effective. We demonstrated the status quo is going to be terrible. Because I want you to think about when people retract investment, when investors are going to retract the investment, because the vast majority of investors are institutional investors, and they're not modeling. There are a lot of individuals going on within a company. So you as an investor have to convince your bosses, for instance, to retract millions of dollars of investment. In order for you to do that, if the government announces an information that is critical and that says the economy is going to be really, really terrible, rather than a rumor that says that the information is terrible, then that is the tipping point at which people are going to retract their investment since all the harm arises. Finally, on this point about other policies being more effective, and this is a point that was completely unresponded to. We told you two things. One, we told you that the things like encouraging private banks to be able to give financial package to each small and medium enterprises on the ground is only possible on our side when people are not going to withdraw deposits from banks on the ground. We get more funding towards the government as the private sector have more capacity to be able to help people on the ground. Second, we told you decreasing unpredictability means more capacity have more capacity to be able to help people on the ground secondly towards you decreasing unpredictability means more capacity for central banks to be able to predict and plan the best possible economic decision for the entire society we protect people we save people from unemployment we stop the economic crisis very proud to stand on proposition thank you very much"

Their argument here was basically the government needs to be able to predict individual behavior, figure out how to solve the crisis and stop panic. Like I just said, big problem in characterization, because if people are finding out on their side of the house, they are also finding out on our side of the house. It's just that they're more vigilant on ours, on their side of the house. First of all, we gave you a lot of reasons why individuals are likely to find out. First of all, because there are watchdog agencies that, despite what they may tell you, do have ways of calculating things like unemployment statistics, like all these sorts of things. But the second response I would give you is that governments cannot handle crises perfectly, right? Like, there's going to be instances in which people might find out because they aren't solving things like unemployment, like because inflation is extremely high, which means inevitably people are going to be wondering why the government is misleading them, which leads to more panic. Also, we think there are cases like natural disasters in which people on their side of the house are going to be in a constant state of vigilance, wondering if any hint of a pandemic, if any hint of an earthquake, if any hint of a disruption in the supply chain is going to cause some kind of a panic. But look, I want to be very clear that even if this argument was true that they give to you about the government response, it's only true for the first crisis. Because once there are more crises after that point, people no longer trust the government when they say everything is fine. I would argue they probably mistrust them more when they say things are fine because they say the last time you said that things didn't work out very well for us. And I also want to say our third substantive argument is going to be dealing with this because it proves to you why even in the first crisis, you're likely to get a better government response because a lot of good government responses that are needed during crises are really unpopular things politically, like having to give stimulus checks, having to like have a lot of like unemployment programs. These are things you only get whenever people realize what's going on in the first case. I think we win the debate in the case when people recognize what's going on and we also win the debates when they don't. What was our comparable material? And I think they dealt with it pretty poorly in their last speech. We told you that over a series of times people are going to realize what's going on. What was their response? They said it is unlikely because one time the Canadian government bailed out a bank and the people didn't know about it. First of all, the people did know the bank failed. They just didn't know the government bailed it out. And the reason for that was because"

There was the natural disaster, which means the government's failure to handle this properly will eventually catch wind. And either investors or the people themselves, because of their lived experience being different happening, it means they're going to realize it. Our argument is that there's a lot of reasons why people could find out, either because people are calculating it or because it affects their lived experience. This means that on their side of the house, when there is any kind of natural disaster, when there's any kind of change in investment patterns, when there's any even like hint that the government is unsure, people assume that there is going to be a crisis. And this is because the media like has an incentive to pick up these things. So even if people initially didn't understand what was going on, they're likely to pick it up by the media and hear this sort of thing. And I also think that over a series of times, even if like people, even if the government handles it well and people don't realize they can't handle it well in every single scenario, which means we ought to prioritize people's knowledge so that they can prevent it from happening in the future. Then I think this means we get access to all of our impacts about how eventually people assume they should just be spending less all the time, or they should do things like do a run on the bank when a natural disaster happens, which is bad. One, because I think you get worse crises from that perspective of the idea of public panic, but also because it means that over a series of times people are spending less in every single scenario, which is the way you get out of a crisis. They can't access that on their side of the house. Second clash point has to do with the principle, and I think we are pretty conclusively ahead. What did they give you? They said, well, sometimes there are times like national security crisis, which means that like, then we should be able to like withhold information from people. First of all, I want to note their principle is extremely hung that withholding information from people actually generates a better response. I think the jury is still out on that one because even if there was one on the bank, I think there's still a lot of parts of like government contribution to the failure or government failure to respond to it adequately, which means we ought prioritize people's secure ability to make their own decision-making calculus. What I mean is that governments could basically mess up their response to the crisis. And this only certainty that we would have about how people behave is whether or not they have access to the information of them being able to solve it. I also think national security is simply a different scenario because it doesn't affect individuals every single day lives. We say this is very analogous on our side of the house to things like medical decisions, where the doctor might freak you out by saying that you have a terminal illness or need a very risky surgery, but they are still obligated to tell you. And the reason is that if it is so endemic to your quality of life, and it might change the way that you spend money, it might change the way that you vote. We ought guarantee people have like a better sense of what's best for them than any of the other things. I also think we can say that like on our side of the house, there's going to be crises symmetrically because of the natural boom bust cycle of the economy, which means that we ought prioritize people's ability to respond to it with their own information. This is not predicated on outcome. It is simply saying if the external circumstances are variable, prioritize people's ability to not go on vacation when the economy is about to crash."

And notably, this sort of scenario engages in this like, like like, first of all, on their highest ground where people don't find out. And secondly, in the case where it's like the first crisis where people don't know this is a strategy. Our argument is that eventually things will get bad because the crisis is occurring. So there could be things like the government's inability, I think it's protected time, inability to respond, all those sorts of things. Governments will never do things but bail out banks. It is not politically palatable because governments generally don't like handouts and they view it as far too risky of an investment as they can't guarantee individuals will spend it in the way they want. Secondly, they are more likely to do things like save big banks because politicians are relatively short-termist, right? So at the end of the crisis, they might just want to get a job on Wall Street or they might want to get a job in the financial sector. And that's bad if they were the individual that gave a bunch of stimulus checks. We think that people who want stimulus checks are unlikely going to be validated by governments on their side, but are on our side, because on their side, they can easily be framed as a fringe case. Or they can say it's a problem with the company that they fired you, or it's just a local community economic problem. We need broad numbers on unemployment and the failure to prove that it's a micro trend that allows individuals to do things like protest for stimulus checks, like vote better politicians into office and like demand the justice they deserve on either side of the house. Our argument is that on their side, every crisis gets much worse because people are in a constant state of vigilance and that even if they were able to grant access to a better first crisis every crisis after that is very very bad very proud to oppose."

First of all, because they probably would have forgotten about the precedent economic crisis in the first place, as Deputy Prime Minister accurately characterizes in the response to the POI. It's like decades, two decades, or like one decades ago, probably economic crisis already forgotten. But the second reason why is because the presidency is literally different. Other political parties actually come into force after the economic crisis. Therefore, the opposition party will say, like, you know, we're not going to do that. And after that, there's going to be more partisan support when the people actually support it in the first place."

The second response here is that media. I think we can flip this argument as well. As I say, if the media is so impactful as they correctly characterize, I think this is the reason why governments can actually more effectively enforce media. This is an example that Kotaro gave you about Canada. The Canadian government used the media as to report the positive effects and the positive effects of the economy. This is the reason why people actually feel trust towards the economy in the first place. This is the reason why using media, using a media power is actually better on our side of the house.

              "text": "crises that occur. Note the financial wisdom that proposition claims governments have must always extend beyond the crisis we're currently talking about. People will eventually find out. We think in that situation, your strategy is absolutely flipped. But with that, we're going to address in two considerations. First, when people are absolutely unaware. Not only was this the proposition's best case scenario, they truly never engage with what happens if people actually do find out. So if I win this clash, we win the debate writ large. What is their point, they say? First, they say they prevent panic, and ultimately, they prevent the crisis from ever occurring. No, considering the motion said during a financial crisis, there's already a pretty substantial crisis that's occurring. Thus, we can largely assume a government response must be made. This is where our third substantive came into play. We said the government is going to need to do more than bail out a bank, notably because bank bailouts do not address the fact that millions of people have gone into things like unemployment or homelessness that need direct responses outside of a financial institution. We said stimulus checks are only handed out on our side of the house because governments do not like to spend. Not only this, this has major effects around, right? First, they're going to prevent the run on banks. They tell you are so problematic, i.e. we can, we like win on their best offense. Second, you increase spending, so there's a very natural way of ending the crisis, but we first must recognize the crisis exists in the first place. Notably, their best offense here was simply you prevent panic. We say, considering a response is necessary, our side is the only side that allows a true response by the government that is necessary to solve the crisis writ large. Second question, if people do find out. Before I engage here, I'm going to say exactly why they do find out. But before I do that, I'm going to note critically this point wins us the debate, even if all of the mechanisms by why people find out are true. Why? Because proposition hangs their entire case on people never find out. Proposition's policy literally crumbles at the fact people have an inkling that what the government telling them is not true. So at their best, we win on the certainty of being able to solve the crisis, even if people are as stupid as they tell you in their case. But why do we think they're not as stupid, right? I think their mechanisms for why this is true were like largely false. First, they said it's military secrets. It's like Area 51. No, it's not. It's the government looking at what people are doing, collecting that data, and then passing it back to people. This is not something the government is the only actor that can fulfill. We say not only is it likely that you have, like, I don't know, people that kind of understand economics that can pull people. They're also pretty observant about what's happening in the market, even if the government isn't telling them what's correct. Secondly, though, what people are experiencing in real life actually does matter. For example, the fact that in the United States right now, companies are doing things like massively increasing wages because they cannot get people to fill spots in their companies that are lower level. And then the government tells you the employment market is fine. I think even someone who totally has no idea what's going on, I think recognizes there's a bit of a disconnect between reality that they're facing and what the government is telling you. Notably, we like largely assume that people generally trust the government. But at the point in which the government is giving them information that is contradictory to the reality, I think that's when you erode that trust. What happens when that trust is eroded? And notably, I think things like unemployment or even things like oil prices are really, really common indicators of what's happening in the economy that you do not need your government to tell you. Thus, when there is a disconnect, people are going to panic. But before we move on to why this is so important, I'll take your point. Your only response to our entire case was that people are going to find out. But we gave you structural reasons, even if they find out, why people still trust the government as long as it leads to tangible benefits. How do you reduce panic when government doesn't withhold information? Right. Not only did I spend two minutes of my speech telling you exactly why we will win this debate if people never find out, I think your response, like your only response to when people do find out is that they will never find out. We say there are three particular reasons why you are absolutely economically devastated in the case in which people recognize this is true. First, notably, this engages with every other crisis after the one you're currently facing. Notably, it is a government's obligation to be more long term than any other actor. So even though like it might be decades apart, the fact that the 2008 financial crisis is like scarred into people's brains because it was so devastating means it's really unlikely that trust is just simply rebuilt over time because people forget. Three reasons why it's devastating. First, every time another sort of like small event, i.e. a lack of production in like one product, like exists in the market, people will assume that it is the beginning of a financial crisis. Why? Because they do not trust the information the government gives them and still want to do things like protect their families. So they're still going to not spend, they're still going to do things like withdraw their investments. They might even like do things like have a run on the bank. They're going to assume the worst, not only more, they're going to assume that more crises exist, but that every time a crisis does exist, it's to a greater scale. So they withdraw all of their money rather than a small amount. Second of all, though, you create a massive amount of market volatility in the case in which these actually exist. And lastly, though, because people are expecting a bust when it doesn't occur over time, people will always assume it's always on the brink of occurring, thus they will always panic more often. All this is to say two things. First, we get more crises over the all, and every time a crisis does exist, it's massively more harmful for everyone involved. Thus, considering this is true, a government's obligation is to be that long-term thinker that is looking not just the crisis we're currently facing, but every other one. You cannot rebuild trust just by hoping it's there when you come back. We think this is the obligation of the government. Lastly, though, quickly on the principle. Again, the principle is totally defensive. Even if they're right and which their action is justified, there's not a reason why we should do it. It's just a reason why it might be permissible if it's effective. We've proven throughout this debate it is not nearly effective, thus it's not obligated on their side of the house. Lastly though, people have a rational right to know the decisions that affect them. This is something that is independent of if they're rational in the first place. People need to know when to withdraw their money to protect their family. That is something we should never deprive them of. Very proud to stand on the opposition. Thank you very much to the third opposition and I'd like to now welcome"

One, that the proof is obvious because when you see things like housing instability, when you see things like a massive spike in homelessness, things that are visible, like an increase in prices in supermarket or increased unemployment, when everyone you know is losing their job and defaulting on their loans, you know there's a crisis. Second, independent polling, it's not that hard. You can have a watchdog agency, poll everyone, calculate the unemployment rate. Thirdly, any government failure to handle causes mistrust after the fact. They say, oh, investors know and people don't remember from crisis to crisis. We told you conclusively, people do remember. This is why the media is like comparing the 2008 crisis to the pandemic. And furthermore, even if investors are the only ones to find out, they go straight to the media and blab it. Obviously, the media has a very clear and strong incentive to want to sensationalize things and tell people.

That is what we bring to you. And that is a nuance that we push from, especially from the third opposition speaker, to which the third opposition speaker had absolutely no response. They didn't understand this nuance of the case. And they say, well, for instance, in second opposition, they say political capital for stimulus package decreases because it's really unpopular. They say also things like from third opposition speaker, people knows about economic crisis is happening. So the government, they know that government is going to lie no this is a really the nuance of a case is that this only impacts a very small number of investors because in the first instance when we're trying to stop the crisis from expanding at its worst form the impact of the number of individuals that are going to be impacted is very very small and marginal on our side but even if the concern about ordinary citizens finding out about it is true i think that the government is opposition is fundamentally uncharitable to our case because the government wouldn't be like economic crisis not a thing guys let's have fun no no they're like more like in the future in a year or in a year or two the economic condition is going to massively improve over time hence you don't have to retract the investment hence you don't have to draw deposits banks are not going to go bankrupt those are the type of things that the government would presumably advocate.

And I think it's at best symmetric on their side of the house too. Second, opposition tries to say the political capital decreases for these things, but they never substantiated in terms of how much of the political capital decreases. But by contrast, on our side, we demonstrated why this policy is going to be the tipping point at which investors are not going to withdraw or stop their investment from making. The reason for this is that in the status quo, as we pointed out from the second proposition, investors stop investing only and especially when government announces that in the next year or two, the economy is not going to recover or the market is going to collapse, continuously collapse over time. The reason for this is that they trust the government. They trusted the government. The first proposition demonstrated, which was not responded to by the previous speaker, is a reason why the government and institutional investors beholden to the interests of their bosses, for instance, have to explain to your bosses. So that is why the market panic uniquely takes place when the government affirms the rumor that exists, affirms the fear-mongering that exists in the market. But secondly, note that when market panic takes place, it harms the capacity of other policies as well, because in the private sector, banks are not having money because people are constantly being panicked and withdrawing their money in that instance it hurts the capacity of these private actors to be able to you know fund to fund to small medium enterprises that means the state has to fund the money in which case the amount of money spent on things like health care package is going to significantly decrease they cannot say other policies are going to exist on their side we and the other challenge we get from the side and main push coming from the opposition but people are going to find out and there's at least a mistrust we demonstrated comprehensively why this is not going to happen given the nature of the kind of policy given the nature of the kind of information but more importantly even if you do mistrust would presumably not happen especially in times of economic crisis as people do understand the government is doing something for them that this this is lying, it's in the interest of people, because the government is constantly giving aid to people on the ground, or giving, you know, financial package to investors as well, in which case they do understand this is a part of the policy that government do to stop the economic crisis. So for all these reasons, we prevent the worst form of future economic crisis, for that reason, I'm so proud to stand on proposition. Thank you very much."

The main contention that I'd like you to consider is that under the status quo, the school system serves, no thank you, as a tool to perpetuate and maintain social inequality. But before I begin, I want you all to imagine the daily life of a child attending a public school. It looks like the life of Daniel, a 14 year old boy from South Carolina who has to go through a metal detector before he goes to maths class, where it's likely that the teacher won't even show up. Recognise that there are only two ways that children like Daniel can hope to get a better education. Firstly, if their family has moved to an area served by a better public school. But this is based upon the assumption that they can afford to buy a hedge, I'll take you in a second, in an area where property prices are driven up by demand because of the school's reputation for being good. Before I go into the second method, a POI. Do you believe that the only way to be able to save students from this atrocious public school system is just to avoid and scrap the entire public school system in the first place? We don't think it's scrapping the public school system. My partner is going to be talking about how this move motion actively creates incentives for the public system to improve. What we're saying is that on an individual level, if we are ever to create social mobility and benefit these people's lives, they have to have a quality of education, they have to have equality of access. That is why we promote this motion. Secondly, the only other way that you can get a quality education program is if you abdicate in the land use from the public school system altogether and go to a private school. Again, assuming that you can afford the high tuition fees. Notice the sickening trend."

All of these opportunities that children attending poorer public schools are completely deprived of. Secondly, these children aren't deprived because of any personal failings. They have simply lost at a birth lottery. Realistically, we tell you that if these children, no thank you, had been born with exactly the same personal characteristics but a different set of social circumstances, they would have the opportunity to shine just as bright as any of those lucky enough to be born into a life of privilege. Thirdly, no thank you, we think this injustice is made even more insidious in the fact that the socio-economic inequality often overlaps with other dimensions of social inequality, for example race, because these minority groups have experienced both historic and systematic deprivation of financial capital to allow them to access a good education in the first place. Fourthly and finally, it is a self-perpetuating spiral where you miss out on a good education and you can't get a good job to raise yourself up and to promote yourself in society. What this does is it locks entire communities in a destructive cycle where there is a generational deprivation of hope for getting a good life."

The main intention of this being school vouchers allow individuals to unlock and exploit potential that was unacknowledged in the status quo. We believe that our model rectifies the injustice detailed in our first substan-so by giving low income families the tools to experience better quality education despite the limits of money. Specifically we tell you it targets students with a wealth of potential that is less than knowledge, that are allowed to go to schools with better teaching and better resources. We think this comes with two main objectives. Firstly, you don't have to live in a situation where you cannot access your own potential or even realise that you have potential in the first place. We think it's an incredibly frustrating life when you realise that no matter how hard you work and how much effort you put in, your future has already been determined by the circumstances of your birth. We think under this motion it changes when accessing cases and you allow people, no thank you, to define their own future rather than it being defined for them by society. Secondly, the second benefit is that you can better people's futures when you give them an opportunity to access jobs that were previously not for people who seemed to be, not for people like them. This is professions like lawyers, doctors, chemists, all of them living people, fulfilling careers and with that the attached financial security to ensure social mobility and allow you to improve yourself in that case. It may be more difficult, but we believe if we improve one individual's life under this motion, we can get education to change his life for the better. We guarantee opportunity by widening access to these people. They have the means to get a chance to discover and implement a circle that they never would have before. My third point is"

We get principally when you mix people in private schools you can eliminate the roots of low-level prejudice that are based upon misinformation because the point at which you have contact with these people on a day-to-day basis, you're in classes with them, you're friends with people of different walks of life, that is when the misinformation no longer has an effect on you.

They claim to have two arguments in this round, but their first, about essentially reducing inequality, was basically about how we move poor individuals to private schools, They claim to have two arguments in this round, but their first, about essentially reducing inequality, was basically about how we move poor individuals to private schools, which is principally good, and then their second argument was about how this practically achieves their success. Note that this was essentially one argument about lifting certain individuals out of public schools. We have three responses. First, we think that this is a remarkably individualistic approach to solving inequality. They said that on their side of the house, if they help just one person, that's enough for them to succeed. But, we think that this should go beyond just helping one individual. What do we tell you? That education is a public good, not a commodity that should be subject to individual choice. Public goods, as they say on their side of the house, are things so essential they can't be left to market to selectively provide to people. These are things like water, national security, and things like this. Education is a fundamental part of this. Democracies rely on individuals to be informed so they can maximize the rights and resources that they use. And in its ideal form, anyone can take advantage of an education system to thrive in society. Which means, we think, what matters is that the public education system as a whole doesn't provide recipients exactly with what they want, but rather that the entire system of education can help as many people as possible. Just as under, say, a public transportation system, the government doesn't use funds to make sure that one individual can, say, buy a Rolls Royce, but in fact ensures the collective benefit of the whole. Additionally, we think because education is funded with taxpayer dollars, it should focus on benefiting the entire taxpaying collective, not just one individual. At the point where we leave public schools behind, this goal is undermined. Our second response is that we actually think that low-income individuals are shut out systematically on their side of the house. Even if they do restrict this to low-income individuals, we think it is going to be the privileged groups within those societies, say white low-income individuals, that are going to be able to take advantage of this. This is because hidden costs beyond the tuition that the voucher provides, things like transportation costs, are going to mean that the lowest- income individuals are shut out of the system. Selective admissions that private schools often use are going to mean only those who already have an educational advantage can even get in. But our final response to all of their recommendation is that they assume that these individuals"

              "text": "are better off in private schools. We think in many cases private schools are actually worse. We'll explain this more in our second substantive argument. With that, let's introduce our first argument about how this harms students who remain in state school systems. Practically, we think the state school system is the most important consideration in this round. Why? Just empirically, it has more students. It is basically impossible for a voucher system to move every single student out of, if you grant that, public schools are low-performing schools. In Chile, the most extensive voucher system in the world, only about half of students are able to take advantage of this. In the large majority of cases, more people are going to be in public schools. But second, as we tell you, those who remain in state schools are going to be the least advantaged in society. Who can't, you know, get into a selective school. Who can't cover those hidden costs. Who can't pay for the additional tuition on top of the voucher. This undermines education in three ways. First, it decreases resources and students for public schools. When students leave the public school system, they take the funding that was attached to them with them. Unfortunately, this means that even though schools have fewer resources, there are some costs that are the same no matter how many students you have. Things like building maintenance, which means that effectively, because you have fewer resources, the number of resources you have per Things like building maintenance, which means that effectively, because you have fewer resources, the number of resources you have per student decreases. But also there are just benefits to scale in public schools. If you have enough students to, say, justify filling specialized classes. This is why in Chile, when they implemented a voucher system, things like English and Portuguese programs were cut because it didn't make sense to pay for these for fewer students. But second, we think we move parents also out of this public education system. And the parents that would be motivated enough to fill out the voucher application, going research private schools, apply to the lottery multiple times when they don't succeed the first time, are also the ones that make public education work. Schools rely on parents to do things like fundraise, volunteer, do things like vote in school board elections, and participate in educational politics to improve that system. When these motivated parents leave in a voucher system, the entire system suffers. But third and finally, we take away the political incentive to improve state schools because of exactly the rhetoric that side proposition pushes. That state schools are fundamental failures. That we really can't do anything to improve them unless we just give people a ticket out of them. This basically gives politicians, I'll take you in a moment, an excuse not to improve education. We saw this in Chile when, between 1981 when they implemented their voucher and 1990, public education spending plummeted 30% relative to GDP. Go. Do you in principle support private schools giving bursaries to academically able pupils who cause socioeconomic backgrounds? Look, our problem in this round isn't that people go to private schools, it's the use of public money taken out of the public system to do this, at the expense of everybody left behind. We don't think that that is acceptable. Private schools giving bursaries on their own are not our problem in this round. With that, let's introduce our second argument about how this actually worsens outcomes for students that do use bursaries on their own are not a problem in this round. With that, let's introduce our second argument about how this actually worsens outcomes for students that do use vouchers. This directly engages with their material.

For example, in the Netherlands, private schools' ability to skirt regulations means more private schools are classified as weak than public schools. But second, the success of private schools is often misleading. What do we look for when we're selecting an educational option? We're looking for things like high test scores, low behavioral problems, and things like that. The problem is, private schools often do well just because students are from wealthy families with an educational advantage. So when a poor family with a voucher picks a school because it has great test scores, often that's misleading because the students in that school are doing well not because the teaching is great, but because they can all afford things like private tutors. Poor families come from fundamentally different backgrounds than often the privileged groups in private schools, which means that those teachers and systems are not well equipped to deal with their needs compared to public systems that are worth it to deal with more needs this means often that students are worse off in these schools this is why since sweden implemented its voucher system in 1992 test scores have consistently fallen for the last two and a half decades. When Chile implemented its voucher system in 1980, its results also stagnated. We reject the characterization that students are better off in private schools. We reject the characterization that the solution to educational inequality in public schools is to abandon them."

We just don't think there are countries that have excess cash that can now put in these areas. But secondly, it's an illegitimate counter-property to say that we're going to fund schools better in the same way that we could just say we could fund education systems better need to give us more NASA's than that. Secondly, the kind of schools that are likely to benefit from these resources are ones that are not the most disadvantaged. That means the schools that struggle are going to have to use these resources on more basic things whereas the already kind of good public schools are always going to get better. Anyway, thirdly, we can still support on our side, as we said, any benefit to the state system by making it better in the long run. Though they're not something that is mutually exclusive to our motion, we think both can happen. Fourthly, on top of that, we give the unique benefits that Rachel tells you about social mixing and representation for young people that are unique to Team Scotland well, that you never get from Team America, that will leave these individuals in the public system alone. Then we attack, and under a second rebuttal on Mitchell's case, he tells that they want to give education to as many people as possible and that that's why we think they can't stay without principle. We have two responses to this. Firstly, that simple utilitarian metric doesn't work. The benefits we give you on Team Scotland are ones that greatly outweigh any of the minor harms you get when you harm the majority of the public system. This makes America's calculation extremely unfair when it looks like America telling a young Sudanese migrant that he can't do the science poll because of the marginal benefits to a few people who already own a good public system. Secondly, even if we take the one about Mexico, we still win because we refer you back to the analysis about the model of vulnerable or about positive cycles that get people out of social inability to arrive at society and get better. We show that you have unique benefits to communities only on Team Scotland as well because they are able to get out of these cycles and out of the poverty that Team America will leave them. Unique benefits on our side. No thank you. Then we tell that the poorest individuals in these cases can't reach these school vouchers because they're not going to be able to afford SSN. We have three responses. First, we point out that this is just a mitigatory response to an argument. If they think they're not going to be able to pay for it, they can see to the fact that it's a good thing. Secondly, we point out that there is a full spectrum of schools that are likely to use these vectors. This could be for-profit schools or non-for-profit schools, meaning they're as different as their abilities. Thirdly, it's in the direct interest of these private schools to allow for the most potentially under-filled individuals to come to them. That benefits those schools in themselves, as we get better results as a result of that. That means if they have students who are unable to pay the fees, they're more likely to give more birthdays and to give more fits. When they say in their POI that they agree that birthdays are a good thing to give to people from low-income backgrounds, but academic disability, they can see to it that the principle exists that people who are deserving of education have unpotential, that their potential that is unfulfilled should come into our sight. That means they can see to the entirety of Rachel's case, that the point of education is to help those individuals who need it most, and they tell you that brushes are a good thing, they believe that if you're an un-developed area and you're unable to fulfil your potential, you deserve to be in a private school. That's what the school voucher is. That's what Team Scotland are for. Onto my argument about why we think we're going to help to state the school system in general, direct the classroom speech we just heard the opposition. Before that, share your point of information. You tell us that it is fine to provide resources to a low-income student to attend a private school. Our problem is taking money out of the public system where the vast majority of disadvantaged students are to do that. That undermines the purpose of the state in providing education and means that you lose this record. Let's be clear. Team America is referring to taking money out for one individual to another school. What they fail to recognize is that, in my case, that some public schools aren't able to catch the needs of everyone. Their classification of public schools being this good thing that helps everyone is completely unrealistic and not the real point. It is true that some public schools are flat places. They help individuals. For the majority of people, when they're already strapped for cash, they are already unable to help everyone. We think it gets better when you can take out individuals who can therefore"

The main contention of this argument is that through increasing the viability of private schools and the competition with public schools, we allow for all students to access a better quality of education directly from cash cashier who just heard. Why do we think therefore that more private schools are likely to exist because of this? Currently there aren't enough private schools, there are many private schools in them because the market for them is fairly limited, due to a restricted section of the richest population of society. However, by allowing underprivileged students to apply for school vouchers because they can spend it on private teachers churches open up that market significantly. It incentivises private schools to expand and to take in new pupils and allow them to access that money. That will help them build more infrastructure to accommodate and grow new pupils and new money. It also incentivises for new private schools to be set up. This is because under Team Scotland's rule there are thousands of families that will now have government money to spend on private education in the amount of pupils that cannot be feasibly taken in by the existing private schools that exist. This means that private enterprises and charities are now incentivised to start schools to capture that wealth and the capital for these individuals and these students so every school voucher recipient can attend should they want to. This will end because of two reasons, no thank you. Firstly, children who use school vouchers are put into private schools because existing parents who are not invested in the education of their children should be pushed for the best options. So in rest of the time they tell us in opposition to say we take the people who are most likely to help practice public schools out of them and put them in private. We say we help all individuals when we put them into a private system where there is more likely to be application for better schools in general. Secondly, private schools have more resources because they get charge fees, they get less legacy donations, and parents donate thousands of pounds on top of their school fees. All of these steps can then provide better facilities and services to all these students. This is specifically important, as Rachel tells you, in cases of ethnic minorities where there are extreme or very extreme lacking things. That's important. Overall, we are planning schools available to them. State schools are able to get better because now they have the ability to not have to retain pupils. That means they can't spend money unnecessarily on things they have to be doing the best for the education. Because they have more money per pedagogue than they would have on how much to spend on certain individuals, they have more money to use on individual pupils. That means you're more likely to have things like modernising the curriculum and restructuring teaching staff and making better teacher training, because these schools are going to lose their pupils if they don't find a good education. That means, all in comparison, school systems in the public sector get better, the public schools have an incentive to retain the individuals they already have, meaning they can't be chatting short, they can't be slacking, they have to be helping everyone, until Scotland's world is realistic,"

But now let's get into all the material that we've heard so far coming out of the proposition. First let's begin with this idea of their model. Note that they give us a pretty abstract term of supporting average tuition fees for private schools. We think private schools can charge additional fees on top of the voucher and in fact have an incentive to do so to increase profits. This is precisely why whenever we looked at Chile, they implemented a voucher school system, but 75% of them went to students that were at private schools already, because private schools simply hyped up their prices to have more of a profit. The reason why this is important is because even under their model, low-income students will always be shut out."

              "text": "But now, let's get into the first question of the debate, which is are vouchers an effective mechanism for creating equitable educational outcomes? We think the answer is pretty clearly no. First off, they assume all state schools are dilapidated and failing. Elba already told you we reject this characterization as true. For example, Finland continuously tops the chart for educational outcomes in the world, and they operate with largely state schools. But secondly, look to Barbados. It has one of the highest literacy rates in the entire world at 98%, and they do this through having government run state schools. As a team of five students that all attend a state school, we think they grossly mischaracterize what this actually looks like. But secondly, we can agree, not every state school is successful, but vouchers eliminate the ability for those schools to reform. Ella gave you the example of Cincinnati, where state schools prevent to actually have pursuit reforms and brought in massively better outcomes. But look at the example of California, which offered financial bonuses to schools that were low-performing to lessen class size and hire more experienced teachers. Both examples better test scores and require two elements that vouchers completely remove. The first is political will to reform. Note that Ella already talked about this, but they never engaged with this mechanism. We think there needs to be more money in education as a whole, but this is less likely with vouchers because of complacency. But secondly, financial resources to reform to purchase things like new textbooks, better technology, fund extracurriculars, and hire more teachers. Those funds go away in their world. Vouchers eliminate both avenues under which state reform is possible. The proposition cannot also have reforms when they themselves agree this is about a reallocation of funds. But the third response is that all of the proposition's impacts assume that only low-income individuals will have access to vouchers and going to private schools will be better. We told you this won't happen. Of non-low-income individuals, it will be the most privileged. They have access to the most information about paperwork to actually pursue those vouchers. The most motivated parents in school systems that will know where these vouchers are accessible. That means under their side of the house the least privileged are left in state schools because they're not able to access vouchers in the first place. But secondly, low income students who transfer do not necessarily have better test scores immediately. Rather, what do we tell you? Oftentimes, the reasons why private schools perform better is because those students have access to things like private tutors, meaning those teachers know how to teach students that have access to a lot of extra resources, time, and private tutors, but not necessarily students from low-income backgrounds. At that point, within the classroom, there is a discrepancy, meaning that low-income students are not able to be educated. They don't actually achieve any of their benefits. But on the point of information, they ask, we don't concede that private schools need public funding. That is at the core of this debate."

              "text": "But now let's get to the second question on this idea of the principal. They tell us it is enough to just have one individual benefit. If one individual benefits at the cost of the entire collective of students left in public schools, we think it is a gross mischaracterization for them to claim that it is okay. Rather, principally, we tell them education is a public good because you need education in order for society to function. That is why it is only the obligation of the state to look after this collective they eliminate that with school vouchers but now let's respond to this idea of the third argument that they give us on this idea of both competition and new private schools being created first off this is true but the kind of private schools that are created are the kinds that want to make a profit we saw this in Chile for example where vouchers led to more for-profit schools that are more likely to do things like cut costs and spend more on advertising rather than education because of this profit incentive. That means at that point vouchers no longer go to funding classrooms. But secondly we would say on this idea, but secondly remember the example of Chile where more things were created and afterwards actual test scores got worse across the country as a result. But now let's get into our third substantive argument before I do that speech show. Team Scotland supports any improvements to education. Why do you, therefore, are willing to leave students in one-top detention schools that aren't necessarily bad but would massively limit their chances for any improvements to social mobility? We told you, we are happy to support public school reforms, but those are impossible and every way implement vouchers for the two reasons I already gave you, who have been engaged with either mechanism. Now let's get into the third argument. Note that whatever marginal increases happen in standardized casting scores that the proposition might achieve are massively less important than this argument about societal costs. Our third argument is that school vouchers worsen segregation in schools, hurting community cohesion. The purpose of education and the unique reason the state funds it is to facilitate liberal democracy. We want citizens to express their preferences in things to be able to govern them, but we can't do that unless they have the tools to vote and participate effectively. Schools where the vast majority of citizens are the ability to be able to interact with other people. Note this actually engages with their analysis about having more segregation in schools. We think education facilitates liberal democracy in two ways. The first is ensuring a common foundation of facts and a common denominator by which all individuals can interact. And the second is ensuring civil discourse. We think that school segregation is antithetical to either of these principles. Of course, society requires things like individuals to know math or history, but the thing that makes society truly work is individuals that are able to work together and separately educated people can coexist. Vouchers undermine this in two ways. The first is by promoting self-assertive dependencies. Given a choice, we think that people generally like to associate with people that are similar to them. It's more comfortable to decrease conflict and have easier communication. This means with vouchers, parents are likely to pick schools with student bodies very demographically similar to their own families. This is especially prevalent in cases where private schools already specialize in things like religion. In Sweden, for example, vouchers exacerbated segregation of immigrants versus native Swedish students in these private schools. And the same thing occurred in Chile where segregation vouchers exacerbated segregation of immigrants versus native Swedish students in his private schools. And the same thing occurred in Chile, where segregation actually worsened along race and class lines. But the second reason why I think this is true is because vouchers don't cover hidden costs, and they also result in a lot of class segregation. Vouchers present a false guise of equality, but in reality, costs still persist. example transportation textbooks uniforms food mandatory donations of school events all of this means that individuals from lower income communities cannot access the prime actual private education because of the hidden costs that will never be covered under any model of proposition migrates in their next speech it means relatively better off students lose the ability to learn awareness of economic diversity and to develop actual understanding of what the lives of other people look like. They all get conceited that the impact of segregation is bad. If that is true, that is a reason to oppose. Low-income students who take the vouchers then become burdened by hidden costs, either sacrificing essential resources or furthering their own debt. In either case scenario, they get left behind. Society is harmed, we win the debate. I would like to defend the status quo,"

This is all the stuff about the benefits of state education, how it functions on our side of the house. We get firstly told, we get firstly told by the open, that it's just possible for them to fund education more. They can just benefit things by channeling funding in a more clever and sophisticated way. Firstly, we point out there's no extra funding in our system. You've still got the same money that was going to funding state education before, it's just been reallocated in a different way. So just analytically on its face, the point just didn't work in its original form. But they changed their hymn sheets a little bit later on, and they said, they started sort of squirrelling things a little bit, and they started telling you that these funding allocations just don't work in a certain way, and that it's much more possible on their side of the house to argue for this additional funding.

That just means it's not a legitimate counter-property for them to stand up and say we'll fund education more and improve it because we can also stand up and say we want to improve the state education system that's not unnecessarily a legitimate characterisation they have to defend the status quo and show unique harms of emotion not just tell you that there is a better reality on their side of the hat. It's also really important to tell you that in that counter-property in that hypothetical world, the schools that benefit the most are the best schools, right? It's the ones in the slightly affluent suburb that are able to use that money to hire the slightly better teacher, not the really disadvantaged school that has to use the money to cover basics and basic necessities, right? So even in their best case scenario, they don't actually fit with my fundamental problem, which is social inequality, which is the disparity between schools. That was our handle since the White House was opening. It wasn't accurately responded to. We also, again, refer you back to the unique benefits of our system, about the social mixing, about what I'll think in a second, about having the politicians getting that increased accountability from seeing those people they otherwise would not. They didn't respond yet."

We think that when competition is introduced it looks like things were in New Orleans. Ultimately, massive amounts of segregation occurred because ultimately more people chose to go to one school, enhancing the divide between the private and the public. But furthermore, it looks like instances in Arizona where private programs such as fine arts, programs such as language, such as better teachers, get cut because there's no more room for it.

That meant that everybody was catered to and nobody was left behind like that would happen in a voucher system but we're even willing to engage and we already did engage with what happens when there are lower performances within public schools we think that that's noble all the more reason to want to encourage more federal spending for them voucher systems uniquely take away that money, especially when they tell you that it requires a reallocation of funds. When you look to examples of Cincinnati, of California, where money was chosen not to go to a voucher system, but rather to reinvest within the system, to enhance the programs through teachers' investment training, through technological investments, through being able to update curriculum, that's where you see change.

This looks like things such as higher test scores, positive learning environments, right? These are all things that we both agree are very essential to being able to garner benefits for students. Ultimately, two mechanisms were presented to you as to how to garner these benefits. Let's go through both of them and why ours is preferable, right? The first mechanism that we heard is the one from side proposition, which ultimately from their own side, which we quote, is a ticket out of tyranny. They tell you that when you hand people a voucher, they're suddenly going to be able to have this choice to get them out of cyclical poverty to be able to inform these students. Here's the thing. We ultimately tell you that this choice isn't actually an informed choice that is made. Why is this so? Because private schools have to operate under a system that upholds their brand, that shows that they're prestigious, that makes them look like they're the best schools possible. That means that they take money into advertisements, they take money into being able to make these campaigns so that they can garner more students, so they can garner more of a successful business model, right? Ultimately, that means that they're going to broadcast things like really good scores that people are going to buy into, but what they're not telling you is how they got those good scores. It's because they have wealthier demographics that can get things like private tutors, that can get things like more time one-on-one with their ultimate, like, really rich and, like, powerful families, that ultimately can give them a better education in the long term. That means that students who buy into these programs who are low-income, who still have to probably deal with, like, a job after school, who have to deal with transportation, hidden costs, all the things that Ella and Emily told you, still are going to be hurt in this system. That's why we think that this mechanism ultimately simply doesn't work. We, as side opposition, gave you a lot of analysis and detailed descriptions as to why voucher systems failed in a lot of instances. Look to Chile, where a lot of instances of this happening"

              "text": "only furthered the divide between students, hurt them in the long term, and ultimately operated worse than public schools. That's a unique reason as to why voucher systems won't work. But we as side opposition present a far more considerable mechanism to being able to benefit for these peoples by focusing on everyone, the common good, the collective. We give you three reasons why this is extremely justifiable. The first is this idea that we are using public money, we're using tax dollars. The reason why we have to care about the collective is not because, say, a few handful are going to get a great education under a voucher system, it's because there's a massive amount of people that are left behind. Insofar that a government has an obligation to care for the collective, to care for everyone in that system, they have an obligation to use money that is handed to them to betterment of all. But furthermore, we think parental involvement is a key theme. The parents that are most invested in their students, that invest the most time in school dances, school events, and bettering the school, are the ones who are going to buy into a voucher system and up and leave, meaning that public schools are left to deteriorate. Lastly, we think that a political incentive is slowly washed away on their side of the house, because now students ultimately are just told that a voucher system is going to work, the government has no incentive to help in the long term. These three things are the things that make state schools successful. When you vouch for students there, it uniquely strips these things away. That's why you can't stand with it. Lastly, don't let them get away with this argument that simply public schools are unmotivated and when the voucher systems are suddenly going to be enlightened and ultimately work with competition. That's round losing for two key reasons. First of all, it operates under the mindset that schools work like businesses in the first place. No, they work to be able to just better them of all people. Public schools have an incentive to just educate, not to make a profit like private schools. But furthermore, we think that competition is the reason why schools fail in the first place, because there has to be certain losers. And when it's people who are disadvantaged, when it's not a fair competition because you're taking money from public schools, you're ultimately leading them to fail. But, the second question in today's debate is which side best promotes social integration in schools? We don't necessarily think that education is restricted to tangible impacts such as test scores or other veterans in the long term, right? We think that you can actually get two very unique things. Civil discourse. We think that diverse settings within schools is how you actually teach children to engage with one another aside from things such as like divides and race or religion or things. When you grow up with people, you're much more likely to understand them. That's something you uniquely get from schools. But furthermore, we think that you need a common set of values. You have to use these kinds of things to enhance society, to operate under like a certain moral code so that we can always keep like a baseline of like faith in society. The best way of achieving these two things are by having this increase of very valuable analysis. We tell you, we give you a lot of valuable analysis of this in our third substantive. We have to deny a system that encourages self-assortative tendencies, like private schools, that uniquely tell you to choose their school because of a religion, or because of a race, or because of a certain socioeconomic class. That's where you actually see greater divide. Don't buy into the argument when they tell you that you decrease inequality, insofar that we tell you integration does not matter if the poor people in a rich school are designed to fail. That's just faulty integration. We don't buy into it. We stand firm on the opposition. Thank you."

Their best argument, and their main offense in this round, is that poor families do need access to a better private education. They ignore all of our analysis about how oftentimes this is actually worse than the public education they otherwise would have received. Because private schools are less accountable, because the reason they're successful is incredibly misleading, and those individuals in those schools are just more comparatively advantaged. And their own third argument, where they tell you that the reason that private schools are going to expand and more are going to be created is because, precisely, they want to make more money. We don't think that all private schools have bad incentives, but the ones that are created anew, particularly under a voucher system, for the purpose of increasing profit, this is their argument, are overwhelmingly for-profit ones that are more likely to be worse, that are more likely to cut costs and spend on advertising instead of education, which is why, as we told you, when Chile implemented a voucher program and more for-profit schools were created, they were worse in math and other test scores than the public education system. This was their analysis. Private schools are worse and get worse. But we also told you that the most disadvantaged students are left behind in the public school system because they can't cover things like hidden costs. And even if it isn't the most disadvantaged, there's still a ton of people left in public schools, which is why that is more important. Even if the few people who get a voucher and go to a private school are comparatively better off. As they told you, this is a debate about reallocation. This is a debate about taking the money that you spent on one student in a public school system and moving it to another place. Even when costs in that system are staying the same for certain things and we're spending less per student. This is a debate about moving the most motivated parents away, and it is a debate about decreasing the, as they tell you, already low political incentive to invest in public schools. If it's already low, why don't you do more to destroy it? We also told you that competition is a backwards way to improve educational performance. We don't think that public schools don't care about their students, and we think the idea that you have to take away resources to force people to compete is backwards. That's like telling a kid that's failing math, I'm going to take away your calculator until you start making A's. How likely do you think they are to be able to do that in a way where they don't have the resources to succeed? You are dooming public schools to fail, and all the millions of children in them."

But they failed to engage on our argument about how people selectively assort themselves into communities where they feel more comfortable when they have more options to leave, which looks like things where in Sweden, native and immigrant populations segregated after Sweden implemented a voucher system because native populations felt more comfortable just isolated within themselves. If you do believe their argumentation that integration is so important for a society to function, you won't pass a policy that allows more segregation to occur.

What we did on Team Scotland is we actually considered the wider impact of having an individual having the opportunity to have success. What this looks like is redefining jobs that are accessible to communities. It redefines what opportunities you can have. It is future without limit. What we tell you is that an individual's success does not occur in isolation. It always occurs when a community is able to see that success and aspire to that success. Because when we told you that one person's success can engage an entire community to dedicate education, this is a benefit. The role of education is to allow access to quality education, to allow people to invest in their own education, invest in your own education, rather than just getting a substandard one. The comparative is that our world is one in where postcode does not determine your prospects. Team USA only ever defended the unrealistic best case scenario where all students are able to go to decent public schools. When we tell you that we benefit people who are in the worst public schools, we benefit the communities, we benefit the education system, the system fulfills its role when it no longer perpetrates social inequality.

When we addressed this we pointed out that they conveniently ignored Hannah's entire case. Because we think when you introduce school vouchers we see that public schools have the incentive to spend more responsibly to keep their students in their schools. That is something that never happens on the side of the opposition's world where state schools become complacent because they are the guaranteed education system for a lot of people. We have to light a fire underneath these schools to burn out the complacency that currently exists within the state school. That's the thing that only ever happens under our side. Secondly, on the idea of worsening segregation, I think this is a miscounted point at best. Because when we told you that principally the status quo is unjust because it shuts out so many people from getting a good quality education, whether that be through getting going to a good public school, going to a private school, this is the segregation that is only, that is only, that always happens under the status quo. What we give is opportunity and all of the things associated with that, when you give communities role models, when you give them representation, that can only be a good thing when you raise them up. The comparative is, is that when the most powerful tool to benefit your life, to benefit your community's life, is now made accessible to you through school vouchers, that is when life gets better, that is when cohesion gets better, that is when society is benefited. This is something that will only ever happen when you give children the ticket out of the tyranny of the birth lottery, and this is why I am so, so proud to propose it. Thank you."

              "text": "That being said, let's move on to our first substantive argument about how gentrification creates economic harm. The thesis of this argument is that gentrification brings displacement, forcing the most vulnerable citizens out of their homes. This happens in two ways. First, through rising prices. The influx of new residents in an electrified area creates an increased demand for the existing supply of housing. Landlords want to capitalize on this increased demand, and so they raise rents. As rents go up, people who cannot afford them are driven out, replaced by wealthier individuals who are willing to pay the higher prices. For example, place bidding in Portugal is rapidly gentrifying. This happened after the government attracted foreign investors and converted historic neighborhoods into housing for young professionals. Over the past year alone, rents have risen by 23%. The second way that displacement occurs is through increasing the cost of living. As people move into a gentrified area, the cost of living increases because new businesses will cater to those customers who will pay the higher prices. Even if you have access to affordable housing, people will still be displaced because they no longer afford to live in their communities. All of this is empirically confirmed. Over a 22-year period in the U.S., displacement was two times higher in gentrifying areas than it was in non-gentrifying ones."

              "text": "But why does gentrification matter? Why does displacement matter? Two broad reasons. First, displacement imposes severe costs on individuals. It's difficult to find a place to live because some individuals, if they already live in economic areas that aren't super-stimulated, don't have the money for things like a security deposit if they want to start renting a new place. Also, children of these families are under the image of having to go to new school districts that probably won't be able to service their needs. And you see things like maybe a lack of public transportation in a new area that these individuals live in. So whereas before, your walk to work may have been like five minutes, now you probably have to take a bus that is over an hour long. Displacement compounds all of the harms that economically disadvantaged people already must face, but our model uniquely addresses this. By ending active government support, we slow down the pace of migration, and it is this influx of economic supply crunch that increases rents and costs of living. Even if some people move in, without active government support, that migration is much smaller, so it does not carry the same parts. The second broad impact of displacement is that it undermines local businesses. Local businesses are only able to sustain themselves through a loyal consumer base, because they may not be able to do things like aggressively advertise. Displacement takes away this base, but this is so important because the big businesses that replace them are unable to help the community in the same way. Because local businesses reinvest in those communities. For example, the excess profits that come from my bodega go back into that neighborhood, but the excess profits from Starbucks simply make Howard Schultz richer. We ensure on our side that people both have access to homes and local businesses that are crucial for facilitating economic sustenance."

              "text": "but slowly. On your side of the house, gentrification happens at exponential rates where these individuals come into these areas and significantly bring up a crisis and cause displacement because no one can adjust to the long term to those issues. Our second substantive argument is on the government obligation to prevent gentrification. There are two sources of this obligation. The first is that individuals have a positive right to a home. The home is the basis of all other rights. Without a home, you don't have a place to provide shelter or the most basic sense of well-being. That is why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that housing is a human right. Note that this is not just a shelter over someone's head. The right to a home also extends to things like geographic stability. Why is this the case? Because people's development, identities, and self-actualization are tied to the culture, community, and location that they call home. Thus, the destruction of these ties through displacement creates deep material and psychological harm. The government has the obligation to protect people from the forced abandonment of their communities and culture. This is why individuals who are displaced can't simply pick up their truth. People's lives, experiences, and future plans shouldn't be disposable for affluent young questioners. The second source of this obligation is the idea that people have a negative right to property. People have a right to property free from the state's interference. That is because this is the sphere of citizen lives that gives them meaning and allows them to exercise freedom. If we prove that gentrification is the result of government action, then it's akin to a government-imposed violation of people's rights to property, i.e. a state-sponsored eviction."

Investors don't want to invest in poor neighborhoods because they're worried that they can never get a return. So only government policies like quote-unquote economic development programs, like tax credits for new businesses over tax credits for the poor and elderly can give them that assurance. That means government action is necessary to create a white limit for gentrification to occur. The second way this happens is that governments directly kick out residents for gentrification. They resort to policies like eminent domain, which means seizing people's property, knocking down their homes, and building commercial real estate. For example, the Lagos government of Nigeria used eminent domain to displace 10,000 people from the neighborhood of Morocco for quote unquote civilized development.

The historic inner city of Kidang, Kuala Lumpur, was considered a drug-ridden slum area for years, so the White Cross City Hall had basically abandoned it. It ended up being gentrification – young professionals moving in in conditions of change – that restored its former glory. Under Team USA's study, Kidang's inner city would still be in a state of permanent disrepair and its inhabitants would still be living in denigration. But four points to add to that today. One, our view of gentrification that this is an effective way of getting to the next generation is a criteria. Two, on Team Scotland we don't have to defend things like forced eviction or like the intimated intent of permanent right, because these things probably happen outside of genocide in the UK anyway. Three, we do still support measures that mitigate the negative consequences of gentrification. Things like re-counselling the slaves people, rather than trying to prevent gentrification outside. Four, we know that communities cannot win by listing negative effects of gentrification. They need to explain why these outweigh the positive impact that gentrification brings, and they need to convince us that taking prevention won't cause unnecessary additional harms. If we cannot do this, how will we win? Having said this, the case will go into state consisting of three points. The harms of active prevention, the harms to the residents of the private area, and insect and overuse of recreational services. But before we get into this example, let's look at what we've heard from TPSA so far."

              "text": "First thing they've made their methods. They've called this a preferred investment site to improve areas on investment through documentation. We think this is pretty unrealistic. You can see governments just can't do this. There's budget constraints, which means they're more likely to spend money to get faster returns instead of going to perpetrators. Secondly, governments tend to usually opt to spend for a little bit of single-immigrant carriers or for a paid minority-emigrant carriers. We just don't think this happens. We just have to have denomination for any investments to take place. This is the type of investment that we're looking for. But then we figure a bit of displacement. We feel this, with the actual denomination, we get more demand, increased rent, and a much a little bit of point of fear. So we think that probably denominated cars will have a demand for a different type of housing for existing residents. Because the point to which the ESV tells us that GenPrize or professions or businesses we think we've got a different demand than working families that already live there and who's what they're looking for in the ground. In any case, we're waiting for the school workers to go over and do the same in our case. Then we've got talk about cost of living increase. So we think that actually GenPrize will be bringing money for existing businesses, which money then gets reinvested into the community, or like, we support businesses to enter into use, again, more of that later. We then got told about how people move out, again, we can support rehousing people, we can support rent-and-duty housing, but we don't think that's necessarily our point. And then we got told talk about right to housing. And really quickly, we don't think that the government has a specific duty to defend someone from a specific house or specific area. We think it's important for people to have shelter. But just like the government pretends that people feel that they can find employment, they don't pretend that people are going to stay in a specific job, we just don't think it's going to be a political movement. But we always work closely at the end of the best plan phase."

              "text": "So having said that, onto the first starting point of the state, the Harbour's Act of Prevention of Pall Declination. So the main conception of this point is that measures that can prevent declination are far more important than the declination of the state. So the kinds of measures that the state will take to prevent declination were the radical government intervention of urban planning, the very strict rent controls, keeping in Paris and Berlin the TSA supports, the very strict rent controls, the impairs of related PPSU supports, the climate permissive for development. There's three impacts of these costs. One, they encourage landlords to sell their property because renting is a threat to no longer high enough to make a profit. That means house prices increase because the house prices have got the properties, and giving someone's house is a really important financial asset that will really hurt homeowners, and will smoothen and outweigh the debt out of the gentrified neighborhood throughout the city. Two, the supply of great-fit rent and accommodation will also be decreased under this condition because you have no incentive for people to rent or to develop a new rent and accommodation. So that means, firstly, some actual people who might want to move into cities aren't able to do so because they're unable to find housing, which is a serious consequence of the supply of housing. And even if prices don't increase, when there's more demand for housing, the way people are more likely to lose out on these landlords are more likely to rent someone with a middle-class background and it's more secure to live without them, so you can begin to pay for the landlord. So that would make it harder for the people to find these to split. Exactly what Kim Yosef is trying to prevent. But three, even if you have to pay rent accommodation remains the same, it will be lower quality because the point at which their rent has, landlords or disincentivised will do anything beyond minimum or minimum rents and properties if they cannot ask for higher rents to go along with those improvements. They also have an incentive for as many people to have property as possible, to get as many rents and high-end housing as possible. This affects the first three people most, and and it forces them to endure poorer living standards. So overall, the measures taken to prevent the gentrification are really damaging to neighborhoods and to their residents, and frequently have really severe consequences given to the city more widely. While we await this, and what we heard from TVSA on this placement, we think these harms have significantly outweighed this placement of harms for three reasons. First, in terms of the number of people affected, the's number of people affected by city or district where rent controls fall is far higher than people affected by displacement in the last six years. Two, there's really easy ways to mitigate home displacement, you'll see alternative housing, where the government can't make barter push to restore a house to its original value. Three, renters that are displaced haven't stayed in their back house to go where they live, and they're much more flexible, where it's no ordered to sell their opportunity, their house value plummet, suffer significantly more. Before I move on to the second argument, I'm going to speak on these few items. Under your own argumentation here, all you're really doing is taking the most marginalized, vulnerable populations and putting them in a house elsewhere. You don't solve the group of these problems. Okay, so we think that when you're talking about gender and age, and I'm about to talk about this, is to help the services improve,"

              "text": "So on to the second argument. The main contention of this argument is that to get a mechanism, lots of residents in the private areas from significant quality of life increases that can help with the general population. So the movement welcomes people into the private areas, it's three main benefits for residents in the area. So firstly, house prices rise. So, the area becomes more desirable and attractive. Real estate values rise, along with housing prices. So, working class homeowners are now far wealthier because they don't own a house that's potentially worth tens if not hundreds of thousands of euros. They can choose to sell and use that money to live somewhere nicer than their original neighborhood, but they can't just have more money to spend on what they want, which is quite a good thing. Two, public services increase. So So, gentrifiers are obviously like, slightly wealthier than the existing demographics and they can move away into. Which means there's like a bigger tax base, so people can work with and do improved services in that area. But also gentrifiers just have more political capital, so local governments tend to be happier to work with like, work with the full wealth for wider demographics, which is what gentrifiers tend to be. Point. So improvements, media improvements, public services, which is what gender priorities tend to be. So improvements in media and public services, improvements in high-speed broadband, public transport. The inter-public community, which is really important for developing communities and helping people fight employment. But three, economic efficiency, personally, and service. So as gender priorities move in, new businesses move along with them to make advantage of the school's low income now available in that way too. That means there's increased jobs for existing residents, because now new businesses have to hire as first, or the resus or other those who work for them. That's a significant benefit to residents of those communities. And as well, people with more disposable income moving into an area is really good for the local businesses, because then they get more to involve, and their money is then reinvested back into the community. This helps keep people within the community, it also just gives them more money, which is quite a good thing. By blocking gentrification in any way, setting propositions blocks a neighbourhood and its residents from financial and service-based improvements that they sorely need, a serious consequence for its inhabitants. So to protect more rural residents, and to prevent huge and extensive harm to the physical, you must support the government. Thank you. Thank you. and we're going toing on the one line about"

              "text": "What, then, is the comparative in this round? Opposition wants to say we have to defend a world in which there is no investment into these communities. They warrant this by saying there's no political capital. Two responses here. First, gentrification isn't the only way to get political capital. Even if wealthy people aren't moving into cities, those cities still have an incentive to improve things like crime and poverty because it hurts the reputation of the entire city. For example, Paris developed socially mixed housing, which was affordable housing that improved the surrounding neighborhood without causing gentrification. In Washington, D.C., $550 million were invested into the poor neighborhood of Berry Farms, looking to upgrade the metro station, create safe walking-through affairs, and affordable housing to bring opportunity to existing residents. This is investment without gentrification. But then they say there's no funds for this. If that's true, their own model fails too, where they say they want to build affordable housing. They're going to have to pick one. Then, what's the next question is to be? What is better for these people economically? What does opposition one give you? Basically they say our model of limitations on supply is bad because it forces landlords to sell. Two responses here. First, why do these landlords build more supply in the first place? Because they are guaranteed by the government to cash out on those increased profits, meaning it proves to the fact that rents are going to increase. Secondly, we look on our side of the house to compare it as more supply, the difference is a 50-story building with 50 luxury units versus a 50-story building with 150 affordable housing units. Lastly, we would say you would not need rent controls in the event that gentrification were not occurring because rents would not be rising. Meaning all of their harms exist in a world in which gentrification is not to actively prevent it. Those measures exist when gentrification does. Then they say renters are displaced because landlords are forced to sell because now they have economic incentive to do so. Let's look on the comparative. On their side of the house, every single renter has the incentive to sell because now a luxury developer is going to bid out their profit for more than three times what it is now. At their best case scenario, on our side of the house, maybe one or two renters sell their property because they no longer see those high margins. Their side is comparatively worse. Then they say there are two specific benefits. First is rising housing prices, so people can sell their property. Two problems here. First, that only benefits people who actually own their property. We say in the vast majority of cases, if they are so economically disadvantaged, they're going to rent, because they can't afford things like mortgages and loans. Rather, they just pay month to month. For example, in New York, 70% of people who live in New York rent. Secondly, this doesn't increase value in property taxes, doesn't actually lead to money in people's pockets because it's super liquid. You don't get this money until you cash out and sell your house. Meaning, in order to access their benefits, they have to displace people. Then they say there's going to be different public services. I'll respond to this in a minute. What was out of common material? Unabused, specific analysis is how it will lead to rising rents because landlords can capitalize on luxury people. They said in response that gentrifiers have different demands. Exactly. Why? It exactly proves analysis is going to increase cost of living because now there is a new consumer base that businesses can charge more for. Secondly, even if they win political capital, this shows that people just live in separate buildings, meaning all of the political capital goes to fixing the pipes to the new buildings and none of the existing ones. I'll take a point of information on that one. Once wealthy individuals are discouraged from moving into low-income areas, where do they choose to live instead? Where they already live in affluent existing areas. We say gentrification is a model in which you encourage"

At that point, the process of gentrification is one in which the government is actively promoting the idea that people must be displaced. Moreover, unduly, that people have a positive right to a home, which is more than just the affordable shelters, they say, on their side of the house. Rather, even if you take them to their highest ground, if displacement occurs, people get moved outside of the city, but it's unresponsive to Hung's analysis, where she tells you that a home is more than just four walls and a roof, their model. A home is the community in which you live, the ties in which you have, and the people in which you interact with. On that note, I will move into our third substantive argument. Our third substantive argument is that individuals have a right to culture and community control, which necessitates government prevention of gentrification. In local communities, subcultures develop that serve to protect people and give their lives meaning. They rely on key institutions that require local engagement. Think things like churches, school organizations, and cultural organizations. Preservation of these subcultures is essential for two key reasons. First, they allow people to care and protect for the most vulnerable people left behind in the state. People use cultural institutions to pool together resources and provide services like free daycare for each other's children, healthcare for the sick and elderly, and a refuge for the homeless. But secondly, and more tangibly, subcultures create political advocacy and political mobilization. In Harlem, for example, churches are safe spaces for black individuals to organize advocacy against police brutality. Given a history of marginalization that opposition proves, political organization is one of the only ways to protect themselves. This mobilization is the prerequisite to the economic investments that they want on their side of the house. Gentrification destroys subcultures in two ways."

Live entertainment industry was their major source of income, but new gentrifying residents encouraged the police to stop the music because it was too loud. When the Romani protested, the gentrifiers had the police beat the musicians, destroy their instruments, and abolish the industry as a whole.

Community organizations get hollowed out as people move to unfamiliar communities. Making it impossible to rejoin these cultural institutions. And vocab is one of the surviving historical enclaves of proud of hard-fired resistance. That culture is unique to the place in which they reside.

We think that in the long-term, private investors, when they're allowed to undergo the process of gentrification, they're more likely to take a risk on affordable housing. They've managed to build up a safe network of housing in a low income community already. They know that's the work of our investments. So they're more likely to take a risk on affordable housing. You can think actually for the people who are not displaced, all the benefits that many events have reached in reverse speech still very much stand and benefit those people there. They have this idea, this claim that we get that businesses won't move away and be replaced by other ones.

And we think that actually, as I'm going to move on to talk about, we get less segregation on our side of the house. So, TVRSA accepted in a key line that people still want to live in nice areas, that they still have this desire. But actually, when there's no longer the option of living in inner cities and areas that are gentrified, they instead move out to the suburbs of the city, which means that you get divides. You get people living out with cities and suburbs who increased stereotyping and stigma because those living in suburbs are not exposed to these diverse communities. So they're relying on their own ideas, the media, etc. of these others. And this is split along income lines, but also ethnic lines as those from ethnic minorities are more likely to live in these current areas. This has two major impacts. First of all, those in suburbs then use these stereotypes to inform their ideology of the city of Bainville. It informs the way they vote. It informs who they hire. It informs where they send their children to school. What is more important, stereotyping certain individuals who are not having a quality of life, who are not displaced, and worse living in a community that did not grow up there? We think that the harms of individuals being stereotyped are absolutely massive because when these people who are forming these stereotypes choose their incomes are more likely to be in positions of power and decision making, and they're the ones who decide about policies in the city, we think it's extremely harmful when their perception comes from these stereotypes. We think that's what leads to policies of over-pricing certain areas when you do not interact with these people. Secondly, we think it also perpetuates the narrative that certain areas are being run down or dangerous. We get less private investment into these areas because they're seen as higher risk. We get less footfall of people going into these areas and we don't think that is an area which is particularly good to live in. But furthermore, we also get severe economic impacts on this. When tax revenue moves outside of city boundaries into these suburbs, that means there's less revenue for city halls to invest back in. And where city budgets are squeezed, the ones who lose out the most are those on low incomes because they do not have the political capital to complain about the fact that they have less services, which is worse for lower income risk, which is exactly what Team USA want to prevent. Even if this well can be absorbed, wealthy suburbs are narrowly focused on their own issues because they're so separate, so they're more likely to look for lower taxes. And if they do look for public services, they are not the ones to benefit more than the communities. They're not likely to lobby for lower taxes. And if they do lobby for public services, they're not the ones that benefit low-income communities. They're not going to lobby for better public transport when they drive. So what does this mean? Because of these economic impacts, that even if this motion does effectively prevent the process of gentrification, the government has a reduced ability to actually help those in low-income communities. Because its income is reduced, because it has moved out with city boundaries, or because those outside city boundaries do not want that going to most people in low incomes. Preventing the process of gentrification when it creates these losses and creates cities is extremely harmful and something we cannot stand for."

We go on to our first substantive, which is our opposition's third substantive, which is how gentrification creates safe spaces for these individuals, because now they're decreasing the amount of stereotypes that happen here. A few lines of reply. We say, first, this entire argument is predicated on the assumption that the people who are ultimately marginalized and most vulnerable actually are able to stay within these communities. This argument does not access any of this, it cannot be accessed because they fail to truly engage with the fact that displacement uniquely happens in a world where you allow potentialification to occur. That really means that truly these stereotypes will continue to occur because all that changed is that there's now an affluent individual living in a once marginalized population. The second is that it actually worsens these elements of cultures and stereotypes on their side of the house. Why is this the case? Because it's unique to how gentrification operates. If it's true on their side of the house that individuals have this desire to be surrounded by culture, then the thing that happens is not me trying to sit down with my neighbor and truly understand the background and the history of their race or where their economic background came from, but rather just tokenizing certain elements of their culture. So say in, look to what happens in Harlem, New York, where in new niche coffee shops there's pictures of black art, but I certainly am not going to watch a large amount of police crackdown because those individuals will still believe those stereotypes but want to tokenize that culture for the benefits that come from it. We don't think that this is a true engagement with benefits that come from the plan of defection for gentrification. Now onto the first question in today's debate. What does gentrification create displacement? Note, it's not enough for opposition to get up here and say that, well, it's just simply not our burden to support the legal things. Because under the world of gentrification, when you're not actively preventing it under a government, all of the elements that encourage displacement to happen for marginalized communities is legal. This happens on your side of the house. It was a rather dismissive response for them to do that. But in fact, we've carried down the bench a lot of analysis as to why this isn't true. Just empirically speaking, it's two times more likely that individuals will be displaced in a gentrified area than in one that is not. But even if you don't want to buy into statistics or studies, there's two mechanisms that were very much unaddressed by side opposition. First was on rising rents. Note this engages with the stakeholders that make up the majority of individuals within gentrifying communities. When they say that a lot of people own homes in New York, they're actually not truly giving you analysis here. Because out of the New York City, 70% of the population lives in rented communities. That means that when my rent increases, I will need to be at harm because of gentrification. There is no way to offset the cost of increased rent for luxury apartments. Why is this the case? Two crucial characterizations that need to be engaged. The first is that gentrification is a very, very rapid process, which means that the increase of my rent, the increase in prices at the stores around me, happen immediately. But my ability to find a job, even in their best-case scenario, happens gradually. So I still am shut out because I have no ability to be able to offset these types of costs. But secondly, under a characterization of employment, where they literally say for Bainham, it's much, much easier to find employment. But that's an assertion at best. We tell you, we need to question what the quality of that employment truly is. It's often times that very, very few corporations that have a plethora of resources to be able to tell you the same narrative that you're replaceable. That means that you get things like part-time loopholes, bad hours, poor treatment, and no ability to be able to maintain a sustainable form of life. We say, prefer local businesses. These get shut out when big corporations come in because they simply cannot compete. But local businesses reinvest within their community when they aren't threatened by gentrification, something that corporations uniquely do not do. Moreover, they do ensure that there's higher wages because there's that cultural connection and understanding of the community that they are tied to. Second mechanism is the cost of living, which engages with their discussion of homeowners. At their best, I sell my home for a price that was once a little bit higher than what I bought it for. But I don't get any of the benefits that they talk about where I have this extra revenue to be able to better my life. No, because now the money that I made from that home has to go to, one, buying a new home, enduring moving costs, commuting to a job that was once five minutes away from me, or looking for some sort of life support because the recreational center or church that once babysat my kids today has now gone for a new niche coffee shop. These are all the harms that come that offset any form of being able to maintain a sustainable form of life. Before I get into why this matters though, Why don't low-income small business owners benefit from a larger number of wealthier customers? We say they oftentimes don't because those affluent individuals would rather shop at a Whole Foods than some mom-and-pop shop. The community that was once residing there, the marginalized and vulnerable, recognized the importance of the mom and pop shop rather than the individuals that simply choose to move in and want to go to whatever they were once accustomed to from their life of privilege. We think, moreover, the reason why this argument is so important and why this matters so much in today's debate is because if you buy into any of the economic benefits that come from side opposition inside the House, it's inaccessible to the people that need it the most."

Let's expand upon what was given to you in our third substantive, because it didn't get quite enough engagement. Luke told you that the strength of culture is uniquely weakened when populations are now dispersed or placed in communities where they're unable to truly be able to be recognized. We think our side of the house would tell you that it doesn't get better for individuals because they're now homeowners, that's a faulty assumption, and it's oftentimes the affluent individuals that continue to create very, very problematic policies for these individuals. Those were not substantial amounts of analysis. Here's why this will matter over all of the economic benefits that they told you as to why this weighs out. We tell you that culture is built around the location uniquely. When it comes to public health issues in my community, I rely on the culture and the community that's residing in it to be able to better it. I rely on the historical landmarks that looks like the Saluk in Turkey or Karpatlan in Europe. We think these individuals ultimately rely on the place that they reside in to be able to benefit themselves. They rely on the ability of having the people that were once in that community to be able to better them. Culture can never be brought back together once it's completely dispersed and destroyed. Economies can always bounce back. That's why you prefer our side of the house. Very proud to propose. Thank you."

Firstly, we refuse to let TVSA put us in a box. We tell you we don't necessarily have to support the worst landlords on the planet, and the worst planning boards on the planet, and the worst landlords on the planet, and that we can probably support some kind of tenant rights, some kind of housing association benefits, some kind of housing subsidy on our side of the house.

Same kinds of people, kinds of people that are going into gentrifying England, no, are not necessarily the kinds of people who kinds of people that are going into gentrifying England.

But thirdly, displacement occurs much more on their side perhaps, because what happens when landlords know that they are going to get much less rent is that they sell their properties because they're not providing the same source of income they have. Even if rent is just kept low as a result of their own being low income residents in those communities, that means you have reduced housing stock. That means that you have much more evictions on behalf of landlords trying to get people out because instead of trying to rent it to a more high income owner, they just want to sell it. But also, you get much worse maintenance of those properties. You're probably not going to have the heating of the property. You're probably not gonna have the heating of the property. You're probably gonna have people put much more into a room. Your community is starting to break down, even in their best-case scenario. What was their response to our rental stocking houses? They told us that we only mentioned rent controls. Firstly, we didn't. We told them that the same house supplies at the point at which any policy means that you're not expected to receive a lower rental income. If you're trying to prevent rents from rising, you have a policy which prevents rents from rising, ISD income, in an end, will definitely receive less rents as a result of that. But also, if you think they shirk their burden, you refuse to defend rent control. So if you look at any city that's trying to prevent gentrification, Paris, Berlin, they had to implement rent control as a method of realistically prevention and gentrification. Yes, London's our fault because two USA refusers have had to act on those levels."

You think that different clientele, that these new businesses are displaced from the network, are not useful for local rates of business. Four responses to this. Firstly, we don't think that businesses don't serve multiple kinds of consumers at once. We just challenge their assets to the point of moving into gentrified neighbourhoods. They might be moving into a Turkish area of Berlin, because they kind of like the character of that community, maybe they wanted to go to the local Turkish porn store and start buying milk and cigarettes. That means you probably have some degree of mutual overlap, because you don't get quite the same extent of gentrification. But also, we don't think all the new businesses that move in are entirely useless to the residents. If you're a bank or a post office or any of those other kinds of things, that's probably quite good for you as a resident, even if you're on a low income and you're still able to use that. Thirdly, we think if you have displacement without gentrification on their side of the point in which those businesses start to leave because income residents are starting to leave because of the stagnation in that community. Fourthly, even in their worst case scenario, there's still a lot of unemployment. Even if Walmart moves in, there's still more jobs in that community than were there under the status quo compared to stagnation. We'll happily defend that as a preference between the mortgage and gross stagnation. I'll take it to your line. You've refused to engage with our analysis about displacement. Sure, banks are useful, but it doesn't matter if the people who live in that community were displaced. I did not engage with the analysis about displacement when I told you that you get much more displacement when you integrate a very disastrous policy that as a result means that landlords sell all their housing stock and force people into a small number of homes meaning you get much more evictions. We also think that probably you're willing to accept that there's a degree of displacement that means you have much more economical opportunities in the city in general."

Their only response was to say that the same stereotyping analysis doesn't really happen because people move in and they don't get to travel to each other. Firstly, we don't think their response to the stereotyping analysis is sufficient, on the point that they don't really engage in the fact that the kinds of cities that tend to be more integrated tend to have better racial relations, and also the fact that specifically, mainly, this is a no-go area, by putting in their protection status by the government. But also, they never responded to the biggest impact to this point, which is that when wealthy people move out of city limits, they no longer commute taxes to City Hall, and that government is less able to provide basic services to those living in the communities. When they live in cities entirely divorced from those communities, they vote for policies in their local elections which actively hurt those particular individuals. We asked how great it was that there was a low-income resident in New York in 1979 when the city filed for bankruptcy and had to double subway fares overnight. We don't think they adequately engaged.

This means revenue from ticket sales and merchandise would be reinvested back into the team instead of going into owners' private pockets. Secondly, residents of the city and in the surrounding area of a team's place of origin would be able to buy shares in the team's stock. We would also support a cap on shares to make sure that no one person or small group of people are able to have a disproportionate number of shares and disproportionate power. Our third point under this is that citizens who buy stock under our model would have voting rights over major long-term team decisions. This looks like moving locations, upgrading stadiums, ticket prices, and elections on new leadership. What this voting power does not include, however, are day-to-day sports management questions, like which players to draft or what plays to make. We think team managers and coaches hired by the board of directors would still have authority over actual competition. These look like teams like FC Barcelona and the Green Bay Packers."

              "text": "is that on principle sports teams are public goods that should be controlled by communities. Our first point under this is that sports teams provide significant social benefits, but they still impose social costs and thus warrant community control. In general, when something is extremely important and its use imposes significant costs on individuals, we prefer things like government ownership because we want elected representatives rather than private actors to decide how to absorb or distribute those costs. This is why we have governments and non-corporations set tax rates, for example. Similarly, many private sports teams have a massive impact on the public, but the individuals in the community do not always consent to the costs that are associated with it. Stadiums and fields, for example, take up a lot of space, and the construction and location of these venues displaces residents to a large degree. For example, to build Tottenham Hotspur football stadium, many local homes would have to be demolished and displaced in order to make that happen. We think communities are much better placed to make decisions about these trade-offs with minimal impact to residents and businesses compared to private actors. Second point under this argument, because sports teams have a unique role in identity formation, they should be publicly owned. Sports shape social culture in a multitude of ways. First, the sports club serves as a point of congregation and a clear sense of identity for the community. People of all genders, races, education levels, religious backgrounds are all able to come together over sports, like we saw in Zagreb with the Croatian football team. Secondly, we think clubs enhance rivalries which create loyalties within communities both within each other and loyalties to the team. Third, organizations like sports are unique in that they are powerful in shaping communal identity and they claim to represent the community so they should be accountable to the community when they're doing these actions. We don't think one fringe billionaire should be able to have all of the control. Otherwise, individuals are simply governed by private interests and not themselves."

              "text": "Our second argument is that community ownership better protects community resources and promotes community relations. But first... If sports is so integral to the community, then why historically have most community teams been sold off voluntarily? We think that this is not necessarily the heart of this debate, We're simply saying that community ownership is a good thing. We think there are wide factors that perhaps you could explain to us. We think communities have a very direct tie to the teams and this incentive would not exist on our side of the house. Our second argument explains this further, about how community ownership preserves local resources for the community. Private teams are well known for extorting cities for money. Billionaires and owners have very little loyalty to a particular city because they don't have to care about the city to get money out of them. It's because owners know they can get whatever they want by threatening to leave. This looks like cities being forced to give up stadium subsidies that are much higher than the cost of education within their cities without community consent. This also looks like things like favorable tax breaks to teams as well. We saw this happen in New York, for example. Direct and indirect subsidies to three major New York stadiums, Yankee Stadium, Citi Field, and the Barclays Center cost $867 million, while universal pre-K in the city would have only costed roughly $500 million. When these decisions about prioritizing sports over things like education are made by private actors, we think that harms the community much more. We think community-owned teams have a unique obligation to conserve public resources and they're thus more likely to balance support for sports versus other priorities like community well-being. Ultimately, when cities don't capitulate to owners demands, they lose the teams after spending millions of dollars on them. This looks like the Brooklyn Dodgers moving to LA, Clyde Bank FC moving to Wakefield, and the Sydney Swans moving to South Melbourne. We are principally opposed to that on our side of the house. Our second point under this is that local ownership of teams builds social capital and strengthens the community network. We think community-owned teams are much more likely to devote their resources to community efforts, like funding youth outreach programs, for example. It's because these teams are governed by local community members who directly benefit from these policies, so they are more likely to want community outreach as the incentive as to why they want to do this. This looks like FC Barcelona's Football Net program, which teaches kids about teamwork and perseverance through sports it reaches over 30,000 kids in Catalonia alone and especially low income individuals and it's all free of charge compare that to Arsenal sports camp which would cost you $1,600 a week and that money goes into the hands of"

              "text": "point under this argument is that community ownership results in a greater buy-in to sports themselves. The community is much more likely to do things like volunteer for teams because they've literally invested in the team. We think the buy-in is empirically larger for community-owned teams like we see with the Green Bay Packers, for example. We see volunteers are very willing to work in sessions to the point where they're also willing to shovel snow in freezing temperatures to help out the team. It is this devotion to the team that we think is unique to community ownership because they're the ones that have this connection that private teams don't because owners don't make the effort to connect with the community. In contrast, the Dallas Cowboys are a privately owned team. And if the owner, Jerry Jones, asked for volunteers volunteers he'd be laughed at because the people know that the volunteer work they do only saves Jerry Jones a little bit of money and doesn't go back into the community. We think that additionally ticket prices are much more likely to become decreased on our side of the house. It's because private investors are profit motivated so they run sports like a business. This increases ticket price, this means increased ticket prices and selling elite luxury boxes for money. In contrast, community members have voting power, and they want to attend sporting games. So they have an incentive to keep ticket prices low and make games as accessible as possible to the large majority of the community. We think that sports have value because they foster civil society. They create networks of people that foster cooperation, common understanding, and the fulfillment of the human need for interaction. Thus, we are very proud to propose. I now welcome the first speaker."

One, why our policy is necessary to even have a sizeable sports industry and two, why corporations are more effective at keeping sports competitive. My second speaker will engage with the best case scenario side proposition where even if they can prove these two things are available on their side, why they increase rapid inequality and worse competitiveness. They have, in terms of rebuttal, they gave you two main ideas. Firstly, this principled idea about the public good of sports and secondly the last two arguments can be reduced to the idea about how private corporations know exploit communities while community ownership benefits."

You can have a public good and still earn profit as well. We see this in things like electricity, which is clearly a public good. But many countries privatize electricity because they realize they can serve that public good while at the same time doing it more efficiently. That's what my arguments will show you. But even if they can show you some social costs, there are enormous social benefits, like the tourism, like the merchandising, like the increased publicity of your city. But we think they're pretty inconsistent because they're capping shares anyway, so their whole democratic principle is slightly undermined at the point when they're not actually including the whole community. And furthermore, no thank you, we think their view of fans is too parochial. FC Barcelona, Arsenal, the Green Bay Packers have global backing. We think they reduce the incentive of these people, no thank you, to cater to the global community. Lastly, in terms of harms, look, there's a social license to operate that most teams need to respond to because it affects the viability of the team. When the local people don't support them if they hurt them. That's their entire principal case dealt with. The second and third arguments, no thank you, is about exploitation of communities and subsidies to sports. We think this is an example of arguing by example. They've shown you singular instances, but not showing that this is systemically true. We show you that structurally, no thank you, there is very little incentive to do these abuses because people are likely to lose profit by the anger because people no longer buy. We give you the example of the Minnesota Timberwolves because when the Lakers left Minneapolis, the Minnesota Timberwolves came in. This shows you they don't have the same grip they want to talk to you about. No thanks. Their last argument was about social outreach. I will rebut this all throughout my case. It will be completely integrated. Moving on to my first argument about why this is necessary."

Four points of analysis here. No. First, corporations or rich people have excess money to invest and are in it for the long haul, as opposed to teams who respond to short-term incentives, so in short losses like in the past, they sold off these teams anyway. Secondly, in terms of financial hardship or recession, these corporations, no thank you, or rich individuals, have better ability to access credit or bridge loans because of their reputation with banks. No. Thirdly, this is also directly responsive to their idea about how individuals will volunteer. We think individuals will deprioritize sports if recession or financial hardships means they have to prioritize other aspects of their life, and they will cut their losses. We have similar examples. In 2016, in the English Premier League, seven clubs ran a loss which was cross-subsidized by profits from other industries that their owners had. What is going to happen on their side? We don't think they can reasonably expect people to take money out of their pension funds, their health insurance costs, and other costs they have to fund sports teams. Or in basketball in 2008, when the Detroit Pistons or the Cleveland Cavaliers reached the Eastern Conference Finals, even if those cities were hard to seek by recession, because on our side, corporate owners were able to fund the money to be off this. We think if they want to have a principle about the integrity of sport, no thank you, the sustainability of the sport is most important in this debate. We think these three layers already show why it's less sustainable because the potential money is redirected to other things that people need to prioritize. This hurts the team but also creates a vicious cycle of deprioritization because at this point where the teams start performing worse, there is less incentive for these volunteers to buy into that team and buy into that identity scheme. So if that's the thing they wanted to put out in terms of social outreach, that hurts them as well. Are the comparative corporations have safety nets or investors come to save the teams? That doesn't happen on their side, no thank you. Those three layers already show you why their side is not sustainable. But preemptively we want to make a distinction between things like sponsors and owners, because we recognize that side proposition can claim things like sponsors as well. The first thing we say is that owners invest stimulus money in the team whereas sponsors do not. This stimulus money is important in times where you need to do things like renovation"

We simply do not think that this is true. We tell you that when owners do sink a ton of money into the team, it is not for the express purpose of operating at a loss. And in fact, it is not those individual owners that incur the cost of their teams running at a loss. We tell you it is actually two actors that do that. First, these teams push the cost of their team running a loss onto actual governments by extorting cities for stadium subsidies when they're running a loss, when they're not making enough money, as we tell you on our side of the house. Second, let's just be clear. The debt that these private owners take on, they do not take on themselves. They take on that debt in the name of the team. So when Manchester United, owned by the rich Glazer family, takes on $660 million of debt, they are free to escape that debt by selling off the shares of Manchester United. The team is then left with that debt. These are not benevolent owners willing to take on massive losses in the name of owning a sports team. We don't really think that makes a whole ton of sense. These are owners looking to own, you know, glamorous sports teams and are willing to push all of those costs back onto the community. To them, sports is a business.

We told you that sports teams are fundamentally incredibly important to communities and often impose really strong involuntary costs and shape community identity. They told you a few responses to this. They first told you that we have some public goods like electricity owned by private actors. We don't think that's a good thing. We do not think that a private entity should be able, principally, to control all of the electricity in a city without any kind of community or government ownership. But even if you do think that privatization of electricity is a good thing, I don't know the last time that there were marches in the street rallying entire identities allowing the electrical infrastructure of a country. In contrast, just that last week, as we told you, over a quarter million people in the city of Zagreb rallied around the community sports team as a center point of their identity. We don't think that one fringe billionaire or corporation should be able to control these kinds of dialogues. We'll explain more about this in our third argument as well. Otherwise, if one fringe billionaire or corporation should be able to control these kinds of dialogues. We'll explain more about this in our third argument as well.

Yeah we think that FC Barcelona can't have many global fans but we tell you those fans are not the ones that are uprooted when a stadium demolishes their house. They're not the one that that team claims to represent the identities of and we do think that local fans are the most important. But they furthermore told you fans don't have the right to own these teams because fans are really bad at making decisions, they're super racist, and that enhances rivalries. We told you that to the extent that rivalries exist, say, between a Hindu team and a Muslim team, those rivalries are going to exist on either side of the house in a world of public or private ownership. We think that representation of those teams and encouraging more diversity of thought is much more likely on our side of the house when we have a lot of members of the community involved in these sports teams, not literally sometimes one individual or corporation shaping the entire narrative.

We told you, again, at the top of our case, that when these owners juicing a ton of money into the team, it's often not their own money. It's public money, and they don't take on the debt themselves. But we second tell you that actually shareholder sustainability is way, way better on our side of the house, because when people buy shares in a team, it's not a loan to the team that it then has to pay back. It's a direct investment. They told you that not all communities are going to be able to afford this. Well, take the example of AFC Wimbledon, a club in London, where the price of a share is £25 for an adult and £10 for a senior or a student. We don't think this is a ridiculous amount of money to spend. But even so, when fans are really, really dedicated to sports teams and are already taking on a lot of costs to, say, buy tickets and things like that, we don't think that these kinds of costs are ridiculous to take on. And furthermore, 7 out of the 8 most successful teams in the confederation of African football, not known for ridiculously wealthy communities, are community-owned.

When the team is privately owned, that is actually less likely to happen. We think that people who have already made an investment to the team even through bad times. When the team is privately owned, that is actually less likely to happen. We think that people who have already made an investment to the team and have already bought in, as we told you in our argumentation, are more likely to support the team and it's actually going to be more likely to be successful on our side of the house. We actually tell you that in many cases, privately owned teams that are really, really struggling and almost going bankrupt often convert to community ownership, like with the Green Bay Packers, who were struggling to get by in the 60s and then sold off shares and became one of the most successful teams in the U.S. Now introducing our third substantive argument about how we better protect teams themselves is directly engages with a lot of their material.

Overwhelmingly white owners of sports teams extorting athletes of color, putting them in really physically laborious situations and then casting them aside, versus community-owned teams that actually care about them and are much more likely to protect their own well-being. But furthermore, we think that owners are structurally unrepresentative of communities and teams at the point where it costs millions and millions of dollars to own a sports team. This looks like the 15 of the 15 richest football owners in the UK, one being a woman. This looks like things like 32 all-white NFL owners telling African-American players, you can't kneel on the field and protest a police brutality or we're going to fine you. We think that's wrong. Our second idea under this is that community ownership ensures teams actually benefit from the financial resources they create. As per our model, community-owned teams are non-profit, meaning 100% of their profit goes back to the team. What does this mean? Both types of team can do things to increase revenue,"

Firstly, right, they tell you that owners will always be exploitative and they give us a gross caricature of all owners, simply saying they don't care about their communities, they're awful people and we shouldn't make them richer. We don't think it analyzed what are the incentives that come with profit because we don't think profit is such a terrible incentive after all. We think they have to give structural reasons as to why owners will never care, owners are going to be disgusting and owners will always be abusive. First sub-level of rebuttal here then. They tell you with regard to community resources, right? We're going to uproot people from their homes, we're going to take people out of school, and we're going to make sure that as owners, we can't be incredibly abusive. Firstly, we think there's already incentive not to do that. Because if people from that community are always going to hate you because you take away things that are important to them, then you lose your fans. You lose important fan bases that will provide you ticket sales, that will wash your games. In these instances, we think there are all the extreme disincentives for that to happen. But B, even in the worst case, we think there are abilities for communities to resist. We don't think owners own all the resources to that community. And in the instance, for example, when the Seattle Supersonics could not provide a team with a stadium that was necessary, the team left. They didn't force anyone to give them a stadium, no thank you."

And because the community, they talk about things like ticket prices and the ability for people to exercise, the ability for people to have charities and things like that. Our first response there is again, there's incentive to do that because you want a growing fan base. But B. Even in the worst case, for example, the tickets do rise, I have two responses to that. Firstly, we don't think it's likely because you respond to supply and demand. If to the point the tickets are inaccessible, then you want to lower those prices because you want people to go to your stadium. But B, we think in the point that they do rise, we think that they do not calculate the cost of what a team may mean. So rising ticket prices might mean we have to pay for more player equipment. Rising ticket prices might mean we have to pay for our players' salaries. And if their goal is to be competitive as well, that cannot happen if we have a clouded view as to what that means. But last response onto this. They tell you they will have more diversity, ignoring our response. We think on either side, right? We can have racism, we can have discrimination, and that is regrettable. But what are the best disincentives to counter this? Communities can still be racist. We think a team like Chelsea, which hated a lot of their African American players, and wanted Sam, their Israeli manager, even if he did well, because he was Israeli. But the sole disincent incentive on our side is capitalism and the ability for you to profit because these players might be skilled even if you might not be biased against them. Because you want to earn money Chelsea kept their manager. Chelsea kept a lot of their African-American players."

If this is a non-profit, what's the incentive to invest? Are people literally just going to give right out of their pockets with no return on that investment? That's confusing for them. We don't think that's likely to happen because people will always care more about the other needs they have. It is best for a community to offset those costs to a rich billionaire or a rich conglomerate of companies. No thank you. But B, they tell you the money is always going to go back into the team. Firstly, we think with the amount of money we have, there's still incentive for money to go back on the team. Why? Because if you want the team to be successful, you don't keep all of that in your pocket. You want better players. You want better facilities, better medical equipment, better coaches, better stadiums. Because the amount for that profit to increase gets greater the more you put back into that team.

I want to examine their best case and show you what it leads to high levels of inequality and total competitiveness. We think that, as my first speaker discussed, there are many costs that members of communities must consider. Healthcare, food, transportation, education. Be positive communities have different levels of capacity to account for this. Richer communities will always have the ability, for example, to afford both these essentials and non-essentials like sport. But for poorer communities, when those costs rise, it is incredibly difficult for you to give up sending your kids to school for your team to exist. We think that this creates a disparity in funding between teams dependent on their circumstance. Why is this harmful? In two ways. We think funding is important for the ability for teams to gather talent and competitiveness. The two ways are here. First, with regard to trading and attracting players, with regard to the incentives people have to join a team and the talent they can bring. We think the ability for you to pay higher salaries, larger contracts, means that you always have more tools and capital available to incentivize strong players. We think that is often why in community-owned leagues, for example, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona can afford the Messi's and Ronaldo's of the world but other teams cannot. We think in the process of negotiation with these players, virtual communities will always have the upper hand because they have more leverage. But B, when finding talent through means like scouting, my partner expounded upon, in comparison, right? Scouting is incredibly expensive. You have to look at your younger 12 division. You have to go out of community and look for more players. The costs are immense, and we think richer communities will likely be more able to afford those costs then. So assuming that both teams will always exist on either side, why is that harmful? No thank you. We think the purpose of sport is to be able to vicariously celebrate human excellence through sports teams. It is the ability to build solidarity with those teams. Firstly, they have to tell us why that's not possible, because even if national teams, in our worst case, were privately owned, people would still love the Croatian national team because they were excellent. I don't see why public ownership changes any of that. We think, firstly, right, for poor communities, the ability to represent and witness human excellence is harmed. Communities lose interest over time when teams are uncompetitive, when they lose a lot and they're no longer entertaining. We think instead of human excellence, they witness defeat and incompetence, and that is bad for people who are burdened by their own circumstance. There is loss of association to those teams if that is your main value. But B, with regard to simple opportunity, we think the opportunities which necessitate good performance, like international clubs with qualifiers, like basketball tournaments which need for you to reach the playoff, post-seasons that measures high levels of play, you even lose the opportunity to represent because you are chained by the circumstance that is given to you."

They measure wealth, riches, and privilege. On our side, however, we think we can equalize that playing field because you can offset those costs to a rich Pakistani billionaire like the Jacksonville Jaguars. We think it is far more equal on our side, because they're not dependent on circumstance. They're dependent on the ability, for example, of rich corporations, and we think even if there's inequality, it is largely much more minimal on our side than theirs.

And they basically say that for communities that aren't able to afford a sports team, they can't compete, they can't be equal to other communities that are able to afford them. We don't think that every community needs a sports team. That's something that we told you in the first proposition speech. But second of all, we think that even if, like, you say the community should have a sports team, we think in poor communities where they aren't likely to invest in shares anyway, they ought to prioritize other things. Like promoting public infrastructure investment, like healthcare. They say trade-offs are so harmful, take them at their highest ground. Even if trade-offs do exist because communities have to prioritize their own interests, we still think that, principally, communities ought to be the ones able to make that choice. And communities are the ones who want to say, well, we want to prioritize healthcare, we want to prioritize investment in education, we want to prioritize hospital infrastructure or whatnot. We think that they should have the right to make that choice and not be forced to pay more taxes and pay more money that they receive little investment on in return from private individuals just because they might demand more money on a threat to leave the community altogether. We think that at the end of the day, our side is principally ahead, which leads me directly into the first flashpoint, which side is actually ahead principally."

              "text": "Now I'm going to tell you one big principled argument that basically public goods can be owned privately and that cap and shares undermines our principle. I'll respond to both of those independently. First, they tell you that public goods can be owned privately. First of all, we think that that's not necessarily true. But they tell you that a lot of utilities are owned by private companies. Just look at water infrastructure, for example. I don't think the city of Zagreb contracts out a bunch of water infrastructure to private companies. They still have oversight and regulation of all this utility infrastructure, so we still think that ownership by communities is still principally just. But even if you do believe that public goods can be privately owned, we still think it's a bad thing. For something that's such an important hallmark of a community's identity, for something that imposes involuntary costs on you, yeah, we think it's important that it be community-owned. By extension, what is the analysis that Shoyoshi gives to you that they don't really engage with? We told you that what's unique about sports teams when they are owned by private individuals is that they're more likely to impose involuntary costs on the community. Why? Because it's not like I am asked by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in my hometown of Dallas if I want to pay taxes to go towards financing the stadium. He just takes our taxpayer dollars and uses it anyway. We think that you need to have communities in charge of owning the team in order for them to make the tangible decision if they want to pay in the first place. It's the same reason why we have governments regulate taxes. We don't want private individuals imposing all these involuntary costs like taxes on you, so why would we allow private ownership under their world, and sports teams, when they impose involuntary costs, do the very same? We would not support that. But then, what do we tell you on our side of the house? We don't just tell you that they impose significant involuntary costs, they're a hallmark of social identity. Why is this important? Because what we tell you is that impose significant involuntary costs. They're a hallmark of social identity. Why is this important? Because what we tell you is that not only is social identity incredibly important and is a reason in and of itself to invest in community-owned sports teams, we think that honestly increases community buy-in."

The biggest argument that they had is that, well, people don't have an incentive to invest in sports teams because just people just don't care about it in some cases or do not have the resources to do so. We think that we have two responses. First of all, we think that's factually not true. We think there are a lot of interests that communities have in sports teams. Why? That's the analysis we gave between our principal as to how sports teams are a hallmark of social identity. We think that at the point where they are a hallmark of social identity and so important to communities, we think that individuals, and especially fans who are dedicated to the team, are likely to invest in it. Once. Before I go on, I'll take a point. But if identity is so important that it's contingent on these teams being sustainable, at that point doesn't your principle become largely reducible to the effects of sustainability? We don't think that identity is contingent on a team's success or sustainability, but I'll address both of those in this Clash Point. Let's talk about the idea of team sustainability. They tell you that team sustainability is the most important thing to consider in the round. We gave you two responses. First of all, community interests will always trump the interests of the team and the private individual. Why? There are more people in the community. They are the ones who are directly impacted by the social costs. Very easy to respond to. But second reason why we think that team sustainability isn't the most important thing is because we think that community interests oftentimes prioritize the interests of the community in a way that private individuals won't. We think that individuals don't think that the end-all be-all of like living in a community is having a sports team to rally around. Yeah, it might be a good thing, but other more basic necessities that communities ought to control and have the decision to trade off with should trump those concerns."

We tell you that uniquely on our side of the house, we have the ability to equity finance. And what does that mean? Communities are able to sell shares of stock in order to draw necessary capital in order to reinvest in the team. That's the comparative that we drew with their side when they talk about private individuals and corporations. They tell you that, well, all these similar financing mechanisms can still exist, like sponsorship deals. But the distinction is all the profit that they gain on their side of the house goes to the owner. The only response is, well, the owner can still try to invest in the team, but what incentive do they have to do that? Their interest, as we pointed out, is to invest in themselves and create a bigger profit, but we don't think that they have an incentive to necessarily invest in the team"

But we think that if it were so unpopular, why would we think that extortion still exists? We think extortion happens because community owners can get away with it. Why? Because they're not the ones who bear the brunt of the cost if they laden communities with a lot of debt. Why? Because we think that in a world where private individuals like we saw with Manchester United take on like 600 million pounds in debt, why do we think that's such a problem? We think they push those debts onto the consumer, extort the communities for all the money they have, and when the communities aren't able to cough up the money, they just leave and go to other cities. We saw that in the United States with Los Angeles. At the point where we think that on our side, we not just principally uphold the purpose of sports and the value of sports, but because we also protect teams and by extension communities, we are proud to propose.

We tell you that it is unlikely that private owners will do this, but even if they do, these are a minute set of cases, but on your side, because it's very difficult to operate a sporting team, you will always, no thank you, have to incur these kinds of costs. But moreover, if you listen to their analysis, they said this, right? People will give in because they want to be able to keep the team within their community. That they're willing to sacrifice things like healthcare if it means that the team is able to stay. What does it tell you? No thank you. This tells you that the team existing is something that is extremely important to these communities, but on your side, you're taking those away, especially when coming from first and second, we told you that it's extremely expensive. It's very difficult for them to be able to offset these kinds of costs. We have to be very clear.

They didn't improve structurally, but that exists in the majority of cases. But we also say we allow communities to own teams on our side. That was in our model.

They said they exploit communities through involuntary costs and there's a social outreach problem. We gave you several responses to the involuntary costs. Despite the only things they're giving us were examples, we told you there's a capacity to resist costs. We give you the core logic about why this is not a likely thing to happen even if there are individual instances of abuse. We told you how the Seattle government was able to resist this oppression. We told you how the Minnesota Timberwolves were able to come in even after the Lakers left. That is systemically true. But the response we also gave you coming from the top is on your side, even if communities give the cost, they're always going to shirker the debt burden. So even in our worst case scenario, it's still better on your side. Note that it was the worst case scenario. There was no engagement with the idea that in the best case scenario in our world, it's much better than in their world because they reduce the competitiveness of teams. But in terms of the response to our several layers of sustainability and several layers of effective, we got two things. People will donate because they like the team and they have sponsors. Well the first response we gave you, coming from First Speaker, is that people will prioritize. The Third Speaker agreed that people will prioritize things, so if there's right in healthcare costs, if there's a financial recession, only corporate owners will be able to fight these teams. And coming in at second and third, they also brought up this idea of sponsors, but we preempted it at First Speaker showing you the difference between sponsors and owners, in terms of stimulus money, why sponsors only follow big teams, or individual players. No response to like the several layers of analysis coming from first speaker. Lastly, about social outreach. You realize that this case was dropped after first speaker because he effectively rebutted it, saying that there's an incentive to do this social outreach, for example, to do youth camps in many countries. A scouting and talent attraction that keeps these sports entertaining and keep them sustainable to the core of the identity. But that's only the worst case scenario. There was no response from a second speaker, because he said even if everything they said is true, even if sports are always sustainable, we think in that world there is still a problem, because when you create this rampant inequality, something that was not responded to, you worsen the ability of teams or communities to associate with that team. We're not saying you have to win. We're not saying you always have to place. But what we're saying is being competitive is what creates the spirit. Being competitive is what created the spirit. Being competitive is what created the spirit around the Croatian team. Being competitive is what kept that identity going.

We told you that things like shares in AFC Wimbledon are only 25 pounds that is absolutely accessible to these low-income communities. And furthermore, low-income communities can absolutely engage in things like sponsorship deals to get more capital. Note that the Green Bay Packers, one of the most successful football clubs in the United States, has an annual average income $17,000 less than the median in the United States has an annual average income $17,000 less than the median in the United States. We told you in the second speech unengaged with seven out of the eight most successful teams in the Confederation for African Football are in fact community owned. It is absolutely sustainable for a lot of members of the community to take on the massive cost. We don't need one super massively wealthy individual to shoulder these costs. At worst, at worst, these teams are moderately less successful and moderately less well-off. But we tell you the comparative is this, a world where billionaires control that team and are able to extort those communities for resources. I'll talk more about this in the second question. But we also told you that it is often from second speech, and this was not engaged with on their side of the house, that it is not often these billionaires who are in fact investing money into teams that they say on their side of the house in a private world often operate at a loss. Those billionaires aren't taking on those costs themselves. They're taking on that debt in the name of that team and in fact doing things like getting more dollars from the government when things like ticket sales in poorer communities aren't making the money that they need on their side of the house. We tell you that it is much more sustainable, at worst, teams are equally sustainable on both sides of the house. We actually think that teams are less sustainable on their side of the house that literally takes out every single piece of offense that they have in this round. But now let's move on to what we think is more important in this round. Who is most important for communities? Their response here is where all of their sustainability arguments and telling us that owners are benevolent. We told you in the Kiel speech that fans often don't pay attention to the bureaucratic mechanisms going on with their teams. And even if they are, often when I grow up watching a sports team, I'm still going to go to games even if a new stadium is displacing a lot of my neighbors. But even if teams do lose support, what are they going to do? Exactly what side opposition tells you that teams do in these instances. They leave communities behind. Communities that have invested millions of dollars into this. We tell you, they also told you, that we force communities to choose between things like health care and supporting the team, meaning that when the community is struggling it is going to invest in health care. Yes, absolutely, we think this is great because the comparative is a billionaire out of touch with the community making that choice for them,"

We told you in our first speech that there is a power imbalance between these actors at the point where billionaires, often not even from communities, don't have any incentives to see these communities thrive. They just want the best facilities for their players. They just want the most success and wealth for their teams. That is not something that is going to happen on our side of the house at the point where we're willing, we're willing to sacrifice the quality of some states in the Green Bay Packers stadium so that we don't see millions of people displaced with their homes demolished. That is what happens on their side of the house. That is why the opposition takes today's round."

Two, we see a conflict, I'll take your point in at the end of this argument, we see a conflict of interest between the managers and workers. Their rights clash with the policies of the company so we might see bias that is much less present with industrial unions which overall provide a fairer solution to representing workers' rights. Also three, it's unclear what the checks and balances are with workplace unions to ensure that the company actually listens to the rights of workers. Whereas in industrial change, we see change that is more likely to be implemented for the rights of most workers. And four, we see conflict between companies' objectives and the workplace unions, because companies will want profits and therefore we believe that wages will might will be less likely to arise.

There are lots of different sectors within a company. So we see workers, cleaners and many different people. And they belong to different industries, but they exclusively have different problems. The issues that can arise from this, if they're blended together, are significant. I'll explain this now. Industrial unions are better set up to deal with the issues of the workers. In a workplace union, specific areas of the job make up a minority, so it's unlikely that issues may be taken seriously due to limited resources of workplace unions, and it's more efficient for them to focus on the majority within a company. We find it preferable that industrial unions represent all. Within industrial unions, no thank you, they create forums for specific minorities within an industry, like I said, to unite under different factions so they have a stronger voice and make it more likely for issues to be dealt with. And this actually pressures the government to make change because any disruption within the industry is important to the government as it could cause economic disruptions and therefore the government has an incentive to intervene to act in the best interest of the individuals and the economy so it's more likely that the government will listen to these issues and additionally the government versus company we're going to additionally with the government versus the company we see um we're going to explain who's the better actor to initiate change it's the obligation of the government to incentivize to protect its citizens um as this has positive feedback connection with trade unions. So it's more likely to enact change and also personally detached from the workers. So it will not be held back by biases. And this versus the company who is more likely to be profit orientated, whilst workers are the core of the company, it's ultimately the incentive to make more money. And so it's more likely for conflicts of interest to occur between companies so therefore industrial unions as a whole provide a more weighed balance to implement meaningful change that positively affects the lives of the workforce and this in itself provides a more sustainable future for Industries as a whole. Proud to propose. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker, for the five remarks. I now invite the first speaker from side opposition. All right. Am I audible? Yes, you are."

But I want them to clarify in their next speech what industrial-level change actually means, because their entire case is very unclear. What kind of change occurs? Are they lobbying the government for legislative change or are they working with different companies? I think side proposition needs to clarify this.

The first argument that they make is that people are less likely to share their ideas and complaints. I don't think this is true. This is significantly worse on their side of the house, because when you have an industry-wide union, there's so much bureaucracy. Thank you. So if I'm a small worker, it's much less likely that my concern will be heard in an industry of thousands upon thousands of workers versus just my simple workplace. So if people have grievances, those grievances are much more likely to be communicated within a smaller workplace than in a broad industry. Secondly, they make this claim about how like minorities are going to stand to benefit. I don't think this is true. I think on their side of the house, minorities are less likely to have their voices heard and have less leverage. Because, for example, if we take, for example, like the steelworking industry within the United States, this is a white-dominated industry, but there are specific places in the United States, like Alabama or like Georgia, where there's primarily Black workplaces. Those workplaces on our side of the house can get specific changes to deal with things like harassment and racism. But on their side of the house, they have to go up to the white heads that run the industrial union and get support from them. That was significantly less likely than them working within their own workplaces and creating changes and different things like that. Their last idea was how they're going to pour resources and get different people working together. I'm going to respond to this within my own material. With"

              "text": "that in mind, our first substantive argument is that we increase the effectiveness of unions. The thesis of this argument is that in a workplace, unions are better able to galvanize support from workers and accomplish their demands. The first layer of this argument is how we increase support. I want to note that people are reluctant to join unions for several reasons. A, because of the obligation of time. B, because of the dues of unions and different fees. C, because in society there's general union stigma, and D, there's a hierarchy that exists that deters people from joining unions. That is very important because in order for people to join unions, they need to know that their concerns are going to be met and they have to have a guarantee that there's going to be returns and tangible benefits from them joining the unions. There are three reasons why we get people to buy in and join unions on our side of the house. Number one, recruitment is significantly easier on our side of the house. It is more likely that you're going to join a union if it's someone that's in your workplace, i.e. a co-worker or someone that you trust that is coming and recruiting you, rather than someone that's like an external marketing agent from the larger industrial union. Secondly, on our side of the house, we get much more specific messaging. People within the union are speaking to your specific issues as opposed to broad industry problems. So if, for example, you work for a manufacturing plant and the biggest concern is safety, you don't want to hear about hours and different things like that. You want to hear about safety. So messaging on our side of the house is more persuasive and more compelling because it's specific to the workplace. Finally, I think it's because you're more likely to see change quickly. When you have workplace unions, you're more likely to see immediate returns. This is number one, because like I said before, there's less red tape and bureaucracy that exists. But finally, for change to happen on their side of the house, there's to be large levels of buy-in i.e workers across different companies have to come together and agree that a problem is an issue strike for that problem or lobby for that problem for that to be solved that requires far more work than our side of the house so if people are more likely to see returns at a faster pace they were more likely to stay within the union at that point we not only get better recruitment but people stay in the unions on our side of the"

If you have different perspectives, it's better for you to work in your specific workplace and get those demands accomplished rather than competing with 5,000 other people who have different interests than you to get something accomplished. That was the collective action problem on your side of the house. Second layer is how we improve the bargaining process. Companies are more likely to comply on our side of the house because the demands that unions make are specific to the workforce. The problem with an industry-wide union is that companies have different capacities. That is to say that a company like Starbucks that has billions of dollars in profits has less of an ability to support their workers than a smaller mom-and-pop coffee shop, right? So you can't implement a one-size-fits-all solution for all companies. Why is this harmful? Number one, you get to erase the bottom on their side of the house, which means that for you to get industry-wide standards, you need to dilute the demands to make sure that companies get buy-in. That is even the lowest denominator of companies. Even if on our side of the house, we don't get the lowest denominator, at least the majority of people get better benefits, get comprehensive changes in wages and working conditions, while on their side of the house, they dilute changes. Secondly, on their side of the house, if they want to get more aggressive changes, they have to have longer extended strikes. And this is incredibly damaging because the longer strikes go, the less income people are getting, the less capable people are to pay for things like rent and pay for things like food. This means that people realize that the cost of joining a union is too high and they're less likely to join the union."

              "text": "Second substantive is how we get better representation for workers. Even if we assume that buy-in is symmetric, workplace unions are more effective at improving working conditions for specific issues that companies face. First of all, I want to note that different companies experience different issues. So for example, like Starbucks had a massive harassment and secrecy problem. Amazon had an issue of safety concerns and people working very long hours. That is to say that different companies within individual industries have different problems that affect them. The problem is that these specific issues are unlikely to be resolved of the union at large in the industrial union, because the only way that the industrial union gets something accomplished is if there's broad base support from all workers. So while on their side of the house, they may get some base level working conditions accomplished, the more specific issues that people face, like harassments that's occurring, or racism, or issues of oppression that are occurring in the workplace, those specific issues don't get resolved on their side of the house. Why were we likely to get representative solutions for workers? There were three reasons. A, it's because workers have an established, known relationship with the company administration that they collectively bargained against. Secondly, it's because there was less internal gridlock within the union because there's simply less people. On their side of the house, you're more likely to see competing interests and fracturing where different people have different concerns, which means that no one is able to agree on actual solutions. And finally, on our side of the house, you got more reliably engaged members. They're more likely to participate in strikes, and they know that those strikes are going to directly benefit them. For those reasons, not only do we get more benefits, more union strength on our side of the house, but we get representative solutions as well very proud to oppose I'm the speaker for Defiant remarks I now invite the second speaker"

However, on the other hand, we tell you that workers from the same industry is very likely for them to have similar interests and similar things that they want to argue for because they are experiencing the same industrial problems problems um for example miners in the past they were experiencing uh poor and poor working environment and those kind of stuff so therefore we believe that uh the interest there would not be competing interest so therefore there"

              "text": "would not be a trade-off in efficiency now moving on to my uh substantive on how it increased the work efficiency of the workforce. So why is that? There are four ways of how we see this happening. First, we see that there's less repetitive work in the industry because A, we do not need different people in different places to work really hard for the same change to occur. We tell that, for example, construction workers who fight for a higher salary if they are in an industrial union and we tell that so therefore less human resources are needed to negotiate for the same change and second reason um we tell that industrial industrial union is sort of like a melting pot because when people when industrial unions industrial unions contain more people than workforce union you have people from a more diverse background so you have different points of views and perspective on things so therefore you have more ideas of change so we have this intelligence of the majority that we can solve the most urgent issues in this industry and that is the most important thing uh in this debate and we tell tell that because there are more people, there are more suggestions on how this change could be most effectively made. So therefore we also get efficiency of the workforce. The third way of how efficiency will be happening, we see that workers in an industrial union will be a greater in number, right? We see that the workers are more centralized on our side. So therefore, they're stronger, they're more powerful. So therefore, it is harder for the companies to ignore their demands. It's easier for change because there's more that they can do. An example could be the railway strike in the UK. We see that when the whole industry are coordinating to stop working, the pressure that they give the government is incredibly detrimental. It could cause the whole society to stop functioning. So therefore, the demands could be made with quick changes because of the power that they could do. And onto the fourth reason of why with this increased efficiency of workforce, we tell that we gain long-term sustainability because we tell that when there are less repetitive work within the company and the workplace union, workers come and go. So it's very likely for the companies to refer back to their original habits because it's more convenient and more cost efficient. However, if you're doing an industrial change, this change would be permanent. So therefore we don't need people to continue fighting for the same rights or policies every time. So before I move on to"

I want to remind you that Ben asked this question in OV1 and still with no response. All they say is it's like big structural changes. For example, better labor standards, increased wages. Yes, but like by who? Is this government policy? Are you lobbying elected politicians? Are you trying to get people out to the polls? Or are you now trying to work and have like every single CEO of major companies agree to the exact same workplace policies? I don't understand the logistics of this they need to engage with that second then is they tell you that like in this last speech that they're going to be able to access like both types of union i want to specific specify what the term to prefer means right when workers choose on which union to join they are going to choose workplace ones meaning that over time industrial unions are inevitably going to decline as workplace ones increase in prominence, ultimately meaning you are going to have far fewer, if any."

              "text": "Given that, first question in today's round on who mobilizes and organizes unions the best. Why is this question so important in today's round and generally when trying to improve better workplace standards? Because you literally need the collective in order to have collective bargaining. Having people actually show up and be willing to join unions and be able to organize specific things like strikes to put pressures on company is the only way that unions actually achieve anything. Whether it is a union, a workplace union, or an industry union, that is just like how they all function. This means that whoever wins this question is able to access the prerequisite to just like unions in general, why do we do this better? Why do we get more mobilization and resources? For two reasons. Number one, we tell you that unions are always going to be a lot smaller. This leads to a few things. One, a lot easier recruitment. Second, it is easier to communicate with one another. Third, it is less bureaucratic. Fourth, it is regionally aligned in a lot of cases rather than being like spread out over the country. And five, this makes coordination a lot easier. I want to point out that this directly engages with their arguments about the unions being centralized and more efficient on their side of the house. This proposition is just practically impossible. It is always going to be harder to try to negotiate and organize and mobilize hundreds of thousands of people that do not even have the same employer that are not usually based in the same part of the country i know just like so many more of them in order to create things like massive amounts of strikes that is why industry strikes are so rare compared to workplace strikes because just think about it like it is easy to walk up to the person whose cubicle is next to you and tell them like, oh, you should join a union or send out like an email blast to people that you know personally in order to do something like organize a strike. This is not something that happens with an industry union when you have hundreds of thousands of people, which inevitably creates a very complex bureaucracy, making organization very difficult. We told you this in the post speech, they literally didn't engage with any of the analysis. I think this is a major strategic flaw on their part second reason why is because we think that you are inherently more representative no but they tell you they say that unions are like a company has too many sectors a workplace union does not demonstrate like the interest of specific types of employees first we think that this is untrue workplace unions tend to be pretty tailored to specific types of employees. But second, at their highest ground, people with different jobs in the same company probably have more similar issues than people that share the same job title technically, but work under completely different systems of leadership and authority issues, right? If racism and sexism is an issue between one specific company, it doesn't matter whether you're an analyst or whether you're a coder, you are still going to face those issues. I think that's a lot more likely than like a coder on one end of the country who works for one company having the exact same issues as a coder on the other end of the country. The impact of this is quite clear, right? Workers now see their personal issues being spoken to, especially when it comes down to like demographic differences that are always going to exist when you're dealing with things like geographical differences. The impact here is quite clear, right? People are willing to join. They are willing to do things like pay massive amounts of dues every year. They're willing to go on strike and risk losing money. They need to know that they are going to be heard, that they are going to see a return in order to do that, because being in a union is always going to require a massive amount of sacrifice. They never engage with this. In what world are people going to be willing to spend thousands of dollars in union dues, be willing to give up? They give up getting like they're getting their salary in order to protest for rights that they're not even sure they're represented in."

Number one, we just think that this is unlikely to happen because industry leverage is a lot harder. We noted that it's very likely you're going to see like an industry-wide strike. They never engaged with this. But let's take them at their highest ground, say that they're able to mobilize. Why is all of their policy going to be quite bad? Because they are never going to be specific enough. Note that they claim that this is all based on assumptions. This ignores all of the analysis that then tells you what. We think that companies are always going to have different problems and to different degrees. Amazon has a lot of prime day concerns over how people are treated when there is a lot of work over those 48 hours, whereas people who work at Target tend to have concerns over like what is acceptable customer interactions. Just because they both work in the same area and the same factories does not necessarily mean that they have the same problems. But second, let's take them at their highest ground, that unions are willing to pay attention to specific companies, meaning that this means specific problems. That means that that's a lot of specific issues you are dealing with. It is inevitably going to receive a lot less attention and a lot less investment on their side of the house because unions simply cannot afford to invest themselves fully in every single small problem that all companies have. This doesn't happen in union problems because that's all they're focused for. Second is that companies have different capabilities, right? What Starbucks can afford to do is different from what your local coffee chain can afford to do. On opposition, they have to go for the lowest common denominator because it's industry-wide, meaning that one, people don't get all the benefits they possibly could get, which means that the conditions are worse than they could be for workers on our side. But second, and a lot worse, is a lot of really specific issues get overlooked because they don't represent very broad ones. Industry-wide problems can exist in workplaces. In that case, workplace unions can address them. But when there are workplace-specific issues, industry unions are unable to deal with. That's the comparative they have to engage with third sub then on societal harms thesis here is it's really bad for the economy when entire industries go on strike because even if conditions in some companies increase the entire industry as a whole has to strike meaning that nationally they're going to be shut down for weeks this happens to the most severe degree because oftentimes best policy is considered that you can't like fire striking employees meaning that they're going to lose out on entire sectors of the economy all businesses are going to stop like producing and distributing for weeks and months on end this is really bad because they are eventually not even striking for a cause because some people have gotten what they already need this is light and detrimental for the economy at large because it's ruining companies that employ thousands of people all of this feeling anti-union sentiment as it takes an incredibly detrimental toll on the economy as a whole making it harder to get things done in the"

And secondly, on how they think that it's less likely for minorities to have their voices heard. Our response towards their first statement is that we don't think it's true. We tell you that individuals are less likely to be seen as whistleblowers on our side of the house due to the fact that there is like a small amount of people in the workplace in the workplace it is more likely for the workers to be targeted by the managerial people within the company as there is a very direct and obvious conflict of interest and whereas for like industrial what like for industry-wide standards to be achieved usually only on our side of house usually only the leaders of the industrial unions need to act as a representative to negotiate for the rights of workers on their behalf. And it's less likely for the people who, for people to actually need the confidence to negotiate face to face with their bosses, and for them to actually worry about maybe getting sacked from their job because of the fact that they're going against their bosses being involved in this workplace union. And it's less likely for people to face discrimination in the workplace on our side of the house, which is why we think that it's very untrue that they say that people are able to reflect their views more on their side of the house. And with regards to their second statement on how minorities are less likely to have their voices heard, we tell you that it is more likely for them to have their voices heard, as we have proven to you in analysis that it is likely for minorities to actually express their opinion in industrial unions, because a lot of times they're able to act like rather anonymously compared to like in their side of the house, and thus it's less likely for them to be discriminated against, as I've mentioned previously just now. They then told us that they have better representation for workers on their side of the house as workers in different companies have different problems. And they don't think we should use like this one size fit all policy. Firstly, we don't think it's true that workers in different companies have different problems. Sorry, is that a point? Yeah, I'll take it. On our side of the house, we still have lobbying against governments that's symmetric. But on your side of the house, you have to do strikes, sort of like tell the entire, like a lot of companies all at once, they must change their practices or you strike forever.

And for example, it is likely for companies in the same industry to also be facing the same problems, for example, like safety standards, because we think that companies usually follow legislation outlined by the government. And if these legislations are not updated, it's likely that the policies are not updated for these companies as well so we think that it's very likely that they face the same problems and even if we assume that workers may have different problems we think that this only applies to the minority of cases which in the in that case we think that they can turn to these workplace unions for help but for the majority of problems we think that it is likely for the industrial unions to actually be able to achieve better rights for everyone. And we think that it's very unlikely we have to dilute the wants of workers on our side of the house, as we think that industrial unions have more centralized power, and the actions of the union can impact the running of the whole industry as a whole. Thus, we think that in order to achieve a goal, it's more likely for industrial unions to stand firm on their ground to fight for what they want, as they have more support from workers and they do not have to fear backlash from individual companies if the problem is legitimate. Due to the fact that the work of these industrial unions are actually public or publicized, we think that it is more likely for these issues to gain public support to actually pressurize companies or pressurize the government to change industry standards, whereas on their side of the house, it's more likely that they will actually have to dilute the wants of workers as companies are less likely to actually negotiate fully with workers due to clashing objectives they have. For example, profit maximizing, which we have already outlined clearly in our first speaker, and the fact that managers of these companies ultimately have more power over these workers, and thus on their side of the house, they achieve less for the rights of workers. And we think that we win this clash because firstly, we prove to you why it's unlikely for workers' rights to be achieved on their side. And basically, we think that this is the most important clash because we think that the workers are the main stakeholders within this debate, and we do the best for them. Moving on to the next clash on the efficiency of the workplace, our second speaker then told you very clearly why change occurring on our side is more sustainable and why industrial unions can increase the efficiency of the workforce in a few ways. And opposition, how they responded was that they said that coordination or like organization it's easier on easier on on their side and it's less likely that we can do things on our side but we firstly uh regarding our response we don't think you need to communicate everything in the same place we think it can occur online we don't think um like negative sentiment throughout the industry need to occur in the same place and needs to be as coordinated as they think they need to be. And secondly, we think the industrial unions tend to have a better structure within as they're set up for a longer period of time, whereas it's usually the structure within these workplace unions are messier because they're less people and it's less likely that people are actually that engaged in setting up a very good structure for these workplace unions. And then they tell us about like how they have better effectiveness of unions because they think that people are reluctant to join unions on our side of the house due to time and union stigma. We think that it's the same on their side of the house, and we think that it's the same that they need to use time to join unions. And they on their side of the house, they even face more stigma, as i mentioned previously on how they it's likely for people to get discriminated therefore we're very"

First, I think there was a massive stance change in the last speech of the proposition where they say, no, our side of the house is lobbying directly against governments, whereas opposition is against companies. Here's the idea. First of all, we don't think this is the scenario in the first place, right? We think both sides of the house are addressing companies or largely as a whole think both sides of the house are addressing companies or largely as a whole. Our side of the house addresses specific companies directly. Their side of the house addresses the group as a collective. But if it is true that their side of the house is truly like effectively a special interest group, where these groups like lobby the government and they do it all collectively with the house scenario. This is the worst case scenario because it is so much less likely that a government who is balancing every economic incentive of like, and every interest that a voter has Sarah alone the fact that every worker is not the same and they have different incentives down the line. Their best case scenario is when the government creates minor change in the least common, or in the issue that is the least common denominator among every worker. We say that it's not only what workers want the least, it's probably way unlikely to happen. Secondly, a proposition repeats down the bench that they can have both on their side of the house. Here's the problem. In a prefers debate, this is about inciters in which workers and people are choosing between the two, which they prefers we choose. We say we would rather have less industry-wide unions in favor of more specific unions because that addresses people's specific lives better."

              "text": "With that, three clashes in the round. The first clash is on the broad strength of unions. I want to note this is the single most important impact of the round. This is because unions are reliant on worker participation. If we prove we get less people, less people on proposition side of the house that are interested in joining a union, regardless of what kind of union it is, we win the round, because we have more unions on our side of the house, regardless of what form they take. Notably, this was framing we gave you from the one it never got engaged with. What did we say? We said workers are extremely skeptical of joining unions because of the time, financial costs, and just general fear that they will be retaliated against for making that choice, right? In the status quo, the biggest stigma against unions right now is the idea that they're bureaucratic and undemocratic, and that workers are effectively wasting their money for a response they will never get in return. we say the status quo stigma is only perpetuated in proposition side of the house when they say we wait and we hope that we participate in a really really large union and hope that eventually the issue that is most important for us actually comes to the table becomes the central issue for the union we say this is unlikely but even if it's likely to happen, we say no worker believes the like, believes like is an agreement about what is the single most important issue. So we say we give each union worker exactly what they want, whereas their side of the house like relies on the idea of all of them sort of believing the same way and having the same rights on this down the bench. The second thing we said is our third substantive argument that got no engagement, right? We said there's massive public backlash to industry-wide strikes because they affect the economy far more directly and far more widely than a company-wide strike. No economy is reliant on one company, maybe outside of Amazon, but I even think that is kind of unlikely. Whereas if industry-wide strikes occur, I think entire economies are least effective in the short term. For example, if all of Japan's automation workers strike, I think that would be a really, really massive problem for every citizen there. Whereas if Toyota strikes, I don't think they would care nearly as much. Why does this matter? One, obviously there's an economic impact that affects people that had no real impact on the reason why problems exist in the first place. But second, it drains long-term buy-in and the bargaining power of unions. If the public is against unions, they feel like they're disruptive to society and make it harder for them to feed their families, right? All of this is a reason why unions have less political capital to do all the government buying the proposition once and also get all the members that are necessary to achieve any union action at all. Third, even if participation isn't lower on their side of the house, it is still that like energy to participate in actual things like strikes or collective bargaining is, right? So even if they still get people, they're still paying the dues and like technically call themselves a member of the union, they're less likely to strike, which means the actual like leverage behind any action that a union does ultimately goes away what is the impact of this is that workers lose their biggest advocate in the status quo exploitation is on the rise and jobs are ultimately more dangerous and more exploited than they were before we need unions more than ever we need to combat the idea they're undemocratic so workers feel they're why places for them to put their time and money into on their side of the house we both agree unions are important only our side sustains the impact of unions long term. Before I move on, I'll take your point. How are companies incentivized to actually negotiate with workers if they face no pressure at all on your side of the house? Effectively, a union has one big leverage, is that if people work for the company and can decide not to work for the company at any time. That is a strike. On their side of the house,"

On our side, we say company-wide strikes are more likely to occur and are more effective because those are actually the workers that are affecting in the first place. Second clashashes on representation. We gave you three arguments. I think only one of them was really redressed, which is the idea of like, there are not really that many issues that every specific union or company faces differently. We say, fine. Even if this is true, there are still varying degrees to which each worker experiences these issues. So every worker might be generally concerned with things like safety and also their pay, some might be way more concerned with their safety compared to pay in the first place because they feel like that is a far more tangible threat to their lives. On their side of the house, they ask workers to pull their resources and then say, pick one of the two to fight for at a mass level. We say this is unfair and likely just not responsive to a worker's need on an individual level. So we get better prioritization that affects workers on an individual level. Secondly, though, the unity the workers feel is far more likely to continue on our side of the house. Workers are just more similar to each other when they're fighting against the same company. Decisions against collective action will be more representative of a much, much larger group on our side of the house. Why does this matter? Importantly, I think the way that they never addressed was that industry-wide problems are also company-wide problems. We address industry-wide problems, maybe not the same order, but they ultimately get addressed. But company-wide problems are not likely to be industry-wide problems, at least not all the time. We address both. They only address one. They never engage with that. Lastly, on effectiveness, we just think they're less likely to strike and sustain a strike in Proposition's world. It is harder to mobilize and get enough group support to do this. A worker has to feel that the issue affects them. Their company is particularly egregious on that issue, and they have to have faith in the long-term effectiveness of a strike to participate in it and to participate in it in a long-term manner. We do not think this is likely. Second of all, we said recruitment and messaging get way worse on their side of the house because the issues are broad. They're the least common denominator. On our side of the house, it's the issue that matters to a person the most, which is most likely to get them to join. It's most likely to get them to be a participatory and active member we say a union is only as strong as its members we motivate its members to stay and motivate them to be active very proud to stand in the opposition"

As Cam told you, the industry-wide problems that they talk about would be solved in either world. If everyone agreed that an issue was a problem, they could always lobby their union or strike to create change at the company-wide. The problem is the company specific issues never get resolved on their side of the house. The harassment issues, the diversity issues that are specific to a company never get the broad-based support across the industry to actually get solved.

We tell that the problem exists first and this is common for all workers because more or less they have, they are facing the same thing and they would more or less they want to increase wage to reduce working hours to have more welfare but then in my speech i've provided you four reasons why it is more efficient in the industrials in an industrial union to get to get to get the change because first it's a less repetitive work done by uh by the by the workers and secondly there's more intelligence on how the change can be best made and thirdly on why is this more powerful with greater people and how it could exert pressure on the government and fourthly how it could have a long-term sustainability having this new standards within the industry and how it would raise the and raise the a barrier of entry within the industry we had no response from that and then they continue to say that if the workers are coordinating and they continue to say that the workers are actually coordinating then they are afraid that the people, okay, sorry.

We said that our stance has not changed from the beginning. I've told you from the beginning that the government is a better actor for initiating change because the government has the obligation to protect the rights of their workers. And we tell that versus companies which were profit driven, it is more likely for the government to have better motivation to create meaningful change within the workforce. Interestingly, that also means that we'll get better collective actions and put pressure to the government. But then they start to worry that this scale of destruction is bad to the economy and because that the workers don't want to be seen as destructive, they wouldn't want to join. However, we see this as ridiculous because putting pressure on the government is a good thing because they're finally the workers are able to express their dissatisfaction and then which is the dissatisfaction, which is the whole purpose of the union. And they can finally make changes. On the other hand, what I've told you from the first point of the first speech, that there's ultimate conflict between and dependence between the workers and their bosses. So therefore, the workers will feel pressured to make comments. So we get no reply from that other than the shallow one-liner that they could always strike. So therefore, even presuming the best case from side proposition, we see that the workers will be better on our side. Thank you."

              "text": "Two constructive arguments in this speech. First, that global carbon markets most effectively reduce emissions that cause climate change. And secondly, that a global carbon market is the most economically feasible and optimal for the vast majority. But before that, a model. We would implement a global carbon market or a cap-and-trade system where a set amount of carbon permits are capped and are distributed to firms who either use their permits to emit or sell their permits to earn revenue. Four things to note. One, the cap will always be lower than the existing carbon emissions level, which is currently 40 billion tons of carbon. So each year, the cap will decrease based on carbon reduction goals, which are set at reducing emissions by 45% in 2030 and 0% in 2050. This means that there will be gradually less permits every year. But two, the permits will be distributed proportionate to the size of the company, its market share, and the average carbon emissions in that industry to account for the industries that have higher carbon reliance. So public auditing of the amounts of permits per firm will be done to prevent things like corruption. But three, companies are free to use or sell their permits to other firms that may need additional permits. So if ever any firm goes beyond the emissions that their permit allows, they will either have to buy permits or they will be fined per ton of carbon that exceeds the price of permits. But four, the UNEP will be the broker of this global market since they can establish global environmental standards. So to reliably discern what to base the permits on, they will collaborate with organizations that have decades worth of research, i.e. VERA and the gold standard, and there will be heavy fines in the instance that a company breaches their carbon limit. What are the alternatives, Dan, that opposition may support? We think one, governments imposing a fixed carbon tax, or two, the status quo where individual countries set up and regulate their own regional and national carbon markets such as the EU, China, California market. They have to support one alternative because both of these are incompatible as prices are fixed by a tax or fluctuate depending on how many permits are created. But before that, I'll take a POI. If the carbon credits that exist in the market are constantly going to be lowered, how exactly do companies actually profit from this model if you're not actually going to be able to sell the"

              "text": "that threatens billions. And the only way to save this is to ensure a predictable global reduction in carbon. Three reasons why this is true. Firstly, we guarantee reductions in emissions through efficient allocation of permits. So through permit trading, industries that can easily transition away from emissions are given the capital to do so by selling their permits to other industries. This is additional revenue that can also be used to acquire greener technology. So for instance, coal-fired power plants, which generate 40% of the world's electricity, are able to cut down emissions by investing in cheap carbon dioxide scubbers, which absorb emissions. In their world, carbon taxes and other similar programs reduce the capacity of industries to cut emissions because they cannot afford the technology. Plus, industries like power plants resort to decreasing output rather than reducing carbon significantly via abatement technology. On either side, companies such as Chevron or BP will be able to pay for carbon pricing due to large profit margins and inflexible demand. On our side, we assure that thousands of other firms can sell their permits to afford green technology, maximally reduce emissions, all while making a profit. But secondly, we create better innovation in green technology. In our model, we incentivize firms to be less reliant on practices with higher carbon emissions because the cost of permits increase and there are heavy monetary fines for breaching the carbon limit. So this creates an incentive to innovate new greener alternatives so firms don't pay exorbitant cost for permits and so they can earn from its sale. So firms now have more incentive to overhaul machinery or halt policies that are heavy in carbon. So we push companies like ExxonMobil to further invest in innovations such as renewable diesel. In their world, innovation is largely spurred by governments as revenue goes to states as opposed to firms. And this is less preferable for two reasons. One, governments are prone to corruption, especially if officials have interest in specific industries. In Malaysia, the government was accused of granting $200 million worth of hydropower contracts to companies linked to a minister. But two, even if corruption, I'll take you after this, doesn't occur, government subsidized individual firms for a greater return of investment. So these firms are shielded from competition and are more prone to mismanagement. So in 2009, Obama subsidized Solyndra, a solar panel company, only for it to file bankruptcy two years later due to gross mismanagement. In our world, mismanagement becomes a massive loss in revenue and competition forces firms to innovate better green tech. But thirdly, we prevent carbon leakage. In their world, national or regional programs incentivize companies to move manufacturing to areas with less regulation to save costs. So a firm in Germany can move production to North Africa to escape costs. Comparatively, a global carbon market ensures that firms cannot displace their emissions to other countries with weaker regulation. We protect developing countries from environmental destruction. On our side, we reduce emissions in a predictable and a collective manner and we ensure greater forms of green innovation. I'll take your POI now. Why would technological companies share green technology and innovation with other states? That would mean that other states are less dependent on buying carbon credits"

But you have to be comparative and listen to our case on why places like governments are likely to be more susceptible to corruption and a lack of innovation. On our second argument then, that a global carbon market is the most economically feasible and optimal for the vast majority. We want to frame this. In the status quo, the environment is important, but economic costs to people, i.e. the loss of jobs or high prices, are also important. So if we can prove that this policy best balances these interests, this mitigates a massive harm. And there are two reasons why we are able to do that. Firstly, we ensure flexibility during times of economic crisis. So during recessions, industrial outputs and emissions fall due to less purchasing power. This drives down the permits due to greater supply, ensuring that firms that need to emit can do so easily. After the 2008 financial crisis, the EU carbon market was able to ensure that firms can bounce back and revitalize the economy. In their world, carbon taxes are less adjustable since the price per carbon is fixed, which means that when it is necessary to increase production to ensure that millions of people can be given jobs, can afford energy prices and afford gas, the fixed cost restrains them from doing so. But secondly, this market ensures that the optimal amount of carbon is being reduced. So the cap set are based on the necessary amount of emissions to be reduced based on scientific research, nothing more and nothing less. In their world, even in the best case, where you reach climate goals much faster by a tax, the cost is felt most by the people. This looks like forcing people to show they're way more expensive. This looks like not just higher prices of gas, but it's public transport and even basic goods getting higher because of transportation costs that are much higher. What is the way up of this? Solving climate change earlier has minimal benefit since research has already determined the most optimal reduction goals. However, the risk of causing massive economic harms would hurt the most vulnerable. On our side, we allow that flexibility that ensures that the most vulnerable don't get harmed. A global problem requires a clear global solution. And I think that we sufficiently proved to you that global carbon markets are effective. We're very proud to propose."

But instead, we will prove why the global carbon market is destined for failure, and in that process process they destroy all viable alternatives crucially we have limited political and economic capital as well as a looming climate deadline and we cannot hinge our limited resources on a failing solution before i talk about two arguments from the side of opposition three key responses to the speaker before me firstly on their mechanism of what their climate their carbon market is going to entail two things number one they say they're going to create a capped market based on the size of the company and the size of the industry i think firstly that this is critically naive because the largest global companies are the largest polluters are the wealthiers are the ones with the largest capacity to transition into green technology they should not be allowing these people to continuing to emit but we think it's the smallest nation companies in the smallest nations of developing nations who need the allocations the most because they cannot transition as wealthy. They don't have the existing capital to invest into green technology and begin the transition. They cannot be as charitable as they assert, the entire world has to transition into a net zero globally green economy within the next year, which we think is impossible for these developing nations and smaller companies to adapt to, especially given since Proposition 1 wants to favor larger nations and larger companies. But secondly, when they tell you that the cap is going to be continuously lower, that already dashes the profit-sharing incentives to truly invest and meaningfully partake and enter the market. Why? Because we think when you invest into the carbon market, what you really want to do is have a guaranteed and return on investment. You need to make sure that the carbon credits that are here today will be here next year and will be here in five years so that the value doesn't go down. On Proposition, insofar as you're constantly slashing the size of the carbon market yearly, what was valuable last year is no longer as valuable this year. Proposition cannot claim that these companies still have the incentive, given that it's so unreliable and it's such a non-profitable market to invest to, given that there are still many others, and it's still far cheaper to go into green technology. But on their arguments, number one, they see this as effective in reducing emissions. I think we'd like to note up top that proposition sets out their own burden as sinking islands as natural disasters then their best case is that they reduce emissions in the environment it's uncares to how these two are empirically linked but on that rebuttal specifically i think when they tell you about the impact of climate change it's uncontentious we think it's a problem on both sides only proposition tries to solve it through emissions we We don't. But secondly, we think that they cannot guarantee the emissions reductions in existence because we think that like a carbon market inherently means that you have to pollute. You have to emit in order for carbon permits to be given out, meaning that proposition cannot guarantee the reduction in emissions given that they're inherently permitting it. But thirdly, we think carbon leakages are contingent on opt-in in and of itself. Given that we told you it's too strict for many developing nations to economically opt-in, we think they're likely to opt out of the system altogether. Even if you sanction them, we think they're likely to form their own economic trade blocks to exist outside of a carbon market, and they can continue polluting and still have carbon leakages as they claim. But the second argument on whether or not this is economically feasible, I think this already deals with their own case. This is a contradiction insofar as they say there's like the wealth, the financial incentives for companies to invest and then say that there will be no incentive for companies to malevolently invest so that developing nations will end up well. They have to pick one. Somebody has to lose out in this debate. Flexibility only exists insofar as there is no rigid cap and trade system. Propositions comparative of a carbon tax is disingenuous because it is not what we are defending."

              "text": "Two arguments then. Firstly, on why a global carbon market will critically fail to solve the climate crisis. Three things. One, a carbon market innately permits carbon emissions. There are two mechanisms inherent to it. The first is tradable carbon permits, which allows countries to pay their way out of pollution. And the second is carbon credits, earned by creating carbon offset projects, which means that a factory in Denmark can still emit 100 tons of CO2 as long as it offsets it by planting trees in Africa to absorb 100 tons but this is problematic because of resounding scientific evidence that once emitted the average ton of CO2 remains in the atmosphere for a thousand years before it is fully reabsorbed while While carbon sinks still hold some value, the process of carbon reabsorption does not outpace how rapidly we are approaching climate apocalypse. At best, offsetting carbon emissions is a mitigatory solution when the priority should be to emit as little as possible through a transition to green energy. But secondly, the carbon market policy is hinged on a false presumption that there is a one-to-one ratio between carbon emission and carbon absorption. However, the amount of carbon that is released and reabsorbed via that ecosystem has an unexpected underground wetland, it could unpredictably emit methane after deforestation. It could very well be true that one ton of CO2 emitted reported an offset of 10 tons of CO2 over time. As ecosystems are unique, no scientific instrument can accurately measure and inform the carbon offset system. PROP hinders the fate of humanity on unreliable calculations. But lastly, companies and countries will prioritize tokenistic and damaging carbon inform the carbon offset system prop hinges the fate of humanity on unreliable calculations but lastly companies and countries will prioritize tokenistic and damaging carbon offset projects sustainable offset projects like wind and solar energy are costly so to maximize the profit of carbon credits low-cost projects are undertaken like chile's mass planting of eucalyptus forest carbon a cheap fast-growing tree that absorbs tons of carbons but decimates biodiversity and ecosystems, further harming the environment. Science shows that these forests can also store carbon for only about 100 years before degrading and then run the risk of contributing toward climate change when impacted by floods, severe weather, disease, and altered land practices. Forests go from carbon sinks to carbon sources because the vegetation adapts to release CO2 instead. Therefore, Prop's strategy is a short-term mitigation that is unsustainable, unreliable, and wastes resources on harmful projects. Before I go on to my second argument, I'll take a point. So how will the model and opposition work presuming all these harms do exist? We already told you that our burden is not to solve climate change, but rather that you destroy all of the incentives for them to solve black through other methods but also noting we don't define a carbon market right all of these harms are unique to a carbon market the failure of emissions is unique to a carbon market we can do other things like other kinds of conservation that you destroy uniquely on your side of the house but the second argument about how introducing profit into the climate solution creates perverse incentives for three ways. One, participants enter the carbon market for one reason only, to profit from obtaining carbon credits and permits. This incentive incentivizes them"

If nations are reducing their reliance on carbon, no one will purchase their carbon credits, killing off their business models and selling credits. But secondly, we think a global carbon market will require you to measure the carbon footprint of every company on the planet. Given that universal jurisdiction to that degree is impossible, the market will have to rely on decentralized global institutions for oversight, like how the WHO's influence is enforced by local authorities. Therefore, and this engages with Proposition's second argument, countries with weak regulatory bodies will be weaponized by companies exploiting the blind spots in the system of enforcement in order to profit. I.e., Mumbai's GFL gas project earns credit through forged paperwork, enabling it to continue polluting, but it's still the largest supplier of carbon credits for European firms. The commodification of carbon corrupts the fight against climate change, entrenching the very system that engineered the disaster. We cannot allow it to exist."

And they give you a vague counter-model that at no point do they actually defend. They don't explain why tech transfers and development aid are sufficient or exclusive in this debate to be able to ensure that you're able to reduce the number of carbon emissions, which directly ensures that a lot of people, millions of people in the global south are protected. The first thing I'd point out, this is largely contingent on ensuring that there is innovation. We explained to our argument, which received no response, that we're actually able to spur better forms of innovation. So private companies having the capital to be able to invest in their own forms of green tech, especially when there's incentive to transition now, given that permits will likely decrease the number of emissions you're able to have. So insofar as they want to stand by tech transfers, we're better able to have tech that is distributed among many different firms, insofar there's a profit incentive to want to profit from these kinds of innovations that you make. But secondly, these forms of development aid is unclear as to why this is largely inexclusive, insofar as there are different actors that are engaging in things like giving out development aid, as opposed to setting up a global carbon market.

Their response is to say the decreased caps won't be profitable and therefore companies won't opt in. It is the fact that it is profitable because over time, if you decrease the supply of permits, the price per permit is incredibly large at that point and therefore it's lucrative to sell it and therefore companies are not likely to be as averse as they want to talk about. So our model stands, but also we give you structural reasons as to why it is likely to stand."

              "text": "Firstly, on the environment. And I want to frame this as the most important issue. Currently, thousands of people are being displaced, sea levels are rising, and we need to ensure we have a solution to be able to reduce carbon emissions. Their first attack was to say, how do they sell it if it decreases over time? Obviously, firms that require more than what was given initially will have to buy permits, especially as we explained, the cap that we set is less than what they are currently being admitted. But the second thing to point out, as we explained, the amount of revenue is larger over time, especially as we decrease the supply of permits, that increases the price of permits. And therefore, what that means is more firms are likely to want to sell it to be able to ensure they get some revenue. The second thing that they say is that these firms will opt out of this system altogether. Firstly, it is unclear how they will opt out given that they will when they will be sanctioned it will be massively economically harmful. Their attempt to say that there's an economic block to prevent the harm is unclear especially when you are directly being fined. It's unclear how an economic block can protect you from that. The second thing to point out, it is just untrue that they will opt out because for the reason that small companies are able to sell the permits over time. If insofar as larger businesses will want to get permits from you, you have the ability to get revenue as a consequence of selling that permit. And therefore, the transition is much easier since you have the money to afford things like carbon abatement technology, things like CO2 scrubbers to ensure that you can afford the transition in the first place. Large companies and large countries don't forcibly take those permits from you. They have to sell it to them to begin with and therefore the transition is likely to be smoother and therefore you're not likely to have that loss of buy-in. The first argument is to say it will fail and I want you to note all of their argumentation is hinged on a caricature of the model which we did not set in to begin with. The first thing we pointed out was the cap will be lessened over time and therefore even if they will emit the maximum amount that is much better than the alternative where they will still emit 40 billion tons where on our side we can set the cap lower to able to ensure that we reduce emissions over time. The second thing to point out is offsets are not in our model. We explained it's just about permits themselves and the ability to emit carbon in the first place and therefore it's unclear what model they were rebutting in the first place. But the third thing to point out is offsets are better than the comparative. Because on the comparative, none of these firms have the incentive to plant trees. None of these firms have the incentive to reduce their carbon emissions in the first place. And therefore, on weighing, if a firm is more willing to do things like plant more trees to absorb carbon, rather than in their side where there's no incentive at all, that is comparatively more preferable. The second thing that they say is that emissions is not it's not correlated to things like the ability to absorb this carbon the first thing to point out is this might be true but if we ensure that we reduce emissions over time which they do not properly contest we're able to reduce the amount of the harm of carbon but just by having less carbon on net and therefore we still win this clash even if might be true, it's unclear as to why that mitigates or that all that does is mitigate our claim to begin with. The last thing that they say is it's profit oriented, and I don't know why this is bad. We explained that we maximize profit and we align the incentive of profit to be able to transition to a greener, more renewable form of society. So it's unclear as to why you maximally emitting is much better because on the comparative, you still emit 40 billion. On our side, you have to tap to ensure that it's limited to only 38 billion. But the second thing to point out is on this notion of corruption, the first thing I'd like to note is this is unlikely to begin with given there will be global oversight. If firms in smaller developing nations will be able to skirt regulation, that is going to receive massive backlash and therefore larger firms are likely to want to ensure that that regulation is stringent and therefore they will likely want to fund things like ensuring proper scrutiny from these as well, because it harms them if smaller firms are able to amass more permits in the first place. But lastly, this is all just wholly uncomparative. They never explain well their alternative of being able to have tech transfers actually ensures you reduce carbon. We explained, one, you reduce emissions by giving them the profit incentive to afford it and the incentive to want to be able to sell permits because it increases over time. Two, that you get better forms of innovation insofar as now firms are now more likely to want to sell their permits because they're not reliant on them because it becomes more expensive to buy them. But three, you reduce global carbon leakage that a firm in Germany is now able to transfer to North Africa because there's no regulation there, which destroys local economy. No response to any of that. Before I move on, go. Offsets take a thousand years and you're investing everything and every other present climate alternative into that, into something that at its best case will only exist in a millennia. So how are you going to solve climate change? Firstly, offsets are not in the model. Secondly, even if it were, it's comparatively better that our side plants some trees and your side plants no trees. So you have no solution to be able to reduce carbon emissions. It's unclear as to why you have a comparative. Secondly, economic impacts. This is not the tension. We explained that we needed to cross the line and needed to walk the line of being able to ensure we reduced carbon emissions, but we're not placing the harm directly towards"

When you are crowded and smaller and local firms within those regions are destroyed because they cannot compete against European firms. When China goes to other regions to escape the Chinese market, those Chinese businesses are able to destroy local businesses within those regions, and therefore it destroys local livelihood. it raises prices because they destroy other competition on our side a global carbon market prevents carbon leakage which they have no response to which is beneficial environmentally it also ensures economically that they're they don't harm small businesses which ensure we get greater forms of employment under our side for all of these reasons we win on the environment they have no comparative we win on the economy they don't explain why that's better on their side as well.

I did not think I would have to clarify this in a policy debate that they themselves outlined. There is clearly opposition fiat. So first, Prop exhausts all of their existing political capital to create and facilitate the carbon market as the foremost global climate strategy. That is massive amounts of capital taken away from the other alternatives that also require global buy-in in order to succeed second prop is creating competing market incentives towards solving the climate crisis allowing stakeholders to profit from the carbon off um carbon trading from the carbon permits that they are going to trade will make it less likely that they will share green energy patterns and make it accessible to market competitors we explain this in a poi they never actually wanted to engage and just called it assertive and that there was no response the response from first opposition was extremely clear that yes the reason why companies and firms won't invest in innovation is because it creates an environment where other nations are able to transition and become green which means that it does not matter in second proposition's clarification that the price of carbon permits becomes more expensive as the carbon market shrinks because less countries require the purchasing of said carbon permits which means they are null and void which is why innovation is not a point that proposition wins but it's rather on up because capitalism does not intervene but lastly every dollar investor in the carbon market is a dollar invested into a policy that will fail. So the opportunity cost is very clear, and we were only provided in our alternatives that were not even vague. We outlined two things, the development of clean energy and the development aid for countries who need to transition to sustainable development.

We told you, you have fiat to implement and the fiat to create the global carbon market, but you need to explain to us the process as to how it is likely to manifest. We said that for every single global institution, there is no such thing as universal jurisdiction and universal oversight. The who is not able to enforce policies the icc is unable to enforce policies onto nations even when they ratify it which is why you require a default model of a decentralized system which meant that capitalism and the corporations that they wanted to characterize are not introduced with incentives we're in the chain of command where there are multiple individuals the local governors that improve the projects, the individuals that are supervising SIT projects, all in that chain are prone to being able to be bought over and bribed, which is why 71% of carbon projects and carbon permits that were given to China in their own regional block were under review and later on review to be invalid because of perverse incentives that you introduce into set market so insofar as their mechanism doesn't actually work they have to defend the likely failures of that alternative rather than relying on fiat second we argue why global uh a lack of global opt-in was the reason why carbon leakages was responded to they wanted a heavily punitive mechanism not on their side they wanted to argue carbon reduction for the smallest poorest firms. That their first argument was hinged on the idea that the poorest corporations will transition because they're able to make money off tradable carbon permits. Panel, the individuals and the stakeholders in this debate that are going to be giving off and selling off their permits are not small corporations. These are the industries with the least capacity to transition to be green, the least capacity to innovate and change their current practices. So those aren't the individuals in proposition wanted to defend. They also gave them the least amount of carbon credits because these small industries were not the largest historical polluters in the status quo, which means that these nations are going to be heavily mechanized and heavily sanctioned on their side by their own mechanism are likely going to opt out which is what first opposite response was highly crucial in terms of if they were to opt out of this global system carbon leakages would still exist and it's a harm that you manifest because they would create rogue decentralized systems where they all collectively opt out and collude that was the response to first and second opposition first and second proposition that they never wanted to take. We've formed one strategy point. So why would a firm that has little capacity to transition sell the remaining permits that they have that allow them to emit in the first place, rather than them only selling it when they realized they could use the revenue to be able to transition, which is the more likely incentive that they have? No, because when you create the carbon cap, you're actively losing money. The money that you get from selling the permit is literally to offset the policy that you implemented and forced onto them. Moving on to the third substantive, but note that the first argumentation from first opposition was literally completely ignored and not engaged with."

And secondly, where do you best balance economic interests with environmental goals? Firstly, are we able to reduce carbon emissions? And secondly, where do you best balance economic interests with environmental goals? Firstly, are we able to reduce carbon emissions? And I just want to flag early, like before I proceed to the content, that if their problem is to say that it takes 1,000 years before carbon emissions leave the planet, the first thing I want to point out is, obviously, we're talking about the carbon emissions that have yet to be made. But secondly, is that if they do take 1,000 years, it's also unclear how in opposition they also tend to just leave faster. So that's a wash. We make a few simple claims. Firstly, that we have an efficient allocation of permits that lower emissions and aid in the transition of green-green. Secondly, we get better innovation by creating incentives for firms to do so. But lastly, is that we prevent carbon leakage, which undercuts a lot of environmental policies because the status quo is firms could leave and go to countries with less stringent policies, if ever that there are good policies in some areas. They make a few claims. First is that we can have technological sharing. First, the guards that would want to freely share will do so anyway. But two, for the organizations that don't give tech for free and actually want a cost, the cap-and-trade provides the capacity since you can sell permits and use it to afford green technology. If they say that there are certain firms that are smaller that would not be able to sell as much permits, the first thing I want to point out is that is all right because these are probably the firms that can easily transition to being green exactly because they are less in volume, they require less facilities to overturn and overhaul to greener technology, but secondly is that because they are smaller, presumably that also means that there is not much technology that they need to purchase to be environmentally friendly because they don't even wreck as much emissions to begin with. The second thing they try to say is that there's not much technology that they need to purchase to be environmentally friendly because they don't even react as much emissions to begin with the second thing they try to say is that there's less innovation because we are unsure firstly there will be less permits in supply which means they're more valuable but secondly if it won't because they assume that companies are also becoming less reliant on carbon which is fair to which is fair one not all companies transition at the same pace. Some need more permits than others, so you will still be able to make money. The incentive still stands. But secondly, even if you can't sell anymore, it's the fact that you don't want to be fined. And take note, we explained that the fines are going to be far expensive than purchasing a permit. So that's an active incentive for firms to innovate. The last thing they try to say is that companies will go to low cost projects. One, if they last for 100 years before degradation, that's 100 years of additional time to come up with a better solution that is more long-term because the problem, and they consider this, that a lot of long-term solutions are vastly and immensely expensive. So if anything, this buys time for companies to develop that. But secondly, they don't prove on their side why companies will want to invest on the high-cost projects to begin with. I will flip this and say that this is actually something that happens on our side. If it's true that low-cost projects don't get rid of much carbon, it will garner less permits. So it's on our side that companies are more likely to invest on costier projects, exactly because they reduce the most carbons, and therefore, if they don't give them the additional permits, at least they prevent them from getting heavily fined then. How do you weigh this? One, if the transition to being green is what will spell climate catastrophe to individuals, whether we like it or not, then it's the Corp Entry that is best able to do this. say we get things like uh like green technology or giving developmental aid for nations but they don't explain where is the teeth on that because you could give the resources but if you don't give the incentives to do so then surely they will not and they they wouldn't uh like they wouldn't transition before i proceed point of information yeah it is not. We made pledges to share and provide tech and aid in status quo. We told you that in your world, you contravened all those existing incentives because you introduced a new one, which is profit engaged. Yeah, so this is an A0 sum. Exactly what you said. These are already deals that were made before the policy was made. In the same way as how, it doesn't mean that a government process a new policy means that you have to revoke all the other past policies that we made because those have different budgets and different allocations of resources. This is not reasonable for us to defend. The second issue then, is where do we best balance economic interests with environmental goals? And if you met the debating before I proceed, we don't actually try to make any compelling reason as to how we're able to balance these things. And this is just sad because we acknowledge that in any environmental project, there has to be economic risks. So in which system are we able to reduce that? What do we prove coming from proposition? Firstly, that we ensure flexibility during times of crisis. Taxes are fixed, but the market is flexible such that when prices fall, presumably also the permits as well. So we're still having the incentive to going green without exactly bankrolling entire firms in doing this. But secondly, that we ensure the optimal amount of carbon"

None of their policy actually addresses the problem that we propose coming from proposition side. The fact that if there are good environmental policies, companies will shift to countries that have less so. And this is something that we uniquely solve on our side of the house. The remaining claim that we do have is that we are likely to penalize smaller countries since they don't have the capacity to transition. Firstly, is that their own model solves this, especially since we've proven it's not exclusive. But secondly, we don't have the capacity to transition. Firstly, it's that their own model solves this, especially since we've proven it's not exclusive. But secondly, we don't, exactly because smaller countries usually produce the least amount of emissions and therefore are probably least likely to be fined with the policy. But also, those are least likely to get to need the permits and are ones that are likely to sell the permits exactly because the largest polluters usually come on hyper-capitalistic nations as they've pointed out themselves. For all those reasons and more, we get a global solution that will solve a catastrophic problem opposition leaves us to"

The downfall of this proposition team so far was their misunderstanding of the round. all of first and second props rhetoric on sinking islands is non-contentious because there are incentives to go green regardless per their own analysis if there was no initial capital to want to enter green transitions then the debate couldn't take place because you can't form a global market per their own fiat response we would be able to use this under our model as well second i want you to know that all their responses were just saying you don't have a solution we at least got something clearly they were not listening let's clarify the burden in the round first this prop team took on the burden for themselves because they were the ones that explicitly wanted to revert the crisis entirely the opposition stance was not to propose a successful counter policy but they were pre pre-existing solutions for the crisis. However, the solutions would go extinct under their side because they introduced the market incentives that will redirect away political capital from these same solutions. But then what are these alternatives and why will they be successful? We explained from first and second, there will be things like green tech and patent sharing, developmental aid to build green infrastructure, etc. Don't be fooled by the third prop though, because it's not mutually exclusive, it is mutually exclusive, and it's not symmetric. The reason for this was, is that most of these things were giving things towards developing countries from the developed world. And the structural reason for why you aren't able to do that on the DR side is because you want them to now buy your credits. At the point where they had access to the same green energy as you, there's no reason why they would want to buy your credits to pollute because they don't have to pollute anymore, which means you kill away all benevolent incentives to make other countries go green in favor of your own profit incentive to upkeep the carbon market. So therefore, they undermine your entire model."

              "text": "That was a fatal concession for BirdProp. To be clear, how do we attain the political and economic capital to go green? First, they are pre-existing business and political incentives to go green, to avoid experiencing environmental damage, to avoid reliance on fossil fuel. So SecondProp is incorrect. There's no reason why they would want to do this under their side. There's lots of reasons why. However, Prop introduces a competing incentive, which is the economic incentive, given they wanted to force countries to spend the money to buy the credits or even sanction them. Therefore, economic survival contradicts the initial incentive to go green, and opposition reverses all existing political capital. In comparison, tax sharing was based on positive reinforcement instead of negative one, which means that countries were likely to opt in. The second was on contextual realism. So we've seen developing countries and developed countries as well, both opt into things like the Paris Climate Agreement, which is one of the largest global agreements of all time. So once again, op introduces a competing incentive by saying, if you give the developing world clean energy, they will no longer buy your carbon credit. So this means that you make all other alternatives unfeasible their only response was second props assertion that you don't get innovation first if these are developing countries and they probably can't independently develop to the same extent anyways but second i don't care if they got innovation under their side but zero access from all three speakers to no response we told you that the biggest barrier behind clean energy was not only the cost, but the patterns behind them, which our solution dealt with. So even if you believe they got innovation, the innovation never mattered because its value was in the access towards people, and they never got that. It's far too late to clarify this in reply. So it doesn't matter if they got some solution. We told you that solution was damaging and condemned global climate action for good. If the market is destined for failure, we must oppose it because we're expending resources on something that will ultimately be lost. There are three"

              "text": "issues then in this speech. First, on the inherent failures of the carbon market. This is by nature a very scientific round, but Prop ignores all these nuances. Three categorical harms that they never contended with. First, offsets still enable emissions. You can build a factory and later offset the carbon from that factory by planting a forest. The problem was that it takes years for all that carbon to successfully be reabsorbed by the forest. So in the meantime, that carbon still exists in the atmosphere, creates the greenhouse effect, and kills all of the same harms that they wanted to talk about. And the second part, we told you, the state subsidizes this process. Their response in third part was this was a future carbon, but this means that they're never able to do it in time for all their benefits to accrue because the carbon was already still there. But second, carbon cycles are different from ecosystem to ecosystem, which meant they're unable to gauge this accurately. These two flaws are unavoidable. It's not about government incentives. It's scientifically proven. So even if you can get better scientific estimations, it was impossible to do this reliably. you can get better scientific estimations, it was impossible to do this reliably. This uncertainty means their benefits are volatile, but also decreases confidence and opt into this policy. But third, there was a tendency to opt into low-cost projects. See, the eucalyptus farms we explained from first op are a good and fast way to get carbon out of the atmosphere, but have unquantifiable harms in damaging the ecosystems and the biodiversity in the environment because you created these monocultures. Why is this true? It's because of second props own words. It's a massive amount of money they can earn so they create a race to the bottom who can nab carbon credits in time by creating low-cost projects which ultimately harm the environment even more if they fail on their own metric. They can't say we'll send scientists to advise what are good projects because it reduces autonomy and increases opt-out. Why is this important? First, it engages them on their best possible grounds. Even if you believe all their arguments, this was showing that the nature of the carbon projects destroys the environment. Their only response from third prop was that it buys time, but this kills their case because they want absolute speed speed before that i'll take a point from yeah this is all contingent on innovation if we incentivize private actors to innovate more they can profit from selling green tax on either side profit incentives exist why would you invest in green tech if it doesn't align with the profit incentive the difference here is that they're already initial incentives to go green for the motion to work and also to prevent the harms of climate change. But now it's harder for you to focus on going green because you introduce a competing incentive to have low-cost projects to get the carbon credits in time. So your competitors don't get it. But also because there are also the economic sanctions, which means your priorities shift from this to other incentives. So you kill off the current trend of going green."

Number one, this is damaging for their case because this means the carbon systems reporting is also corrupted. Note that we told you from second opposition about how you need to decentralize this to local governments to report it, and that's how you're able to get the carbon credits. This means that under their side, they were also susceptible to corruption. They never mechanized this, which is why our setup still takes precedence here. What was the comparative? You cannot be corrupt when it comes to things like developmental aid because there are conditional loans from other countries. And if you defy these terms, you will then lose all the funding. In comparison, on Diasa, you are able to give fake reporting that harms the climate even more. But second, they claim that a global market would fix the flaws of regional markets."

With this, it's clear that they failed to do their research and they are a great part of losing this round the second issue then was about global climate injustice from the market and profit incentive we explained that they set a market cap on how many green credits can exist at one time which is a maximum amount of profit but second that they shrink the carbon credit pool every year which means on two grounds they like to lose this debate if it's true that it's very good for you to earn these credits and companies are invested in the long term, then it's less likely you'll opt into the market because very short term and eventually your investment will lose value. If you believe the opposite, which is that there will be short-termists in their profit incentive, this mechanizes our first argument about bad projects. But finally, this is not a generic capitalism is bad argument. The nuanced explanation we said was that in status quo, we are trending towards green energy, but they reversed this trend then. The final thing was then about the forms of mechanisms they wanted to put out. I think it's ludicrous that the team that wanted to protect displaced coastal villages wanted to further sanction countries to economically cripple them. I think this means that countries are placed in a false and a hard dichotomy. You're unable to choose the decision that's best for them.

Our burden on proposition is not to deliver a utopia, but we do think that states would have benefited local populations, and the balance of probabilities created a stronger foundation for them to build and develop into the 21st century. What do we stand for? As these states gained independence, they would prioritize limited political resources into implementing economic changes, such as land redistribution and cash transfer payments. This speech will prove three things. Firstly, economic reparations are likely to be applied best under our side. Second, they bring the most and greatest immediate benefit. And finally, economic reparations are prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights. Firstly, why economic reparations are more likely to be successfully applied than civil and political rights. And this is crucial because it explains why it's only under proposition that a policy that is likely to be implemented successfully and note that this argument preemptively will respond for all of opposition's benefits because they're all contingent on political and civil rights being carried out successfully there are three parts to this argument firstly economic reparations are initially more achievable in a post-colonial state recognize that the revolutionary leaders which this debate occurs upon are not purely altruistic but they balance genuine desire to help their nation with selfish desire for power. Despots like Mugabe, who have no desire to help their nations, fall out of this debate because of their unwillingness to implement either side's policies in a meaningful manner. So given that, civil and political rights require a far greater training offer of because you necessarily set up systems to on your own demise. Conversely, economic reforms enable leaders to pursue a desire to better their own nation without compromising their own motives to power. That's why leaders like Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana went on to create one-party states to prevent losing their own rule. So what this has established is that leaders both have the incentive and capacity to fail to implement opposition's political rights, whereas they'll be more willing to implement our economic rights. The second part of this argument is to say that even if opposition proves that political rights were initially successful, it's unlikely that they'll be sustained into the future for three reasons. Firstly, because political and civil rights require additional buy-in into seemingly Western systems of democracy. These populations who have had no encounter with these democracies before necessitate that distrust. Democracy only works effectively if it is engaged with and without the trust it will fail. But secondly because civil and political rights are highly inter-reliant such that the failure of one right necessitates the downfall of all others. For example the right to vote is inconsequential if you lack information because of pipe state control. But thirdly because political rights require additional and continued maintenance, such that the states have the capacity to provide political rights and name without actually doing so, through mechanisms like gerrymandering, voter suppression and miscounting ballots, all of which are easy to hide versus whilst observing land distribution is relatively obvious under our side. So what we know so far, the political rights at the point of implementation do not guarantee the benefits that opposition will claim, in the same way how Eritrea was one of the first African nations to have free elections, but was not successful in sustaining them."

                "text": "The final part of this argument is to note that, by comparison, economic reparations are likely to succeed after initial application for three reasons. Firstly, because economic reparations provide immediate benefits, even when citizens do not have ideal access to them. Even if you believe that economic reparations are imperfect, recognise that half the access to these policies is still good. If you receive a cash transfer but no land redistribution, it still benefits you and that is still better than no reparations at all. Compare that to opposition where the imperfect application of one right harms all the other rights which they try and gain. The second thing to say here is that economic benefits are more easily sustained during a context of political instability in post-colonial Africa. We know that empirically, many African states experienced political turmoil during those periods. Political and civil rights could not have been maintained whilst the economic benefits we provide before that are given and they are able to remain. But the third thing to say is that unlike opposition, which gets weaker with time, as more people lose faith in democracy, economic reparations compound. That's because economic reparations allow you for continuing development, like educating your children or working in the land that you're given. This allows the benefits we claim to grow over time in comparison to opposition, who will likely have those democracies rapidly backslide. So at the end of this argument, from the under proposition, where policy is likely to be implemented successfully, and which is what all of opposition benefits will be contingent on in this debate. I'm now going to move on to my second argument. But before that, I'm happy to take a point of information. How are your operations more sustainable if you don't have property rights? So I've just explained that we are likely to be able to have these sorts of things because they compound over time. If you give someone money, for for example you're able to invest that in yourself you're"

Side proposition solved the immediate problem of poverty and starvation, which is the greatest impact in this debate. The impacts of political rights are long term and speculative because they require future action, whilst economic reparations do not and are guaranteed. We look to examples of huge famines in Ethiopia, where 1.2 million people died, and democratic rights did nothing to help them. And note that even if opposition tries to claim that they eventually get economic reparations, you must still vote side proposition, because of the immediacy of our benefit. Because every day where governments deny economic reparations, thousands more have died. And opposition at this point has an enormous burden in this debate. Tell us how they're going to help the people suffering right now. Why, even in their best case, it is worth having to wait decades to save lives rather than grant immediate economic reparations, which only we can do under our side."

                "text": "Finally, why the prioritization of economic reparation is a necessary prerequisite for achieving civil and political rights. The thesis of this argument is to suggest that economic reparations are prerequisite for accessing anything that this argument is to suggest that economic reparations are prerequisite for accessing anything that this opposition wants to claim. So even in opposition's best case, if you believe that those rights are important, you must vote side proposition. That's for two reasons. Firstly, you have to recognise that individuals need to be economically secure to be politically engaged, because you need time to conduct protests, because the right to vote in name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper, because the right to vote in name means nothing if one is too hungry to lift the ballot paper because the right to freedom of the press means nothing if someone is too illiterate because their parents could not afford them to send them to school secondly this is because this would lead to a less power asymmetry between ethnic groups economically actually increasing civil and political rights effectively because that inequality is lessened and therefore safety increases under our side all that is to say that if you want to unlock any civil and political benefits that opposition wants to claim, it is necessary to first achieve a baseline of wealth that only we can access on side proposition. That is what this opposition has to contend with in this debate. By comparison, you're more able to push for civil and political rights when you're in a better economic situation for two key reasons. The first thing to say is because you have more power, you are able to pressure unwilling governments because of the fact that you hold economic power. That is through the mechanisms like lobbying and platforming politicians by giving them funds to conduct things that could only happen under our side where you have that economic power. That level of government reliance on individuals is how you achieve a voice under our side. But the second thing to say is that for the reasons before, individuals can only mobilize and push for rights when they have that initial economic basis that we provide. Because rather than thinking about how you're going to put the food on the table at night, you can think about who you're going to vote for. You can think about how you're going to enact change. Obviously, we're not saying that these individuals will have all the economic power, but the question you have to ask yourself in this debate is who has comparatively more economic power, which flows into political power for the reasons that we've given. At the end of the speech, economic reparations are a prerequisite for all other benefits. Political and civil rights are a leaf in the relentless wind of reality. That's what this opposition has to contend with. Vote proposition. Thank you very much for that speech."

Those are very hard to repeal. It's a literal constitution. You cannot really challenge it very easily. Secondly, ensuring those, governments are going to be ensuring that those rights can be exercised. Meaning you'll have the means as a person of Africa to go to court and demand actors in society to respect your rights but thirdly we also think that institutionalization of those rights will be pushed forward this means that governments on our side prioritize building institutions that protect your rights this means you're insured more public defenders more judges more inspector that can for example come check abuses on your workplace on proposition countries have different goals those things are crucially left behind, and they're then different on two grounds. One, although they might give you land, you can't be unlawfully detained. You can't be unlawfully stripped of the land that you were given. You don't have the right to let go about your life as you want to. But secondly, even if the right to land is codified on their side, it's unclear to us to what extent you can exercise this right. This extent is severely limited when you don't have the institutions developed to complain to courts to have the judges look at your cases this means that we're already better at achieving the right that proposition wants to claim before i move on to a negation proposition engage your side is the status quo in all of africa the three functioning democracies how has your side been successful can you repeat that sorry the sound was up your side is the status quo in all of africa the three functioning democracies.

This cannot be done when rights are literally being denied to you. When you have like no rights, someone can always make choices instead of you. Someone can always control your life. Someone can always decide when and what you're allowed to say. Even if the actor making decisions is completely benevolent, you're never seen as a free and worthy individual. Notice that then on proposition, even if you have material freedoms, you're never free because freedom of non-interference has to come before material rights otherwise regardless of whether you have ten dollars on proposition or like if you cannot control how you spend it if you cannot unionize to get more than ten dollars if you cannot decide whether something is more important to you than getting those ten dollars you this right is equally like less important because it doesn't allow you to access all of the rights that you would actually need it just assumes that you want those ten dollars it doesn't really matter what you are accounted for this means that proposition inherently keeps people of africa dehumanized because they're always seen as incapable individuals of making decisions for themselves like they were during colonialism when they were literally enslaved they had no control over the land they had no control to war confrontations etc this means that specifically in this context people of africa deserve and need to be given their dignity back they were stripped off of it by oppressive european leaders were the only ones giving it back to them on the second argument i'll be engaging with more props material notice that from proposition like on opposition political and political rights and rule of law are crucial for a state accountability and proposition doesn't really have that increasing accountability happens on"

                "text": "two levels on our side. One to political rights. Notice that this is especially important to keep government politically accountable because they don't always add benevolently, and you don't always have the best intention in mind. Notice that this debate is happening in context of post-colonial society. There is a lack of trust between ethnic groups. The one in power was probably privileged during colonialism and other powers, other ethnic groups are largely going to mistrust this. This incentivizes the people that are in power to act in a not benevolent way because they want to keep those powers which proposition already characterizes. So but even if you act benevolently and have incentive to do so you're not necessarily always acting in the best interest of the people because you don't necessarily know what the people on the ground want and need so it's crucial to keep the government in check political rights are then political rights that do do this by directly allowing people to participate in the political life of the country this means you can go out and vote for the representative that best represents you. This means you have freedom of speech, you can criticize the government, but it doesn't give you the needs that you need. You also can go out and protest, you can show the satisfaction with all the things that the government is doing wrong. This means that only on our side, you show the government what you want, you can hold it accountable when it doesn't do that. But secondly, also to to the rule of law in societies where there are already big disparities between the rich and poor the rich who want to benefit further and they want to entrench their power into the system or to get more wealth and more land this is crucially important for the countries to focus on the rule of law rural thought gives the basis for rights being protected meaning that laws are applied as equally as possible for everyone this means that someone cannot just come on your land and take it away from you because it is your right to property. And even if they do so, even if they seize your land, your injustices have to be fixed because you can go to court and complain about it. We have three impacts of all of this analysis that I just told you. One, government policies are more likely to be representative of what the people need and want because they're able to express their needs to political rights so even if proposition gives them some good things we're able to give them more good things because we give them what they want secondly everyone can demand the same benefits from the state so because your rights are codified on our side you can demand your rights being fulfilled to the same extent as the rights of other individuals even in proposition wealth gets distributed to a few individuals in the country on our side all individuals have the right to demand it but thirdly proposition doesn't necessarily get good land reparations and economic reparations, because it don't pay your day civil and political rights. Firstly, we think the government will not redistribute land and economic reparations evenly, because one I already showed you how there's a lack of trust. You're probably likely to prioritize the people that are going to keep you in power. But secondly, you're probably also going to reward the army that literally helped you get in power and help you to the liberation movement, staying in power. This means that the poor people in the country, for all the people are getting the land people will be like taking away the land from the more powerful actors on proposition because this happened in zimbabwe for example when a retired army general that had a lot of power violently took over the alamain park consisting of 5 000 hectares of land previously that was redistributed to the people on our side of the house those people would have the power to go to courts and say that their rights are being validated and get back the land. This is impossible proposition. This is why it's far more important to firstly give the people civil and political rights than maybe focus on economic land reparations, Proud to oppose. you All right, thank you very much for that speech."

They make one big claim here, which is to say that rights are things inherent to their dignity. But note that underlying every piece of rhetoric they give you is simply an assertion that what people need is agency. We would tell you crucially that economic rights are linked to agency in just the same way. That is to say, it is restricting your agency when you cannot buy food to feed yourself. It is restriction of your agency when you don't have enough money to send your child to school. All of those things limit your ability to exist like a normal person in society. There's an unfair characterization to say that economic rights don't in the same way restrict people's ability to exist in normal society. What do you know then? You know that dignity and reparation can come from economic rights too.

                "text": "the second question, which side is better able to achieve and secure rights? The first claim they make is about the accountability of these states. Two big responses. First, it is important to note that neither side can change the behaviors of the most dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side, no matter which direction you can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like dictatorial powers. That is to say, no side, no matter which direction you can take, can change the behaviors of dictators like Mugabe in the types of policy directions they take. It doesn't matter which thing he prioritized, it was always going to be most dictatorial, you're never going to hold him accountable. So what you need to deal with then are those in the middle, those with a level of altruism. What do they tell you? First, that you have a right to protest and a right to freedom of speech, and that mechanism through which you hold them accountable first we reject that you were able to achieve these rights in and of themselves that is to say note how much rhetoric and time they spend on proving how this can like improve the lives of these individuals but no time proving how these institutions actually enable these people who have these rights we would tell you through every piece of material at toby the fact that individuals see this as an attack on their power because now these individuals can go out and treat and protest them is why they are likely to never give these individuals what they need and what they deserve but secondly and crucially even if you can claim freedom of speech or right to assembly we tell you that you're if you like need to focus on working 16 hour days in order to get food on the table if you don't have the ability to protest because you can't read or because you're just like in a rural area that is not interacted with the state you're not able to be successful in that way finally then on the claim about fairness they tell you that a minority gains a sense of power three key responses firstly as I mentioned before it is important framing that a dictatorial state states neither side can change this but those in which you can we ask you to be imaginative. That is, obviously, firstly, and it's the piece of framing we gave you earlier, it's less than an attack on an individual's power when you're likely to give them economic rights, sort of less likely that you just give it to your ethnic minority then. But secondly, you need to think of the long term, which is to say, if it is true that some dictators are likely to prioritize some individuals within society and push up their minorities, it is crucial to know that our side only needs one good person with some level of altruism willing to do a good policy. They need to deal with the fact that they need multiple dictators or multiple governments in succession to preserve things like constitutions, to preserve things like democratic rights, be unwilling to repeal everything that has been done previously. So if they want to make this debate about which side gets the greatest best people in power in terms of like fairness and things like that they have to deal with the side that is just more likely under their world that is the status quo because they have to deal with multiple individuals coming into power and being willing to repeal things like that but even if it is symmetrical even if it is unfair why do we still win this debate first because giving a minority economic rights is still a benefit at the point at which it keeps society running. That is to say, if you give a minority of individuals, an ethnic minority, for example, the ability to vote, that doesn't necessarily impact the ability of other people to exist in society. But if you give people money, it keeps the economy running in an important way. But second, we will tell you that economic rights to these individuals makes their lives better, but doesn't empower them to actively make the lives of others worse. Which is to say, when you give people the right to vote and only give that to a specific group of people, they are able to push for policy which actively discriminates against a certain group. Which means in their worlds, what they have to deal with is where a dictator may be unfair, may only give the right to vote to a certain number of group of people, and they're able to weaponize that to cause the most harm. What do you know then at the end of this practical clash? Firstly, that we actively better these individuals' lives. We make them more able to feed themselves. We make them better able to feed their families. We make them able to enjoy life more. That is crucial in that way. Any rhetorical example they give you where they haven't done the mechanization to prove why they actually get these changes before i get onto my one point of substantive i'll take a poi if there is one minorities on your side can always be unlawfully detained can always be taken from their land and taken away from your family on our side we"

It looks like the rise of populist and racist leaders, those who bring about an us versus them mentality mentality which in and of itself brings instability and brings division. These leaders capitalise on existing economic disparity between groups to support their cause, that is, observing how a colonial regime has benefited some groups more than others and how post-colonial structures have failed to fix these problems. How do we stop this competition? First, observe that this competition stems from a watch to solidify economic prosperity for themselves and their communities. We pre-empt this competition from existing at all by granting economic rights to all, decreasing perceived inequality and hatred. But second, we just limit economic inequality. You can't foster hatred surrounding post-colonial systems if they give money to everybody. You can't manipulate democracy if you have the power that you have to manipulate because of your economic prosperity is lessened. Secondly, though, we tell you that economic rights foster strong narratives about independence. That is, colonial society acted like wealth extractors. In their departure, what emerged was a sentiment and a fight for independence, which had underpinned the demands to reduce poverty and famine that had ravaged the continent. Point to the independent movement which emerged in Mozambique. What does this mean? It is crucial that these states deliver on these economic promises to prove their legitimacy to these populations. Regardless of any benefit that practical benefit the side opposition can point to, populations can be easily galvanized into riots and violent revolutions against yet another failing system of government, yet another post-colonial structure which doesn't get them what they want. At the end of the speech, we improved people's lives. We dealt with the status quo like it is, not like we would want it to be, so incredibly proud to propose.

This is why we believe that this principle is much more important, even if we take them at their best and say, okay, maybe the government is going to be benevolent. Still, we tell you that these people need the access to self-determination. These people need to be able to decide what they want to do in their what they want to do for themselves they need to be finally be able to have the control because notice we're putting this into post-colonialistic context these are the people that have been for centuries told they're the inferior race we tell you that it's much more important to be humanized to be, to have your humanity codified, than having a piece of land. Okay, but then secondly then, upon accountability and upon how we're not able to achieve this, we tell you that the side proposition is being very paternalistic at the point of which they tell you that these poor people cannot change their own situation. We tell you that this is very uncomparative and it's also not put in the real world.

We tell you that the principle is about you being able to be humanized, about you being the human, you being very equal as every other citizen. We tell you also additionally that the fact that you're starving is contingent on you proving this is going to be something that you will be tackling on your case.

This means that the government is much less likely to take you and the thing you for whatever, which, for example, happened in the absence of this rights in Ghana in 1,958. This is a country that did not prioritize civil and political rights. They they have a preventive preventive detention bill which was used to essentially silence opposition and silence the critics that they didn't like. And in 1965, over 2000 people were in detention. We tell you that when the side opposition, this is much less likely to happen simply because you have things like that prevented in the institution, even if this is a weak democracy. Additionally, the second point here under the protection on an individual level, you have, you are protected from the intervention of other citizens, as we already told you, there's no insurance of property rights and in the absence of this, nothing official eventually prevents the neighbor or any other person who's more powerful for example, a person with a gun to get to your house to get your property, and just take it away from you. We tell you that it's very important that we institutionalize this. And this is especially important in the context of these reparations, because look, these reparations, as we tell you, in their best case scenario, is going to be helping only the middle class and the upper class. Why? The weakers are still going to be at loss simply because these weak people are still going to be the weakest and they have no protection from the state to ensure that they have these rights, to ensure that they still have the piece of land that the government gives to them. So we tell you that in best case scenario, if we ignore all of the analysis that we've given to you, that these things are not going to be carried out properly, we still win.

We give them the ability to demand improvement without being at risk for being shot out on the street. And this is exactly what sets us apart from the previous system. Look, the comparative here is that the change on site opposition happens because we can it can because we give them the ability to do so whereas on the side proposition the change is contingent on the benevolence of the government this is also how we can co-op the site propositions benefits simply because we give these people to ability to achieve these reparations because they can't protest because they have they can't have reforms because of things like that. So the impact here is then the existing power imbalances get much smaller. But lastly, on the point of minorities, this is especially detrimental. We already told you that these countries are not homogenous and that the dominant ethnic group still has the incentives to deprioritize the other ethnic minorities. Look, they'll be the most harassed, they'll be the most disrespected and the most discriminated. And look, reparations are only going to further this world gap. So what we do here, we give them the ability to go to court, to unionize, and we close this discrepancy gap. So because we help the weakest people, because we actually humanize people, that is why you vote side opposition. Thank you very much for that speech and now we return to the proposition for the"

That means on a baseline, you have to believe that we are starting with more immediate economic action, immediate economic action that goes to people. Second of all, in regards to prioritization, it is not fair for Slovenia to say that we get democratic rights and economic rights, but you can't even make a land court like in the first place we think because the fact this is a prioritized debate we are able to do things like assume that these leaders aren't going to immediately take the land right away because of the characterization Slovenia brings you third of all we think they're still like countries can't access these resources in the first place obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do not believe that's in fear some many countries do have vast natural resources in the first place. Obviously they exist on a spectrum even if you do not believe that's unfair. Some many countries do have vast natural resources in the fourth place and last of all to the extent in which we're talking about nations in these like status quo the opposite has to deal with this. This is not a speculative debate on their behalf it is a debate looking into the past which means that is the ground on which this debate is won. Therefore what we do have to contend with is the actuality of the status quo of what these countries look like. Because according to global reports, three countries in Africa have functioning liberal democracy. That is a whopping statistic considering the accountability they tell you is likely to work. So on this question of accountability, we hear from Slovenia, you can codify rights, ensure the judiciary, and build institutions. Once again, as I'm going to tell you, most of these democracies are likely to be imperfect. This fiat does not assume they can make a beautiful status quo. That means these democracies are susceptible to things like lobbying. They are susceptible to people who are privileged, having massive control, and they are susceptible to falls, which is where all of our second speaker substantive takes into place. Second of all, we would tell you voting is not the only means of accountability, because obviously, to the extent in which these are semi-liberal states are making this way up in their own heads, they are likely to be to some extent receptive to the needs of their public. This means insane leaders like Mugabe are out. What we are dealing with is leaders who perhaps do want to appease their populations therefore when they tell you about things like we get no democracy and institutions that doesn't fall we get a degree of accountability so do they the point is that we are not willing to trade that off for people's food now moving on to the second question about how the principle works in this"

This is a world where many colonial leaders had systems of indirect rule. They moved people onto different land. They put them to the least terrible sections of the population where they knew they could not farm the land in a sustainable way. They were physically removed from having any ability to thrive. And that's incredibly important because it's not enough to say that these lofty and speculative ideals of democracy are meaningful to people, noting that all their analysis essentially proves that democracy is a good means of getting to an end goal in the first place, assuming it is on the point of agency. We would also tell you that all the analysis about your being in the past you've been stripped by european leaders really falls down when you consider how history functions because yeah rhodesia was normally a democracy many people in these african states are really untrusting of democracies in the first place with good reason that means all of our analysis that, oh, you know, we need democracy, it is a good system. Democracy is the first and only economic political system that exists. We think before democracy, pre-colonial states had systems of consensus, their own structures, people are far more likely to buy into. So at the point in which you think democracy is a good, it is unclear whether that is a good that would be appreciated in the context of this debate considering the historical legacy that we're talking about and lastly if side lobenia wants to talk about political vacuums i think in the abstract being alive is more important than having the right to say what you want at the end of that you know that side australia wins this debate just on principal grounds alone because we are not forcing this system upon um post-colonial african states a system which although tries to profess to give them agency truly does not in the vast majority of cases as i'm going to elaborate on now so on this the first thing i'm going to establish is"

Before I move on, I'll take a point of affirmation. On your side, this is all. You're constantly speculating what the people want and the people need. If the people on the country on your side are not going to actually get food, if the people on your side actually need more benefits first, we're actually decided and guaranteeing that African people can determine what they want for themselves. The point is that assumes that this will be implemented in the fullest way possible. Given the way we tell you that these rights are entirely codependent, at the point in which we prove at the very least that they are not implemented perfectly, that is automatically a loss for you. Because money in the hands of people, whether or not they are the poorest people, if those people are not starving, we win. If those people are starving, then we win the debate even by a bigger margin. Then moving on, why are the economic policies also likely to fail?

That is incredibly important. At the point in which you do not have food on the table, being able to vote doesn't matter when that voting system is dominated by elites when you feel like you have no rights in the first place. Large economic disparities are the reason democracy breaks down and when democracy breaks down, there is no tangible thing you can cling on to deliver benefits to these people. Notice once more all the framing I gave you about ethnic tensions means if there are massive genocides happening, that is symmetric. But in any way, based on our second speaker's substantive, it is far better for us that we try and undermine these tensions in the first place. At the end of this speech, you must be realistic because an Africa today is an Africa that traded off their potential to do things like cash transfer programs for a desire to institute democracies that have not worked because three out of 54 isn't a good statistic.

This is what sort of proposition is doing, they're telling these people that they're not capable of making good decisions for themselves. We believe this is very paternalistic, we believe this is not the right way to go.

We tell you, firstly, there's likelihood of people actually being killed during the process of rent distribution as happened in Zimbabwe, for example. Secondly, we tell you the elites are lucky to get all of this land at the point in which you as the leader of the movement, at the point in which you as a government that has no checks and no democratic checks and balances. You have selfish incentive to stay in power and you want to give the money and the land to the people that you trust thirdly we tell you that they never responded to all of this then the the money is going to go to like the military generals at the point which these are the people that keep you in power as a government leader however on our side of the house the mechanism for you as a government leader to stay in power is for you to be re-elected so there's a necessity for you to listen to the people this is the mechanism in which you stay in power on proposition the mechanism for you to stay in power is to actually be oppressive government and to give less power to the people less land to the people less cash transfers to the people but also way less rights and actually like backtrack before moving on i can take a poi given the instability we've seen in the African continent as a legacy of post-colonization is far-reaching, do you think that in the case where both policies fail, is it easier for people to hold on to a constitution or a block of land? We believe on our side of the house, we have way more stability at the point where there's less chaos, at the point at which you're able to go to courts, at the point at which you're able to claim your right. On your side of the house, you might get, or might not get land, you might get the land, this is now I'm going to best case scenario of proposition, even if there's an ideal land distribution or cash transfers, there's a high possibility of someone taking it away from you, and you have no ability to claim it back, because you do not have court, you do not have the right to complain, you do not have all of that. Secondly, we also tell you best case scenario for prop, these rights can be revoked in the long term. We see this happening in Zimbabwe at the point in which they're taking the land back away from this. And this is why we're able to win this.

But then lastly, let's talk about the worst case scenario for both sides of the house.

So even if proposition proves to you that cash transfers are going to be perfect, all the people are going to get them, we're unsure as to why people on their side have the right to use this cash in the right way chose to get this cash instead of investing it to a local hospital and chose to actually not and are still why is this more important than you not being too able to be taken away this cash when you're unlawfully thrown in the detention center tortured from all whatever means the government's one the only response they have to all of our claims is that but the prerequisite for civil and political rights is economic reparations. This all falls if I prove to you, which was already proven to all of our speeches, that you cannot actually eradicate inequality. That is a prerequisite that they say for achieving better civil and political rights that it shows to you in second speech but drop in third entered then let's talk about the propositions back to Victory we tell you that the only propositions back to Victory is the likelihood analysis of what is actually going to stay true we tell you that they tell you like civil political rights we reappeared because governments are not willing to give out their power and because democracies are sustainable to lobbying times and times again we have shown to you that we're more likely to have accountability in a democratic regime when you're able to have means and checks of the power as compared to an autocratic regime on the side of a proposition. This means that on our side of the house, you have a lot of mechanisms to keep the government in check. Voting, criticizing the government, going out to protest, but also forming civil unions, labor union to go against your employee when he's denying you the right to go out and get a higher wage. This means that we can achieve far more things for the people, especially those fees that they want. Even if those things are weak at the start, we can see that they might be because there's a limited political capital. They exist and people are able to improve that and they're more likely then to keep those rights. Crucially, it doesn't exist on prop and here's why they lose the debate. One, because this means the satiety of analysis means that the land reparations are going to fail and their entire case falls because of this. The prerequisite analysis I mentioned earlier then relies on you being able to achieve economic and land reparations first. This does not happen because you're not distributing the land correctly, you're not giving it to the most vulnerable people the government wants to hold in power wants to keep in check and the arson is going to give the cash away from themselves they might be giving it to the lead they might be giving to the people that are close to them they might be giving it to the party but the most vulnerable people are never going to get it so i'm unsure as to why their prerequisite analysis actually improves on their side but secondly also about observation they never showed you by minorities in the country are actually going never showed you why minorities in the country are actually going to get land, why minorities in the country are actually going to be able to benefit from their policy. It's far more likely that minorities in the country benefit from our policies, because even if the constitution is weak, even if the democracy and democratic institutions are weak, minorities are able to go out and protest. It's not a prerequisite that you're not starting to go out and protest. People are literally a prerequisite that you're not starting to go out and protest. People are literally able to unionize in the worst conditions possible because they know that they want to improve their conditions. We already give you that analysis. And lastly, the harm that they do is crucial because the harm that they actually do is that the people are not going to be deciding on their side. This is very important. Because one, you are not actually giving the people what they want. I'm unsure as to why people would be prioritizing cash transfer in an institution where they don't have roads when they don't have like hospitals etc why would they not democratically vote for those things to be prioritized i think it's more crucial that people decide what they want but more importantly you're not able to equally demand from the government what you're able to achieve because even if on their side land gets given to like few people, if on our side, people decide for land reparations, all of the people are able to demand through courts land reparations existing. This means that we're able to not only give the people what they want, improve their situation far worse. And this is why you vote for opposition. Thank you very much for that speech."

And I'm starting with this, and it's important, because all of opposition's material are actually contingent on these rights actually being sustained. And note that this notably deals with their principle, because there is no self-determination if democracy does not work. There is no self-determination if people starve and they die. They start this off by saying a few red herrings. Their first line of attack is that they say that because you have the same power means that it has the same level of enforceability. This falls down in three ways. The first thing that we explain at first, it said that it's not just about the power, but it's about the will of the person to actually implement that policy correctly. And to the extent that you were directly giving away power, that is unlikely to be done in a way that's particularly good. We point to the example of Uganda, of Kwame Nkrumah, this opposition has not responded to. The second thing that we point out, because that's not just about instituting rights, but it's about people actively engaging with it. And to the extent that we point out that this system is one that is seen as particularly colonial, because it comes from this Western background, people are unlikely to have the sort of faith that this opposition would require to actually have an effective democracy. The third thing that we explain is that notice the extent you have to believe opposition's rights to fail is exceptionally low. Because we point out all down the bench that failing one right necessitates failing many others, whereas even if they can mitigate some of our benefits in terms of not getting land reparations, still getting cash transfers, that is clearly something that we're still on top of in this debate. All that is to say that the world of this opposition is not a functioning democracy. Because we point out it's easy to miscount votes, as we point out it's easy to gerrymander, we point out that there are all these reasons and all these ways that the people in power can skew it and they have the incentive to do so meaning that they do not get the democracy they want. The second line of attack is that they say what's constituted constitutional but that ignores the fact we give you all these why that constitution while it may exist is unlikely to be applied correctly the third line of attack is to keep talking about zimbabwe but we know from first this is out of the debate because mugabe would not implement either policy under either side successfully which is to say that it's symmetric which means that you cannot weigh that the final line of attack is say that we implemented poorly because they we lack land force we will know this is a prioritized debate perhaps we can have land force but we will prioritize the economic reparations. And that is what this opposition has to deal with. So with that in mind, they cannot claim any of their benefits on democracy."

And this is crucial because of the 51 nations in Africa that are not functioning democracies, they're still waiting. They're still starving. And opposition does nothing. Even even taking opposition is the best they have not answered why it is worth waiting decades for people to stop starving we point to the fact that 1.2 million people have starved in ethiopia and that is the reality and that is what this opposition has to defend which they have not the very benefit of humanization is not enough to overcome death itself because you cannot feel humanized if you are dead you cannot gain that benefit mentally if you're someone who's no longer living because you have starved at the end of that that is clearly the greatest way that we win this debate and this opposition has no response other to say that maybe in a few years maybe in a few decades we might be able to get change we get it right now we save those lives finally do economic reparations lead"

Note that we also explain that wealth can be used to influence this sort of political system, and that necessarily means that we're actually able to get these changes better than this opposition. Not under this opposition, they have not been able to contend with their own realistic characterization. They say that we are the side shooting people, but that for some reason, they're able to get people to perfectly follow constitutions which are written out and fought against their power. At the end of this debate, economic reparations are the prerequisite for all benefits. Life itself is what is most important, and that's what we defend on side projects."

Secondly, why economic reform leads to greater political accountability. Before moving into arguments, two points of setup. Firstly, on our stance. Our goal is simple. We want to break down existing economic privileges and redistribute them to the people through two methods. A, we're happy to confiscate the wealth of the super-rich and redistribute this to the people on the ground. But B, we're happy to redistribute the sources of wealth, which essentially is land, which was controlled by ex-colonial powers as well as local elites who were prioritized in the colonial regime."

                "text": "The second point I've set up on what both worlds look like. Firstly, what are we willing to trade off on our side of the house? We're happy to give up on democratic reforms, for example, the right to vote, the right to protest, since our claim is that these will not be respected anyways on opposition world. But secondly, what do we imagine our world to look like? We think it is likely to look like a set of non-elected officials crafting and implementing policies. For example, we think this looks like in Indonesia, where prominent nationalists who fought for independence collectively made decisions with Skarno as the unelected president. Obviously, we're happy to concede that this body is not completely accountable, but we think there is a significant interest in uniting the country, as the period immediately after colonialism coincides with the peak of nationalism, where the people, prominent nationalists in particular, are bound against a common enemy that is the symbolism of colonialism. Given this setup, first argument then, why the breaking down of economic privileges are necessary for economic activation. The thesis under this is that economic and land reforms are necessary for people to live a fulfilled life and uniquely get that on side opposition. Why then does economic privileges actively shackle people to endless poverty? Two reasons and points in chat, please. Firstly, because landowners have massive leverage over individuals. This is to say people are forced to make unfair concessions to landowners because they're economically dependent on them. In truth, they need that land to farm, so they're naturally forced to listen to the plantation owners. This means two things. A, they live under harsh conditions where most of their profit are sucked away by landowners. But B, they're often forced to stay in a particular piece of land for a long amount of time due to their contracts, which deprives their mobility. The second reason is that it is empirically true that African countries are resource rich, but these resources are monopolized by elites. This looks like the United Africa Company under the British government monopolizing oil in Nigeria. The profits earned through the excavation of these resources are hoarded by Western elites, which comes at the massive opportunity cost of bringing that wealth to the people on the ground. These two mechanisms prove that poor people in Africa will structurally continue to stay poor in the future. What is the comparative then? Firstly, in the short term, wealth redistribution allows people to survive, allows people to have food on the table and pay their rent. But second of all, in the long term, greater economic opportunities accrue in two ways. One, individuals are able to access greater earnings. Now that farmers aren't sucked up most of their profit and can use that leftover money, but also have ownership of land, means they can produce more crops, make harvest more efficient, and able to start up new businesses. But two, the country is able to access increased economic opportunities in three ways. Firstly, the increased size of local market. People being wealthier means local companies in domestic markets are likely to thrive, creating more job opportunities. But secondly, increased supply of cheap labor. Insofar as individuals are not constrained to landlords anymore, this means they can now seek employment in alternative jobs in these cities, which provides attractive cheap labor to companies, and especially foreign multinational companies, which means there's more investment, especially from foreign countries. Thirdly, we take back control over lucrative natural resources. This looks like Botswana regaining their diamond industry, Nigeria regaining their oil industry, which gets a lot of profit. But the difference is the profit is now to the people of the country. All these proves that we enable people to become more economic affluent in the future. Obviously, this is debate winning, important in and of itself, since the vast majority of people living in African countries are devastating poor and we need to help that on our side of the house. But this argument also has another implication in the round as well, since we would argue that"

Your only incentive as to why this economic redistribution will be done well is that they want to fight against colonialism. If we already are in a post-colonial state, why isn't an overriding incentive to favor your more your closer ethnicity and to favor your cronies? I already gave you three independent mechanisms why it's likely that the individuals are allowed on the ground are able to access economic benefits. I think that's independent from the POI and what you're talking about on your side of the house. The second argument then why economic reform leads to greater political accountability. The thesis under this is that economic liberation leads to better accountability in the long term, in the most successful instance, democratization. Two reasons why this is the case. Firstly, economic development creates greater incentives and capacities on the part of the people to hold governments to account. This is because when people have achieved minimal economic rights, they're likely to start asking for higher levels of rights, like political rights, and have greater capacity to spend their time organizing rallies and gaining information"

These reasons prove why you're likely to get accountability on our side of the house. On the comparative, we would argue that political reform will not create accountable system for three reasons. Firstly, because democratic institutions are very weak. This is because, for example, there's a lack of systems that effectively supervises electoral conduct in many countries. This means elections under opposition have to rely on the good faith of potential candidates. But this is problematic because there's obviously incentive to cheat, like stuffing the ballot box or rigging the election, because not cheating means you significantly reduce the chance of you winning the election since you cannot gather other politicians not cheating. Thus, there becomes a race to the bottom. But secondly, the concentration of wealth results in the capture of politics by wealthy elites. For example, they can aggressively lobby politicians to protect and entrench their veterans' interests, or control media to influence how people think and make decisions. This means in the absence of economic liberalization, which you uniquely get, they're unlikely to ever get a functioning democracy. But thirdly, and importantly, even if elections are to an extent functional, we think democracy leads to ethnocentric politics. This is because the most reasonable platform for politicians in ethnically divided countries is to prioritize certain ethnicities to cement their support and guarantee their votes. I.e., if you're neutral, you're unlikely to get votes from any ethnicity. This means that the best form of politics opposition side gets is one that only caters to the majority and oppresses the minority in places like Kenya, where the Kikuyu people are always prioritized at the expense of other ethnic groups. This also increases tension on their side of the house. The conclusion of this argument is that at best, opposition side gets a dysfunctional system of accountability, comparatively may take a little longer on our side, but we get a proper accountability mech that lasts into the future. I've never been prouder to propose."

A, individuals deserve fair elections that are free from vote buying and intimidation because people deserve agency in the forces that govern them. They deserve to create coalitions and vote for blocs that can represent and negotiate their concerns in politics. B, we would give them the right to assemble, which allows them to formalize their stances and collectivize with those who share similar struggles to join their cause in lobbying. But crucially, greater political rights means they have stronger influence on the government, which dictates both national and local policies and enforces laws and protections for everyone. Before my substantives, a few rebuttals. First, they tell us that we're going to confiscate from the super- rich. Note, this is where more people are likely to be in fear of cracking down and conflict. When you take away from the rich, i.e. the lands of the Afrikaners, they will likely retaliate and take up arms left over from the liberation conflict. The meta here is that it would actually be harder to attain this land, therefore taking a longer time to distribute it to the public, meaning that people will stay poor for still a significantly long amount of time on prop. But secondly, I want to respond to their first claim that post-liberation Africa is poor. Our comparative solves this because we give lands to farmers and revive markets that create jobs. The response here is note that all of this is contingent on the assumption that farmers know what to do with this land, know how to sell this land, and know how to create sustainable markets. Prop had to discuss this through this process or their impact just doesn't happen. I would say that you're unlikely to get this because education is a right that is cemented by civil and political rights when we set up stable political and civil institutions that prop just doesn't have. So people are just left massively uneducated under their side because all they dealt with is conflict and is conflict and liberation. First substantive"

The framing here then is that for centuries, African populations were treated as second-class citizens in their land. We shouldn't repeat mistakes of the past by providing rights to help them construct a stronger identity. A few reasons. One, political rights are necessary to create common identity and curb ethnic violence. A, these rights, such as the freedom to assemble and fair elections, are shaped by people's preferences and are crucial for nation building. People need to and can only be represented by forming coalitions that represent them, e.g. as racial minorities or poor rural groups. In post-colonial South Africa, the white Afrikaner minority restricted the ballot for the African majority, depriving them of representation. The only way to prevent this is through free elections that aren't monopolized by the elite. But we create an inclusive national identity. political rights protect the freedom to practice religion and culture without interference. On our side, the Ndebele people can practice their beliefs without the Shona majority cracking down on them in Zimbabwe. more ethnic participation allows diverse representation of different identities in the academe. This enables policies like that in Botswana, where all 12 ethnic groups' cultures are celebrated in schools. In their world, minorities can't vote or create organizations, since their views are silenced by liberation leaders coming from the majority, i.e. Kenyatta being a kikuyu. See, we mediate conflict and violence. So post-liberation, these states don't have robust systems that quell violence. When citizens are deprived of the ability to decide leaders and feel unrepresented, they default to violence. We saw this in Kenya in 2007, where the rigged elections forced the Luo minority to engage in conflict because a leader was unfairly elected and didn't represent them. In our world, these people are given a peaceful avenue to recognize differences to be ballad. But note, in the absence of a representative parliament, it triggers secession, as we saw with South Sudan feeling unrepresented by the North. With political rights, majority groups have no incentive to include minorities, allowing them to build racist nationalist sentiment against other identities. This is why it's crucial to reinforce the rights of forming blocs and coalitions so that marginalized groups would be incentivized to cause further division. In our world, people wouldn't have resorted to extreme lengths because they have representation by ballot, access, and vote. Second reason, political rights"

One. States are more likely to equally distribute economic development when they have to cater to voting bases beyond their ethnicity. So if people vote for a leader and demand cash transfers and education programs, we are likely to have equitable economic distribution. But two. We ensure sustainable development through taxation, since taxation is only possible when people trust their leaders and governments. We ensure this by allowing the right to vote and allowing people to decide their leaders, as opposed to it being the unelected elite. This means that we get more education and health care that wholly benefit people. Note that this is different from providing economic rights to individuals. But B, on the comparative, economic rights don't lead to civil and political rights. This is why I deal with the second argument when they try to go up by saying it leads to political accountability. I'll prove why that's not true here. So note, there will always be a disparity between the elites and the masses because they will get more resources, either because they are more in number or because they have direct high city government. So even if resources were distributed fairly, you're unlikely to do things like challenge authority, especially when the state can easily take it away using the same power they used to give it to you. So in states like Zimbabwe, citizens know that the lands were seized and expropriated, and property rights were the things that states could easily revoke. This is why a more participatory approach to land distribution can only be done when civil and political rights are secured. We recognize that these are going to be long discussions, but these are done much better when political rights are enshrined first. I'll take the point. We write that political reform is far more difficult since elites have incentive to monopolize on political rights given they want more stability in the government. Yeah, under our side, we would rather enshrine political and civil rights where we strengthen the current government and the rights that people deserve, as opposed to having an unelected elite being the person in power without any checks and balances. Twofold impacts our first argument. One, we ensure post-liberation Africa gets short-term stability, which is crucial because you need short-term stability to get to long-term change. But two, we demonstrate that we get more sustainable economic development when we ensure that there is trust in the state and greater accountability in the process."

The framing here is that these post-colonial nations lack transparent bureaucratic processes, have weak institutions and inefficient checks and balances.

One, the struggle for liberation, no thank you, was unequal, with concentrated power towards certain groups as granted by the colonizers. So some ethnic groups were given more rights and more land compared to others. So A, ethnicities had different contributions towards the revolutionary struggle. For instance, in Kenya, the Kikuyu ethnic group were the largest group that contributed in the Mau Mau uprising because they were the strongest group with the most access to resources.

The process of redistribution will be incredibly corrupt. Dominant ethnicities can redistribute land towards themselves rather than to minority groups. So unofficial from the Hausa tribe can prioritize their kin and not give land to the rightful owner from the Igusa tribe can prioritize their kin and not give land to the rightful owner from the Igbo tribe. So these conflicts over land cannot be solved by any pragmatic means or economic reasoning because the point of tension is a group's historical or cultural claim to this. This then further drives economic tensions. In our world, political rights are less prone to corruption as it is much easier to implement by giving access to ballots. Moreover, any unfair distribution is more likely to be scrutinized since all groups want universal access due to the fear of being disenfranchised next. But B, this process is likely to descend into violence. Why? One, the expropriated land and businesses are likely to have had existing Afrikaner owners with vested interests. Just like the Rhodesian Bush War, they would have likely had arms and funds left over from the conflict. This proves that on side prop, their world is more prone to mismanagement and failure.

But if you think about it, it's quite strange when their analysis themselves is your ability to have money can decide, can ensure that you influence politics. But if you take away their wealth, if you take away their land, if you take away the things that they're able, that they need to survive, or the fact that you will encroach on them and take away property, I'm quite sure that there's a much bigger encroachment on you, something that will likely require violence and force, and therefore that will likely mean it's bloodshed on their side. But even in the best case where they succeed, it's the fact that in the process of trying to attain it, they will likely be met with resistance, which likely means more people will die as a consequence.

You didn't have an oversight of the land. That was the sad reality a lot of these farmers went through.

                "text": "destitute. Therefore, that's not the margin of this debate. Second, on political rights, there are claims to say that you have weak institutions and you can lobby governments. One, there's a greater incentive to strengthen these institutions at the point at which you enshrine these rights. It's much easier since it's inalienable and universal, especially when a lot of liberation leaders had to ensure that the majority were behind them. Mandela had to ensure that the Black majority were enfranchised. So it's quite unclear as to why they wouldn't do that under their side. But secondly, lobbying doesn't matter when obviously the majority of the people in that country are still Africans, and therefore they're still likely to want to outvote the white African minority. But secondly, your legitimacy as, for instance, the ANC, is based on ensuring that you give benefits to those people and therefore it is unclear to what extent that lobbying still occurs under their side. What did they say then? They say that we create ethnic politics under our side. But the nuance here is quite simple. Insofar as you need to win votes and you need to ensure that you win as, get a wider base as possible, it's the fact that politics actually disincentivizes you from being nativistic and from being racist. The fact that you need to get votes out from your group but from different groups to be able to out-compete other politicians is a unique disincentive under our side to alienate people. Under their side, there is no incentive at all to try to be inclusive, to try to pander to different groups. And at their point, that is where you're more likely to incite violence when these people have no alternatives whatsoever, when these politicians are more likely to be inflammatory and aggressive. That is what happens then, and their side will likely lead to more violence. Their only response under our side was an attempt to say that the tipping point actually is when politicians don't fulfill their promises. I don't think this is the case, because the fact that other politicians will just say that they will be able to fix those things and be able to ensure that you get that economic welfare, which likely means our comparative where you get little to no representation for minorities is a tipping point for violence. Before I move on to the extension, I'll take a point. Your concession that politicians need to get votes off so they're going to cater towards ethnic groups is literally our case. We're telling you in the comparative they don't have to do this because they're going to be a revolutionary group and that we're happy to trade off elections. You have to agree to the comparative. Politicians win on margins. You need to cater to a wide base because if not, you're more likely to lose. Under your side, if they are an unaccountable elite, to what extent are they more willing to cater to minority groups? To what extent are they willing to redistribute that land to people not of their ethnic majority? Politicians, political rights, and accountability that is inherent to our side is the sole disincentive to ensure that ethnic cronyism happens under our side. The extension then is that this allows greater foreign investment into democratic states. And I think investment is more likely to flow into democratic states than authoritarian ones under their side for two reasons. One, investors look at key indices like the Freedom House Index as a metric of how politically stable the country is. Investors don't want to channel money into countries with high corruption as they're unlikely to yield a return of investment as officials can pocket more money under their side insofar as they're unaccountable. But the second thing to point out is the US, post-Cold War, wanted to prevent countries from opting into communism and spent billions funding democratic states. So they wanted to ensure that strong democratic rights were there. They're more likely to invest in countries that are more democratic and authoritarian than under their side. The reason why this is important is even if there's some degree of inequality under our side, and we would assume that it's true, that we amass more resources on net. Because in Proposition's best case, when you redistribute existing land and engage in cash transfers, the amount of wealth circulating is largely minimal because all the reasons they say themselves, that these people were unlikely to earn large wages. fact that the the colonizers extracted a lot of wealth through plunder extracted their natural resources meant the only way to ensure we increase the size of the pie overall is to ensure greater foreign investment under their side investors know that that the government can take away their land at any moment and therefore you weaken things like investor confidence much more we win on the political side of the thing of things but we also ensure"

                "text": "Firstly, then on our points about economic benefits. Now, I just want to, first of all, engage their point that they brought up in their deputy about how there will be foreign investments in these countries because there's democracy. I just want to question the feasibility of this, because it's extremely speculative, right? Presumably, these investors won't invest billions of dollars into the nation just because they're the democratic. This didn't happen, empirically speaking, and therefore, it's not very likely that that investment will exist. Their side has to actually mechanize why this is feasible. Now, our argument here was that economic benefits are likely to happen for many of the mechanisms that we gave. I'm going to engage to what they engaged to one by one. First of all, they say that, like, why would the government distribute fairly, right? But our engagement to this is that the people who are likely to be in power is the nationalists who overturned the government that used to rule in the past. So when there's no elections, they have incentive to not to anger the people, because the way in which they got the power initially to overturn the governments is by the popular power, right? Moreover, the way in which they get overthrown, their current state of power gets overthrown is through massive protests and such. Therefore, insofar as they have an active incentive to try not to anger the majority, they have the incentive to try to distribute this land fairly amongst all ethnicities. Therefore, this is a mechanism for why the government is likely to distribute fairly. And then secondly, they say something about how ethnic unaccountability and how the record of lands is not there. Two responses. Firstly, factually, I challenge this on set, right? We can just counterassert that there is record of land, given the fact that these are likely to be from like 200 years ago. It's still likely that things like land records still existed. And moreover, given that developed nations like England was the one who invaded these countries, it's very likely that they kept precise note of who was in rule of which area. But secondly, presumably, given the incentive that I said earlier about how governments have the incentive to allocate fairly, it's very likely that the government will allocate fairly. But then thirdly, they challenge the feasibility of this argument that elites would get really, really mad and you would have to fight them. I'm going to flip this argument and say that elites are more likely to be mad on their side of the house. Because the thing is, on both sides of the house, you're going to enrage the elites to a certain degree. Because they're both affected by their political monopoly being taken away and their economic capacity being taken away and being risk distributed, right? The comparative then becomes on which side is elites likely to be less mad. Now, elites are likely to be less mad on our side of the house because even if they lose some of their land, they're still likely to be an upper class, right? However, when you actually give the people the right to actually speak up, and if all side government says it's true, it's very likely that then their whole power will collapse, and therefore it's very likely that their whole land will be taken away. They'll suffer disproportionate impacts. Therefore, it's very likely that elites are more interested in presuming a monopoly over the political rights in land. Then the fourth thing. So even if we can't claim fair distributions, which is our worst case, by putting economic and land reparation at the priority, we have reasonable fiat to say that even if the extent of the impact we can claim is relatively marginal, we can still claim some kind of impact on land and economy, and therefore there will be some allocation of land and economy to the people on the ground. I'm going to take this argument a step further then. So I'm going to prove to you why even if you get unfair distribution, i i.e. only small portion of the land, why we can still claim all of our benefits and why that's ground winning. So we told you, and this is for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that we told you in first that multiplier effects happen. So if you have your own land, presumably you can grow crops, you can sell it, and you are likely to make decisions in a way that maximizes your utility and how it multiplies this money, which means that we can claim our impact on the economic benefits for the individuals on the ground. They minorly engage with this by saying that these people don't have education. But even if you don't have education, you have the ability to assess what maximizes your utility, right? For example, growing two crops increases your capacity to stay safe economically and such. Therefore, I don't think these are hard decisions. They can claim this without education. But secondly, this is like individuals are likely to like economic reforms produce linear outcomes and politics is very zero sum. So the problem with political reform is that it's all or none. So in other words, even if you're granted the right to vote, if the government doesn't have the incentive to listen to you and does things like election fraud, it's very unlikely that it creates any pragmatic change. On our side of the house, if you're given even just a small number of money, it can lead to bigger outcomes for the reason that we provided above. Therefore, it's very likely that if the comparative is that on their side, you get a small portion of political rights, and on our side, you get a small portion of economic rights, the comparative lies on our side. With that, why is this in and of itself debate winning in the sense that even if we lose out on all of the democratic benefits, we can win independently on economy? Because it's very likely that for the majority of individuals in this debate, which are extremely poor farmers in post-colonial Africa, they're literally struggling to find food on the table and they're unable to get education and the right to free speech is unlikely to be of much importance."

So your only mitigation that this causes civil violence when the elite rises up is that they're going to have some of their land left. But if I'm not mistaken, isn't all of the land of these elite unjustly acquired by these people? Even if it's unjustly acquired, we framed a model that they would be redistributed to the people to a portion of degree. So they're likely that they're still going to be able to own some kind of land and therefore we can still claim all very impacts so by the end of this I'm able to prove to you that economy can be claimed on our side even if it's a small portion which leads to a bigger impact and that's why we independently win I'm going to engage secondly on the theme of democracy two things firstly why the ethnic tension will get worse on their side secondly why we can get sustainability firstly then why the tension between ethnicity will likely get worse. So this is by far the least important delta in the debate, and so far as these ethnic minorities are likely to be caring more about financial liberations than whatever their ability to like free speech and etc. But essentially, all of PM's material was that division between ethnicities exists, and giving them political voice in elections will lead to more sustainable politics. I have three or four engagements. Firstly, this tension will exist symmetrically, right? Yong-ho already told you this. Even if you don't give them votes, supposedly there will be a huge fight over which ethnicity is the most powerful in politics. Therefore, this point is completely destroyed insofar as this tension is likely to exist symmetrically. But secondly, let me break down their premise, that coalition and voice will not matter in this debate. Because the crucial context of this debate is that this exists in a paradigm where there's a lack of political infrastructure, given that they just recently got independence. Therefore, it's very likely that there's likely not much accountability. This means that the current government, if their side is true in saying that they have bad incentives, is likely to manifest in the worst forms, like, for example, oppression of these coalitions and these voices. Therefore, it's not very likely that this matters in the debate. Thirdly, I'm going to flip their arguments in two ways. Firstly, the ethnic group that likely overthrew the colonial government is the ethnic party that supposedly got the support from a majority of other ethnic groups because they needed arms and they needed that power, right? Therefore, we can claim that these parties actually have the incentive to cater to other ethnic minorities as well. But secondly, you significantly increase the capacity for ethnicities to be disproportionately be affected in politics. Because insofar as there is election, it's much more likely that they will want to secure votes. And the easiest way for politicians to do so is ethnicity, right? This increases fighting on the grounds of ethnicities. They say something else that they want to cater to the majority, but that's really hard to do do the easiest way to garner support as a politician exactly given their framing that ethnic tension is likely exist in these nations is to cater to people's interest of their ethnicities and therefore this ethnic tension will likely get worse on their side of"

Firstly, if it's true that political rights won't be respected, it is unclear to opposition why redistribution won't be respected will suddenly be respected as well. It is unclear why proposition seems to assert that a lot of the harms and a lot of the loopholes and deletes, something that they'll pursue in political redistribution, but suddenly they won't do it in economic redistribution, especially since Prop 1 didn't just claim that they're going to redistribute wealth, they're also going to redistribute these sources of wealth, and that means the elites can't even recoup the wealth even if they lose it. But secondly, they said that there's a lack of political infrastructure. It's also unclear why, on their side, they suddenly have sufficient economic infrastructure to ensure equitable redistribution across all ethnic groups. Especially since what we explain down the bench is that a lot of minorities were barred from owning these lands. A lot of their records might not even be existent exactly because they were not allowed to own these things. If there were, it is the fact that they were decades and even centuries apart and are likely to be disputed within each other given that colonizers made arbitrary lines and divided communities up. It's unclear then why Proposition is able to assure that their policy will succeed. And this is important because a lot of their benefits literally rely on equitable distribution and it being successful. This is not to say that political representation is something that is successful on our side. What the opposition has to prove is that it will be marginally better and that we're able to lessen the majority of the extreme harms that we have explained."

                "text": "On to the clashes then. Chat, please. Firstly, which is the prerequisite? Economic or political rights? I want to raise two points. One, you need accountable democratic institutions to ensure a lot of proposition benefits, especially if the proposition model is a committee. Like what if that committee is sorry, especially since the reason of a common enemy existing as an incentive is not compelling at all, given that these colonizers are already gone. But secondly, they said it's revolutionary leaders and the only reason that they gave as to why they usually come from the minorities because they have a lot to fight for. But you also want to take note that even people from the majority were also oppressed, that's why they even joined the revolution to begin with. We gave you structural reasons as to why they tend to be in the majority groups. First is that they're the ones that can easily round up more people to join the revolution to begin with. We gave you structural reasons as to why they tend to be in the majority groups. First is that they're the ones that can easily round up more people to join the revolution exactly because they came from the dominant group. But secondly, that they are richer and can fund the revolution. That is what happened in Zimbabwe. The conclusion to this is that on their side of the house, they literally have to contend that the redistribution will literally be handled by elites or people from the majoritarian groups. The problem is that they have no checks and balances, at least we do. The second thing I want to deal with is that the elite can skew elections. Firstly, if this is actively rigging, we have whistleblowers and journalists. If anything, it's on their side where rigging is more potent because we never tried establishing a bill of rights we never tried to ensure the protection of whistleblowers and journalists on our side of the house if they try to suppress journalists around like a politician tries to do that that's even if they don't get like found out it's already a red flag and it implicates themselves already. But secondly, on this point that people are beholden to landowners and that's why their vote will be skewed. One, how will they know who you vote for? Your vote is private in the voting booth. But secondly, that's why we need constitutions that will protect human rights. It is a false dichotomy that we have to defend owners not paying their workers well because that is literally things that are protected in constitutions which we are able to strengthen when we preclude political rights before economic representation to begin with so in conclusion i would posit that political rights do preclude economic benefits and it is untrue that a proposition can claim otherwise the second"

So on your comparative on which one is a prerequisite, our claim was that you don't need accountable parties to claim our impact on the economy. Insofar as being given a small portion of land is enough for our whole impact to stand in a way to stand in this debate. How do you engage with that? If assuming the best case that they give you that land having the question if the state can take it away which they could especially if you can't vote if especially if you can rally and especially if you can't even assemble together the second issue then on preventing conflict and mediating differences before i proceed i want to point out the contradiction so p3 says that the elite don't like political rights, but P2 argues that they prefer political rights. So which really is it? We think it's one or the other. And this is important because this literally takes out a lot of the reputation that P3 launches or else it contradicts their partner. Three things I want to point out. If it's true that landowners and the elites are immensely powerful, I would like to ask how will they react? We suggest that it would be a violent way. The comparative on our side is that we incite violence less. Why? Because taxation does not remove their wealth massively or entirely. And this is important because on their side, you're literally removing their source of wealth. On our side, even if you tax it, since they still have the source of their wealth, they can recruit that wealth anyway. So there's more buy-in. But secondly, they said that the only point of democracies being majoritarian, one, smaller groups can form coalitions and blocs to get representatives. But additionally, ethnicities would be very wary when legislation about repression about other ethnicities are being passed on. And the reason as to why is because they're scared that they might be the next ethnicity that will be subjected to this type of policy. But secondly, in the most consequential legislation that usually happens on amendments, that usually happens in massive funding bills, you often need a super majority. So there's an incentive to actually appeal to groups, even smaller ones, if you want legislation to pass. And that's how the incentive for the majorities even care about smaller ethnic groups. Lastly, assuming the worst case, democracies offer a non-violent alternative, especially since it's inherent for people to have disagreements. Like let's assume that they're both ethnically different. That is not going to disappear on proposition side. Democracies allow an avenue that is not violent inherently, that you can vote for different representatives, that can join different political blocs and have disagreeing ideology. Even if you still lead the conflict, it becomes a last resort instead of a first resort. On their side, because they have funds to arms as proposition says, if that's the case, then it's literally more likely, especially since ethnic strife might still be existent on their side. On the last issue then, on the access to basic needs and development. One is on the access to basic needs. We have access is on the access to basic needs. We have access to welfare because we have transparent governments which means spending goes into public housing, education, and healthcare. On their side, you have to believe that everyone will be able to spend properly."

This is to make sure that places like Malawi, for example, have access to resources like waters or roads to transport goods. It's unclear to me how having a parcel of land would even matter if you don't have a water line going through it or a road that can transport your goods to begin with. But secondly, it is short-term because of the high risk of mismanagement, especially if we're talking about people who went from handling small-scale industries to massive resources. In Zimbabwe, the abrupt land expropriation caused severe food shortages. In Ghana and Zambia, the mining industry tanked because they were run by inexperienced people. This is important because once the resources are mismanaged, it's difficult to go back once you've starved people that has already happened. We conclude then that if you want to preserve not only the political and human rights of these people, but also economic development, but also in the future, we compel you to side with the opposition.

So for instance, the Hausa majority or the Tutsi majority or the Tutsi ethnicities within those countries. What that means is they're only hanging thread for all their benefits. The incentive to redistribute fairly is disproven and the impact is massive. It's not just that they have little benefit benefit but also leads to more ethnic violence when native lands are unfairly distributed to other ethnicities and away from those ethnicities which likely means it leads to more conflict under their end.

Firstly, on the incentive of elites, my question here is quite simple. Would you rather risk losing all of your money or give up a large amount but still live comfortably? I think it's the latter. Because even if you lose a lot of money as an elite, they are so powerful that this doesn't impact the standard of living for these individuals as much. The larger harm for them is losing all of their political rights, because that means all of the rest of their money was also going to get taken away. And that was why it was significantly harder for opposition to claim that change is going to happen on their side, because elites are less willing to give this up. Secondly, on accountability, we come analytically prior here because we structurally prove why we're more likely to get accountability because when things like governments getting overthrown happen, when military coups happen, it is far easier for people to hold governments accountable for taking away their land than taking away their political rights because whether or not a political right exists is very subjective."

That's not on our burden. Rather, we told you that even if people use this land in a terrible way, having economic benefits was the prerequisite to getting political rights. And this was the winning argument that we didn't get engagement from. This is for two reasons. One, that having good constitutions do not matter if people cannot go to that voting booth, if people cannot go to that rally in protest because they have to be working on their farm 24-7 because their landlords take away all of their money. But secondly, even if you can go to the voting booth on their side, there are invisible measures, there are invisible measures like election fraud, which are likely to happen on their side, as we see in the status quo in Africa. They needed to engage with this because insofar as they don't, we come analytically prior to them."

All they say is that land is likely to be taken away. Let's be charitable and say it's speculative at best as to who gets more of what, whether we get more political rights or they get more economic benefits. We still win this for two reasons. First, because of the sustainability wing that I gave you at the top that we're able to help and influence millions and increasingly more number of people on a scale. But second, on the money multiplier effect that we told you about down the bench, that political reform is all or nothing, where you have to make the government listen or the majority to opt into you to get any reforms. For economic reforms, we told you there were likely to be linear outcomes. So even if the amount of money you got at the start was small, even if governments redistributed this in an unfair way, you can find ways to make your life better with that. And we specifically told you that this was likely to have trickle-down benefits for the most vulnerable individuals, because they never proved why they're able to help those people on a structural matter we told you that when middle class individuals get money which is likely to happen for the characterization we gave you about who was likely to be the people in power which was Nationalist on our side those people had an incentive to do this which means that they were likely to make things like farms they were likely to start things like small businesses which hired the most vulnerable which made money circulate in our economy they needed to respond to our analysis for all those reasons propose thank you for that speech thanks everyone for the debate"

Firstly, we think post-colonial African states share a few characteristics, namely, one, strong grassroots movements formed during colonial rule to fight for independence. Two, their economic system was designed for colonizers to extract wealth from them, so poverty is rampant. And three, note that all post-colonial African states in the status quo pursued a mixed bag of political and economic strategies. So this debate must be about reimagining the world on which of the two we should have prioritized at the point of independence under the rule of a good faith government. Otherwise, neither team can deliver"

This will look like roughly three things. Firstly, establishing committees responsible for fairly redistributing wealth and property who prioritize distribution from those who unfairly took wealth under colonialism to the economically disenfranchised. Secondly, establishing quotas within the workplace and schools to ensure equitable access to employment and education. And thirdly, cash transfer programs to marginalized groups. Three, we think in reimagining the world, a post-colonial Africa, absent of civil and political rights, will not be a society that lacks all fundamental human rights. This is because local leaders in a newly independent state have directly suffered under colonialism, incentivizing them to ensure that the basic humanity which was eroded under colonial powers is now safeguarded. Therefore, fundamental human rights such as the freedom from slavery and torture exist, whereas civil and political rights such as expression, the political expression and assembly are not specifically codified by the law.

                "text": "in this speech. The first on how immediate economic relief is second to none in safeguarding the livelihoods and upliftment of African nations. There are three parts underneath this argument. First of all, I'd like to note that in the hierarchy of competing rights, economic upliftment must supersede political empowerment. This is because economic rights are instrumental to the right to life, because the biggest obstacle is in the state. It's starvation, disease, and intergenerational poverty. Finite resources mean that millions spent to build voting booths on op could have been used to feed the malnourished and earn acceptable income so their children could go to school instead of being forced into child labor. Perishing means there aren't any political expressions to be made, because when you survive, it becomes your utmost priority. The right to life is a gateway right that is fundamental to human dignity and comes prior to everything else. Why then is saving lives exclusively a prop? Because it's a time-sensitive issue. Lives are at stake. Democracy requires the state to carefully debate, pass, and implement public policies. So even if you get political rights, economic policies will only come way after. In the meantime, the lives we lose waiting for immediate relief are irreversible. But economic policies on the side of op will be far less efficient, as state resources are stretched thin for nationwide projects. On-prompt, direct cash transfers and land in the hands of the people gives them the agency to ameliorate their specific economic situation. Those who need medical care and shelter can get it directly instead of waiting on the state to develop things like public housing or hospitals. But secondly, we think our economic reparations uniquely empower the people in a few key ways. In many African states, natives were robbed of their land and consigned to barren parts of the country. In South Africa, the 1913 Natives Land Act was apartheid's original sin because it conscripted Black South Africans who formed 76% of the population and restricted them to land ownership in just a tenth of the country's land, systematically shutting them out of metropolitan cities. Only we reverse it by the restoration of land rights because ownership over land land improves integration between ethnic groups, because we prevent things like segregation, and we allow individuals to use their land as collateral for things like investment to build their wealth. We don't provide access to education and jobs for disenfranchised groups. It opens up access to income streams where otherwise they would be impoverished, allowing access to upward social mobility but lastly we think economic reparations in the wake of decolonization addresses Africa's crippling underdevelopment because their underdevelopment stems from foreign powers using them to extract natural resources and exploit cheap labor when consumers are impoverished there isn't a viable market and labor exploitation perpetuates the cycle of poverty because workers never gain adequate disposable income to attract meaningful FDI. Economic reparations means consumers will have purchasing power. Hence, foreign investors won't stop at just setting up low-cost supply chains. Rather, they'll set up businesses and invest in the growing economy. This sparks job creation and lessens the economic burden of the state when FDI contributes towards growth. But without economic reparations, we think opposition creates a unique vulnerability in africa as prolonged destitution means they're more prone to the outbreak of things like conflicts disease and death the lack of resources exacerbates existing social ills and is insufficient to create any meaningful impact before i move on to the second argument sure i'll take point. In a post-colonial impoverished, largely backward economy like Africa, who creates all these jobs, has enough money to create healthcare and education, and how?"

Because note that the implementation of rights is also contingent on resources. If you solely want to make this debate the fact that post-colonial African nations are broke and they have absolutely zero resources, your side cannot claim your benefits as well. Moving on to the second argument as to how civil and political rights cannot be exercised meaningfully without new wealth. Three parts here. The first, wealth inherently allows participants of a democracy to gain the political system in two ways. One, through lobbying. The financial elite and the state will collude to create an ecosystem of power at the top where political and economic favors are constantly exchanged. Companies that receive state subsidies and contracts inevitably cement themselves as the dominant market force, and these newly crowned financial elite then fund political campaigns of the ruling parties to continue receiving these"

                "text": "political rights are strongly entrenched, like in the US, where lobbying actively undermines the public will. But two, we think meaningful access to free speech and association is impossible without money, because the financial elite who dominate mainstream media have excessive channels to exercise those rights, their platforms to shape public opinions in their favor and a greater influence in determining which parties and candidates get into power thus we leave you not challenged the concentration of wealth the financial elite heavy chokehold on power what keeps them in the driving seat of democracy is to keep others locked in an inescapable poverty trap by the deregulation of industries, low wages, and low redistribution of wealth, which is exactly what we see in Africa today. But the second part of this argument is how economic oppression is in the heart of African suffering, and political rights uniquely fail to alleviate it. Because the lack of economic enfranchisement means that while segregation may be abolished on paper, it's purely tokenistic, because Black South Africans stay trapped in slums because they simply do not have the resources to move elsewhere while white Afrikaners prosper across city lines. That is the world of modern apartheid that opposition stands for. We think therefore money is the prerequisite for the state to enshrine rights because when faced with limited resources in a nation's coffers, the state has no choice but to trade off certain rights. In those instances, the wealthiest actors who have the largest political say get their rights paradise. Finally, we put power back in the hands of people by giving them wealth, because disposable income empowers individuals to make their political opinions impactful. They're able to fund campaigns and signal their strength to governments because it cements their influence as an important voter block. Hunger rings louder than any political promise. On opposition, they hand the impoverished words, we uniquely grant them the ticket to survival. I'm so proud to propose."

If a government, for instance, is all the power and all the resources and determining how land is distributed. I think they have the ability to give a lot of these land to their friends. They have the ability to do things like cement the dominant, that their power in some way, for instance, like this happened in Singapore in singapore right okay first argument then how does proposition increase ethnic and political violence the first thing i note here is that most african countries and nations just have sign they just have like extremely diverse religious parties in general they're incredibly diverse post colonization why because i think the british and french often like actively brought different ethnic groups from their areas and they colonized in order to do things like mine certain precious minerals, for example, or do things like set up railways. Right. Therefore, they needed like large labor pools in that sense. But secondly, I think they wanted to divide and conquer policy so that different minorities could not just unite and rise up in protest against them. And I think that's why they drew borders arbitrarily. Now, here's the thing.

Now, note, why is it going to be hard because like look i think the failure literally means that you're literally taking away money from that say one tribe and giving that money away from the other tribe it looks like giving taking money from the virtues and giving it the tootsies for example the reason you have this incentive is because the right to let's say the because like right after you become independent you want to get resources right you want to help your loved ones in your in these oppressed tribes but also you don't have like greater tensions until like the negotiation processes actually get ugly let's be clear on what happens on the comparative firstly i think we get far more that we can like power sharing agreements on our side between the majority and minority tribes a lot more because democracy itself involves this process of negotiation to figure out the best way to represent people it It looks like the majority and minority tribes are getting different areas of land and redistribution of natural resources between these tribes because they have that common agreement to help ensure the democratic right to vote is within people. Why is this so much better than their side of the house? The first thing I note here is it involves better relations, no thank you, between parties and incentives for them to portray these relations with their populace. It looks like keeping each party in check with regards to abuses. That is to say, if one party abuses against their people, for instance, the other tribe can do more to show how they're better. In that sense, I think it also incentivizes each party to give reparations and economic goods to those people on the ground, because there's a ways to the top. Look at the implication here, panel. This literally coop see a lot of population benefits on that sense secondly even if like power sharing agreements you have shared like the unifying narrative of the government is like really important here right because this is when you look at like the unified this is literally when you like look at the unified history right one of your independence like how you have the right to democracy right the right to self-govern this is better because the narrative is far better because it forces tribes to focus on the common goals either way panel on proposition side there's backlash there's backlash from different stakeholders in post-colonial african states in the case of reallocation of resources from one ethnic type to another the fact that they're like long years of tribalism it means that it's far worse and far harsher because i think like you would refocus on who would come into power right as a result it's going to be less accountability on their side of the house you literally internalize racist narratives what are the impacts of this the first thing is this is a significant decrease in conflict on our side of the house because it involves fewer people notice how bad propositions world is oftentimes these communities get closer to each other and they can be impoverished the"

Your argument on preventing ethnic conflict is contingent on political participation. But if people are still suffering tangibly because their economic needs aren't fulfilled on your side of the house. They simply don't have the time nor the resources to engage in politics. The first thing I note here is that, look, we literally give you two reasons as to why people are incredibly likely to be participating here. Why? Because there are father figure narratives, for instance, there's the narrative of independence. I think on our side of the house, there is going to be political participation. I think that's symmetric. The difference is the fact that there's going to be more conflict on your side of the house. Right. But more crucially, never actually proved to us that you're going to get like fair redistribution in the first place. The summary of this argument here is that people fight a lot more on propositions world. The fighting worsens the issues on their side. Second argument, I think this outweighs the majority of the proposition case, because I want to prove here why democracy is just far better than drug operations. At its most basic level, I think the right to choose is a prerequisite to utility. Because note, at the point of a nation democracy, a lot of people have similar wants."

Like they can put bad economic policies, for example, they can be inflation, they can be political instability that can make your plot of land literally worthless on their side of the house. The ability to vote is what ensures politicians fix these issues. Why is democracy so certain, on the other hand? It's because people have similar goals. They have similar policies when nation building. They stop government abuse on our side of the house. They can vote for basic infrastructure bills. The leaders on the opposition's world are not necessarily going to be that great with economic policy in the first place.

Was this the will of the people? Was what opposition needed to answer?

Moving on to observations and responses. Note that first on their mechanism, they wanted to just assert that they would have free and fair elections and in response to our harm that they did not prepare for, would just simply ban lobbying. Note firstly, this is just a literal frivolous response. You can't just assert banning lobbying, especially in the context of post-colonial African states where these are nascent democracies. And we've also outlined and highlighted that even in entrenched democracy and strong Western liberal ones, lobbying isn't actually banned. But even if we assume this were to be true, they never actually responded with this catch-all response towards the argumentation at all. Because we told you two unique things regardless if you ban political lobbying. Number one, in terms of even if you ban political lobbying, what is the enforcement mechanism insofar as they still haven't told us why the individuals on the ground are financially empowered to actually be act in order to actually be political agents within society to hold them accountable. But number two, social privilege still existed, which meant that the second analysis that came up from first proposition as to how the elite control media. The elite are the ones that control TV and airtime and interviews, only the wealthy and privileged and the words that they say hold weightage in society. So regardless, even if you believe you could ban lobbying, these social influences that you had still existed,"

It was about corporations implicitly giving a large sum of money to large political candidates and assuming implicitly there's a promise for certain outcomes and certain policies so their catch-all response in their own mechanism and their own setup does not actually work and they can't just assert that it will be done well because note that it first the Poy to first off proposition is entirely entirely disingenuous in terms of they want us to defend our broken system that for some reason if we are the same government and the same structure on our side it will be done badly on our side these malevolent actors will subvert the economic redistribution but on their side in the same actor that would run the same political rights they would do it perfectly and give it to each and every individual.

                "text": "case needs to concede to prop. But on to material responses. On the idea of conflict, not that we think it's highly simplistic why conflict exists as the backbone of the case. They said that you're angry at the minorities for taking money and redistributing it to individuals. Note that this exact same analysis applies to them because the majority that was privileged from colonialism under divide and conquer, certain ethnicities benefited more. Certain ethnicities were granted the right to education through English schools, for example. Some of them were allocated to more proliferating and more socially uplifting jobs, for example, in the agriculture sector, where some individuals were forced to work in the mines, which means that granting them equal, if not the same political rights, and in a case where they would be the overwhelming majority, would also make you pissed off at minorities and equate to the same kinds of outcomes. The only assertion as to why you would be able to correct this is power sharing agreements that incentivizes the race to the top, and therefore you co-opt all the propositions benefits in the first place. We told you in our second proposition speaker two things. In terms of number one, political participation is unlikely to exist insofar as the individuals are the most impoverished, which meant that it isn't the race to the top, but rather it's extremely easy to cater to the simplistic needs of individuals on the ground to keep them quiet. It looks like giving them financial aid from politicians and say, vote for me, giving them bags of rice, and therefore that is sufficient for them to vote for you in office, which means that they don't get a raise to their top because it's extremely easy to sway these individuals into voting into those systems. So it's likely the exact opposite insofar as you're able to exploit the individuals where you don't give them economic resuscitation in order to mobilize but second is more important than reparations all they say here is that the right to choose is important and the democracy fosters transparency before i move on to the point i'll move on to this i'll take a point she talked about how rich white people are the minority but they have the majority of political and economic power so isn't it more likely that the black majority will be able to vote these people out and potentially regain some amount of power, which doesn't happen on your side? The entire second argument from first proposition was explaining to you why money was important in deciding political outcomes in terms of the social influences, the social spheres, because the status quo based on their vote should not be the status quo that we see today. But the only reason of logic for why democracy is more important than reparations is the right to choose. We told you straight up from first proposition why the right to choose takes a backseat insofar as exercising the autonomy requires you to be in a certain level of financial privilege to access all of those sorts of things. Whether individuals even vote in the first place is questionable insofar as people care more about their financial survivability in the meantime. I think this takes out two of their argumentations, but it was also comparative, the only thing Proposition was willing to do. On to a third argumentation then, as to why economic empowerment is the backbone of a healthy democracy. Three parts. A, economic upliftment is exactly what elevates the social class of citizens to become the working class majority. Quotas for unemployment, land for businesses, and disposable income to increase employability are all the conditions PrEP creates to mobilize the impoverished to the working class. This translates to more participation within the education system when children no longer have to"

This is also non-contingent on whether the leader actually has good incentives or not. Which actors invest? Foreign companies and NGOs of the west are irreplaceable. Why? Because they are by miles the richest actor that can invest in other countries. Their history of acquiring resources through colonization, their presence of strong institutions help them incentivize foreign investment. We give them two unique benefits that they mitigate. First, we give businesses guaranteed rights to democratic checks and balances. Businesses from the West are used to certain legal practices and norms like guaranteed property rights, IP laws, and civil liberties, which means more familiarity. They let this be when you have people previously owned property forcibly seized and redistributed, especially white contacts that you know. This is bad for business confidence. Secondly, we think during the Cold War, there is heaps of backlash about everything that is even remotely socialist. The US is increasingly McCarthyist. They have an incentive as the torchbearers of democracy to actively invest in countries that show democratic potential. We instantly got that. They mitigate it. Now, before I get into even their best case in terms of FDI, I'll take a few. You wanted to co-opt all of our economic benefits, such as land redistribution.

I think I made that painfully clear. Later on, democracy works, you have more accountability, you are able to have peaceful negotiation.

If governments are inherently racist or democracies are never flourishing, then how do you ever get equitable distribution of land? First, both sides assume it's the same actor, it's the same government. So clearly, if it's a bad faith actor, then none of your rights will also be equitably distributed because the people at the top want to preserve their power for themselves. Second, assuming they were still allowed to be racist or any forms of bigotry, laws and rights are contingent upon enforcement. So just because it's written in the Constitution, we protect your right to property, we protect your right to free speech. If you are still racist, then they're likely to not have enforcement. But secondly, I think the way this works is most of the racism doesn't come directly from the get go because clearly at this point, all tribes have the common goal of exiling the oppressor. So once the colonizer has left, you don't have these forms of innately evil incentives. Most of these things only come because you're able to hijack the political system. So given that we've told you the hijacking of the political system comes from the way you're able to hoard wealth from first prop that went completely unresponded to, this does not stand. So even if we don't get complete benevolence, the way it works is because we don't have these innate incentives from the very get-go, means you're better able to hold them accountable over time. First issue, can we actually get our policy? So I want to note they have two main responses here. The first is that they claim in second op that economic issues are not the expertise of liberation leaders. I want you to review your notes and consider whether this is persuasive.

So clearly not all of them have no food on the table, but we're able to enable people to break a poverty cycle, which affects everyone on that on a good level. But second, I want you to know that votes are still likely to be highly unimpactful because you're delegating your political power to someone else and they make decisions on behalf of you the difference here is that money gives you autonomy for you to decide what's best for yourself political votes are way more uncertain in terms of outcome because you may vote for someone else but you still have other interests that are still ignored so for example if there are three ethnicities but only two of those ethnicities get their elected representatives in power that one ethnicity is still like to be ignored per their own analysis that they're likely to have differences within them the difference is that wealth is getting given towards those communities even if some communities have less are still oppressed under our side because of differences the difference is wealth can then protect yourself you can create self-sustaining communities. You can then trade with different things, which means that you remove your biases and say this is a person from another ethnicity because we're all engaging on economic grounds. The second thing I want to talk about here is the ability to exercise our rights. Prop simplifies the debate. From the start, we were charitable and took the trade-off. Yes, you would get votes. Yes, you get free speech. That was low-hanging fruit because instead of claiming you could get free speech and free association you have to prove why it was meaningful we told you why when you have all these people and also meant that the people the people in power are the ones that are most likely to be able to use these levers of the political institutions things like you'll never be able you're able to go to court but whether you can win the court case is something entirely different I want to note that their response here was saying people can vote in democracy to tackle any issue by taking them on your best possible grounds democracy needed bypassing bureaucracy you need to compete with other public policies such as criminal justice or education the final thing was then about fdi their claim was the fdi from the west comes here first fdi is more likely to happen on our side because the wealth is more equitably distributed the natural resources are able to have more disposable incomes for all consumers but second even if the west refused to enter we still have the briggs investment bank we have the bri from china who are still willing to invest even if you're not completely democratic but thirdly it ignores the initial premise that we proved to you from our third argument which went unresponded to which eventually people become more politically literate become people become more politically conscious when you're able to have this wealth in your hands. The conclusion of this is it's time we call it for what it is. The failure for land reforms was state-sanctioned violence we are very proud to propose."

I'm going to, even though they didn't mention this, I'm going to say, okay, let's assume the West actually does invest. We think this West actor is actually bad because we think that the West, when investing in a non-democratic country, firstly has no sort of political government that can actually engage with them democratically, which means they're more likely to be hostile and they're more likely to actually look to try and displace far. This looks like the US in the Middle East where they were forced to try and change up the political stability of the country. This of course creates political vacuums moreover. Thirdly, we tell you this can also create proxy wars between the US and the USSR, creating further political instability in the region.

Let's assume for a second, my first and second speaker told you extensively why these leaders who are going to be carrying out these actions, going to be carrying out these depredations have bad incentives.

I'm particularly talking about people who have the political will and capital to actually go on doing these land distribution methods. Firstly, when they say economic rights will somehow give access to healthcare, education, quotas and jobs, wow. The problem is there are no jobs to give quotas in, right? We tell you that this is an underutilized economy where this massive inflation, it's economically unstable.

Secondly, we told you we get foreign help that's exclusive to our side because multilateral institutions like the United Nations set up special agencies for Africa. They will only assist Africa if these nations choose to want to become democratic. They don't want to, especially in the time of the Cold War, these multilateral institutions are unlikely to help these countries set up autocratic institutions. And we don't think they will look to entrench these autocratic institutions even further as well, which is why you won't be able to create democracy in the future as well. Now, moreover, as my second speaker told you, it's easier to set up political institutions. You're more likely to mess up economic policy. But coming to what happens if these leaders actually manage to redistribute well, we tell you, even if these leaders successfully manage to redistribute well we tell you even if these leaders successfully manage to create these quotas create this brilliant land distribution everything in the one actually happens we still think this is a short-term issue we tell you that we give you an example of the great leap forward in china we tell you how these autocratic governments even in the temporary period they're able to create these short-term sort of economic gratification because of lack of like number one because of lack of checks and balances they you're entrenching greater power in these people right number two we tell you because of lack of like number one, because of lack of checks and balances, they are intention greater power in these people, right?

Why on earth would the people stand for this? Okay, firstly, there are different actors. We think that the oppressors, the colonizers, at least from the past, are not necessarily the same institutions. Like the United States is not necessarily the colonizing part of the African people actively hate. Moreover, even if these African people actually want to sort of prevent their governments from forming these relations from these particular countries like the United Kingdom or France, we still think that they at least have the option to do so by keeping these governments accountable. And because of the transparency of information, they can control what kind of foreign relations, what kind of powers they collaborate with. Moreover, at least we have multilateral institutions investing. We don't even have that. So even if it's not particular countries, we still get that FDI. One of our ethnic tensions, we tell you, is a lot worse among tribes. We tell you, leaders are forced to affiliate with certain tribes and prioritize their needs, which means when they talk about how the black majority is probably not going to have enough power, you're actually letting the white majority control the narrative, at least to some extent. Even if, okay, sure, it's not going to be great levels of accountability. On our side, these black people at least have a voice. The minorities have a voice and these ethnic tensions can actually be negotiated peacefully through democratic means.

Prioritize a Western model of democratic statehood or correct the wrongs that those same Western countries had inflicted upon them. Post-colonial leaders chose to imitate their oppressors, and Africans have been paying the price ever since. The wording of the motion may be a mess but Africa didn't have to be. We're very proud to propose."

First, the clarification issued by the motions committee states that opposition have to defend the world that did exist during the time, i.e. the status quo. To be absolutely clear, this is a world in which much of Africa lives in poverty, exploited by the West, and devastated by civil war. That is the world they must defend. Two, our burden is to defend a hypothetical world in which the majority of post-colonial African states reclaimed stolen land and money from colonial elites and redistributed it among the African population. There are three types of program. A, there were cash transfers to individual people of an amount roughly equivalent to $1,000 in today's money. B, land reallocation, particularly of foreign lands so that land ownership is allocated roughly equally across the population. And C, this looks like state reclamation of natural resource wealth, like oil wells and regular cash payments to the population of the profits from these. Three three we think that in most cases a leader of the independence movement would likely become a non-democratic ruler who would initially rule the country on a national level and initiate this policy supported by a network of local community governments four note that this motion covers an entire continent given this we think the burden on both sides is that the policy works for the majority but but not for all countries.

                "text": "first argument, where would these policies have been done well? Who is carrying out these policies? They are the immediate leaders of post-colonial African states. In almost all cases, these are the leaders of the revolutionary movements in these states, as they were the obvious and only candidates for colonial powers to hand over in reign soon. What assets would these leaders have been distributing? We think the state would have owned some land and assets to begin with, but they would likely have had to take most land off predominantly white colonialists who owned it or the minority of African land-owning elites who had gained it by collaborating with the colonizers. We think they should have taken this land back without recompense or with relatively tokenistic payments. It was stolen of the people of African states. We accept this might not have been easy and it might have even been violent in a few cases. We think however that in most cases it would have been successful for three key reasons. A. There would have been a lot more black Africans than white colonialists. By sheer quantity they clearly win. B, they now control the levers of the state, including the army, so they have much more power. But C, we are supporting a world where many African states chose to view this. This means that even if the first few cases where this policy was attempted were difficult and potentially bloody, white landowners in other African states who saw this would likely have realized their time was up. Given the colonial powers who had just left, neither wanted to see their citizens die, nor themselves get embroiled in conflict, they likely would have paid these white landowners to leave peacefully, as the British did when they left Kenya. Why would these leaders allocate resources fairly? Three reasons. A, they have been literally fighting for their nations, and have recent experience of being oppressed, but B, within their legitimacy at that point in history, is heavily hinged on their willingness to fight for the rights of their people, and c within a core part of the majority of these independence movements were African intellectuals who were arguing for the justice of this exact policy."

                "text": "Second argument, the principle. We think under our side there are three powerful principled obligations which the government of the time also prioritized and could only be fulfilled by redistributive policies the first principal obligation is that land and wealth are the correct form of reparation this land was stolen by white colonizers whose descendants profited from it often by enslaving the descendants of its original owners not only did the land have significant economic value, it also had unquantifiable cultural value to the people it was taken from. These are historic religious sites or bureau grounds. Given that, the criteria for reparations are clearly fulfilled. A, the stolen property itself, i.e., the land, is unambiguous and of immense value. B, the rightful owner is clear. And C, unless opposition wants to defend colonialism, the illegitimacy of the current owner's possession is also clear. Rather than redress this, opposition requires new states just to shed from the shackles of colonization to start absolutely protecting the rights of white colonialists. The second principal obligation is that land and wealth fits with the will of the people. But for colonialism, communities looks much more like those which our redistributive policy would facilitate. Smaller, much more communal, predominantly locally led. Importantly, a lot of independence movements held up this model when they pushed for the end of colonialism. People called for it, they fought for it, they desired it so deeply that men are willing to lay down their lives for it. The third obligation is that land and wealth preserves your right to life and ought to be the most important. Food and money keep you alive. This is what you need to access any of opposition's political rights. Look, we respect that OPP has some claim to be granting people rights, but they're obviously far less important than these because A, granting people a right to vote has no guarantee of improving their life, and B, freedom of speech and association are nebulous and often restricted even in democratic countries. These are of no importance when compared to returning their property, respecting their wishes, and protecting their lives. Before we move on to my third"

                "text": "money is so important first way money is used to solve immediate issues like food and medicine. This is a simple impact, but it's incredibly important. In our world, people are given money that they can spend on food and medicine. They are given land that they can live on, grow things from, or sell. This allows them to escape extreme poverty. The second way is because they have money to invest. Knowing that you have a regular monthly income from your stake and the local life, or that you have been able to make savings from your initial payment of cash allows you to invest in the future. A community can collectively buy farming equipment that makes it far more efficient to invest in a well. The third way is because we give people control over the land. Africa has the potential to grow enough food to feed itself three and a half times over. Despite this, they have suffered more famine than anywhere else in the world. That is because Western companies own their farmland over-planted to the point of soil degradation, and then sell the crops out of Africa to European buyers. On our side, people control their own land. This improves food security in two ways. A. They farm it in a less commercially aggressive way, thus reducing the chances of crop failure. B, they have control over the products that are grown. That means that even if there's a bad harvest or a drought, people are better able to adapt to help themselves. In a reduced harvest, you're able to keep the crops to grow and feed yourself, rather than be forced to sell them to Europe. And even in a truly dire year, you're better able to make the choice to switch to animal agriculture to save yourself yourself because the land is yours. On a wider level, within redistributive policies, reduce the risk of civil war. Civil wars typically occur when there's a combination of extreme poverty, limited opportunities, and the lack of trust in the state, and are even more likely to happen when there are multiple ethnic groups who in Africa were often set against each other by colonial powers. Those conditions are why there have been countless civil wars since the end of colonialism, and why there are 21 happening in Africa right now. That's what opposition's policies led to, poverty, weak democracies and conflict. Why would this be better with redistributive policy? We explain why poverty is alleviated, but giving people land gives them stake in their nation. It's much easier to abandon everything for a chance to be a soldier is a lot harder when you have a stake in a community but needless to say this is about as big as an impact gets civil wars wreak unfold damage to countries in the long run this running of the motion may be a mess but africa did not have to we're proud to propose"

Civil and political rights formed the last stronghold against the attempts at unbridled grabs for power. My speech will be divided into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to analyze why proposition is unlikely to succeed in their reparations. Secondly, why they're likely to create more economic harms. And thirdly, why we're able to create a more stable society. But before that, I want to make a strategic note. It is not sufficient for proposition to just argue the benefits of reparations. The motion has a flip side, which requires proposition to defend the absence of political and civil rights. In other words, a dictatorship. Because in order to win this debate, proposition has to prove why it is both legitimate and preferable to subject individuals to literal authoritarian rule."

                "text": "Okay, moving on to the first part of my speech on why we think that land redistributions will simply not work. Note that this directly attacks the Prime Minister's first argument on why they think land reparations will be done well. Note that even if the proposition has some fiat to enact their policies, that doesn't guarantee that external factors will make it literally impossible for their policies to succeed. We tell you there are three reasons as to why we are more likely to achieve civil and political rights than they are to achieve economic and land reparations firstly in terms of international support when we look at for instance assistance for civil and political rights we've already seen this happening where for instance in senegal other countries have provided independent observers to ensure elections were free and fair this is because generally on the international stage civil and political rights are right widely recognized But we say on the flip side, there's oftentimes a lot of backlash for land redistribution. Note that, for instance, the US has sanctioned Zimbabwe for the last 22 years, partly because of their forceful land redistribution policies. Note that this also offsets any economic benefits of such redistribution. The second reason as to why we're more likely to achieve our world is because of the concept of taking versus giving. Land reparations means you have to actively take away someone's assets, which will likely spark aggressive opposition. This is what we've seen in Ghana, where farmers literally hired private mercenaries to protect their own land. Comparatively, civil and political rights are merely given to people, and thus individuals don't have an incentive to fight for what has been taken from them. The third reason here is that there are already blueprints for enshrining civil and political rights. For instance, you can copy existing constitutions and other democratic frameworks. However, land redistribution in such large, ethnically divided and unstable, have never been done before, and so it's far more complex to do so. What this means is that it is very unlikely to get economic and land reparations, while it is more likely to get civil and political rights, even if both sides have the same amount of fiat, we have substantially more external factors"

                "text": "Africa where black farmers couldn't get mortgages from banks so they still couldn't afford the necessary machinery to work the land we tell you secondly uh there's oftentimes fragmentation of land assuming that land will be distributed equally's oftentimes fragmentation of land. Assuming that land will be distributed equally, you have large plots of land that we split up into many smaller plots. This is seen in Ethiopia, where half of all the plots of land were less than a quarter of a hectare panel that is literally tiny. You cannot live off of that. Note that this threatens food security. These nations already face food shortages. So every time you waste scarce land that could have been used to grow crops, you bring the countries closer to the brink of starvation. This is also what contributed to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984 after their land redistribution. The second harm here is you're less likely to have foreign direct investment because foreign companies are reluctant to settle into authoritarian regimes where individuals have absolutely no rights because they're afraid of for instance the sanctions this means that job opportunities are lost in countries that already have high rates of unemployment the third harm here is that you have no development aid because countries are reluctant to give aid to dictatorships for instance after the United States made charges of corruption against the government of Kenya, they halted the development aid. This means communities lose out on hospitals that could have been built. They lose out on schools. They lose out on food, for instance. The last harm here is you're likely to have poor economic policy. And this is caused by the dictator's dilemma. Opposition might give people a bag of money. But if your country has hyperinflation because of economic mismanagement, that money is literally useless. Bad economic policy might happen on either side of the house. But the difference in our side of the house is that when you have political and civil rights, you can correct that. In a dictatorship-like propositions world, people who are critical of the government will never be able to express their critics, their beliefs. Look at Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe literally caused hyperinflation by just continuously printing money and plunging the entire country into economic crisis. What this argument shows you is that even on the metric of the economy, which is propositions grounds, we still take the debate. Note that this also tackles the principle argument, because we believe that the best form of reparation is to give back the country a stable economy after the disruption and chaos caused by colonialism. They cannot do that. We can."

We're here, we're going to show you why the lack of civil and political rights will exacerbate conflict and lead to more unnecessary death. Why do we think this is true? We tell you this is for two reasons. Firstly, citizens will turn to violence when they cannot voice their dissatisfaction peacefully. To illustrate, in the early 90s, the Nigerian government tried to make a deal with Shell about extracting oil from the Niger Delta. The local communities hated this plan, and a small conflict emerged. But because we had democratic structures that recognized the voices of the people, they were able to establish environmental regulations in propositions world you don't have these rights you would prevent citizens from being hurt entirely we tell you the small conflict would have escalated to far worse to become far more violent but secondly we tell you in propositions world authoritarian leaders are far more likely to stoke conflict to maintain control we saw this this happening in Kenya in 1992, when the president tried to purposely stoke ethnic conflict to ban opposition parties. Luckily, people were able to hold them accountable, and the president was later ousted from power. On the opposition side, they lacked that form of accountability. We tell you ethnic conflicts would have worsened, and many more would have died. Note that this also clashes with their third argument on reducing death and suffering. We tell you, even if initially our world is not a fully functioning democracy at first, enshrining civil and political rights is a prerequisite for that. It is the seeds that must be planted before the flower of democracy finally blooms. We tell you that in our world, we are able to create the basis for that. This is because, firstly, when you have the right to vote, you're more likely to be able to establish systems of elections. In many African countries, voter turnout has been comparable, if not higher than in the West. But secondly, we're able to have the establishment of opposition parties that can organize to pressure government reform. What this ultimately means is that we are the side that is able to maintain stability. We are the side that helps these people i'm so proud to oppose"

I just want to flag where I could start here, that every single example opposition has given you of failure, of poverty, of terrible conflict that has devastated people's lives and livelihoods happened under their side of the house. We were very clear in our answer, according to the clarification from the motions committee, side opposition's burden is to defend the world as it exists today. They have to defend the status quo. They have to defend what these countries chose to do. That's why when they talk to you about Ethiopia, that's why when they talk to you about Ghana, they have to stand behind the failures there. But then, would this have worked? Because side opposition want to challenge us here. They tried to tell us first of all that these leaders are going to carry out these policies badly and then they tried to say you're not going to be successful at taking things away from people. How do we respond to this? First of all on incentives, we believe that these leaders wanted to carry out these policies well. First of all opposition tried to tell us that these are going to be bad people. Or we think actually they're likely to be the same on either side, as Helen points out in first, and as we get no response to. Five reasons for this. We think first, they have huge name recognition across the nation. These people are coming off the back of the biggest political win imaginable, independence, so they have popular support. They tend to be very charismatic. That's why these people have risen to the top of the independence movement. They have the infrastructure of the independence movement around them and that's a ready-made party and they're the ones who are shaping the discussions of independence, so they have the advantage in rising to the top of any system they create. Whether it's democratic or not, we think these are always going to be pro-independence leaders and as we also explained to you, we think they are likely to have good incentives for three reasons. First, they want to do what's best for their people. people second because their legitimacy is hinged on providing people and third ideologically they are part of the independence movement they care about these policies but also on our side they probably have better incentives because when they see themselves purely as caretakers they aren't legitimized as school rulers when you tell these people that they still have to fight for democracy and that fight against colonialism isn't over we think they're far more likely to be more conscientious about the potential for democratic backsliding and about doing things well therefore we think it's very clear that these leaders are going to have good incentives why then are they going to be successful at taking"

They don't really respond to any of our actual analysis on why it is so good to have money, why it's so good to have stability, why this is so good for the economy. They simply give us a set of counterclaims on why they think this is bad. First, from international support. They say their side is better because you're able to have observers to ensure that these processes are free and fair. First of all, under our side we think it's so much easier because you don't need these observers. We're able to do it once and crucially on our side you can't take away those reparations. On their side democratic backsliding is very easy. Then they try to tell us that the United States is going to impose sanctions. As we point out in the POI, the US isn't going to sanction all these countries. It could only sanction Zimbabwe because there was only one Zimbabwe. But if the whole continent had stood together in pursuing these policies against colonialism, they would have been far more successful. Then they tried to talk to us about how it's bad to take away someone's assets. I think we've already dealt with that in the clash over whether this is going to work. Then they tried to tell us that the land is going to be underutilized their first mechanism for this is that you're not going to be giving people enough money in that slightly odd that this is the only argument they could think of against giving people money and black but how do we respond to this as we make it very clear in advance we think when you give direct cash transfers to individual people and yes we've done the maths this looks like a thousand dollars in today's money when you're reallocating farmland so that people are able to have a roughly equal share farmland and crucially when you have a stable source of income from natural resources which we tell you we split among the people of these countries we think frankly that is quite clearly going to be enough to build a living and it's far better than having absolutely nothing at all which is the comparative under their side and then they say well you're going to have fragmentation of this land no again they preemptively responded to this because we told you about how these groups coalesce into communities and how much better this is than having absolutely no food or money finally on fdi don't let the myth of us by fdi developing african states trick you panel the us's fbi in africa look like building a road in a straight line from a port to a mine.

                "text": "development under our side? First, economically. Africa broadly fits two main niches in the global economy. The first is cheap labour. In Oxford, Africans are able to be exploited because they're willing to work for extraordinarily low wages and have no bargaining power to improve their conditions, so Western MNCs are able to exploit them. This led to decades of low wage labor and appalling conditions because their only competitive advantage was the cheap price of labor and therefore improvements of quality of life came at the unacceptable risk of a company moving out of the country and people starving but this would have been different on our side because africans would have had an alternative source of income to fall back on their land and their livestock so they wouldn't have been able to speak the words into low wage labor and companies would still have invested in these states because they were keeping the resources there, but on our side it's on far more equitable terms. Secondly, natural resources. Africa is the richest continent on earth and has the natural resource wealth. But in opposition, all governments who are trying to protect political rights allowed neo-colonial companies to continue extracting that resource wealth and funneling money back to the west. But in our world they'd have taken this land back, they'd have extracted and sold the resources themselves, and they'd have used the proceeds to build state infrastructure, and crucially, to pay cash transfers, as we outlined. This both makes the state far richer, but also creates consumers who attract foreign investment that is not there to exploit their labour, but rather to sell them goods. Don't underestimate how many billions of dollars this would have funneled into the coffers of African states and the pockets of African people. They're not a long-term political development because opposition wants democratic rights for African states, that's their only argument. If we prove we get this better on our side we so clearly take this debate already. In a continent of 54 nations there have been two continuous democracies since decolonisation. Right now Africa contains one full democracy, seven flawed democracies, and 46 states that are considered fundamentally undemocratic. This is because a certain level of economic development is a prerequisite for any democracy to succeed. Two reasons why. First, there's a basic level of education needed for people to learn and understand about the democratic system they're expected to participate in. Second, because you need a level of engaged political class who can put in the time to build political parties and scrutinize government practices the absence of these conditions is the reason why under the status quo they defend every african state bar two has failed to successfully have long-term democracy but on proposition we think sure there would have at some point been education to the implementation of democracy but that transition on the outside would have been far more peaceful because it's helen's two people in more developed states have so much more to lose from war but it would also have been far more peaceful, because as Helen touched, new people in more developed states have so much more to lose from war, but it would also have been far more likely to be successful because these countries meet two criteria that we outlined. So on opposition's own metric of democratic rights, we think there would have been far more democracies in Africa today had these policies been implemented. But given that right now there are over eight of them across the entire continent, any more than that wins this debate independently for team effort. We're so proud to propose thank you you I think I briefly dropped there after the end of the speech. Can everybody hear me?"

Firstly, the moment in which the government is the only thing which guarantees you your income and guarantees your access to your land, that's when people are more reliant on the government, therefore they have more to lose. Secondly, people don't really have that much power of the government on the proposition side of the house. You don't have the ability to vote and you don't have the ability to protest. Even if people defy this and start protesting, on the proposition side of the house it's significantly easier for governments to prevent protests from ever getting any kind of steam. This is incredibly important because if a protest ever wants to achieve anything, it needs to reach a level of critical mass, which requires a huge amount of people to participate in it. So protests are constantly being put down by autocratic regimes. You're unable to, even if people have a good quality of living, ever achieve any kind of change. This is how the CCP maintains a grip over the people of China."

So, so far from proposition, you've gotten two arguments which are impacting of one argument. If we can disprove that argument, then we've won this debate. Secondly, on the idea of, I think this is weighing, where they say land is particularly important because there are certain historical places which have unquantifiable value. Firstly, I find it unlikely that a lot of the specifically historically important places are going to be redistributed. We get the impression from the first public speaker that this is about farmland specifically. Secondly, this is hugely problematic to their case. Surely that would only increase the amount of tensions that you have about the redistribution of land, make it harder to pass and increase the likelihood of wars or smaller scale conflicts uh uh lastly we think that is also like taking away individuals rights for instance the ability to exercise your religion the ability to exercise your language is also unquantifying the value to individuals and their culture so insofar as we are able to restore these rights better on our sub house we think we also restore things of unquantifiable value to individuals. Thirdly and lastly, the lack of political power and the ability to self-govern is also what was taken away from Africans. It wasn't like the British were just like, hey y'all, y'all can vote on anything, we're just going to peacefully take away your land. No, it was oppression in every possible regard. In fact, this was the biggest thing that the Western colonial nations took away from Africans. Why? Because this was the biggest thing that the Western colonial nations took away from Africans. Why? Because this was the root of all these symptoms of proposition sense. So taking away land and taking away welfare from these countries was a symptom of the fact that they were in a state of oppression. Since we are the side which is more likely to allow African nations to attain some level democratization, we should we should win on this principle"

But secondly, I think it is to an extent plausible just because the USA and the EU trade far more with each other than with African nations and trade with China far more than they trade with African nations. So in terms of the power disparity there, African nations with relatively little importance to the economies of Western nations. Secondly, in terms of local influential elite, elite is also already material from Egas Egas speech in the first argument we give you. They say, well, firstly, in the PM that they will just peacefully leave after you've attained some victories. Firstly, this is circular reasoning. It requires you to have attained those victories in the first place. But secondly, I find this incredibly unlikely just because like a proposition does the research here. They're literally just been war started about why colonisers were not wanting to give up their land when it comes to land redistribution. Like, why would you want to give up everything that you have just because you see other people getting it take away? If anything, we think white colonisers are more likely to want to firstly do exactly what we're talking about, which is abuse the system. I'll take a PY in a second, by the way. And secondly, if that's impossible, to fight for it, which is exactly the impact that we're talking about, about civil wars, about conflicts happening. Secondly, they say that Black Africans outnumber white Africans to a significant degree. Firstly, this is a point about political power. We are unsure why the numerical game matters more than the political game, especially since the local influential elite, firstly, have the full support of the Western colonizers who've just left behind them. And secondly, because they're the ones with by far the most capital. If you want to hire a private militia, then it's not going to be the coarse individuals in Africa, then it's going to be the local elite trying to protect their assets. Thirdly, and lastly, this is a new mech here, about zero sum. So for instance, if you want to vote, then your ability to vote doesn't detract from my ability to vote. However, if I give you land, then that must directly come up with the land that is given to me. So it's relatively easier to implement reforms around civil and political rights than specifically economic reforms, because the amount of land you can get the amount of wealth which relies on the con, which is in the country is zero."

But secondly, I think there's a more structured reasons that we give you. Even if you want to do well, the reality is that you rely on international support and you rely on the influence of local elites. This brings us quite nicely to our own case.

Because once you've been given this land and this money, that is yours. And you will notice if someone tries to take it away. In comparison, if you slowly erode democratic rights you are much less likely to realise that and so you are much less likely to lose the benefits that they claim. They say that if these are that important then redistributing this land is bad. But this is about choices planning. We would much rather have Africans have the land that is important to them than some random English or Dutch colonizers. Now, I recognize that this is a creep rap, but that is not an excuse for not engaging at all with the analysis that Helen gave. And note the way in here. We say that these principal obligations trump any other rights to democracy or to vote. Let me illustrate this to you. If you're an individual farmer, you care about feeding yourself and your family. If you're a community, you care about taking control of your natural resources and what was stolen from you. And if you are the state, you care about representing your people's wishes. Given that we prove why this is the principle all three of those levels care about, it's the one that should be prioritised. Before I show why we went on immediate benefits, I'll take your feel-eye. China is currently in the process of committing genocide in Singapore, but UNSL for being gay. If those are really the countries which opposition wants to champion, then you should really reconsider your stance in this debate. We really want to talk about homophobia here, where over half of the countries in the world where being gay is illegal are on the African continent and four African countries still have the death penalty for being gay. We tell you that not all dictatorships are as bad as North Korea and that in fact you can have many positive benefits especially when they later transition to democracy.

They give you four reasons why we think we are not going to succeed. Firstly, the lack of international support. The beauty about these economic reparations is that we don't need international support because you only have to do this in a one-time transfer. Your side requires that continuous monitoring and goodwill from the state, which is so much harder. Secondly, on backlash, and the only example and analysis here is look at Zimbabwe. We tell you that Zimbabwe was unique because they were the only country that did this. We think when every country on the continent is trying to implement these policies, it is so much harder to have this sort of backlash and have these sorts of sanctions. But even if we do, Maya has explained, well, we don't think that is bad enough to make it not worth it. Thirdly, we get this idea that we're going to have backlash from the people who you're reclaiming this land from. We point out that these people are massively outnumbered.

That is exactly what the British government did in Kenya. Fourthly, they say that economic and land reparations are complex. We don't necessarily think this is true. We take the land and we give it to community leaders as we set out in our model. And note that we don't need it to be perfect to get all the massive immediate benefits that we get. And I want to flag our mechanisms here, which they never even bother to pay lip service to, about why we're going to be successful. We tell you that we massively outnumber the colonisers, that they have the levers of state, that many countries are doing it, and the colonial powers are likely to support this. So given that all of their rebuttal hinges on them proving that we're unsuccessful, we can take out an enormous amount of their material. Secondly, they say that this isn't going to be enough to give people the help that they need and it's not going to be enough money. This was clearly a point they wrote before, it doesn't engage with our model that we are giving people immediate money and they stake in the resources around them. But know that they concede here the money is indeed helpful and is useful and the problem with that case is that they never contend with how to get it under their side of the house. We would much rather people have some land than no land at all, because they're able to coalesce and use this together in order to get benefits from it. Finally, on this idea that these people are going to turn violent and that their leaders are going to stoke ethnic conflict, their own example was of a conflict that happened in a democracy. Because when you are scared of another party taking power from you in an election, that is when you stoke ethnic conflict to stop people supporting them. We tell you we're going to allocate these resources well, and that we are able to give people money to solve their immediate issues and restore control over their land."

We would much rather have better investment once people have control over this land so they're able to negotiate. Shell is no longer able to come in and bribe a corrupt government to take control of oil supplies when those oil supplies are owned by the people. We tell you we get much better economic success in the long term and political success in the long term and they never engage with those mechanisms that Maya gave you.

                "text": "important things the second clash is whose policy is most likely to be effectively implemented here we gave you three three main reasons why proposition land redist true land redistribution will never work and we give you empirical evidence notes that the world is not black and uh black and white so the examples we get venue are attempts at implementing props policy yes it was in this in the status quo world but there is just one of those gray areas that did implement. The majority of countries did implement social and political rights. That is why we're a trend of progress, except the countries that implemented props policy. So their whole point about, oh, they can't bring examples doesn't work. So then what did we bring you under this clash? Three things. Firstly, they need international support. Props issue tells you, no, they don't. They can just redistribute land themselves. No panel, because sanction will be harming. You need aid to be able to bring about agriculture. You need fertilizers to not have all the insects kill your food you need you need a water irrigation system so that the droughts that are on their continent don't hamper this food security yes you need western support secondly they will tell you uh land preparations are zero sum because when i have planned team england can't have land on the other hand political rights are nothing. I'm speaking, they're speaking. My speech is not a zero sum thing. They never engage with this point. This means that this is one of the reasons that stand why land redistribution will never work. The third reason we gave you was that it's actively taking land from other people versus giving. There's empirical evidence to show that it's unlikely to be successful. For example, in South Africa, who started the Reconstruction and Development Program in 1994, the largest land redistribution program to date. Less than 10% of the redistribution target has been reached by the state. It doesn't work. Note that this alone means the whole proposition case false because they are never able to implement these land redistributions anyways. But look, maybe even if they do a little bit it is a skill they are not going to be able to redistribute all land at best small parts of their land the the impacts of redistributing very small part of land never way up to the violence that they create which i will explain in a second what then do they tell you no no they'll be able to do this because firstly, they're more African than colonists. Look, if it were by mere numbers, it doesn't work. Like in South Africa, there are many more black people than white, but still the white hold power. Only numbers are not a point in politics. It's about who has the resources, the money and the army. They don't have the army. The Western armies are still stronger. Thirdly, they tell you, no, no, no, we support a world where African states can learn from each other. Whoa, not all African states are the same. The fact that it worked in one state doesn't work under the colonizer of another state, right? They tell you that they can learn from each other, but the fact that it worked for an ex-French colony doesn't mean that worked for for an ex-french colony doesn't mean that it works for an ex-english colony the end of this flash it's clear proposition is very unlikely to ever be able to do land distributions in the first place however they need they need to deal with the bad things that happen even if they would be able to achieve land reparations namely the"

For example, in Zimbabwe, two thirds of the population were at risk of starvation during a rain season because the land had been redistributed. Secondly, we tell you the lack of FDI is crucial. The stabilization program by the IMF in the Democratic Republic of Congo led to the inflation decline from 8% to 2.5%, which how you FDI is crucial. What do they tell you then? No, no, no, but we can reduce suffering because they can use like the thousand dollars of cash we give them right away to alleviate immediate suffering. Note that you finish the thousand dollars in two months after the Africans are a bit off as they were before. However, to sustain policy in the long run, you need institutions which create tax incomes that can sustainably provide for people. That is why on our side of the house, there is more involvement in secondary education, doubled more from the inabundance until now, because we create sustainable institutions that give people a true improvement on the long run, not just a thousand dollar cash influx. That's never enough. Second of all, we tell you that the money to invest in the future never work. They don't have the economies of scale to collectively buy things at the point that they didn't have money in the first place. Before I move on to my third question, I'll take that be alive. What's more useful to you as someone in extreme poverty? A polling booth in a town three hours away or land that you can now farm to keep you alive? First of all, I've proven to you, you'll never have land to keep you alive. Even if you have land to keep you alive first of all i've proven to you you'll never have land to keep you alive"

First of all, because when citizens have no peaceful means to express their dissatisfaction, they turn to violence. Secondly, authoritarian leaders stoke conflict to maintain control. Look at your notes. This was in LO. We've given examples. What does this mean? Civil and political rights would protect against conflict. Everything you buy about civil conflict being bad in the status quo would be worse. For example, in the Casamance conflict in Senegal, which was a low level conflict for the independence of the Casamance region, whose population is religiously and ethnically distinct from the rest of Senegal. The only thing that solved this conflict was that the Senegalese president was pressured by the people to sign a treaty with this region. This prevented mass conflict to escalate further. We've given you the example of how this happened in a Niger region. No response. Panel. More civil wars on proposition is a clear win. Vote up.

                "text": "Two questions in my speech. Firstly, on which side is more likely to occur? And secondly, on which side is more important? So on the first question, note that what we proved to you from the very first speech onward is that even if we have fiat on both sides of the house, there are still external factors that make it more unlikely for proposition to achieve their aims. Because in propositions world, you have to constantly be taking away land from the rich, from the elite. In propositions world, you don't have a blueprint because every country is filled with complex ethnic tensions where it's very difficult to plan things like land redistribution. The comparative in our world is when it comes to enshrining civil and political rights, these rights are oftentimes negative rights. You don't need to directly give it to someone. Rather, the absence of the states just not infringing on your right is enough. The fact that you already have blueprints like other democratic institutions and other constitutions make it significantly easier. What does Proposition say to this? The first thing they tell us is that they can also have land reforms because leaders on both sides of the House will have good intentions. Panel, I'm sure Robert Mugabe probably had good intentions at the beginning. But the problem is oftentimes when you have no accountability mechanisms, when you cannot vote out leaders, when you cannot protest against leaders, that's when leaders get bad. So even if both sides of the House have good intentions, the problem is when they do mess up, we can hold them accountable. Proposition cannot. Then they say, ah, at least we'll have more black individuals. So somehow we will have more equitable land reform. But note that this doesn't matter. It was also the case in colonial rule that the black was the majority. The difference is your numbers only matter when you have civil and political rights. This was pointed out by our second speaker, because numbers only matter when it comes to things like voting. Numbers only matter when it comes to things like protesting. You're not able to do that in proposition side of the house. They have no power whatsoever. I also think it is interesting that the second proposition, for example, of Namibia, where 70% of land is owned by European descendants. Panamibia is one of the few countries that actually actively prioritized land reform. It was the president that actually had that main goal in mind. What we tell you is it is simply not likely to happen."

Let's say in their best case, you do have economic reform that finally works. You give each individual $1,000. Why is this still not good enough? We told you two things. Firstly, that even if you give individuals land, you cannot use it properly because oftentimes the land that you redistribute, you have to divide it to such small pieces that you just can't live off of that. But more importantly, you don't give people enough sustainable capital to actually use that land to continue to be able to have enough resources to farm off of it year after year. But secondly, we tell you that money doesn't matter if you have poor economic policy. If your country is suffering from hyperinflation, that bag of a thousand dollars doesn't do anything for these individuals. But thirdly, we told you independent of anything else, you're far more likely to have civil conflict in their world because individuals who do not have their voices heard are more likely to go to extreme ends. What does this mean? It means that for the oppressed, when you cannot protest, you're far more likely to result to things like riots. That when you cannot express your opinions with democratic institutions, that was when you resort to more violent means."

That is what we have to return. And when they talk about how land redistribution is a zero-sum game, it's not fair that we're taking it from other people. Panel, we are taking land from white colonisers or elite collaborators who stole it in the first place. The principle of justification is clear. And then we tell you that taking land and wealth and distributing it fits with the will of the people and crucially preserves the right to life and ought to be the most important because that's what you need to access any opposition to political rights. They respond not by engaging with this principle but by trying to weigh it against the assertion that civil and political rights matter more. But how do we respond to this? First preemptively with the second and third parts of our principle because this is what independence campaigners wanted democracy doesn't have to look like side opposition's narrow western view of going to the ballot box every five years it can look like a huge popular support for a life that was materially different a new chapter after colonialism but we also tell you that you need to stay alive to access any of these benefits when side opposition concedes that people need land and money to survive they can see the debate but we"

There's no response to this argument than a claim that, oh, this is contingent on your policy work. We've made it clear that this policy does work, the principle stands. Then on the practical, first thing opposition say here is that we're going to have a dictator. But as we've made it very clear, central authoritarian rule is something both sides have to grapplele with because opposition have to stand behind the status quo where dictators at some point have had power in all the two countries in Africa. They should have been more careful before making too many critiques of this but then they only give us two actual practical harms both woefully unarguable. I'd like to point out that the rest of their case which we dealt with earlier is pure mitigation. First on the lack of FBI. We tell you that the large availability of labour, the purchasing power advantage of cheap currency, and the presence of natural resources, coupled with pressure from Western countries to find new locations for their factories, means that these companies would still likely have invested in these countries. The difference is, as we talked about in second, our workers could have demanded better conditions and better wages. Then they say that people are likely to become violent. I think in the first question I proved why this doesn't happen. But we tell you about the unique benefits, unique benefits that side opposition can see when they say there is a high standard of living in China and Saudi Arabia. We tell you four reasons why people don't starve when they have land, why it's such a good thing. We tell you about how we avoid the catastrophe of civil war. We tell you about how we get long term economic development, but also how we build on opposition's own metrics.

Where does this land then go? We want to have this proportional according to ethnicity to restore the original balance. If your group makes up 10% of the population, you will get 10% of the land. Additionally, poor farmers can apply for land and agricultural support, for example fertilizers and seeds. This will be done well because there is an immense desire for land redistribution from the population. What else will we then do? We want to have other redistributive policies such as the social aid system, cash transfer programs, and heavy taxation for beneficiaries from colonialism. We lobby for reparations from former colonial powers.

The problem for the large majority of people in post-colonial states is that they lack a baseline of survival. They can't put bread on the table for your family. That is because they're exploited in large farms and work under slave-like conditions with very little pay. Opposition is unlikely to change this meaningfully for two reasons. One, because large landowners are likely to lobby the government to prevent any kind of legislation that would end exploitative labor. They can uniquely do this because of their economic importance. We expropriate them at their weakest right after independence. Second, because there are fluctuations in how much you can actually buy with your wage. That is, your money can decrease in its value, especially in a semi-stable economic system, whereas land you can always use. This means land is always better as a form of redress. How do we then help people? You can grow crops on the land that you receive. You're likely to do this very well for three reasons. One, because of the agricultural program, you receive seeds and fertilizers. Second, because you already worked as a farmer prior to you receiving that land most people were in agriculture and thirdly because generally not that hard i can grow crops in my own garden there's no reasons why african farmers wouldn't be able to do this we then tell you that you're they're likely to use the land even better than large farms because one you're likely to work harder when you reap the benefits of your own work and second because there's more sustainable agriculture because you depend on that land more than the large land owner does. But panel, even if baseline survival would be ensured on either side of the house, owning land gives you collateral. That is, you can take out loans and use them to invest in economic opportunities like starting your own business, sending your children to school. This gives you the option of meaningful economic participation and a higher quality of life. Why is this so important panel? Because we give enslaved people redress from centuries of exploitation where they can now meaningfully decide for themselves how they want to participate in economic activity. Second, because to access political rights, you need a good economic situation. I need spare time, spare capacity, and spare resources to make use of that, right? What does it matter if I have a right to education but my children need to work to get food on the table and I don't have the money to pay for tuition and buy them books and paper? I can't organize a protest if I need to work to feed my family, panel, where we want economic baseline baseline survival but even if you don't but but onto the"

                "text": "second argument on stability then three layers to this firstly we satisfy equality demands panel people have a massive desire for material and for material equality because they feel and see this every day there's a generational heart of your land being taken away it's often also symbolic to have a government take land away from your exploiter that killed your family and often the independence campaigns promised redistribution and largely ran on this. This means you need to meet this need for redistribution otherwise you end up with an unstable system because populists and radical forces can use the discontent and rile up people against the government. you generally get uprisings and strikes against the situation. This is incredibly bad in an already weak system. Second layer then, on why our government is likely better and more stable. Because our authoritarian leader has massive incentives to improve people's lives tangibly. People are okay with having less political rights only when their lives are actually becoming better because of that. Look at China, for example. Second, because often these people are former revolutionary leaders, they care about the country and the state they're in a lot. They're really invested, right? They literally risk their life for independence. But then thirdly, they're also quite educated and knowledgeable about this country and its issue. And fourthly, I think generally we can know that they're good leaders because they reconciled independence movement. Compare the central opposition, where you get an unstable democracy because they have little buy-in. That is firstly because there is distrust into the Western democratic system. Panel, I just want to make this very clear. This was the system that was used to create the inequality you are experiencing. The system that was in place when your cousins were taken away, your parents were murdered by the white settlers white missionaries put the system onto you i don't think there's a reason why african farmers would trust it then second because ethnic groups have lessened incentive to buy into the system that is because every group gains from overthrowing the new weak order we are likely getting coups and constant changes in who leads what panel there are precedents in algeria in 1999 when an islamist party tried to overthrow the government, or in Ghana when a military coup overthrew Khamenei Nukwa's government. This is uniquely harmful to democracies because they depend on wanting people to buy into it. You need to go to elections, you need to accept their results, you need to support protests of either side of the house. Third layer then, on why we get more actionability. Democracies are generally slow, especially if they're new, right? You have no established compromise mechanisms, you don't even know which parties are running for an election then. Second, because democracies in post-colonial states specifically are likely blocked by ethnic tensions. We need to compromise and there are potential deadlocks that occur when parties specifically cater to certain ethnicities when engaged in clientelism where policies are specifically designed only for one. Before I move on, why this argument is generally important, is there a PY? Okay, moving on. Why then is stability so important? Because we think in the best case for opposition, you're getting an unstable and dysfunctional government that cannot deliver basic necessities like building hospitals and infrastructure because it all requires government action that is blocked on opposition side of the house and a democracy that is in deadlock. But I think in their worst case, you have weak structures that are prone to coups and civil wars. Panel, you need to get your land back to get your country back. We say you get immaterial equality before you get immaterial rights. So proud to propose."

Firstly, it is contingent on the willingness of these leaders to redistribute land in the model that they have given to us. Firstly, we look at the model of Zimbabwe when Zimbabwe was another country that prioritized land reform. Land was not accessible to the average individual but was rather prioritized to be redistributed to party loyalists and those who participated within the struggle. And we think this was something that was common amongst most African states when we look at countries like Uganda and Zimbabwe. Why does this become important in proving that side propositions model doesn't work in this debate? That's on the first instance, on the willingness of the political leaders to partake in this form of redistribution. But on the second level, we don't think there's people who will buy into the fact of there being a cap being put on the amount of land that is being given back to them. Because we think on the principle of reparations, you do not choose the amount you wish to give back but you give back what is due if i as a fat as my ancestral family on 30 of the land i expect to be reparated 30 of the land we think in terms when we put a cap on this you're likely to run into a lot of conflicts and friction with people who do not agree with this model but secondly on that of brian we think ethnic groups especially won't buy in. When we look at minority groups have already been disenfranchised and receiving a lot of their land from majoritarian groups. And at a point that you put a cap, we think it becomes a scapegoat from majoritarian groups not to back the majority of the land that was stolen from them. Secondly, we think that a lot of people would be too poor to access a lot of these rights."

What does political emancipation look like and what does economic emancipation look like? Firstly, political. We think this looks like drafting legitimate constitutions secondly providing a separation of powers between the judiciary and executive and thirdly setting up a judicial system that acts as checks and balances on justice in the current country on a civil and political level we think economic emancipation looks like the devolving of financial needs down to the leaders appointed of these countries to embark on economic survival on their own or setting up of a democratic structure why this is true we think it is the common trend that is perpetuated in multiple countries if we're really looking at what economic preparations look like not what side purposes they gave you we look at how the Zimbabwe"

And then they were told to do with it as they pleased, whether or not they would use it to buy back their land from the white settlers. So we find as we find it more preferable in pursuing a sound political system. The clearest context of these two roots we will use in this debate is that of the conscience of South Africa and Zimbabwe. The reason why is because geographically they are close in proximity and share a lot of the same geographical things. So they were ruled by the same people and thus their only real substantive reason for difference in political, economic and social progression is their difference in the route taken after gaining independence. We think one, South Africa asked for help in setting up administrative judicial structures and a demarcation between the executive and the judiciary, whilst the mob would prioritize economic emancipation in the form of reparations. This will act as a rebuttal to a lot of the substantive from first speaker. The impacts of this. Firstly, South Africa in the 28-year democracy has been able to recall lot of the substantive from first speaker the impacts of this firstly satan in the 28-year democracy has been able to recall two of his presidents to question their conduct with zuma effectively facing jail time and repercussions whilst in zimbabwe robert had a 37-year term in office because the constitution ultimately allowed it this being brings about a focus on economic emancipation and in turn this had a despot in its presidency while South Africa has curbed this with political structures. And secondly, South Africa in turn has experienced a degree of economic emancipation after pursuing political emancipation. We think this looks like there's been better housing at cheaper prices, a new industry that has begun to spring up in a political system where if people can call it out and they're being changed at a point in time, the people call out the inconsistencies within the political system. Whilst the Zimbabwean economy is shattered when we look at the 2000 land reform policies that came along that prioritized devolving land to loyalists and those who participated in the struggle, not actually reparating it back to the people who previously owned it. Why is this a problem? This is a problem that is particularly contingent on side proposition. At a point in time that they want to put caps on the amount of land that devolved back to people this would mean that there's no guarantee that one those who lost will attain it back and secondly those who may not necessarily actually had any um any claims on said that might gain claim to access on said that if they have a political and social quota in that country at that point in time we think this looks like loyalists to certain um dominant pirate parties and those who then support this movement this becomes important"

I think an authoritarian leader has an incentive to set the cap at a certain level where his policy is effective enough to actually achieve the change he wants. Why would he otherwise try it in the first place? Secondly, I also think we get a justice system just as they do. The difference then lies in how the democracy political system looks.

They would hate the fact that the Hollandizers came in in here stole the land and took it away from them they want this back i think land secondly is more tangible and political right this is something that gives them an immediate benefit i don't think they can claim on their side there's a bigger idea of getting theirs thirdly i would argue because equity and equity is affects how happy you are because i compare my happiness and high life satisfaction compared to other people if everyone is equal on our side and people want to be happy, we're more likely to get that. I think landowner politicians, even regardless, have incentives to also push that. On the one hand, they want brownie points, right? They want to make sure there's no uprisings that actually control them down. They want to have a symbolic policy that people can actually get behind, something that applies to all ethnic groups, not just clientelism. And secondly, because I think there's a big threat in them if they have landowners that are too powerful if you have a couple elites that are powerful there's in the people you have to serve to people you have to give like tax breaks and other things to people control you out of policy i don't think it's something you would want i think therefore on our side secondly the ideas they tell us or the cap system is wrong because not everyone gets a just representation i think this happens on a spectrum thus even if i don't perfectly get what i want or what i deserve even if it's not getting some it's better than getting none i think therefore this principle still stands but note they assume our policy does not work at all but don't ever prove our implementation on their side works i would argue implementation is harder for something that is intangible something that is not native to this community and it's harder to actually implement secondly on the quality of life of these people because I think you are Hannah tells you quite a few mechanisms here which go completely unrespond to the only ideas we get no thank you is this idea it's not perfectly redistributed but I think even on a marginal level even I tell you because they want to cater to every ethnic group they want to make sure this is a policy that they can reunite people under they're more likely to make this fair but even if they don't even if they give it to some people, I still think this works for a majority of people. I still think a majority of people now can flee exploitation of these landlords, can flee the loan wages, and therefore actually get possibility of some economic reparations.

There was a huge unrest in 2021, and 350 people died in that. I don't think there's an example where they proved that this policy works in other ways. The only idea we get here is that we have a loyalist. I want to point out this again would mean that we've given power to a small elite. This is not something a politician has incentive in, because a small elite would mean I'm dependent on a small group to actually keep me in power. To have multiple people spread it out, there's not an individual who can actually throw me out of my room. Spreading the eggs I have to feed to, meaning, for example, giving economic growth to everyone, giving land reform to everyone because it's something everyone can get behind, is so much better. Again, I want to point out here that Johanna gives you mechanisms on how, for example, political deadlock will happen, how, for example, policies will not actually be enacted or there's civil rights on their side.

                "text": "Let's get to my own substantive addition here, the long-term trajectory. The thesis is, in the best-case scenario of both sides, proposition gets fair redistribution, opposition gets their political rights, we also get political rights on proposition. Why will opposition not get land redistribution in the long term? The reason is because opposition gives all their people political rights. This also means they give the right to property. This means opposition can't anymore expropriate the land of people because property rights are protected. Leave them two options. One, they either have the prost policy of like having a willing seller, possibly a problem one, that not everyone is willing to sell their land. But even if they are, because they know this is a government plan, they hold the leverage of keeping prices extremely high and therefore not actually being affordable for the government. Secondly, they can expropriate land without a willing seller because the land government actively infringes on the right of a person. Compensation has to be extremely high to justify this. Problem is, post-colonial countries oftentimes are extremely poor, have small government budgets, they can't actually afford this. This is opposition's worst case. This means this won't have any form of land redistribution at all. In opposition's best case scenario, they get some land distribution, but it's on a small scale, doesn't affect everyone, few privileged people get this. It takes a big part of government budget and is really slow and takes a lot of time. Before I can tell you where Proposition gets political rights and redistribution, I'll take a POI. Voters and cash transfers can't be equitable without a justice system to safeguard these for you. I think I tell you this in my intro, be equitable without a justice system to safeguard these things? I think I tell you this in my intro. We also have a justice system. We also have a legal system. And the active incentive on why we have it is because it makes it easier to actually implement these policies, implement their policy, implement their rule. But even if you don't buy my mechanistical examples, look at Namibia, look at Egypt, look at different authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia in the world. They still have these kind of justice systems. I don't think there's a claim. I don't think there's a mechanism behind how they get this. Okay. Why do we get political rights and redistribution in long-term? What we create is a strong middle-class. Lots of people on our side own land suddenly, and now have a baseline of wealth. Additionally, they can use the land they have to pay for education, to start a business and actually grow. Analogy here is on their side, they'll have an Elon Musk. On our side, we'll have a million homeowners. This will lead to the democratisation in the long term because people with economic power will now demand political rights. This is especially the case because these people are more educated on our side and they are rich enough to actually care about other things than just care about other things and not just only their material well-being. But the middle class is so big and so vital for the economy that even the credible threat of them standing up, them stopping producing goods, is enough to bully and push the government and actually giving up. I think the authoritarian regimes at that point are unable to further be able to do this. How this could look is, for example, in a British monarchy, where, for example, you had the rich aristocracy, which you only cater to, but at the point of industrialization, you had merchants, you had engineers, you had a bigger middle class were wealthy and because of this the king had to create assemblies in later parliament to satisfy the demands of this growingly important class democracy was created because a few couldn't could be paid off with government contracts but because we had so many people now you had to necessitate and you had to give them powers even if this fails governments will have to improve their institutions and go kind of go in the demands of these people, bettering the lives of everyday people because of all of this, because we can claim the benefits. They can't claim ours. Vote side proposition."

Firstly, just on basic contextual clarity and what these two policies look like because proposition has no proper understanding. After sharing gives you an actual analogous thing of what happens in Africa. A few things that we think are very important a we told you that when you look at things such as political reparations and what they look like such as like creating civil liberties it means that the countries like western liberal democracies at a point of these countries were becoming post-colonial there was a meeting that was set up e.g the lancaster hours agreement and also like the movement within south africa what happened is it was you had to prioritize whether or not you had to create proper financial structures and redistribute land or you had to create actual political systems where individuals could vote and use build up large democratic sites which would be used as accountability mechanisms. That isn't why the two examples that they have for their entire case don't wreck Egypt and Namibia is primarily because Namibia invested mostly in creating a proper function of democratic structures that could hold governments accountable and make sure that they couldn't merely just take advantage of citizens and points at which they want to keep their real up-and-touch and investigate. Before I talk about quality of life, I'll take that POI. Go. Why then did a majority of countries that tried civil political rights fail and slide back into authoritarianism on your side? Listen, you are very up on the fact that what actually happened in Africa. There's a few things that happened. We say, A, the countries that did prioritize the creation of political and civic rights, countries such as South Africa, managed to create systems that were efficient. That is to say, we managed to recall Jacob Zuma, managed to recall Thabo Mbeki, we managed to historically recall actual presidents. Two, it meant that these individuals have been capacitated to historically sue the state and effectively take out presidents. This didn't happen in countries that actually prioritized the creation of, you know, that prioritized that deprivation that Staff Sharon already explained"

That is to say they viewed themselves as those who deserved more than that basic and average citizen. Within society they were more likely to actually capture the state and use it for themselves at a point at which citizens did not have active democratic structures to call them out and to make sure that the system was inherently better. Note the only reason why white people were effectively able to take away the land of black people is because they did not have civic rights that protected them from that ever happening in the first place. When you just take those people and give them back those in that land in that very same situation, I think it is equally easy for the government that exists to use policies to directly take away that land, even if they redistributed at the very start of your policy in your best case scenario. So we think anyway you're likely to repeat the harms that you talk about. So the best response that you get then from opposition to our, from proposition to our entire case is that like economic policies themselves are unstable, we don't necessarily have structures and why the structures don't exist. I think in first picture it does a really good job in showing you what setting democratic structures actually look like political in post-colonial African states and systems where it was prioritized but it meant something to say it meant that you would sit down at the table with active people who were already involved such as the un and other bodies that already actively involved in democratic systems they would help with the initial foundation of state democratic system and make sure that they were fine and make sure that you could actually separate legislature and other forms of state power to make sure that they were sufficient in"

Firstly, note that elites are a direct threat to leaders, right? So if you give people economic power, they can then use this power to defeat you and control you politically, right? Especially right after a revolution where leaders are presumably the weakest, it is a bad idea for them to give lots of land to powerful people, right? It is much easier to tax and control lower classes in the short term. Secondly, note that after a revolution, there is still this revolutionary move, right? The leader has seen what can happen when the people get angry and overthrow a government this is why they are likely to want to get brownie points with the entire population that means that giving land retribution therefore like ending basically colonization because only if you get your land back do you get your country back it is likely to be incredibly popular. Note that also this policy equally benefits all ethnicities. And thirdly, if you are relatively well off, then the potential personal gain from a revolution does not outweigh the risk of having the revolution fail. For all of these reasons, it is a very good idea for these leaders to implement this policy to like keep their power, which is why they will do this."

We would tell you that opposition simply asserts that they will be able to get a democracy. Never do they give you mechanisms, structure, reasons why they will be able to do this. We would give you two further reasons why it is much easier to get land redistribution than a functioning democracy. Firstly, land redistribution is a one-time policy. A functioning democracy needs continuous political buy-in and people to support it secondly right note that on our side of the house we have a capable administration that previously distributed land to the colonizers and can now do the reverse and like like give it to the local population versus on their side of the house they have no tradition of a western democracy how is it going to stand? But ultimately, Tarun's argument tells you why on the long term, we will be able to implement both, right? Because only we can do this. Because when you have a democracy that functions, if we take opposition at their best, then that democracy guarantees property rights, right? And you would have to give people compensation for like, and that would probably be too expensive for a developing country's government. On proposition, we tell you, the more economic power people have, the more they will push for these to be politically formalized.

Three reasons. Firstly, because people simply care more about material things, right? In order to redress past injustice, I have to cut my country back, I have to get my land back. This is internalized injustice that people want to redress. Secondly, on an individual metric, material things are simply more tangible for me and have a bigger impact on my quality of life. If I have money, I can pay a good education for my kids and give them a good life. However, one vote is unlikely to change the outcome of an election. Thirdly, material things are logically prior in Maslow's hierarchy of need, right? First, you need safety and your physiological needs met before you can reach self-actualization. I need money in order to pay tuition, in order to get access to my right to education. I need to be able to buy a newspaper in order for freedom of press to matter.

They will be happy to simply be better off to have some wealth, even if it isn't perfect, because presumably they understand that perfection isn't perfect. But secondly, because colonization was probably like 200 years or so, they probably don't even remember who exactly their land owned for.

That is to say countries like South Africa, countries like Namibia, and countries such as Egypt, that they also claim again. It feels really weird because the countries that first set up democratic systems that could hold these politicians into account and make sure that they did the policies that they promised the citizens. Further than that, we told you that the best example for this debate was SA and Zimbabwe. Told you that these are countries that exist very close to each other in proximity on terms of like geography and all this. Told you that most of the benefits that they could incur were symmetric for these two countries but the difference was in what policy they chose to use in making sure that they actually achieved their form of like um of freedom and independence. We showed you then throughout analogies how Zimbabwe in status quo is significantly worse on a political spectrum on an economic spectrum. We've shown you how South Africans have directly managed most of them to at least have access and claim land that they historically owned was their ancestors and they got it back. We showed you how they managed to recall presidents. The only response they gave you to this was to their example and not the analysis itself, and was merely to say South Africa is corrupt, corruption is bad. We don't think that Arasahamdas was conclusive because he showed you that this analysis was not based off of that just impact alone. But most importantly, the third speaker concedes that these institutions are unstable on their side. We say that concession in itself meant that they could"

But in the second, they want to claim, well, this is inherently an unequal distribution. You only give this to loyalists. They ignore what Tarun and Oud talk to you for four minutes throughout both of their speeches right you would necessarily want to cater to everyone rather than creating a small elite right if I give Oud and Tahun all of my land it's much more likely than they can that they can overthrow me rather than when I give it to all of you in this room because individually you're less likely to overthrow me this is an incentive to do land redistribution well i'm not going to give it to all of my like only like the loyalists second i think the leader is afraid of being overthrown again if they don't do this well i think because people have such a massive desire which they never contest this is likely to be very very very well done right we see this in examples we see this in ghana for example right i think other ethnic groups will then hold them in check it's likely to be very well done. But even if that weren't true, they tell you well, but like the government is too weak. Panel at best is asymmetric, if the government is so weak, they never get a democracy on ours, their side of the house as well. I think much rather it's then easier to get land redistribution because it's only one time because ethnic parties have an active incentive to buy into that and to get it well done. What is the impact of this panel? I think we're way more likely to get good land redistribution than they are to get good democracy.

                "text": "So first argument on how this leads to immediate increasing prosperity. Why do economic rights matter to individuals? Firstly, day-to-day life improvement. If you had given these people land to their name, they would have been able to utilize this land for survival. For example, they would have been able to cultivate their land and feed their children. This matters especially in post-colonial Africa, when during the 60s, 45% of child deaths in Africa was due to malnutrition, while at the same time it held the biggest level of agricultural exports in the world. On the comparative, what happened under opposition was giving those people freedom of speech to ask for food without giving them the benefit immediately. Second reason why economic rights matter is independence. If you had given these people economic reparations, it would have enabled them to act independently by giving them options from ownership of land that would allow them to sell it or start trading or open up a business to cash transfer that would give them stable income and control of their future. On a principal level, we restore their autonomy because they are finally recognized as people who can make choices. This is something they were deprived of by colonialists. On the comparative, opposition as a form of compensation gave these people rights they could not utilize to maximize their choices for two reasons. Firstly, lack of democratic institutions. For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state. And secondly, lack of democratic institutions. For example, the right to vote is meaningless in a one-party state. And secondly, lack of democratic traditions. For people in power, it was difficult to understand their powers derived from the people. And for the people, this meant accepting the complex of democracy, like being on the losing side of elections and having to accept majority control. This is complex for them to understand so third reason why economic rights mother to individual is trusting the system because the outcome of having day-to-day improvements and independence is that these people would have started to see immediate change and tangible benefits to their lives on the comparative when rights didn't give them immediate benefits they ended up doing the system that didn't give them what's promised in the chart piece.

                "text": "so economic rights are the first priority. Why immediately after the colonization is a narrow window in time for the opportunity to get these rights. Two reasons. First, the momentum of the colonization. When the colonization happened, there was a situation of political power so with new institutions in the way it would have made sense for a distribution of economic power to have been part of that process as well. On the comparative what happened under opposition by postponing land reparations was establishing a new state that reflected the older colonial economic order. So when South Africa is now doing it during the colonization, but now it's targeting part of the elite instead. So initially it said it would happen in five years under Parisians, but now the target has changed to 35 years later. So the second reason why now is the right time to do it, why after the colonization is the right time to do this, is that elites were at their weakest. Because right after the colonization, they had time to do this is that elites were at their weakest because the right because right after the colonization they had part of economic wealth but they didn't yet have the opportunity to establish their control over the new government so opposition allowed the elites to establish political power without challenging economic power so pursuing economic operations to start would have meant less powerfully to oppose this process. So, for example, Ghana that prioritized political reform and only tried cross transfer programs 10 years after independence, at which point they had established political power and could make sure to get the majority of funds. Well, in that case, it would have been much easier to have a successful cash transfer program immediately when elites power was not so much a trench in"

                "text": "society now moving on to the second argument about state building where economic rights reparations likely to create a more stable state than civil and political rights before all that argument i will accept the poi you keep talking about how you will be achieving all these great impacts for vulnerable people in the post-colonial states but you never explain to us how you're going to be doing these things. How is the land going to be distributed and by whom? Who is going to be deciding who gets the cash in that colonial state? Who is going to be leading? Okay, so well there are land reparations have a defined process of happening. You have the new state that has been assigned the role of distributing the land to the people as fairly as possible. And since under our city we make it a priority, then all political capital, all the focus would be on how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest, to the most vulnerable. These things would be the how to give these cash transfer programs, how to distribute land to the weakest, to the most vulnerable. These things would be the criteria for starting this. And in fact, this was in our model from the get go about how this looks like nationalizing companies, for example, to distribute wealth to the masses. Now moving on to my second argument about state building. Why economic rights are likely to create more stable states than civil and political rights? Because to have stability in the system, you need to have people buying and support. So when politicians promise that people's lives will become better and actually they don't, the system loses credibility. So what happened is people were expecting change improvements in their day to day life, but when promise of meaningful rights never materialized, they lost faith in the system. On the comparative, if you had given these people a piece of land the system wouldn't have been perfect but they would at least have done to be improving was it important firstly this led to uprisings by the people who were disappointed by the system which political leaders responded with martial law and violent oppression for example in vongo mobutu had 33 300 000 civilians in that instance people neither had economic prosperity nor did they enjoy the rights they were promised to get. Secondly, when things go wrong, people needed someone to blame and because there were societies that were deeply ethnically divided, they started blaming each other, leading to incredibly bloody civil wars and even genocides. For example, in Rwanda, Tutsis controlled a lot more land than the Hutus and the fact that it was never redistributed led to conflict which escalated to genocide. On on the comparative when you have a small business you don't want economic activity to be interrupted by coffee so there is less chance of this happening so where are we likely to create more accountability because we it's because we decrease the symmetry of power between people and the government it's important because colonialism created ethnic divisions with local elites that benefited from their regimes because not just the colonial masses that pressured the people. For example in Rwanda, Belgium chose to rule over the Hutus and now we increase accountabilities from the Hutus to the Tutsis because now, because we give them land, they can actually have an influence in government because they're the ones that pay taxation, contribute to the state budget. So even if you buy the idea of democracy is better, you think the democracy is democracy is better you you think the democracy is good on the other side you have more accountability so for more accountability and better state building where you can vote so I'd like to thank the first speaker of the"

First rebuttal, you spoke about economic land reparations means saving land, nationalizing corporations, and distributing the land. First of all, who will decide who gets the land? How is that distributed and by whom? Without elections and without a proper democratic process, it is very likely for there to be unequal distribution to happen first of all due to corrupt leaders that take control and all the other issues that occur in these post-colonial states without actual proper governments the people need to have the right to vote plus civil rights in order to organize themselves in a group in groups and voice their opinions on this and be able to have proper discourse and have actual say in how that land is distributed and b after colonization states are very unstable and very vulnerable to corruption the prop tells you in response to our poi that they will have land distribution but land distribution can only be successful it's the only case where it's successful is in a structured state with structured stable work union or election or some kind of political system that is only developed through political rights on our side of the house so our side of the house actually does more land distribution over long term than their side does later on secondly economic rights you spoke about the day-to-day life improvements the biggest issue is that these guys give you the impact of economic rights but never explain to you how these impacts are achieved. How are these economic rights going to be given? Third, the right to vote is meaningless, they said. Well, we tell you that's exactly the opposite. Without voting, without having civil rights, people remain dehumanized and unheard. Vulnerable minorities like women and children will not have their voices heard on their side. How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need? You simply cannot without a proper political system. Fourth, you speak about space building. The promise of meaningful rights never materializes. People are given lands. You never give a reason why meaningful rights will never materialize on our side of the debate. Why will civil rights not be promised? You also never give the likelihood to which economic rights could be achieved. I'm intuitively led to understand your impacts, but I do not believe that they are likely to happen because you never"

                "text": "explain why land is more achievable to give to people than civil rights. Now let's move on to the first argument. Let's speak about the importance of civil and political rights in these societies. There are a few reasons why we believe that civil and political rights were the most important thing for African states to prioritize in their postcolonial periods? I'll be answering this in three different points. First of all, this is what citizens in colonial periods were most denied. Many colonial rulers, be it British, French, Spanish, or whoever, often operated in these countries by a certain control, without any limited or democratic input from citizens. Where citizens had a say, it was often limited to the most elite or those who supported the colonial regime. This was done in order for those colonial forces to maintain their power. However, this denied the majority of citizens their fundamental autonomy, the thing they craved the most, their capacity to vote for their representation, their capacity to simply express their political opinion, and as a result, it was the most important thing to take back after that colonial period is over. Of course, people care about their convict status too. We don't say that they don't. However, there is a reason why middle-class citizens agitate for change and dictatorship for one-party faiths. They desire the fundamental human dignity that comes with being able to express your free will in society and political system. Secondly, these rights are necessary for some of the most vulnerable groups. Women, sexual minorities, and ethnic minorities often face massive discrimination in post-colonial societies, often as a relic imposed from conservative Western rulers. Civil and political mechanisms were often the only way these groups could bring attention to their struggle, whether it be through free speech, protest, or otherwise. Three, these rights were crucial to prevent democratic backslide in post-colonial states. For many African nations, the post-colonial period represented their first attempts for decades or centuries at self-governance. Whilst many nations thrived, many nations faced challenges due to democratic cronyism. Only strong political rights provided the mechanism to check this democratic backlash and ensure fragile institutions do not completely crumble. Before I move on to my second argument, I'll take your POI now. If leaders are corrupt enough not to be able to do land redistribution, why wouldn't, for the example, rig the election, making any right to vote completely meaningless? Well, simply, I'll give you the example of Morocco. Morocco focused on land redistribution after colonial states, where the people in power were the elites in the society. They took all the land for themselves and did redistribute it properly. However, on our side of the debate, political rights are the first thing looked at. Therefore, the people elected are through the consensus and the votes of all the people around them, not simply by being elite or being a general in society. Therefore, they have their structured people that were put in place by their people. They were chosen by their people and have a much, much higher chance of being less corrupt due to being in a politically correct system. Now let's move on to argument number two. We speak about the practicalities of economic and land reparations."

                "text": "First of all, in many cases it will simply be done right and possible to achieve economic and land reparations. I'll be expanding about this in four different points. First of all, land reparations is probably the worst case for opposition. Take for example the case of South Africa. Given the significant overlap between post-pollinism and apartheid, advocating for any land redistribution is away from white landowners would not only have been unsuccessful due to the massive influence of white landowners such as farmers, but this might have been a very real chance of inciting significantly further violence as individuals felt their very livelihoods were threatened. B, taking even a less contentious example, even quotas or cash transfers in the majority of African societies would have been seen as contentious due to the perceived nature of them taking from one group and giving to another. C, this is not the case with civil and political rights, which are not zero-sum, which is exactly what they're proposing. That is, if you give rights to one group, you don't need to take it away from another group, whereas that is necessarily the case with any form of economic distribution, which of course leads to conflicts and tension in the country, which is especially bad for these fragile new countries that are still developing. The conclusion of this is that governments and civil society groups would have not only wasted their limited political capital, but may have actively risked further destabilization and violence in many fragile societies. And that is their only impact. Secondly, in the long term, we think that it's actually easier to achieve economic rights through stable political rights. For example, when you're able to freely form associations like unions you can advocate for worker protection or you're able to freely vote for a party that represents your actual interests you can vote for the best economic policies. And PropsWorld is one where at best best we have achieved some economic redistribution but not prioritized a long-term mechanism to continue to achieve economic benefits once those needs evolve in the future only our side does so and that's why i'm extremely proud"

                "text": "the well-being of the African people before going on into my argument about limiting neocolonialism rebuttal four main things firstly opposition is telling us that we are going to have unequal distributions because of corrupt leaders, but that people need to group and have a say and decide together where there are not these land reparations are going to happen. Firstly, we think that the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to have these civil rights and give them to the people under their side of the house, we're talking about the same people that are going to do this land distribution under our side of the house. Because these are the people that are more likely to assume power. The people that are leading the independence movements are the ones that usually are elected in the beginning of these democracies because these are the most known people and in the same way they would usually assume power under our side of the house as well so if these people are so corrupt then that is also the way that they corrupt these democracies that they're able to then change the constitutions so but what do we change here is the second response having these same people under our side of the house we have more accountability for these people, exactly because the states are now more dependent on the people, care more about the people, because they have something to offer, right? Because now that these people have land, now that these people are paying taxes, they're not just a burden to the state asking for shelter and food, but they're actually something that the state is dependent on on the comparative it is very easy to like dismiss their civil and political rights when they can just say that these people are not as important because we don't get our money from these people let's change the constitution it's much harder to have accountability when the state is not dependent on them but third thirdly, even if you buy that under our sort of the house, we have more corruption, right? We still get the benefits of having at least some kind of land distribution, at least some kind of more cash towards these people. So on the immediate level, these people are better off because they're less hungry, because they're able to use their money to invest in hungry, because they're able to use their money to invest in things, because they're able to have autonomy in their decisions. But secondly, because we have more stability in that place in general, exactly because of the fact that they're not leaving to have conflicts, that we have less, we even told you about why genocide is less likely to happen because of this stability, which is very important. So even if you buy that corruption, we still think that it is very important to have these economic reparations prioritised. But secondly, opposition is telling us that people lose their voices. But we think that, as I said in my introduction, it's not as important for people to lose their voices when we're talking about people that do not have like basic things to begin with we think that these people need to have these reparations need to have this land and need to be able to like have to have this immediate benefits right now but thirdly opposition is telling us that the reason why they want civil rights is because this is what people were mostly denied because they did not have a say like during colonialism which we think to an extent is true right like during colonialism former colonial powers did not give people the ability to have a say and to have political liberties but the reason why this was harmful is because they also didn't give them a way to take control of their resources to take like to be able to decide what is going to happen with their land which is taking away the the idea that these people have ownership over their land when they didn't let them decide what to do with their minds what to do with their agriculture this meant that these people now don't feel like their land is theirs so in order to be able to have civil and political rights, even in the long term, if you buy that this is something ideal, we need these people to feel like what they're deciding on is something that is theirs. And this will not happen if you don't give them the ownership, right? Because the ownership is what they have been missing for all of these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistribution are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another. these years of colonialism. But fourthly, opposition says that land redistributions are unsuccessful because they're pretentious because they come from one group to another. We think that firstly, it is harmful that the examples that they gave us are of things like South Africa, which have been delayed and delayed again and again, exactly because they let time pass, which now makes it harder to do this redistribution because it seems like you're taking away this from the elites and not from the colonial powers. But secondly, we think that this is exactly why land redistributions cannot happen later on. And we need to prioritize them in the beginning because this is when we have more turmoil going on in society. This is when we have a general thing of like changing the way that society exists and generally of trying to make reparations taking stuff away from the colonial powers especially when we have when we live in a society where a lot of decolonization happened in the same time period before moving on into my argument i'll take the point"

                "text": "okay so no point now my argument is about limiting neocolonialism. This argument is going to prove that prioritizing economic reparations is necessary to limit the instincts of the former colonial power. Even 60 years after decolonization, colonial powers are still benefiting from the extraction economies that they created, which is why France is dominating Cameroon's agriculture and selling in their own markets. This means that even though the colonization ended formal political control, it did not end economic control, since a lot of the assets remained in the harm of the former colonial power or their local collaborators. How does economic presence enable other forms of neocolonial influence in the area? Firstly, political influence. Having economic influence over the country like france owning the majority of senegal's banking telecommunications and supermarket industries means that they get more bargaining power intervention in the political situation because when a majority of the african states income comes through these taxes when they're all especially when their own people are that poor this means that if they see a benefit in cheap working hands for extraction they're more likely to pressure for the continuation of such conditions. But secondly, they can even have military influence because they can use the excuse of, I have my assets there, I need to be able to defend them, like France does with having troops in Mali, Chad, and Niger. This is important because these two ways of influence break the self-determination and sovereignty of these African states. How would prioritizing land reparations and past transfers fix this? Because returning wealth and capital from the colonial elites to the masses means that they would have the ability to use this capital to create domestic industries. Therefore, they could use their minds to build manufacturing rather than only extraction. This could create an economy that is more independent from the former colonial control. Notice that by doing this from the beginning, it would become easier to actually disengage from that economy versus on the comparative, because you have tied your development to these companies that extract, it's not easy to happen. When we're creating this independent economy, this means that when the other powers like the US and China want to have influences in China, in Africa, which they will because of the vast resources they don't get involved with the extraction model but they're more likely to have agreements as trading partners which would be better because they're established based on a new order as two sovereign states so they're more likely to be actually beneficial but secondly because the agreements will be beneficial to the majority of the people and not the top 1% because they are the ones that own the assets that now foreign powers want to use. So because we prove to you that it is actually better to have economic independence with our side of the house, please vote for PRO. Thank you."

They kept telling you that on their side, they have the most short-term benefit of having people being immediately fed. But we've already explained to you, panel, that these impacts don't make any sense without a proper mechanism. They still don't explain to you how land distribution, how cash quotas, how all of these economic reparations will actually happen on their side. How will this land be distributed? Who will be making these decisions? Who will have their cash removed in order to give it to someone else? All of this model, this model is not existent on the proposition side. They haven't explained to you the detailed outline of what is needed in order for their economic impacts to have any sense. No, thank you. Protected time. We also tell you that the comparative is that it is very difficult to hand out political and civil rights in a discriminatory way. For example, if you protect the right to protest, you are almost always likely to do this for all groups in society. And this is the point that they have not responded to. We already told them that there is a great point of contention and tension because of their economic policies. Because at the end of the day, if you're giving land to someone, you're taking it from someone else. And that creates tension in an already unstable country that has just been decolonized. And for you to not respond to these arguments makes you already lose that clash. They also tell you that, you know, the same people will have power on both sides of the house. And we completely disagree with this point, because we tell you that people that are likely to receive power on the proposition side without an electoral process are people who already have power who are not the vulnerable stakeholders of this debate who like women and children and minorities ethnic minorities sexual minorities who do not have the ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them back we tell you that through our side with an electoral process we have the ability to choose for themselves the leader that they think will represent them best. We tell you that through our side, with an electoral process, we have the ability to choose a leader that will do the best. So we tell you on the on the point of tangible changes, our side can support basic welfare programs that help the most vulnerable. But Proposition has to specifically defend things like active land distribution, quotas, cash transfer programs, which are not necessary to get people out of poverty. Proposition still has to explain how they can achieve those things. We explained to you why those aims would have been impossible in many countries in our first opposition speaker due to the fact that they are seen as a trade off for some groups, which is not the case for political rights. And even if economic rights are important, they are not more important than political rights, because the only way that you can achieve any form of utility is by being able to express your preferences in a political system, which only our sides provide. And at the end of the day, we provide the longest-term pathway to propositions benefits. With only proper political rights can groups form unions, lobby governments for economic policies, and so on. So I'll be moving on to my first"

                "text": "argument about the international exploitation. The premise of this argument is simple. Even as many colonial forces exited African states, many did so with unease, either believing their ousting was illegitimate or seeking to continue to reap the economic rewards of colonial exploitation. Thus, these powers looked for other ways to exert power or control, for example, through exploitative trade deals, resource projects, and so on. Our claim is that that would have been significantly easier for colonial powers to do this if African states did not prioritize political and civil rights in this period. Firstly, political and civil rights simply provide a mechanism to lobby domestic governments if citizens feel that international powers are exerting inappropriate influence. For example, to vote out a government that is in bed with a problematic Western company. Secondly, international powers can more easily justify intervening in African states when they perceive them to be quote-unquote broken or corrupt. This is less likely on our side when these states have a much healthier political system. The second proposition speaker told you that on their side, they'll have better trading relationships with countries like the US, countries like France, and that they'll be better partners. But we tell you that the reality is when you have a broken political system, these higher powers like the US and France can take advantage of that country and can exploit them further through exploitative trade deals. The impact of this argument is clear. We get less long-term international meddling in African states, allowing them to be more autonomous and not stuck in an exploitative relationship that is different to their past colonial rule. Moving on to my second argument, but before I do so I'll take your POI. When these countries like France have so much have so much investment in these colonial states, why would the government kick them out when it gets a lot of the money from their taxes okay international investment is based on so many factors it's based on resources it's based on borders it is hard to fully predict that if investment with that investment would have been stronger if those countries economies would have been stronger if i take your best case saying that your economic impacts will happen and as we've shown you powerful western countries may have further exploited african countries post-colonialism if they perceive them to be weak politically. Like with the example of South Africa, for example, when that political system was weak, that African state was subject to exploitative trade agreements through apartheid policies, for example. So when you have a weak political system, there is guarantee that you will be exploited by those same trading partners that you reap that you claim you reap benefits from our second argument about is about"

And to that, we have two very important responses. Firstly, we have pointed throughout the debate that corruption is symmetric, that if they are like if under their side of the house, politicians are corrupt, like if under our side of the house, politicians are corrupt. This means that also on their side of the house, the same politician is corrupt. The reason why your side is better is because, for example, if you're corrupt enough to make land distribution a little bit different, you will end up having a piece of land. Yes, maybe not the same with the elites, but end up having a piece of land yes maybe not the same with the elites but you will have a piece of land under your side of the house if you end up corrupting the election and it's rigged therefore your like rights to vote is meaningless because whatever it happened the very electorate process was corrupt under our side of the house you at least get some benefits but secondly and most importantly here let's take them at their very best and assume that somehow under our side of the house we have more corruption here's why more corruption still wins the debate because even if you're more corrupt under our side of the house and they give less rights like they give a lot less time to the people right they're giving them very very little little land or very, very little caste. We told you why even a very, very small piece of land is important to literally feed your child to the point that during the 60s, malnutrition was the cause of 45% of children dying in Africa. And on your side of the house, yes, you have, for example, less corrupt freedom of expression and you're able to have a more independent press but what's the point of that if the reason why you needed it in the first place was to demand the food that we're immediately giving them under our side of the house this is why in the end of the day even if we take them at the best what they never managed to respond is our argument about what these people what they need in the short term is the ability to eat is the ability to exercise the basic economic rights that they were deprived of and in reality this resulted to deaths of children that's a family that did not have access to a simple necessities as food but"

And to that, we have two different responses. Firstly, we think they're being a lot assertive here. We think that the major harm that was done during colonialism is that these people were not able to exercise the right of property, that in Nigeria, they were not able to take control of their oils, that in Congo, they were not able to take control of their diamonds. Not having a right to property means that you're not able to understand that you have a right towards the state. Meaning that even if you give these people the right to vote, these people don't have the sense of empowerment, don't have the sense that I have a right towards this property and this brings me this empowerment that I need. You're giving these people the right to vote in a world in which they don't even have like a right to property. But secondly, we also tell you that under their side of the house, civil rights do not end up materializing. This is because as we told you from the get-go, which they didn't respond to, you're giving them for example the right to vote in a way that the institutions themselves are not being established. This means that in their best-case scenario, these things end up materializing in the best case scenario, these things end up materializing in the very long term, taking away all the benefits that they bring about faith in the system. Because the point that the colonization has happened, and the first thing that you prioritize is this right, but the institutions are not there, these people do not see them as valuable. And in the long term, this results to them not being able to exercise them. And this is why a lot of states right now in Africa do not have a democracy, exactly because the people were not able to take advantage of these rights. But thirdly, they also tell us that rights are very important to minorities. Yes, we also think that for these minorities, what is really important is for them to eat, is to have food. And also, who are these minorities and the women that are so great and like they have gotten all these rights we think that they have been massively oppressed to the point that they did not have basic access to necessities and therefore if they were a lot were placed in a lot more difficult positions being forced in extreme conditions of work and hence being deprived of even more rights before i move on to my class about stability i'll take"

We tell you that economic distribution in certain states may have been susceptible to corruption or lobbying influence, especially where government institutions were more fragile. This looks like a group with more political power, such as former lobbying governments for a greater slice of the pie, or in the worst case scenario corrupt official investment parts of cash transfer this uh the comparison is is that is that is very difficult to hand out political and civil rights in a discriminatory way for example if you protect the right to protest you are most likely to do this for all groups in society they have clearly clearly and in real comparison, they keep comparing corruption on our side and corruption on their side. Investing some money doesn't have anything to do with corrupting an entire election. This is not sympathetic at all. Well, corruption on your side is most likely to happen because they are corrupting, taking land, having more cash, etc. But you are saying that it's the same as corrupting an entire election well this doesn't make any sense they say that in their world they have independence and citizens restore their autonomy do you think in a world where they don't have right to vote to speak to choose from themselves it's being independent having the land but no right to vote is exactly the opposite of independence their most our second main flash and their most important arguments later their our second clash and their most important argument was that post-colonial uh states suffered from extreme poverty and uh uh and that's in their world they have more people to defend and we have four responses to this although these claims are too vague and not true in in all cases as i imagine most people in post-colonial countries are all uh are all uh not fed well for responses to this is our side can support a basic welfare program that's how the most variable prop side has to be side has to specifically defend things like active land distribution quotas and cash transfer programs, which are not necessarily to get people out of poverty. Second, profs still has to explain how they achieve those things. We explain to you why those aims would have been impossible in many countries due to the fact that they are seen as straight up for some groups, which is not the case for political rights. Thirdly, even if economic rights are important, they are not more important than political rights. The only way you can access any form of utility is by being able to express your preferences in the political system, which only our side provides.

Well, you are talking too vague because what I'm hearing is that these people, yeah, they are voting for people to protect them, to give them money to eat, to feed them. And we are not saying that all politicians aren't achieving that. Well, we are saying that by this right, not just to vote, right, express themselves and so on, they are protecting themselves and elected politicians are going to be able to develop the country. Well, later on, they are going to be able to develop the country well later on they are going to be able to also have more money and so on uh so they say the right to vote is meaningless and it's not important well we tell you that's the exact opposite without voting without having civil rights people will remain dehumanized and unheard vulnerable minorities like women and children will not have their voice heard on their side. How do you guarantee people will be given the land they need? Well, much better to choose who can do that than wait for someone who didn't choose to do that for you.

They tell you that economic land reparations will be successful on their side, that they're going to save land, they're going to nationalize corporations, distribute the land, They're going to give people economic rights and help them on a day to day basis, give them the ability to be taxpayers and to be citizens that contribute to an active economy. But we tell you that in many cases, all of these impacts are very, very unlikely to happen and that it's downright impossible to successfully achieve economic and land reparations. We told you that land reparations are sometimes the worst case for many African states, because many quotas or cash transfers can be seen as contentious because of the perceived nature of. Because when you give voting rights to one group, you're not taking away the voting rights of another group, whereas it's necessarily the case with any form of economic redistribution. And we also tell you that in the long term, we think it's actually easier to achieve economic rights through stable political rights. For example, when you're able to freely form associations like unions, you can advocate for worker protections. When you're able to freely vote for a party that represents your interests, you can vote for the best economic policies. Proposition's world is one where at best we'd achieve some economic redistribution, but not prioritize a long-term mechanism to continue achieving economic benefits once those needs evolve in the future. I think the biggest thing that Proposition has not done in this debate has actually to characterize to you panel what their economic policies look like. What does it look like to have a cash transfer program? What does it look like to have land redistribution? They don't do that on their side and we tell you that only through unions, only through political systems, strong stable ones, can we have those economic policies in the long term. Now I'm going to be doing some weighing our arguments in this debate are the most important because firstly we help ensure the most prosperous long-term future for these nations only political rights can help governments in check and ensure that they do not backslide democratically which would undo all the gains made in getting rid of these colonial rulers secondly we tell you that we help protect the most vulnerable. While low-income individuals are indeed the most vulnerable, so many other groups are only protected by our side of the debate when they have the capacity to bring attention to the struggles that they are experiencing in the political system. We also tell you that we ensure the most political and economic rights on our on our side that is proposition side cannot meaningfully achieve political rights but our but our side can achieve economic rights in the long term once we have institutions in place to sustainably do so and finally we prioritize what the majority of citizens are likely to value the most which is a political system that helps them feel dignified and no longer dehumanized and for all these reasons i proudly stand for opposition thank you very much thank you and now for the final speech"

Starting with stability, notice that this is an independent clash and an independent benefit of the land given. This doesn't mean, and this doesn't mean for us to have a lot of land for each person but rather the fact that they now have some type of ownership. We have told you three main things. Firstly about pensions that we're less likely to have pensions when you have some ownership so you're less likely to have these deadly conflicts that we're telling you but secondly we're less likely to have these ethnic divisions that are deep under opposition, as we told you, that have even led to genocide. These mechanisms were not responded, but what we heard from opposition is that you can have conflict from land distribution because you're taking away someone's land and taking it to the other. This is why we told you about why this is important for it to happen in the beginning, where we are in a context of the changing situation, where we're changing regimes, where we're changing the international arena, especially when this decolonization happened around the same decade. This is why it needed to be prioritized in the beginning. And from their first, opposition has said that they would want to land the distribution at some point. They just think it should come from the people. If they agree that it should come at some point because of this reason that we told you it is only going to work if it happens prioritized in the beginning secondly in this clash we told you about how it is harder to take away these like ownership exactly because it's more tangible versus on the comparative it's much easier to change bad stuff to like even restrict a bit of freedom of press because it takes more time for you to realize this and why because of this means that it's more easy for our types of rights to actually succeed on happening this wasn't responded so it means that we are more likely to have this benefit which brings us to the impact of having less tensions and not having more people being able to feed themselves. But thirdly, on neocolonialism, they're saying that we don't respond when we have an entire argument on this that they only apparently responded to, and when we brought back in the POI our mechanism on why governments are less likely to listen to the people when they have these colonial powers, having all of this economic rights and control, and why this would change when you actually redistribute this economic control from the beginning and allow the people and the masses to have these rights to be able to make more decisions on their account so the impact of this clash is that we have more stability which allows for more economic development that is independent of former colonial powers and because of this class alone we can win this debate."

Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution to actually distort like economic civil rights and be able to have worse harm, right? Because when Mugabe is changing the constitution to actually distort like economic civil rights and be able to have a dictatorship, when Kenyatta, the elected president, prohibits rivals from running, this doesn't allow for the rights to actually live at all.

                "text": "A few arguments come into the problem. The first is on why we benefit the economy, the second is on culture, and the third argument in the second speech is an argument around the environment. Before that, what's our stance? One, we aren't banning tourism, that's absurd. We're rather limiting the numbers in the industry. We believe that any industry can have economic benefit, but it is the duty of the state to regulate against unchecked growth in order to ensure that the possible harms don't outweigh the possible benefits. For clarity, we want tourism to not overshadow the carrying capacity that currently exists. What then does our model look like? Five things. A. It looks like establishing quarters, particularly during peak season. So for example, limiting the number of individuals that can access something like a tourist visa. It looks like how Greece's admins has put a cap to 20,000 individuals per day, down from historically with their number of 40,000. This significant reduction is going to be determined by states alongside relevant experts in the field. B. We're looking to impose restrictions on tourist-centered accommodation. So this looks like how Berlin has put a regulation on short-term rentals requiring a permit to be signed when you are apportioning the apartment in residential areas at a time. C. We're looking to also support the implementation of additional premiums for specific areas. So this looks like how Venice has an increased five-year fine for visiting Venice on day trips if individuals want to live in there. D. We're also willing to support all other reasonable initiatives to limit the number of tourists within these major destinations and also prevent the inflation impact that currently exists. Lastly, this cap would be determined from country to country basis, but it would be a cap determined on the basis of reducing the country's dependency on tourism. That's what the most important thing in this debate is. Second part of the strategy. We're willing to trade off the constant influx of money for tourism because of three reasons. One, government's responsibility to support local populations first and foremost because of social contracts. Hyper-tourism uniquely has a blanket form to its individuals, and most instances the money from tourism doesn't actually go to locals and we're the ones who put the silver back into it. But two, tourists are still able to visit on our side, we're not completely undergoing the economic benefit that exists, we're just maintaining a lack of sustainability. Third, access to tourism creates a dependency that forces governments to have pervasive interests. So the idea that the government of Brazil is now likely to not have an incentive to face your vendors because they have a reliance on slum tourism is something that they can never trade off on their side. Arguing then as to how we benefit the economy. Before I preach, I want to take a P.O.I. Arguing then as to why we benefit the economy. Before I preach the argument, let's take a P.O.I. Arguing that as to why we benefit the economy. The framing here is very simple. Unchanged tourism has led to harms to the domestic economy because oftentimes there is a prioritization around the needs and comforts of wealthy tourists over the poor population. Why then do we have more economy? Firstly, the allure of tourism is certainly that politicians often don't take the necessary means to regulating it until there's a critical tipping point, so private interest overshadows the domestic population's well-being. Air gain across the world has led to increased demand for short-term rentals, increasing the general cost of living in city centres, which leads to a real human cost, at the point at which pensioners and local individuals can't out-compete with tourists in terms of like on a many reasons. That means then, it should likely do harm to these individuals and increase the prices of food in that area. The minimum wage in Spain is a little over a thousand euros a week, but on average tourists in Madrid spend about a thousand euros. This leads to an enemy out-of-place and very veganization impact out of volume. Secondly, there's a seasonality around the world. So tourism centers are in peak seasons where markets pop up and there's accommodation that's putting tourists out. The seasonality is harmful because when tourism is allowed to grow unchecked, you create a dependency on the tourism. That means then that out of season there's no real economic benefit. This is especially important because even in the best case when they do provide jobs, those jobs are still on steam. Particularly pernicious in the instances when the government needs incentivised mass training. Because those are the types of things like hospitality training that are short-term in nature and they're very volatile. Third, the massive gains from tourism on their side just leak out of the country. Because MNCs are the largest corporations that have the ability to create large results on tourist destinations. 70% of all of the money tourists spend in Thailand ends up leaving their country. Because international allies don't benefit the local economy, local vendors often get bought out by MNCs looking to gentrify. The reason as to why MNCs and leakage are inherent to scale and are a hand to mass tourism is because they enable MNCs to gain more economies of scale, to keep prices low, and fundamentally is a greater likelihood of that happening on their side. But even if leakage exists on either side, it is far worse on their side, because more and more people come into these local communities, making those economic issues far worse. Especially important in all points is going to make any argument about developing world economies that are worse for the opinion that they're likely to be talking about. On our side, however, destinations in particular don't get overwhelmed. There's less inflation pressure on the poor and the middle class comparatively. One, locals are always going to outnumber tourists but they need to be able to live in cities that can have economic economy to help the broader economy grow. Two, on our side, states can invest into more long-term, durable economic opportunities because when tourism decreases, it's likely other industries can grow because there's more utility that's provided. Even if gentrification occurs on our side, it is still likely to be better because that gentrification is going to happen organically and not to be needed to have a lot of tourists. So you don't have MLCs pushing for rapid development and things like high-rise buildings. It's going to happen head-to-head to global. On their side eventually, the appeal of the novelties is going to be let off. The country is going to be let off. No other means is sublimating that value. Tourists are going to move on and the trade is going to be over, like we've seen in the Spanish islands. So that means then that you don't have the capacity for the country to build again. The impact of this argument is twofold. Firstly, we see this home existence in wealthy countries, and I think now regulation is an especially important empowerment for developing nations that are looking to become tourist hotspots. Cape Town, a city in South Africa, has the most ABM visa in the world because of pro-business government who want MNCs to buy up and construct new tourist accommodations, leading to a vast disfaces. Tourists just don't care because they don't have an attachment to their country, And even when they are aware of this, they prioritize their own comforts over the comforts of others. But second, there is a real human host to all of the things we are talking about. It is the mother who was laid off from her resort because that resort isn't making money. It is the young couple that cannot afford to start a family and build a home because homes are too expensive because of gentrification. That is the type of world that exists on the other side. Second argument then around culture, before I give this short. For nations like seashells, they have to do tours because no alternate economy has worked. What alternate economies would they comparatively shift to in your world? We gave you two structural reasons as to why these economies are likely to diversify and they're likely to have under industries grow. You need to actually engage with those. Argument number three. We improve cultural participation and social communication, and you like it and let industries grow, you need to actually engage with those. Arguing with the government will be important. We improve cultural participation and social communication, especially in the developing world, because there's an increasing demand for tourism there. It's taking the characteristics of the exploitative nature as opposed to being appreciative of that culture. There's a disrespect for culturally and spiritually significant areas. So for example in Peru, they had to limit the tourist numbers that existed in order to better ensure that those harms don't exist too much. In Greece, they had to literally arrest individuals because they were defacing things like the Coliseum and historically significant architecture. These are not isolated instances, but they're structurally true because tourists just don't have the same appreciation and they just don't have the same attachment. They're individuals who want to look cool and get an Instagram post of them. Currently, all across Europe, major tourist clubs are seeing an increased protest from individuals because individuals don't like these things. Spanish individuals are spitting in tourist drinks and telling them to leave their country. This is because institutions are set up to cater for tourist individuals, not necessarily the locals of their country. So complaints about drunk, water-drunk, or loud tourists just don't matter to the institutions. We solve these issues because comparatively, on our side, we have smaller numbers of tourists, that means then it's easier to regulate those individuals as opposed to in your side. This argument is especially important because if we better maintain the culture of the nation, it's likely individuals who do actually care about those things are going to visit that country. So we maintain tourism over a longer period of time. If they're going to argue about tourism in one of the five years, then our case is simply prior to theirs. What proposition? Because we make tourism work for locals again. Not international payment, not international businesses, not amenities, but for people who live to deal with high prices in large areas and their homes and homes."

Spreading tourist traffic. Promoting business during off-peak seasons can help distribute the influx of tourists more evenly, reducing the strain on popular destinations. 2. Improving infrastructure and facilities.

                "text": "first argument on the economic development. And note that this argumentation will directly clash with their argument. The thesis of this argument is that tourism boosts the economy and creates jobs. There are two layers to this argument. Firstly, how does tourism stimulate the economy? There are four notes on how much money tourists spend which proves the stimulation that tourists bring. One, tourists uniquely want to spend money. This is because tourists inherently have a strong inclination to spend money during their travels, times of excitement and relaxation where they are prepared to indulge in various activities and experiences. 2. Tourists often come from countries with stronger currencies, meaning that their money has a greater purchasing power in destinations with weaker currencies. This difference enables them to afford more luxuries and experiences than they could at home, which leads to increased spending during their travels. 3. Travelling itself is inherently expensive. When tourists visit another country, their expenditures extend far beyond just airfare and accommodation and extend to public transportation, dining, souvenirs, entertainment and various services such as guided tours or taxis. Each of these expenditures contributes a substantial influx of money into the local economy. 4. And lastly, it creates spending on unique services. For instance, locals have homes and sublets so they don't use hotels as much. Locals cook home food so they don't regularly go to restaurants. Locals barely use taxis as they have cars and public transport. Locals don't consume souvenirs. Therefore, the implication is that the types of spending that tourists do is extremely unique and valuable. Before we move on to the second layer, I'll take a quick one. Speaker, you literally just said that individuals can use public transport, and then you say that they can use cars. Which one is it? Because they're both contradictory. We don't think it's contradictory, and it's very unclear what the implication of that, even if there is a contradiction."

                "text": "Second layer of this argument, how the proposition's comparative harms the economy. There are six main impacts. One, job loss. Intuitively speaking, this economic failure will lead to massive job loss for people in the service sector and tourism sectors, unlike they claim. These are jobs that are very accessible to low skilled workers. These are workers with very few transferable skills, no education, and no experience, which means it's incredibly hard to find a new industry to house all of these unemployed workers. Furthermore, when an entire city is suddenly unemployed, it also means more crime happens. It means there are no longer support networks for the unemployed. Job loss is a massive impact here. Two, Promotion of service work. The types of jobs created by the tourism industry are often more favorable compared to alternatives in many developing countries, while manufacturing jobs, which many developing countries rely on, oftentimes involve roles are far less physically taxing. These service sector jobs are much more desirable because these positions offer a better work environment and greater job satisfaction. Three, Loss in government resources. The immediate effect is a substantial loss in tax revenue, which typically comes from both tourism-related jobs and the expenditures of tourists themselves. Governments also oftentimes have to take a lot of debt to cover welfare expenses for the unemployed and incur additional debt to sustain social services and economic stability. For many nations, tourism constitutes a considerable segment of their economy, thus replacing this lost economic activity as a task that leads to prolonged periods of financial instability and economic decline. But fourthly, there will be less foreign direct investment, or FDI, meaning less corporations come in. Firstly, the immediate short-term losses from a curtailed tourism sector make it less profitable and riskier for investors to allocate capital to the affected country due to the anticipated return on investment diminishing as the tourism industry revenue stream dries up. Secondly, the signaling effect of such a drastic policy shift creates broader concerns about the country's investment climate. By effectively declaring war on its largest industry after years and years of promotion and support, the government signals unpredictability and potential hostility towards other sectors. This erodes investor confidence as we fear that similar abrupt and detrimental policy changes might impact their ventures in other industries, ultimately leading to a reduction in FDI. Fifth, losing foreign currency. Tourists bring in foreign currency that supports the local economy and exchange rate. Therefore, without this, the country faces a deficit, weakening its currency. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive, causing inflation and reducing purchasing power. This can lead to a cycle of declining investor confidence and further economic problems, causing this vicious cycle. Sixth, and finally, this also leads to bankruptcy. Tourism businesses often invest heavily in real estate, infrastructure, and services, expecting steady revenue. Therefore, when tourism stops, they can go bankrupt, leading to job losses and long-term debt struggles. These bankruptcies affect banks, causing significant losses and tighter credit, which slows economic growth. Therefore, the implication of all of these six mechanisms is simple. This economy is massively impoverished when tourism is significantly limited. Significant restriction on tourism is significant restriction on the economy. For all these reasons, I'm very proud to oppose."

                "text": "Firstly then on the policy and the ability to limit tourists on their side. We give you three responses to their analysis. The first thing is that all regions of the city have the biggest tourist destinations. What you're doing is competing for centrality. That's nightlife, that's access to amenities, that's the things that individuals and tourists are directly in opposition for because they want to experience those amenities and the centrality of the city, which means there's a direct competition that they can't engage with on their side. But secondly, note the inherent difficulty on policing large crowds and the disincentive there is to do so, because tourists are going to like your area less when they feel like it's a police state, when they feel like they're being actively cracked down on, which means unless you have small crowds that you can regulate using smaller security services, you aren't able to regulate the larger crowds on their side because it detracts from that ambience. But lastly, on the behaviour of individuals. We note firstly that tourism creates an environment where people feel like social norms are suspended. We're in a place to have fun, we're going to do that at all costs. But secondly, on the capacity to spend, they talked about currency disparities. That's directly worsen on their side because people are able to absorb larger fines and are psychologically inclined to do so because they come in with the intention of spending money. That then frames a direct incentive to pivot away from over-tourism that exists under status quo, but also shows you why our mechanism is uniquely beneficial"

Here we just think they don't engage with what exists under status quo, where tourism creates a direct incentive to lock yourself into particular markets. And here is where we talk about the fact that tourism is effectively seen by governments as a free source of money. It's like something that's based on the natural features and requires minimal investment when it comes to the development of regions. Note then that policies that rely on developing areas within your nations are disbeneficial to states in two regards. Firstly, they require more active investment because of that development, but secondly, there's a sacrifice that needs to be done. So if you have to run, for instance, protectionist measures to protect a nascent industry, that's something that's going to cost you trade deals, that's something that requires political inertia in order to happen. That then creates an incentive or a structure where states are able to lean on tourism over more because it doesn't require political sacrifices in order to get off the ground."

So Thailand is notorious for sex tourism, that's something that Western people go to to experience, and it's something that the government won't regulate because of that economic benefit. But note then, they also didn't engage with the litany of harms that we brought to when it came to disparities in purchasing power. And they agreed to these harms. They told you tourists come into spend. And what that means is the generalized increase in standard of living and property taxes for the demand of short-term tourist accommodation, all of these things then are impacted on their side. How do we weigh out then? We weigh out because they create a diffuse harm and we create a concentrated benefit. A diffuse harm with a concentrated benefit. So they're able to benefit the few people that are employed in these areas, in these cities, while generalising and decreasing the standard of living.

On one side, you have developed economies, which creates an increase in the standard, in the cost of living within these nations, and pushes people to the outskirts of countries, of cities, like LA. That's something that's directly disbeneficial, and's something that can be fixed easily because we have the GDP reserve to just not rely on tourism. In developing nations you create the direct incentive to lean on tourism as a mechanism and you allow for regulation not to take place. Those are two different harms that you create and you need to engage with them respectively. On the idea then that you create harms to the environment. The framing here is that we have an increase in environmental tourism under status quo. These are regions that carry appeal because of their aesthetics. These are regions that are also uniquely fragile because ecosystems are dependent on balance. Note how this is harmed in three ways on their side. The first way is the increase demand for accommodation and luxury. This means the construction of tourist regions. What that means is tourism expands in popularity and companies work on increasingly more extravagant and resource-intensive projects in an attempt to corner the markets. This looks like the Guaypoh Islands in Dubai that required a massive amount of sand to be pulled in order to build them and destroy reef infrastructure in the process. That means that those ecosystems are irreparably damaged and can't be maintained. But secondly, note that tourist presence creates pollution and environmental harm. That's firstly in terms of resource use. So there's massive resource-intensive hotels that are going to divert resources away from locals. Dubai literally couldn't fight its wildfires because it didn't have the water that water was being diverted to the hotels in the region. But secondly, on waste products. Note that tourism are uniquely dependent on single-use plastics because they want to vent in the region for a long time. You're eating out more, you're going to create more waste products in that regard. Based on all of that then, they fail to benefit the individuals who live within particular nations and we get that benefit, never been prior to a proposed."

                "text": "I want to firstly deal with their economy. They give you three main mechanisms in their first argument, I'm going to deal with each one. But before dealing with each one, I think it's imperative to note that they don't prove through a comparative in this debate. They have two burdens to fulfill in the comparative that go unfulfilled at this point in this debate. Firstly, they still have to prove to you that alternatives to some extent do exist. That the asserting POI response that, oh, alternatives probably do exist, cannot prove to you that that is true. In the Maldives, the reason why the nation is relying upon tourism is because no other industry adequately can replace the economic impact that that has. In Seychelles, the reason why the economy is 40% dependent on tourism is because nothing can replace that GDP impact. Therefore, they still have to prove to you alternatives do exist. But secondly, they then have to prove to you that these alternatives are in any way better because their homes are not in any way unique to tourism. Look at, for example, their claim about diversification or higher cost of living. That claim is basically going to be symmetric in every other alternative you can bring. Let's say you shift to manufacturing. Let's say you have car companies come in and build infrastructure in your country and hire people in your country. These car companies are going to bring in hundreds of foreign workers with them who are similarly going to push the economy into overdrive and are similarly going to increase the cost of living. The problem is not unique to tourism. But I also want to look at each of the mechanizations. The first mechanization is on cost of living. I have two levels of response against this at the top. One, that we frame from our second piece on frame that is unengaged by their speaker to say that, well, oftentimes the tourist areas are very far apart, or at the very least in different areas from where the locals live. And governments do have incentive to structure economies, to structure societies this way, which is why in Amsterdam there's a tourist district and then there's a locality district where the cost of living is a lot lower. But secondly, I don't believe that the cost of living going up is just unique to the cost of living going up. But rather, things like eats, things like salaries and infrastructure go up with it, which means we can match the pace of inflation with the salaries. But finally, I want to weigh our argumentation on things like vulnerable jobs and the general economy as a whole above this cost of living claim in four crucial ways. Number one, that having a job and being employed is the prerequisite for you even caring about cost of living. If you have no income, the damage of cost of living is highest for you. Secondly, that high cost of living has some amount of solvency. You are helpless in getting an income out of strats as an unemployed individual, but there are many ways to do things like cut expenses or just move to another area. Thirdly, high cost of living largely only applies to more rich individuals. The price increases in this debate impacts luxury goods and not everyday goods. It's restaurants, not grocery stores, that are impacted. It's hotels in the city structure, not rent in the outskirts. It's the cost of living that disproportionately only impacts tourists or those who are rich. The unemployment disproportionately impacts the poor. That is the impact we all care about. But fourthly, that the state has some amount of more moral obligation to these individuals than they do to them. Because the state is actively at fault for the reliance of these workers that they have on the tourist industry. Not only did they allow for it, but they did not create good alternatives, and for years actively encouraged tourism and tourist jobs. And now they're stabbing them in the back."

The second response I want to make is that the seasonal analogy claim is highly uncomparative because at worst we have a season of prosperity and a season of stagnation and therefore they have constant stagnation. Their third claim is that these massive gains leak out through multinational corporations. We've provided to you various mechanizations from our argument. We have six of them, none of which are heavily reliant upon MNCs being willing to trickle down the economy. For example, our second mechanism, our second impact was on the shift to service industries. This means that even if these corporations suck up all of the money, the fact that the economy shifts in that direction in and of itself is a benefit and in that way trickle-down still does happen. Let's talk about our argumentation. Our argumentation gave you six reasons, six impacts why this economic benefit to tourism brings is uniquely and massively important. The proposition fails to heavily engage to any of these mechanizations. I think that this alone is debatable, but especially on vulnerable jobs. I think that one does this debate. Let's talk about culture then. The claim of culture is basically tourist disrespect culture. I have two layers of engagement to this. Number one, that cultural importance for locals or indigenous people can still be protected in our world. We can literally do things like subsidize these areas. For example, the U.S. natural reserves do give communal ownership to indigenous peoples to allow them access to that. But secondly, that touristy cultural sites and important cultural sites are oftentimes massively different. For example, in India, people are obsessed with beautiful mosques, but the actual mosques that are regularly visited are ones that are further away, far less used, and far less touristy. The second level of response is to say, well, all of this due and disrespect for cultural sites can heavily be mitigated by forms of regulation. This is not just policing coming in. This is also, for example, people who are visiting the site alongside you, telling you you should actually take off your shoes when you walk into a Japanese temple. Now, proposition gives you various reasons why this is probably true. They say things like competition or how you cannot police this or individual behavior. There's two levels of engagement here. Firstly, on the level of incentive, I think states have massive incentive to do this. Yeah, sure, being seen as a police state is probably not that much of a good thing, but being seen as a dysfunctional state is far worse of a harm. Also, you have some amount of incentive to cater to your voters who hold you accountable, which means you do have to care about your citizen population. The second level of response, on the level of capacity, it's actually fairly easy to regulate this. Just find people more, or just get more people, just get more police, or in the case of slum tourism, just ban things like gambling. I don't think it's that hard, I think we've proven capacity."

                "text": "I want to run an extending argument in my last minute then, on liberalization. There are three reasons why liberalization happens when tourism is massive. Number one, a large influx of tourists puts a big and immediate pressure to relax urgent policies that are oppressive and conservative. Because when governments continue to get massive revenue from the tourist industry, they have to maintain this positive image and avoid international backlash. Look at Qatar. Secondly, active tourism necessitates easing of restrictive laws and implementation of consistent policies as authorities face challenges in selectively enforcing regulations on tourists. Initially, authorities may try to say, well, tourists, you don't have to follow these laws, but at some point, the influx of tourists is going to be too much, governments will have to make liberal black-ed policies. Thirdly, on normalization, when tourists openly engage in behaviors that are restricted or stigmatized, such as same-sex relationships or liberal dress codes, it gradually normalizes these behaviors, and all of this leads to softened local prejudices and inclusive policies. This looks like, for example, Saudi Arabia's introduction of tourist visas being accompanied by social reforms like women being allowed to travel without male gardens. This looks like Bangkok, which is a renowned destination for LGBTQ tourists, where it could have never have evolved in this way if it weren't for tourism. This is important not only because it benefits the larger society in forms of freedoms but also for the most vulnerable minorities, LGBTQ individuals, women who suffer in conservative societies. Liberalization is massively important for the tourists, for the economy, for the vulnerable"

                "text": "Firstly, on the context between developing nations versus developed nations. Let's assume that this case takes place in the world of the opposition, where we specifically look at developing nations. Why exactly do we think that this is bad? We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the opposition, where we specifically look at development in Singapore. Why exactly do we think that this is bad? We think that the increased dependence on tourism harms them in terms of the shocks that they are likely going to be facing on their side. Two reasons why that's the case. The first is because the majority of the benefit that they get on their side is likely going to be seasonal. That is to say that you only get a minimal income in the season in which tourism is most likely going to be affected. In the cases in which they want to derive the off-season benefit. We don't think that the majority of people visit the majority of these countries in off-seasons, mainly because of the fact that the conditions that allow them to go there aren't necessarily there. So they cannot enjoy natural beauty because of extreme weather. They cannot enjoy the things that they currently claim are going to be true in that regard. But second, in the case of natural disasters, things like COVID and all of those things, they have to accept the fact that the majority of the economy under their world is likely going to be stopping. This means that a majority of the income that you will be having in that regard is going to be taken away. But furthermore, that means more economic adversity for these countries. You say shells and the mountains suffered during COVID, mainly because the fact that their main source of income wasn't protected. That means on their side, they're most likely going to have far worse incentives and far worse impacts for these countries in the first place. On the comparative, why exactly are we there? On our side, we can have multiple avenues of growth that we can utilize for economic stability, things like retail stores and things like having to train individuals in order to ensure economic growth."

But here's the thing, they need to prove a whole lot more in order to ensure that this is going to be true. Because let's just dissect the logic. If they say that tourists have so much money that they're willing to be spending on these very same countries, they're most likely going to be spending it on that regulation, and they're still going to be getting away with the majority of the problems that exist within those countries. So if it is that they're littering, they're going to be paying those fines what they're. They don't actually provide a mechanism towards which they can actually regulate the majority of these problems that exist within their world in the first place."

                "text": "First class then, on the economy. Here, I want to deal with the three key points that they give us. They firstly tell us that tourists spend a lot of money and that benefits the majority of these countries. Secondly, they tell us on their side that on our side we're going to have a lot of like job losses. But lastly, they tell us that you can have like government resources and like diminishing inishing on our core. First point, on the idea that tourists spend much more money on theirs. Two reasons why this is bad. First, because foreign currency tends to harm the locals and their ability to actually participate in the economy. That is to say that the nature of foreign currency is often inflammatory in nature. That is to say that they inflate prices and like increase and decrease competition. That's to say there's a higher bonding power that is given specifically to tourists that is taken away from locals. So that's to say that an Airbnb for a tourist might have been a home for a local and that means that they don't actually get that benefit under their will. But certainly a majority of tourists don't invest specifically into public transport and public services as they claim. This is because of the fact that in tourism, you've had multiple alternatives that have been given in order to ensure profit. That's why Airbnbs have been available as opposed to hotels specifically. This means that on their side, they don't actually get that benefit going specifically to the government, but rather to companies that exist in order to exacerbate tourism under their vault. That kind of incentive quite literally takes away the economic benefit they might have been getting in the first place. The second thing that they tell us is that we're most likely going to have a lot of job loss on our own. Why exactly do we still have the capacity to have jobs on our own? There are two distinct reasons, and this also deals with the capacity to have alternative avenues of income. Why? Because there is a large scale of natural resources that can exist and can be utilized for specific benefits. So for example, the Seychelles invested in fisheries when they realized that tourism wasn't working out for them. That meant that you can unlock a labor capacity that doesn't actually provide or doesn't actually depend on tourism in the first place. Second, on Earth, you have a massive labour pool that can be unlocked through vocational training. This is important because almost every developing nation has prioritised this because of the fact that they realise that this massive labour pool is something that is likely going to be much more effective under our law. No, thank you. Second, I'm going to ask you a question on why exactly they themselves don't have jobs. One, because of the fact that diminishing returns decrease the capacity for you to have a job in the first place. That is to say that companies, specifically tourist agencies, tend to outsource jobs to alternative needs and to alternative individuals apart from locals. This is because of the fact that they have the opportunity to cut costs, but furthermore, they have the opportunity to exploit individuals under their own. But secondly, there's a whole lot more competition under their own. That is to say that the tourism sector, if it is that they claim, is such low skill, that means that you're most probably going to have a lot of individuals competing for those very same industries. 60 million people live in South Africa, yet only 5,000 of them are employed by Airbnb. That very same gap leads to more people being unemployed under their world. They have to deal with this problem specifically."

The majority of the benefits from tourism go specifically to major MNCs. That is to say that you have over-cent centralization of these industries, specifically in capital cities. So cities like Hanoi, quite literally had about 50 McDonald's and 50 Starbucks in every single corner that you turn. So majority of the benefits don't go to local industries, but rather go to huge MNCs that exist like they want. But second, FDI comes specifically through things like trade of resources. You get that when you look at various other industries, as opposed to tourism, who already gave you the fact that you have a large number of resources that exist under our wall that can be unlocked. So that very same benefit isn't exclusive to their wall. Before I move into the second class then, sure, I'll take it."

What? The majority of these countries literally used tourism as a front for their own abuses. Qatar literally used slavery as a means to hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022. They cannot claim that this is a benefit that is normal, mainly because of the fact that this is something that allows for these governments to continue exploiting individuals. Post the FIFA World Cup, Qatar remained the same, similar with Russia in 2018. But second, if these governments are so oppressive, they can survive without those tourists in the first place. They don't provide a unique mechanism as to why exactly tourism means that these countries automatically change the majority of the incentives. If they're oppressive, they don't care about alternative actors. That's why sanctions in majority cases didn't work in those countries. By the end of this debate, two things are true. The first is that over-tourism and the benefits of over-tourism are things that they haven't proven and that they won't specifically.

We tell you that the LGBTQ couples being able to get accepted in the public, or the increase in solo female travelers prompted in India as a result of this kind of like tourism and over tourism and the pressure towards the government uniquely exists in all sides of the house because liberalization is only going to happen when the government is pressured by the international like people that have liberal values. Why is this likely to be a hidden point? Obviously this is because they do need to bite the bullet on their side of the house and say that the defense and significant limitation and see that the substantial decrease in the number of visitors will exist. Which means that this substantial number of people pressuring the government to act is incredibly important because there is also a higher countervailing incentive to want to keep these traditional ideas. Older generations would always want to justify that homosexuality. It's the same. People would always want to say that marriage should only be decided by men. This is why when 40 million people actually swerve into the government only when the government is dependent on the tourism industry, only when the government needs those tourists and industry to actually gain those kind of things to begin with, that is at the point in which liberalization will actually want to happen which is why at this point in time they're losing already. The weighing of this argument is really simple because the severity of the harm of this argument is extreme. Because note, things like environmental degradation and things like, let's say, like, I don't know, economy, I think, for example, environment presumably exists to an extent on either side of the house when we talk about degradation. But when it comes to things like LGBTQ individuals not being able to accept it in public, that is something that actually comes at a cost of their existence.

Firstly, I want to look at the strategy of the proposition team in this debate, because what they're saying is that tourism sucks in the abstract, but for the most tourism-reliant countries, like say, Shell or Maldives, Maldives for example, I think this industry did play an important role to begin with, and I think their side of the house saying how these amenities are exploitative to begin with does not distract from the fact that Maldives, like 80% of the countries, are in fact dependent on the economy of the tourism industry and that they need those industries for them to operate to begin with. Secondly, let's talk about the context of this debate. They think that the tourism in this debate most likely takes place in developed countries. They give you three structural reasons for this. Firstly, this is not true, especially in Turkey, Ireland and Seychelles, Macau, Jamaica, all intuitively does have a tourism industry. Second of all, the structural reason why our claim is more true is that those kind of tourism industry oftentimes don't require industrialization to begin with. Those things like historical monuments, or things like the nature that you have that actually appeal against tourism, like tourists to begin with, those things are things that are uniquely have without the industrialization to begin with, which is why I think developing countries are going to be the context of this debate as well. Their attempt to out-frame their developing country and say that developed countries is the context of this debate is also terribly unstrategic for them insofar as diversification and things like that already exist in the United States of America. But even if the context of developed countries is more likely, our claim stands true and we are willing to weigh this argument over theirs insofar as this is the most likely delta in the debate insofar as Maldives and those countries are inherently reliant on those tourism industries. Therefore, the biggest burden that they needed to prove in this debate is why these vulnerable nations have the capacity to transition into a diversified economy. But here's when it gets very damaging for them because they prove in the absence of the tourism industry that other industries will arise, but they do not prove why the diversification is likely to happen. This is important, because a lot of the developing countries have other industries, but those industries are one of cultural economy."

The point is, in the comparative, in the absence of tourism, countries like Maldives, countries like South Shelf are going to suffer the most. First class on job losses. This stands both in the context of developing countries and developed countries. The first thing they see is that we need to actually do things like vocational training. Obviously, yes, but this can only be done on our side of the house, when we can actually have a substantial income and actually have a substantial influx of money. When we can tell you three mechanisms as to why those countries and those tourists are likely to spend money when foreign currencies are actually to come. That is at the point in which we can actually do vocational training more on our side of the house. The government has an incentive to do this because they want voters and they want appealed voters to begin with. The second thing they see is that it doesn't trickle down to the bottom of the people and the local individuals to respond to fear. Firstly, no, it does trickle down. It happens. I think our first argument already proves this. But secondly, I think this is uncomparative to begin with because all of the foreign direct investment problems that they have identified symmetrically exist in either side of the house. It's unclear to me whether they were listening to Seiji's speech. And I think Seiji gives you four main mechanisms as to why this job loss is the most important argument in the debate, especially when compared to their argument on the Boston thing like cost of living, which is why I think this still is our path to victory. Finally, let's talk about the economic development. Our claim in this debate was really simple, that this economic failure will lead to massive job loss for people in the service sector and tourism sector. Numerically, the number of people decreasing from 40 million to 10 million, this means that given that the number of customers drastically falls, big companies have to lower the salaries of their workers and they have to lay off individuals who are working at the bottom of their corporate ladder. That is the people that they need to defend and anticipate. The first thing they see is that other countries will develop and other industries will develop and diversify. Firstly, let's say again, USAID is out of the debate, but secondly, they don't have methods to compete with other developed countries for things like industrialization hasn't still happened, but secondly, I think tourism is much more unique because I think historical monuments and things like that does not require you to have machines. The second thing they say is that, oh, this is short-term and it's really uncreditable to begin with. I have like two responses to begin with. Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons, for example, for two reasons. I have two responses to begin with. Firstly, I want to point out that it is mostly true that people go in different seasons for two reasons. One, because I think there are different allures and attractions in different seasons to begin with. But secondly, when it's like let's say Hawaii for example, I think people would want to go to let's say winter because if relatively less people go to winter, you can actually go to different places at the same time, which is why I think their claim is not standing. But even if it is short-term, it is unpredictable. I think one thing that they have yet to prove in this debate is the comparative, because yes, it might be unpredictable, but they never proved why their comparative industry is better, which is why I think just because saying that these individuals were harmed in the COVID-19 crisis is not going to be enough for them. The way in here is simple. The reason why I think this beach out their claim against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is not going to be enough for them. The reign here is simple. The reason why I think this beat out there clean up against cost of living is because I think cost of living in and of itself is not a harm, right? If we say that things like salaries are going to rise as a result of it, I think they are able to actually cope against the cost of living, which is why I think the most vulnerable context of this debate, countries like Moldova, countries like Seychelles are going to win us the debate. For all those reasons, teams of countries exist to debate."

The two claims I want to note is firstly, that the money leaks out through MNCs. To some extent, this is true. We have to accept that. The problem with this is twofold. One, that we've given you mechanization to prove to you that trickle-down in some way does exist. And secondly, that this is an uncomparative claim, that any other MNC that comes into the country in their world, in any other industry, is still going to lead to the leaking out of the economy. Let's also talk about their claim on the over-reliance. Yes, we are to some extent over-reliant, but this is again an intensely uncomparative claim when their comparative is to shift the economy into another industry and to just be as over-reliant on that. And yes, tourism industry was massively harmed by COVID, but so was every other industry."

From our first speaker, we flip all of this. We tell you that things like service industries, training, vocational training, state support can only exist in our world where the tourist industry is in some way successful. Therefore, there are jobs in our world. On the comparative then, are jobs going to exist in proposition? We say no, and the response to just do vocational training isn't a valid alternative when the poorest individuals who are only employed in our world are absolutely messed up because they can't access vocational training in their world. And secondly, it's unclear what money they're doing this vocational training with when Seychelles is incredibly poor. This means that this argumentation, which I weighed for four mechanisms from my speech alone, can run as this debate. This is more important than any other claim. Let's also talk about this claim on displacement. We outframed and outweighed this argumentation for a second. I don't think it stands and the web didn't bother extending. Finally, and thirdly, on seasonality, we proved to you that this is not only untrue but also comparatively better in our world, but it's also wrong here why this is so especially bad. Like ski resorts earn all of their money in the winter and have enough money there to carry them through the next year. This means that seasonality is not an inherent harm, they have to prove to you it's harmful."

Because we told you why liberalisation is something that isn't going to function. We told you why countries use tourism as a front to pretend as if they're liberalising and then do things like use slavery, the Kafkala system, to build up the systems that enabled that tourism in the first place. And we also told you why these countries are uniquely not dependent or leaning on the public perceptions of individuals in the West to survive. So if Saudi Arabia is perceived to be a police state, generally we don't think the opinions of Western tourists are things that largely shifted in that regard, but we think secondly that those opinions were easily manipulated. That's engagement we gave you, that's engagement that's unresponded to. And so their alternate path to victory is out of this debate"

                "text": "quickly off the top of the speech. Three things then. Firstly, on context. Secondly, on the economy. And lastly, on the preservation of culture. Contextually speaking, we already told you why developed nations are important in this debate. They aren't dependent on tourism, and so the limitation when it comes to the populace generally is something that is marginal. And note then that the focus of people in the nation is something that is uniquely overshadowed by headline economic figures in the state. So the mayor of Paris, for instance, accepts broadly that things at the Olympics are going to happen, while not listening to the outcries of the populations that have to deal with those Western tourists on a day-to-day basis. But also, their point on this being empirically untrue just disregards the way the world functions. We told you why the tourists who have the money are more likely to flood into countries they're more capable or comfortable in, but we also told you why this is something that's uniquely impacted within these states. And so all of our analysis on the majority context in this round is something that still stands. But secondly, don't their assumption that tourism just ceases to exist, demand still exists, that the demand side is still pretty high on our side and we're just regulating the influx of tourists within a nation, we have yet to prove why this is so disastrous when it comes to the individuals themselves. So at this point then, understand that the majority context is one on our side and the individual clashes will take out the externalities. On the first conversation, on the economy and the harming of people in those nations, we told you two things. The first thing is that you compete with tourists for resources. And note that this is something that's supported by every bit of analysis they give you on tourist spending power. These people are inherently short-termists, they're able to spend your monthly wage in a week and that's what they come there to do. What is their response? The extent of their response is just tourists have different places that they're competing with individuals with. So it's not a direct competition, but largely the harms occur in different places. We gave you two responses. Firstly, on centrality, that is, you as a tourist want to be in the centre of a city where the economic activity is, where it's bustling, where the nightlife is accessible. The same center that individuals who have jobs want to be accessing as well. That creates direct competition that can't be regulated out. But secondly, note the impact of the increasing cost of land on our side. Because that doesn't just isolate one area, it isolates the majority of instances where that land is going to increase in cost. When Airbnb buys out a massive amount of properties, there's less properties for you to have your supermarket on, increasing your cost and ability to provide for locals. But secondly, they told you the creation of jobs is something that occurs. But we told you that you uniquely lock out alternative economies from developing. You lack development of other economies because of the lack of incentives they have. They don't have the necessity to generate alternative economies and they're going to ignore those economies as a result. Thailand ignores its manufacturing, nascent manufacturing center because of the tourist income it generates. And as a result then, we also told you that tourism is uniquely unstable because it's the first thing to go when a shock like COVID-19 happens. So sure, things are able to decrease when it comes to bad economic circumstances, but tourism is uniquely unstable in that regard. Two deadlock breakers. One, interest develops or decreases in the long term. So like Spanish islands, for instance, had less attention on them, and that's something that means the money is less long-term. But secondly, the investment in rebuilding the farms you create, like rebuilding shores from those like construction, is something that's bad. So that money doesn't even get funneled down. Secondly, on cultural preservation, we told you there are regulations that are panacea, and you can't regulate tourist behaviour as effectively. Note then that we win on this debate for the people who live in these countries that we've been proud to propose."

The first note is that we would wean countries off tourism. This would not happen immediately. This would be a gradual process. If someone wants to go to a major tourist destination, they apply for a permit a year in advance. These permits are limited in number. 50% of them are done based on a random lottery system. The other 50% are done based on auctions with the money going straight to the government to spend on things like conservation and job transitions. People are obviously willing to pay a lot of money because destinations are very much in demand. These are enforced by accommodation checking your destination permit, like how they ask for passport to check in. There will be heavy fines, revocation of licence and so on. This will be well enforced. People who miss out on this permit, no thank you, at peak times can apply for permits in non-peak times, spreading out tourism over the year. Every government already identifies who tourists are when they are allocating visas. For the sake of the debate, this is not people who are conducting businesses, visiting family or studying in a country that has different visa classes."

They might be on a stag trip with the lads. They might be taking the experience for granted. This is like littering. This is like graffiti that looks like ignoring local laws and regulations. This is much less likely on our side because they're either very lucky or have spent a lot of money. No, thank you. They're more interested in their destination and therefore they are more likely to respect their destination. Even on their side when tourists are well-intentioned, they still cause harms because of their presence. There's things like environmental degradation from walking over a path too often, poor sanitation, pollution from flights and cruises. This simply happens because a large number of people are in a place that is not designed for them. Some of the world's best surfing beaches have been made unsurfable because of the construction of ocean-side property that impact wave breaks. Now, also, tourists must live somewhere, eat somewhere, do something with their days. This means we have to build airports, hotels and so on. These are built on forested land or local communities, not on empty land. This impacts the environment and locals. Now, onto how tourism"

So culture is exploited as well as the environment because tourists fill places like churches, which means that locals who actually want to worship there cannot fit in. You know, they have to get tickets and so on. Even if they can access it, they have a private ability to enjoy them spiritually because they're covered in graffiti, they're full of people, as I told you. Even if they can access it, there is pressure to bastardise local culture, turning it into a commercial, unsellable product for tourists. For example, in Hawaii, luau celebrations have traditionally been reserved for very important occasions, like the birth of a child, like victory in a war. But now, multiple are thrown per night as an exotically branded party, aimed at tourists with sexualised waitresses. This is extremely degrading for a local whose culture is being turned into a product. This happens everywhere. Japanese kimonos being turned into a vessel to get extra tips. Traditional healing practices like massage being fetishised and serving as an entrance into sex tourism. This is incredibly harmful. Why should you weigh this? Firstly, on the environment and built culture, you must remember that people go to incredibly beautiful places, places that are incredibly important to humanity, the Great Barrier Reef, the Vatican, and so on. We have an obligation to future generations to protect these incredibly important places by not completely degrading them. Opposition harms them significantly. No, thank you. On culture, these are places with historic and important and ongoing culture, particularly to Indigenous people. Opposition is essentially resurrecting colonialisation as they allow large numbers of foreigners to come in and exploit culture and land for a fun summer abroad. I'll take a point for a move on my next substantive. If you are promising to take vandalism and graffiti, you might have to place regulations that could be used at some point. Firstly, there are far too many tourists to place regulation. We see in the status quo that vandalism already happens because there are simply too many tourists to effectively replace. Since we have less tourists, the police resources are stretched less thin. We get better management of graffiti. And secondly, even if you known by that, there is still harm by tourists physically being there, even if they're well-intentioned, as I told you, you still get those harms."

I'm going to explain why that's not the case, why it's actually harmful. So, firstly, on the actual scale of benefits that tourism brings to a local country. Many foreign tourists prefer to stay at Western-style hotels, you know, go to Western-style resorts and theme parks, no thank you, because they feel safe there, because they feel accommodated there, you know, they trust the food and so on. These institutions are run by large multinational companies like the Crown Prize of West Anglia, which is run by IHG, an international company, and these companies are based offshore offshore they're headquartered offshore they uh you know know how to exploit tax loopholes therefore in general the largest amount of money does not go to the local country no thank you the comparative is our auction system where the money goes straight to the local government there's likely to be a very large benefit so we get a good amount of money on our side secondly on housing crisis so as more workers are required to fill jobs in tourist areas they move into these big cities and they push locals out. Also, as tourists with more money are able to move into these areas, they pay more for things like Airbnbs, which pushes locals out. It becomes virtually impossible to find a place to live as an ordinary person living in these cities. They're forced out of the city, they're forced into homelessness in places like Barcelona, Byron Bay and Brighton. Next, inflation. Wealthy tourists with lots of money to spend and desire to spend it are willing to pay far more than locals for basic things like medicine, food and groceries and so on. This causes local businesses to push up the prices to match which makes it much harder to live and it outstrips the growth in wages caused by increased"

They're only there for a week, they've never been to the place, and they're likely never going to go back to, for instance, a restaurant. So the incentive is for this restaurant to advertise really well and not spend so much money on services and the actual quality of food, since tourists have already been there. This means locals get worse services overall, since they're not designed for repeat customers, they're designed for one-off customers. Now, on to the biggest economic harm, which is economic dependency. I'll take the point first, though. If you're honest that locals are worse off because of inflation, this is not true, because local services are given separately, and tourists are given separate packages that they need to purchase, vice is how you're sensitive about that. Again, broadly, this isn't true. Tourists obviously have to share things like the metro system to get around. When we were in Paris, we used the local metro system. There simply aren't alternatives to tourists. But also to the extent that the government is likely to spend more money on these services at the cost of things designed for locals, since tourists, as I told you, can pay more. So the government's incentive is to cater for them, not for locals. Now, onto the key economic impact, which is economic dependency. This is what happens when 30% of your economy is reliant on tourism. So, firstly, your economy is far more vulnerable to shocks outside of your control that impact the number of tourists significantly. This is things like terrorist attacks, things like global pandemics, things like changing international relations, even just... No, thank you. The changing social pressures of where to go, what is popular on Instagram. This means that you can't control the number of tourists you get, this is a large economic shock. This is also true every single year, it's the seasonality of tourism. You know, people go in the summer, people go when they have holidays, which means that for half of the year, workers and businesses have no income stream, a very little income stream, which means that they are unemployed or it's far harder to manage. Now, why is it particularly nefarious? Because tourism kills other industries. Because it is so lucrative for six months of the year, local capital flows significantly into tourism and talent at the cost of other industries in the region. So it's even more dependent. Next, inflation really hurts other industries because at the point at which, you know, the resources you need to run your business, at the point at which paper becomes more expensive because your currency is implanted, it's harder to run other businesses. And finally, environmental damage and congestion affect your productivity."

And finally, there are other industries in all countries that can receive this amendment. We're not going to say what they are, but for instance, things like fishing, agriculture, sea trade routes, manufacturing, whatever, there are huge other industries that can go into. Particularly in Western countries like Paris, like Rome, where obviously there are other investments that can happen. We support diversification. We are less reliant on tourism. So proud to propose."

What happens to countries like Sri Lanka? Because realistically, we have a couple of garment factories but nothing much else. To these countries, tourism is not a choice, it is a necessity. It is something that keeps these countries afloat. From the person on the street selling seashell necklaces to the mid-level manager that runs a hotel, it's the lifeblood of these countries. They do not provide us with an alternative. Diversification is just asserted into this debate. Therefore, we think we are the only side that cares about the most vulnerable. A couple of things in characterization, set up, before I move on to my responses and finally my substantive. Firstly, I want to characterize that deterioration of these tourist sites is something that is inevitable, whether that be to climate change, where, for example, Venice is sinking, not because of tourists, but because of a rise in ocean levels, but also because these tourist sites are a place where rebuilding and repairing is something that always occurs. Take, for example, the Great Wall of China, where although it's considered to be a part of the Qing dynasty, it was actually mostly built in the Ming dynasty because it keeps getting rebuilt. Understanding this, we think that the process of rebuilding and keeping these sites maintained and up-to-date is something that happens better on our site when they are better funded, cared for, and given the attention that they deserve. But secondly, I want to point out that their characterization is very unrealistic because both sides have self-regulation incentives. Because if Machu Picchu is destroyed to the point where no one can come there, then obviously no one's going to want to visit Peru and they lose out on the cash cow that they obviously had. Meaning that on our side, governments won't be stupid. They're going to impose regulations to make sure that these places can be preserved to some degree. On to set up then, a couple of things. Firstly, I want to point out that this is a debate about volume, and they need to prove to us why exactly limiting the number of tourists significantly is not only good for the economy, but is the tipping point for all these things that they claim to essentially save these sites. But on top of this, this debate is about a range of places. As much as it is about places like Athens or London, it is also a debate about places like Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Costa Rica, seashells,"

We can impose countless numbers of regulations, that be crowd-organizational control measures through ticketing or imposing time limits, that be incentivizing good behavior through social media and awareness campaigns, that be safety measures to protect degradation and damage, like, for example, better support structures in Machu Picchu, protective stone coverings in the Coliseum and rebuilding these areas. We'd also have regulations in the cities to prevent for the worst excesses to locals, where, for example, Madrid has certain streets reserved only for locals, or maybe on price caps on Airbnbs and such.

                "text": "Three things. Firstly, they say that tourism is inherently exploitative and people act in irresponsible ways. We think that tourists are being educated and improved, particularly because of social media, where people are increasingly aware of the detestable stag culture that needs to be avoided. But on top of this, we can support things like fines and regulation. Their only response in the POI to this is to say that surely regulation won't work because the police is stretched too thin. Why can we not ramp up the police then? Why can we not pay for better surveillance services? Why can we not beef up the ability to protect these areas? Regulation can work. Secondly, they say that you commercialise these places and this is inherently degrading. I want to flip this argument very quickly because if these places are fetishised and isolated, the solution is greater globalisation. Make people go to India to understand that the saree is a part of daily life and not some weird fetish object. Make people look at these sculptures, see the people living there and understand it. Tourism solves the fetish object. Make people look at this culture, see the people living there and understand it. Tourism solves the fetishization. It does not cause it. But on an even if level, I'm going to take it at the absolute best. Even if it's commercialized to some degree, that's absolutely fine. Even if like the elephant who's a sacred part of Sri Lankan culture is sold in the form of like key tags and postcards, if it means that a person can feed his family for that day, what's the harm in that? On net, it's a great thing. But the last point of response then. They say that they can diversify. I'd like to point out that if diversification was possible, these places would have done so anyway. Because it makes economic sense and your voters are going to want that. Why exactly is it likely on their side? It is not sure. Okay then, on to arguments."

                "text": "Firstly, on why we are better for economic development. And secondly, on why we better preserve these sites. Firstly, on why we are better for economic development, and secondly, on why we better preserve these sites. Firstly, on why we are better for economic development. Premise. Prior to the advent of tourism-based economies, these destinations were extremely impoverished, and tourism was brought out as a necessity. Why? Firstly, because they have no meaningful comparative advantage. Maybe they lack mineral-rich rent, maybe they lack resources, maybe they lack human capital. If a city is to survive in the middle of a desert or an ocean, they need to find a way to generate value aside from traditional economic means. Tourism was that option for them. These are the people who this debate is most applicable to. But secondly, these are the areas that were left behind because of colonialism, because of historical injustices, which means that they were left with like weak currencies and such and needed to find a way to build their economies back up. These are places like Sri Lanka that then use this to make sure that tourism works as an alternative in these countries. Why do we then get more money for these places? One, because tourists have more disposable income. They enter in large numbers and hoards and the cash goes into the pockets of local communities and businesses. These communities and businesses sell them goods and services at higher margins than they can to locals. Where, for example, in Kandilama, a traditional sarong priced at 20,000, who I as a a local would never buy a white person coming in would probably buy because their currency is far more stronger than ours and when converted to dollars isn't even the like price of a subway fare for them but two the money circulates and goes beyond just the destination the residents of sibu may have again disposable income and tourism first kicked off but then this money is used to provide temporary stimulus loans to liloan and bonbon and those residents can be livelihoods, put food on the table, and send their kids to school. This then creates an incentive for more local businesses, especially those unrelated to the tourism industry, for example, say, a restaurant in the region, to set up because more people have more disposable income to make use of those services. Why then, given that we have more money for governments, does this benefit translate to a national level? Because increased tax revenue from the increased income of local communities means that we have more tax revenue to pay for the people, but also we have access to foreign currency, and this is good, because access to foreign currency and the transition to local currency means that you have more foreign reserves in your bank, in your government's bank, which means that you're more stable and you attract more investment, but also you're able to set up state enterprises and things like touristic as tourism sites, national parks and cultural centers that directly earn money from tourists. Government spread this money. The initial investment would be used to grow tourism further and the secondary incentive will also be to spread the benefits further where diversification now is possible because you have the funds to do so and politically governments are going to want to do this as well because diversification is likely something that is popular. Why is this exclusive? Because these benefits only manifest through large injections of money into the economy as opposed to small ones. Because on their side, even if they get like a couple injections far and few apart, they still don't have the amount of foreign currency required to establish your local currency as a strong one in order to attract investors and such. Moving on then to my second argument on why we're better for the preservation of these sites. Premise. The upkeep and maintenance of these tourist sites within these destinations requires high costs, within that governments lack the incentives to invest into this, where they lose their golden goose status. There are a couple of reasons why. Because the upkeep, there's a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, we think that the upkeep of these places is going to be expensive regardless of the number of tourists, where these attractions are designed to be attractive and opulent, and maintaining them is going to be expensive because of their cultural heritage, where there's seasonality, where you need to make sure that these places are up-to-date, even when it's in the off-season, where natural deforestation and random accidents and such can happen, and where a number of these sites cannot be modernized and need to have their cultural element preserved into it. This means that the maintenance of these places takes cash that they do not have. Why do we exclusively have that cash then? Because on our side, tourists come in large numbers and bring in the money that you need. You make the kind of revenue that you so essentially desire in order to make sure that these places are maintained. But on top of this, there's a cultural volume of shared ownership where, for example, the only reason that Notre Dame was sent so much aid to be built overall was because all people across the globe felt it was like a collective heritage versus on their side, it becomes France and France's problem only. These incentives are exclusive to opposition, because on their side, politicians can no longer justify spending money to preserve these areas, because there's no economic point. It's always going to be better to invest in tangible things, like say, welfare, education and healthcare, meaning that these essential sites are the first to get slashed on their side, versus on our side, when there's a guaranteed economic benefit, when more people visit these sites, and there's a large number of tourists coming in, and cash is pumping the economy, we are better off and we are funded more, for those reasons, I suppose."

Are we really to believe that the Coliseum, they're not trying to protect it from graffiti? Obviously they probably were, and it just ended up failing on their side. The same reason they give you, if they say, if you could diversify you probably would already. If you could protect your sacred sites, you probably would try to already. You'd probably accrue that harm as well. Secondly, it's just so much easier to regulate when there are less people to regulate. People are able to slip through the cracks when there is like a bustling amount of people. When there are less of them there, it is far easier to regulate those people. But thirdly, I just dispute that you guys can do this regulation at all. You never explain why it requires less fiat than our side. I'd say it probably does require more fiat on your side for two reasons. Firstly, your first figure explains you're economically dependent on that industry. When you're economically dependent on it, you're far less able to regulate it. You do not believe that regulating it in the first place means they do not have the fiat to be able to do that. Because you're economically independent on it, you cannot do the regulations because that would harm your economy, get heaps of political blowback. And secondly, you affect less people on our side.

When you're paying for Paris to be exclusive, you pay far, far, far more money. That means it goes directly to the government. Their best mechanism on this is it goes to the hotels that are owned by Western companies, and maybe they don't have too much profit. They pay their workers some money. That goes to someone else. Some trickle-down economics, we give it directly to the government. Far more certain benefit on our side. The speculative chains of logic there are so unclear as how they get it and under-explained. Second reason is to explain is that the marginal returns of each tourist you're adding just get lower over time. That each tourist you add probably has less money to spend is less likely to spend money we keep the tourists that won't want to go the most will spend the most amount of money and we make exclusive for them they are likely to pay more on our side that explains how we get more money than they do next thing to explain is you're economically dependent on this industry therefore it is bad for us to cut it note that we're doing this on phasing out on a period of time so there's no instant harm that they point to that falls out of the debate pretty quickly."

The industries already exist. But note there are new industries developing, things like AI that you can go into, be able to do that. You could have said 100 years ago that Hong Kong was in a nice place that had nice temperatures and would be a nice tropical island and be like, oh, that would always be a tourist destination. Why would it be anywhere else? Could have said the same thing for Singapore. They became other places. They can diversify even if you are like a Pacific island or in Southeast Asia. Second response is, where are the vast majority of tourist destinations? When you think of it as places like New York, it's places like California, it's places like Paris, places like London, those places can obviously diversify. They will be better off. And thirdly, is that we spend more money on skills retraining through the money that we get through the auction system, so we're more able to diversify on our side.

Second response is you sell less goods on your side because you get things like Dutch disease, the price of the currency rises which deletes all the other forms of the economy, you sell less exports, means you get less foreign currency from that, it is not a benefit. But thirdly, it's unclear if you get foreign currency on your side because lots of people do things like trading the currency when they're in America and then fly overseas, so you never get the American currency because they trade it before they leave, because they want to know that they can definitely get it. They think they can get it at cheaper prices when they trade it in America for like serving currency, so they don't go and do it when they go overseas, they trade it back at home. Fourthly, is the vast majority of tourist places are in Western countries and they already have their own currency, right? They already have the Euro, they already have the US dollar, they already have the US dollar, they already have the Australian dollar. Why do they need the currency reserves? Entirely unclear from this team. They had to prove that the vast majority of places were in the non-Western world and that also you traded the currency specifically there and that that wasn't even a trade-off of getting other industries. So many things in logic that you fail to prove. Fifth thing is that we do things like building skills, which means people can go overseas, get remittances and send it back to their family we get more currencies that way because we spend more money diversifying economy putting up skills putting up things like nurses so that we get excess means that you can go overseas and then send back money on foreign currency that explains how we win and flip most their economy harms in the debate I would take a POI London and New York have diversified while remaining busting tourist sites without giving tourism up."

First thing they try and go is, well, local services are given separately to the people local, to the people that are international. A couple of responses. Firstly, governments don't have infinite money. Just because there are tourists does not mean they can now also give money to local services. The way that France spent billions of dollars on cleaning up the Seine, which voters argued was a direct opportunity cost of doing things like funding hospitals and protested over, there are opportunity costs of spending money on tourists that you do not get to spend on your local people. But secondly, note that when it's incredibly crowded, things like buses, it is hard to scale up. It's hard to build new train lines in a city that has existed for a thousand years and build where they are. When you've moved a bunch of hotels, how do you build more train lines there? They can't scale it up. It means that the trains just get incredibly crowded. Note this has two impacts. First, it feels incredibly bad for people to just have a bunch of tourists in their train so they can't get to work. But secondly, note the productivity limits it lowers. Things from people are less productive when it takes them longer to get to work. Third thing we push is that you have things like housing. You push people out of the city, which puts them further away. It makes it harder to give them services. And if you are, they are less effective because they just take longer. They say you can do things like housing, you push people out of the city, which puts them further away, makes it harder to give them services, and even if you are, they are less effective because they just take longer.

The next thing to explain is why we are better off, this is my substantive advice, actions. This will explain how people do things more like sex work, hard drugs and crimes for fun than they would do when we limit the amount of tourists. Four reasons for this. Firstly, we have a net less tourists, so even if this doesn't change people's propensity to do this, just having less of them means they're less likely to do things. Note that cocaine production peaked in the world when the Euros were happening because there was lots of people going to one place where they thought they would all have cocaine and that meant that there were more hard drugs being done there. Secondly, it's far easier to regulate on our side because firstly, it's smaller and secondly, your economy is less dependent on those vice industries so you're better off. Thirdly, lots of the tourism that's done for vice industries like sex work is often impulse things that people do. They go, oh I want to fly there next week because I really want to do some drugs or something. That is less likely to happen when you have an auction system and when you have to sign up for permits. It's harder to do those impulse things that lead to vice drugs. But fourthly, note that we have a more diverse set of jobs. People are not pushed into having to do things like sex work when they did not want to and had no other industry to rely on. They push people into that so those services are less provided. The impacts of this are pretty clear. Women stop getting abused. Economies become more stable because they're not dependent on things like crime. It disturbs locals' lives on their side. It amplifies every impact we're giving this debate. For these reasons, incredibly proud to propose."

You can still pivot to the other 70% of your economy and diversify on that side. I'll chat about why you can't. But again, you do agree that this is a big part of your economy and your jobs as well. So this is the one thing everyone agrees on. There are a lot of jobs that tourism rides on. We'll explain why those get worse on the asset of the house. First question then. On regulation. They say that regulation won't work because there are too many tourists. But like, why? The challenge in first opposition is that tourism gives you the money to hire more cops, gets no response. If there are too many tourists, hire more police officers. I have no idea why it is literally impossible to regulate just because there are more tourists. Then they say economic dependence on tourism is why you will not regulate, because apparently regulation will turn away tourists. Right. Because people are going to stop going to Rome just because you can't graffiti the Colosseum. This is an absurd argument. Just because we regulate against the worst harms possible does not mean that tourists evaporate from these sites. So their claim that there is no political will to regulate is just untrue. The third and final thing they say is that sex tourism on the house is going to be better because sex tourism is impulsive and they stop this from occurring. A, they just make it go to non-major sites of tourism so I have no idea why this changes. Instead of going to Bali in Indonesia, you go to a smaller village in Indonesia and do the same exact thing. If anything, the scrutiny on Bali is higher on us than the house which is why you see the Balinese authorities starting to regulate against this on our comparison. The second response I want to point out is that there are some evil people who will plan a year in advance and go do it anyway. I really don't understand what the margin here is. Sex tourism cannot be the biggest thing in the round. The 99% of tourists who don't engage in sex tourism, the money that they bring to economies probably ought to matter a lot more. With that, we proved that regulation is possible to a very large extent."

                "text": "In my third class, I will later prove why even if you do not buy regulation as a perfect intimation on ass at the house, why the harms that they point out just don't work as well. But I want to note, insofar we prove regulation, a big chunk of the negative case goes away as well. On to the second question then, about economics. I want to start by chatting about whether there's a problem in relying on tourism to start with. The claim that they make is that tourism being a big part of your economy stops diversification. And the mechanization that we get is second proposition saying one sentence, that Western hotel companies stop diversification. How? Maybe you can't build a factory in front of a Crowne Plaza in Belgrade on our side either, but why does the Crowne Plaza care if you build a factory on the suburbs of Belgrade? Why does the Crowne Plaza care? About every single inch of land in Serbia, we imagine that they don't prove why industrialization or diversification is literally impossible on our side of the house. Clearly, there are areas in Serbia, clearly there are areas in India that we can happily industrialize as well. So their opportunity cost was one that just existed in their heads. I have no idea why India getting some white people to come there means that India now won't have factories on our side of the house. Just think about how ludicrously absurd this claim is. Then they say that Hong Kong and Singapore economically developed. But I think this shows up our analysis and proves the mechanism that I just talked about, which is that you can have a lot of tourists in the country and also develop and industrialize your own financial sectors. You can also set up your own factories because that is what Hong Kong and Singapore did to start that. So I think those examples cut deeper into their case than it does to us if anything they prove our case for us. The next thing I want to respond to is the very Western-centric responses to our argument about forex reserves. They say four things, all of which only apply to the developed world. They say that forex reserves don't matter. To the Australian economy, maybe not, because creditors rate the Australian economy very highly. You know who it does matter to? Countries like Pakistan, countries like Sri Lanka that need massive forex ratings before anyone is going to put their money there. FDI will not come into our countries if we don't have the forex reserves to guarantee that to these investors that they can pull their money out, that their money won't be stuck in this economy because without those forex reserves, you will not have the confidence to get the FDI to set up those factories that they so desperately want on their side of the house. Maybe on the absolute best case, Australia doesn't benefit. But you know who else benefits? China, Sri Lanka, India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina. What about the rest of the developing world that they never wanted to talk about? Then they say, that should just happen, and that this is a bad thing. But I would note, there are a lot of developing countries around the world run trade deficits because they need to import a lot of goods. On our side, importing becomes a lot easier when the currency is managed better as a result of tourists coming there and giving you forex reserves. They say that this will not happen because people will trade currencies in America and then fly to Sri Lanka. But guys, the problem is not every single currency is an international currency. You can't convert in America US dollars to Sri Lanka rupees. You have to come to Sri Lanka and do it in the fast pace which is why we think the forex reserves of Sri Lanka will be boosted up on us and the host. India can convert Australian dollars, but guys, the rest of the world is not globalized to the extent that your economy is. The last thing to point out is that the vast majority of tourism is in the West. Intuitively, is this true? Probably not. There are a bunch of places in the developing world that do attract a massive amount of tourists. There are a bunch of people in the developing world who engage in tourism in each other's countries. Look at the millions of tourists from China that visit India, that visit South Korea, that visit Sri Lanka, that we think is going to be significantly beneficial on our side of the house. The implication to all of this is that the responsive strategy only works in places like Australia. Maybe the Australian economy will be fine, it will be fine either way because it's the Australian economy. The places that mattered more were the places like Maldives, were places like India that could actually get money on our competitive and that they got rid of on their side. The implication to this was people had more jobs on our side of the house. When the hotel employed you and gave you a paycheck that you could feed your family with, this was important because they could not just say that they set up alternative industries without telling us what those alternative industries were. Fishing is not good enough. They set back development by decades because they take away the one comparative advantage countries like Maldives had in the first place. On our side, we would not sacrifice the certain benefit and industry that we already have for the speculative benefit of fishing being good enough on their comparison. Lastly, on culture. They say that culture is fetishized on our side of the house. Why is it not going to be fetishized when they still let some tourists in as second proposition wants to conceive to begin with? Then they say that locals are locked out of their services. But I want to flip this argument. It is because there are significant amounts of tourists in your cities that the Rome government has A, the capacity because tourists give you the cash and B, the incentive to improve things like the metro system because tourists will not come into a city that has a dysfunctional metro, right? So it is only on our side of the house that these places have the capacity and the incentive to improve things for local populations. A better metro, desalination plants, if they are concerned that there's not enough water, all of these things were exclusive to our side. The implication was tourists brought money, this matter to the rest of the world, if not Australia."

The private companies don't care whether your industry is reliant on tourism. I'm going to tell you why that's not true and why their side actively, with over-tourism, stops governments from diversifying. First, it's because they suffer from things like the status quo bias, which is the exact thing that they're suffering from right now. They assume that because these countries have so much tourism that this is the only thing they can do. Second, it's because governments were inherently short-termists because they had electoral incentives and they weren't perfect actors. That meant they traded off what was a quick boost to the economy to things that would legitimately help them in the future, like investment, into things like skills. Third, it was because they had a bias from the past. They point out themselves that sometimes these countries were ones who have faced colonial pasts and that meant that tourism had helped them get out of these situations. That led them to believe that this was their shining light and pushed them away from investing into other industries. Lastly, it's because people in these countries see low-level jobs in hotels and tour guides and never attempt to upskill. They are actively pushed into these industries instead of using government capital to push them out of it. Next, that's defeated their point. That's proven at the end of that that governments would put more money into things like investment, into things like skills, if their side wasn't encouraging things like overtourism, which directly stopped them from doing this. Second thing to defeat them is what they say about countries have literally no other options, that they have only nice beaches and this is the only thing that they have. First, I think this is incredibly uncharitable. Not only to us, but also to places like the Seychelles which have great reserves and incredible natural resources that aren't used because of things like colonisation which push them back from using them. I'll tell you why they're able to diversify. First, it's because these places are highly attractive for things like investment and foreign direct investment. That was incredibly good for these countries. They're blocked for all the reasons I told you about how there was inherent tie-up in the tourism industry. If you told me a few decades ago that a place like Taiwan, which has really nice beaches and is relatively small, would only be a tourist hotspot, obviously now that seems ridiculous.

Know that people get locked out on their side because they go into things like quick jobs rather than trying to upskill and trying to pursue other industries. Yes. To be clear, you think that the Indian government won't bother to look at setting up a government factory because of the status quo bias that exists just because some hotels exist in India? Okay, look, you wanted to talk about places that aren't like India, which exclusively rely on tourism. I know that India is a place that doesn't rely on tourism, quite obviously, and has incredible other industries. I'm not sure how this helps you in the debate. At the end of that, we were the ones who encouraged governments to invest in other things, they never got to do that we encouraged governments to diversify that was incredibly good, because tourism was a bad industry to have economically their only response is to say that every industry suffers things like shocks we tell you that tourism is uniquely unstable, because it's uniquely seasonal because it's a suspect to shocks like COVID, which killed entire industries and sent entire countries into poverty, but that it was also finite, that beaches' water quality would go down over time, that these could not last forever, that climate change would change your seas, and then that if you focused on tourism, you would have literally no way in the future of providing money from your country. At the end of that, we were the ones who encouraged governments to diversify. We were the only ones who did that. On their side, they remained stagnant. They remained in these situations where people had no other employment opportunities but to work in things like hotels. If they wanted to relegate people to that, they could, on our side, we actually changed things by pushing governments to change what they do. The last thing they bring you is that, the last such attempt to say this is to say that the lack of foreign reserves means that you never diversify. First, obviously tourism and the physical exchange of money was never going to be the defining factor in whether you had foreign reserves or not. Obviously other industries, if you pushed into them, would also give you things like foreign reserves. Private companies could also do this. I don't think that was ever going to help them in this debate. The physical exchange of money was no longer what was the most defining factor in foreign currencies now, in foreign reserves. And we just told you that that probably wasn't going to be that helpful to that country. Most countries don't actually directly focus on having strong"

Their only response is to say that this helps people learn more about their cultures because they go to these places. First, this is obviously untrue because you had an incentive to play into stereotypes that westerners wanted, to play into stereotypes which would make people spend more. These were the kind of things that film propagated but were not necessarily true to your culture. But second, it's because Westerners and people from bigger countries played into things like colonial power dynamics. They had the money and the purchasing power. You had to prostrate yourself. You had to make your culture more palatable for them. That was so harmful to these people because it was a massive impact to literally lose your whole culture, to lose your sense of life, to be like someone living in Hawaii and have to give luau to people every day. That was something that deeply harmed your sense of life. To be like someone living in Hawaii and have to give luau's to people every day, that was something that deeply harmed your sense of self. We told you also that you have things like destruction to monuments. Their only response is to say that they preserve cultures through rebuilding processes. This obviously wasn't enough. If you lose your individual culture, if you lose the history of these places, that is obviously a harm in itself. If you rebuilt the library of Alexandria for me, that would not be enough. Things are good in their original form. They have huge importance to things like indigenous communities. They have huge importance to your sense of self. Last thing to say, then, is on culture and the brief response they give you on sex tourism, that it gets worse on their side. The first thing I'd note is that if you believed any of our points on diversification, then this is obviously untrue. On their side, people are pushed into these industries. They don't have a sense of choice. They don't have agency in choosing where they go. On our side, if you weren't just pushing into tourism, if you were actively incentivized to do things like build your skills, to do things like stay in education, you were far more likely to be able to directly seek other jobs. At the end of that, on our side, you were far more likely to keep your culture. You were far more likely to keep the monuments which had deep cultural importance to you. You were far more likely to have places to live and your economy was far less likely to be dependent on something which was so harmful to you, which rubbed you of your culture, which rubbed you of being able to live your life in a normal way. So incredibly proud to propose."

First on the economics and second on culture. First, whether regulations will work. We pointed out three things here. The first is governments have an incentive to regulate because governments care about people coming in here when their entire revenue stream is dependent on the fact that they need over tourism to exist within these regions for their economies to sustain itself. In instances where it does fail, it means that they cannot get the revenue that they have on our side, which is why they have an incentive to regulate. What is the implication of this? That is, governments will cut down on things like cocaine production, for example, as the second proposition wants to say. In instances if it means that people become uncomfortable, that they don't want to go to these regions in the first place, because there's just so much of crime in these regions or there's so much of uncertainty of what will happen to their lives. So the implication of this is that governments have an incentive to regulate. The second thing that we pointed out is that capacity. If they can literally implement and fear an auction system on the outside of the house, I'm sure we can fear some level of regulation existing on the outside of the house as well. But the third thing we pointed out is that the capacity to regulate also significantly gets better over time, right? And there were two reasons that we suggested for this. The first reason is because they just have more"

Housing prices are going to exist anyway because there's like a trend of overpopulation or like climate change is going to occur anyway, like in Serbia you're running out of water because it is the heat that is happening out of nowhere. These things are going to happen anyway. The ability for governments to fund these things only exists if you have the money to do that. But the second thing that we pointed out is that the pressure on governments to regulate against these things also significantly increases, right? Like when you're moved out of your house and you don't have enough houses, that is when people can prejudice the governments to regulate as well. So regulation, even if as it exists, is not like perfect, it will get better over time because of the additional pressure that keeps increasing on garments. What is the implication of this? This takes out the vast majority of the cases they have. Their first argument on graffiti and like people doing bad things. Their third argument on like people consuming cocaine. They will have a positive case at the end of this if they do not prove that regulation does not work. We've proven sufficiently that we can fear some regulation and it keeps getting better over time. We win this debate already. But let's answer two questions additionally, just so that we clear the wind, right? The first is on economics. The first thing I want to point out is deal with their argument on diversification and the second thing I want to prove in this argument is that even if diversification does not happen on our side of the house, where the tourism industry is the best industries that these countries have and need to stay in this taking us on our absolute worst case in a world in which diversification cannot happen the first thing why can diversification still happen on our side and like the argument on diversification I want to point out a couple of missing links from the proposition here the first is that they never pointed out why diversification is important in the first place. Why is this industry so, so different to the tourism industry? Their damage control in the third proposition is that, well, this is seasonal. I want to point out two things. The first is fluctuations in demand happens in every other industry as well. I don't understand why this is uniquely volatile when it comes to tourism. But again, we are talking about major tourist destinations. Like, the Eiffel Tower is always overcrowded, guys. It is not overcrowded in particular seasons of the year, which is why their seasonal harm does not make sense as well. This is true of every other tourist site that is going to exist on that side as well. So I don't understand the necessity to diversify in the first place. The second missing link in the argument is that they never proved why they can diversify in the first place. We pointed out several countries that just don't have the capacity to diversify. Firstly, because they don't have any other industry like the Maldives. But secondly, because they don't have the money to diversify"

In the past, their entire economy was dependent on the tourism industry, but over time, they have entered the financial sector because they're able to use this money. So over-tourism is essential in the short term for these countries for them to be able to diversify in the long term, as they suggest. But the fact they want to point out is that they never proved why this is exclusive on our side, because we pointed out governments do have an incentive, right? And the reason for this is diminishing marginal utility. At some point in time, it just becomes so much so that there is no additional benefit that you get from, like, tourism, to the point where governments are forced to shift to other industries, because their labor sector is just packed with tourism, that there are still people who are unemployed, that they need to find jobs for them, and that is the point at which they divert to other industries and they start building those industries as well, and people will pressurise the governments to do this. The fourth missing link is that why is this beneficial in the first place, which leads me on to the second part of this clash, right? That is, why even if diversification does not happen on our side of the house, why the tourism is the best industry that these people have, and there are two exclusive reasons that we gave to you, in first opposition, by the way, that they never responded to."

The need for labour does not exist in other industries as it does in the tourism industry which is why we can guarantee all people jobs versus on that side some people will always be left jobless even if they have the benefit of upskilling secondly why can upskilling still happen they don't prove where they get the funds from they say auctioning is the funds from auctioning good enough and you only have like five rich people coming in versus on our side you have the funds from like billions and billions of people who come into the country and spend, you know, like significant amounts of money and the additional funding that we get on our side because rich people are going to spend"

We pointed out that foreign reserves are significantly important because it shines to other countries in terms of their currency stability which is why investor confidence is boosted which is why other industries also start coming in in a world in which tourism industry also exists, because you get more spotlight when you also have your factories there. What is the importance of this? Two things. Firstly, this is a certain benefit when it comes to the tourism industry for countries that don't have an additional competitive advantage. Secondly, is that the long-term industrialisation is not something that is mutually exclusive, but on our side of the house, the harm of tourism is guaranteed on"

If this debate is about countries that don't have major tourist sites, then that doesn't make sense either. Third thing under this question, in terms of other regional development, again unengaged argument as to why other regions within that same country become more popular. Like people go to Sri Lanka to visit the sea and then they go to Jaffna, for example, to visit the co-village there.

Whereas on their side, they will break down the forest to build factories, which is because it does not bring any benefit on their side. The second thing I want to point out is that the stereotypes argument does not make sense. If it means people have food on the ground and food to put on the table, it does not matter because of stereotypes. Those are going to exist on either side of the house. At least we can break it without needing to appease to some billionaires on our side for all these reasons, of course."

                "text": "They have no positive case at the end of this debate. Two paths to victory on opposition. First, on economic development, where we've been quite clearly. Second, on the lives of residents improving on our side. Our second argument that receives barely any response about why we better protect cultural heritage sites on our side. Firstly, on economic development, I think the engagement in this clash through both sides fall to an extent. It gets quite messy. So I think what's important here is to break this down into groups. There are different kinds of countries in different circumstances. The first type of countries that we think matters are countries with not a lot else going for it, countries that are dependent on tourism. Why was it that our case was winning by a wide margin in these set of countries? Because we pointed out that this was the most profitable method of earning cash. Earning cash in foreign currencies by the way. They say that phishing exists. They say that surely something else needs to exist that you can maybe turn your people to once tourism goes away. But this is an uncharitable response. Because our claim from first was that these countries depend on tourism because this was the best thing for them to do this was the one thing that has a comparative advantage over the rest of the world at and it was that thing that we guaranteed and secured for these countries on our side maybe the Maldives can fish but you know what India also fishes and India is probably slightly better at it the Maldives is much better than everyone else at tourism and that is the thing that we were unwilling to take away from these countries we pointed out that for these countries, getting forex mattered a lot. They gave you four responses as to why the Australian economy doesn't need forex. We gave you responses as to why the rest of the world does. Third proposition drops this entirely. The implication to this is that we get cash, that cash then translates into investments from abroad, because FDI becomes more likely when your currency is more stable, because again, we get more forex reserves on our side of the house. So if our best-case implication was industrialization mattered, we actually gave you the means and mechanism to get to industrialization because we made FDI more likely on our competitive start. The way here is that the long-term on our side better achieves the best case on their side, which is they want industrialization, we just get to it in a far more secure way on our comparative. The next set of countries that I think matters are countries that have the capacity for other things beyond what is going to start with. But they never tell you why exactly these countries can't industrialize. Because all they say in second proposition is, aha, big evil Western company stops this. We point out that this is absurd in my speech. The crown plaza isn't going to stop industrialization of the suburbs of Belgrade, right? They don't respond to this in their proposition. They don't respond. When we point out that return on inflation in Skadaria in Belgrade does not mean that you can't set up a factory in literally any other plot of land in Serbia to start with. So they don't actually prove why industrialization is literally impossible literally everywhere else beyond these major tourist sites in these countries. Their proposition says that India doesn't count. We agree. India isn't going to be stopping industrialization as a result of just having some hotels, and that is the response that be their case as opposed to our case. So the implication here is that the countries that could industrialize will do it anyway. The countries that can't industrialize get cash on our city halls that feeds people's families. That cash is the cash that got to industrialization in the long term in the Maldives, in Sri Lanka, on our side. They need to engage rather than talking about Australia's economy. On the second question, why is it that lives of residents are better? A, regulation. They don't engage charitably. We can regulate against a lot of these harms and the incentives to local governments to care about local voters, which we point out in the first opposition is undisponded to. Second, even if you don't buy regulation, my response in the second proposition, that third proposition, drops, which is that governments get the capacity to improve things on our side of the house through this cash. You build a better subway, so with that in mind, with the metro, we could expand the metro with the cash that tourists brought. Finally, our argument about preservation. We told you that forests matter to you and the government on our side of the house. When the forest gets you cash, on their side, cutting down the forest, tearing down these cultural sites of preservation makes more sense. Ours was the only site that they made these sites economically valuable. Approved."

I think it's more intuitive that you think of those places because they just do happen to have more people going there than the ones that they name. They try and push you that, oh, the Maldives is a major tourist destination. I'm unclear that it is. I'm unclear that Paris is. It's probably a way that it's more likely. But secondly, we explained to you that Western tourists are more biased towards going to Western destinations for two reasons in our speech. The first one is that they're just biased towards their own places because they're culturally similar but secondly it's geographically similar if you're in europe you're more likely to go to european countries you ought to go to countries that are further away since your way that is more likely because you were there that means that the bulk of characterization we give you about western countries we protect their sites and they'll still be fine economically but even if it does go to other countries we still win the debate there they never engage on our grounds in this debate so we and we"

Second response is we need to give you, there are a bunch of things like malicious tourists doing things like graffiti in Colosseum. The third thing we tell you is that there are things like access to services. You get pushed out of public transport. That just makes your life awful. We also explain second proposition, that lowers economic productivity, gets their harm. Fourth thing we tell you is that there are things like the housing crisis. We push people out of cities that they have cultural connection to, which make it harder to live in worse places. And often people's rents go up, they lose lots of money. That is economically depressing for those people, even if you rise their wages. Housing prices go up so much that that is harmful for them. Fifth thing we explain is that they're culturally exploitive. They try to say they can do regulations. Maybe they can. We already gave the reasons why they totally didn't have the fear to do. But if they could, why were they not doing it anyway? Unfair on that. Next thing they try to do is go, well, the side proposition is probably winning by a margin on this, let's try and weigh it out of the debate. What are the two metrics they give you at third opposition? First, climate change happens anyway, so why should we care about the environment? Is climate change going to happen anyway? Probably untrue that it is. But it also, lots of the harms we give you are direct environmental harms, like sewage leaks. Second thing they tell you is, overpopulation happens anyway. Doesn't mean you have to add"

If you believe this is a Wayne metric, it doesn't get them anywhere in the debate. We tell you our benefits are more true because first, they're benefits that they get in the short term. Sam explains in his speech that the wave breaks in Costa Rica no longer exist because you build up hotels so that people stop going there and there are a bunch of hotels that no one visits. And therefore, people don't do the tourism so they only get short-term benefits on their side. We have more sustainable economic benefits. But secondly, our harm is more certain. And thirdly, we have a wide variety of impacts. I'll give you five different ones that only trade one small part of the economy they don't win on. Let's go on their economy material, noting that by the end of this I think it's short-termist and probably not even something that they can win on. They tell you that there is a certain benefit of adding the middle class. It's unclear the speculative logic change we explained at the start. This goes to the government. We explained it's more direct on our side. And not even if it is true, it's seasonal, so you don't get claims benefit all the time, half the time these people are unemployed. We lower the delta by capping people in summer so it's similar to people in winter, so people more have jobs. But they tell you they can't do things like diversify. But note that 3.0 says Hong Kong did diversify. They used to do things like doing lots of tourism. They could. Next thing they say is they would anyway. Alice explains that government's a short-term bias. Governments do make bad decisions. To buy their argument you have to believe a government never makes a bad decision. Untrue. Lastly, on currency, I'm clear you need this much more currency because we still have some tourism on their side. They act like it's a banned tourism debate. They're unable to clean its benefits. We still have enough currency. Power up to propose."

                "text": "On the count of the model, what do we look at? We say our policy is two-pronged. Firstly, we significantly limit by placing caps on attendance in various ways. We say, firstly, by restricting numbers to entry. We do this in just the same way Lord Howie Island in Australia restricts the islands to 400 people per night as of 2019. But secondly, through pre-bookings and specific tourist restrictions, right? We say we allow certain individuals at each point in time to enter major tourist destinations and make travel-specific visas to that very major tourist destination. But on the second layer, we say we aggressively promote other tourist destinations. We say we do this through the increased advertisements of smaller tourist destinations, but secondly, through promoting virtual tourism. We say in the same way Thievelu did this when the island was under imminent threats of sinkage. We say this is something that is important. But why then do we think this is the best and the only form of regulation? We say historically, due to the direct conflict that exists between the very purpose of tourism, which is to invade the natural space and be its parasite, and the core function of regulation, which is to limit invasion in one way or another, be it banning snorkeling in Guantanamo, be it the jail time for noise in Venice, or be it the banning of Airbnbs and hotel construction in Barcelona. We say that the governments have been unable to regulate without taking away from the adventure of tourism in itself. We say significant limitation, however, is unique in its ability to simply reduce the number of people that can invade this particular space. We say that's something that's important. So first, let's talk on principle. But before we do that, let's talk about a little bit of some pretext here."

                "text": "We say that there's a long-standing history of tourism that has scarred and violently struck at the souls of locals within major tourist destinations. We say that this has served as the impetus for new untapped levels of hate and vitriol towards mass tourism by these locals. We say that the hate is closely tied to the idea of having too many tourists, and it conjures up feelings of unsafety and anger. We say in Spain, locals have been gathering up at tourist sites to throw stones at those particular locals, at those particular tourists. We say in Bali, we've seen violent protests and violent protests erupting at the end of the day, right? What then becomes the premise here? We say that the mass existence of tourists in the land of locals is a triggering and a frightening scene. We say government's responsibility in this instance should be to significantly reduce in order to put those people's minds at ease. What's the claim therein? We say the claim of this principle therein is two-pronged. One, we say that there is government obligation towards responsiveness, right? But secondly, we say that there is proactiveness of the government in response to the civil uproar that is occurring. What's the wash here? Why do we think there are no pragmatic benefits that are likely to materialize on their side? Because we say the tourism industry in itself is going to face severe damage in future because of this vigil. We see that people are already scared to travel to these areas, particularly because of the anger that's already there. So we think at the moment in which you don't resolve this, we don't see a world in which the pragmatic benefits they are going to argue for are going to materialize in the long term. So what do we want you to note critically? Note that we value the paternalistic utilitarian role of government in the instance where the populace can rationalize this decision. But in a world, however, where the people are greatly emotionally traumatized, where the people are hurting, where the people are bleeding, we think that government has to value putting the minds of those particular people at ease. They have to value then helping those particular people, right? What then becomes the proof of outcome here here we say in the instances that we don't follow this principle we think we then see followers of like mass citizen discontent right we see a lot of civil disarray because a lot of people are generally angry about the ideas and everything that's been going on i think that's something that is terrible but principally on its own right why is it important to follow this principle? Because you feel trust in your state, you say you feel the discontent and you fulfill that discontent of citizens who've been always feeling like the government has been not acting towards these things, right? Principally, those people feel safe and they feel like, you know, the state has fulfilled their obligation to the people. And we say that in itself is something that is very important that we ought to preserve."

                "text": "But the second argument is on why significant limiting in itself in improving the standard of living. But before I take that, let me take a few more. If there's already so much fear for tourists traveling to these locations, why are we not going to see a gradual drop-off in the number of tourists? Why do we need to impose these strict government restrictions? So, I think we've already spent a long time explaining why that's something that's necessary. I don't think that's necessarily relevant. But when we talk about the significant limiting in improving the standard of living, what's the premises here? We say that over-tourism has harmed the standard of living for locals. We say that the locals have been priced out of the market, and this is manifested in multiple ways. One, we say it's manifested in the skyrocketing of prices for basic necessities. Notice how locals are forced to live on less than the bare minimum. They have lack of access to cheap food, clothing for your children. E.g., we saw this in the Bahamas, where there's a 47.5% increase in prices in every tourist season for them. And these prices are only getting worse and worse. Why is this so? Because one, there's an influx of tourists that jack up the demand and cause demand-pull inflation. But secondly, because tourists are generally perceived as financial stable people. And so companies generally have an incentive to increase prices so as to capitalize on the profits of as much as possible, right? But secondly, we say that locals are subject to forced displacement. We say that the rental prices and the housing costs are pushed up significantly, making it difficult for locals to often live in those areas. In New York, an urban tourist-heavy city, they average up to 80% more in housing costs making it difficult for locals to often live in those areas. In New York, an urban tourist-heavy city, they average up to 80% more in housing costs compared to other neighboring cities such as Jersey City. This happens because the demand for housing by tourists is often pushing out those particular... forcing a lot of landowners to maximize their profit by changing their business models from orienting towards the local market to orienting towards the tourist market to orienting towards the tourist market and pushing out those particular locals. We think secondly, we think locals are getting bought out of their houses. They prey on the despise of these particular locals for that money and use that land to then develop more tourist attractions that way they can benefit off of profit."

We say because tourism continues to expand and send people into even worse off areas, it means that people keep on getting worse and displaced even more and more. And this is something that is generally harmful. But lastly, we say the outpricing of locals renders that employment contracts useless at the end of the day. This is because the minimum wage jobs that these people are earning barely cover the high cost of living in these touristified areas. This is worse for lowly paid workers in the appendaging industries because this continues the price increase versus like the low wages continues to make them suffer within these areas. but how then does significantly limiting deal with this on the comparative note here one we say significantly limiting deals with overall pricing because there's no demand pool inflation so we think because there are less people we think the prices are much less but secondly we say that the businesses reduce like prices in order to cater to those local people because that's where their most that their profit base relies right to say that because now we've got more locals and locals are more more profitable like markets to invest into we're likely going to reduce our like prices to engage those people right but secondly we say deals with displacement because landlords have no incentive to increase the rent as like the main consumer base again are locals right but secondly we say airbnbs and other housing structures are likely not going to change the ways they do their structures because they understand how they're going to be able to attain more money from that particular consumer base. We say what's better for those particular individuals who are better for the locals, and we think that this is something that is incredibly important on our side. Proud to vote."

At the point that we prove to you that the population is hurt more on their side, we also take this principle.

First of all, because there are many visitors in the region making use of services, that already means a lot of money comes into the region. But second of all, tourists are willing and able to spend more money than the local population. Tourists generally tend to be more wealthy, save up for vacation, and spend their money impulsively. This has two positive effects then on the local economy. A, it simply means there is a lot more demand for labor. The local population on our side is able to pay for rent and food by working in restaurants where tourists eat, hotels where they sleep, and museums that they visit. But B, apart from there being more jobs, these jobs are relatively well paid. Tourists tend to spend lots of money that for higher prices can be asked than for locals. This is why in markets and for taxis you tend to be charged more when you are a tourist. And that also means that local business owners get more money and are able to pay their employees well."

Hotels, souvenir shops and bars are all unable to make profit without a constant stream of customers. But two, in these destinations, it is incredibly hard to start up an entirely new industry directly dealing with their POI. Why is this? Four reasons. First of all, most people are taught to work in service and hospitality jobs. It is incredibly hard to in one go retrain the majority of the population, let alone have experts do the higher up work. But B, it requires an insane amount of capital and time. To specialize in a new industry on a large scale and become actual competition in the market, you need to build entire factories, offices, find customers on a large scale. This is undoable. C, a lot of retains don't have the natural resources to specialize in alternative industries. So for example, the Netherlands is specialized in agriculture because we have very fertile land. The Middle East is specialized in oil because they have a lot of oil fields. And many of these tourist destinations don't have any of these natural resources. Think the Maldives, think Venice, right? And lastly, capital and space are zero-sum. So the city center only has a limited amount of accessible space. So if there is a building, you can either make it an office in a hotel. Historically, they have been making hotels of this, therefore there is no base to go from, there is no other industry to invest in. All of this also means that investors will never invest capital into these regions, but will always prefer the neighboring regions that doesn't have all of these problems. So then what is the impact?

So why is there only regional development? Because of tourism. This is because of the incentive of the government. Because as we've proven, tourism creates a lot of economic revenue. And governments are dependent on tourism for their tax income. This looks like issuing visas. This looks like taxes on profit and product taxes. Therefore they have to keep on developing the region. Proposition takes the incentive for the government to care away because the region is no longer an area that brings in money. What do we think then that regional development looks like? This looks like building infrastructure such as high speed rails, better quality and cleaner roads, and the installation of ATM. This is necessary to keep tourists coming. Roads with holes, dirty streets, and a lack of streetlights deter tourists. On proposition, the government can let dirt roads be dirt roads and keep dark alleys without streetlights. Note then that the infrastructure benefits locals. We see this, for example, in Spain, where a railroad between Barcelona and Montserrat was developed to connect tourist destinations, but the 12 villages located in the 15 kilometers in between these tourist destinations now can also easily take the train. Note that this also deals with their case, where they say that prices tend to become a lot more expensive. On our side, it's easier to live outside of the city. But second of all, you get more developed products and services. Tourists will demand a certain quality of products that they are used to, that otherwise would not be imported into the area. This looks like medicine, right? This looks like higher quality goods. The local community now gets access to these higher quality products and services. So what does this then mean to the debate? Infrastructure has a huge positive impact on the lives of the local population. It means it's easier to live further away from the city and travel to work by public transport. Think, for example, the train in Spain. It means your streets are less likely to be covered in trash. It gives people access to medicine and conveniences, but forcing them to move or spend money on going elsewhere to get basic services done. Pano, in our side, the 50 million people that are living in Bangkok aren't left in the dark, but they can keep sustaining their lives. For all these reasons, I am so proud to oppose."

We say that in the instance that individuals are actually employed within these industries, we talk about the low wages that these individuals earn within these industries. This is to say that even if these individuals are particularly employed, they still can't afford basic staples within those cities. But secondly, we think there's a structural flaw in the argumentation and they tell us that there's comparatively different pricing. This is to say that groceries are cheaper than hotels. We think this is something that's untrue within major tourist destinations. Why? Because we think that even those hotels themselves buy those groceries that they're going to be using for the tourists that particularly live within those Airbnbs and hotels. So we think that there's still an incentive for those prices to still hike. But thirdly, we said that these tourists don't just go to hotels. We think those tourists also eat and buy those groceries that are existing within the streets of those cities. So we still think there's no such thing as the comparative pricing that exists. But secondly, we said that even if those individuals are actually employed, we think that in the vast majority of instances, because tourism is a seasonal employment type of like industry, we say that most of those individuals get laid off when the tourists don't particularly go there. We say that when most tourists come within the holiday seasons, we think for the greater part of the year, individuals are unemployed enemies. This is to say that even if individuals significantly drop in the number of individuals that go to those tourist destinations during like the seasons where people go in large numbers, we still think that the impact of individuals being laid off is still mitigated on their side.

We say that the act of tourism itself is something that constitutes a harm to the environment that it's actually partaking in. We say that when scuba divers go into the waters of the Guadalupe Islands, we think using things such as attractants and cages actually harms the species that exist within those waters. We think there's an extended harm, therefore, when you have the variety of people, a large number of people actively dumping cages into the waters of Guaranupe. We've seen this happen when there's a large mass of people that walk within the Great Wall of China, which has necessitated two-thirds of it to be unfit for tourism because of the structural damage that they've incurred. Why do we think this is true? We say that the more that you have all about tourism and the high influx of people that actually damage this infrastructure, it makes it increasingly difficult for these governments to maintain them. And we think this is something that becomes harmful for three reasons. Therefore, we think, firstly, the damage to these sites in most instances is irreversible. This is to say that two-thirds of the Great Wall of Chima are still closed down today. We think the same happens with the Guadalupe Islands where they got closed in the early years of 2023, two dates they haven't been reopened. The harm, therefore, is that if they value the employment that you get from tourism, we think when you have over-tourism, you are likely to get a complete closure of those infrastructure in the instance that there's an extensive damage on the infrastructure a complete closure of those infrastructure in the instance that there is an overt damage or like there is an extensive damage on the infrastructure that they have within that particular site. What that means is that you are unable in the long term to continue to have that employment that they value on their site so much. I think this is something that they need to consider because I think in the long term these tourist sites are unable to provide the type of employment and infrastructural support that they want. But secondly, we say that there's an extended harm even on the environment itself. We say that the cruise ships that land in the beaches of Venice particularly harm the damage, like the water supply that you get within those particular cities. We say in cities like Bali, within Indonesia, when you have a lot of cruise ships actually polluting the waters, what that means is that individuals that exist within that city don't have access to clean water. What is this to say? We think this is an extended harm that only happens when you have over-tourism. Why? Because we think that when you have less cruise ships going to those particular cities, you are likely to have manager performs of pollution within the waters that exist within Venice. We think that's the comparative there so what it means that you have less spending on like we have less spending on like actually accounting for the harms of tourism but rather spending into the infrastructure that you actually have within those cities we think this is something that you then get within that what is this to say he said that the extended harm on that environment itself is something that constitutes a harm to the how to how individuals are able to end that life within those cities. We say that when individuals can get access to clean water, we think the government should prioritize those individuals having that access as opposed to having like pleasantries from tourism. We think this is something that they needed to prioritize. But that you say that there's even an extended harm within the sense of security within these cities. This is to say that an increase in the large populations in cities such as Paris and Barcelona has led to a spike in crime rates within those cities. We think individuals or the locals don't feel safe because there's always large crowds parading within the streets that have led to instances of high crime within those cities, right? What is this to say? We think that government therefore is also necessitated to increase their spending on ensuring security for tourists that go to those cities, but also for the locals that exist within those cities. And we think that's an extended harm that side opposition needs to take care of within their side of the page. We think this is something that they need to engage. But then before I get to how significant limitations solve these problems, I'll take you. For this point, work, you have to explain why the alternative measures don't work with people both."

                "text": "Alright, so we think that the alternative measures don't particularly work because we think that in your case you already show how, for example, promoting people going for off-season tourism particularly means that you still have individuals particularly being limited in numbers because we don't see how individuals can go to off-season when they still have the opportunity to go in-season, right, when they go on holidays. We don't see how individuals can go to off-season when they still have the opportunity to go in-season, right, where they go on holidays. We don't see how you're able to achieve that without limiting individuals from going to those tourist destinations during the seasons, right? But second, we say in your regulation, you actually remove the essence of tourism itself. We don't think you can be a scuba diver when you are not allowed to enter the waters of cages and shoot like the species that you want to explore from a distance. We think tourism itself loses its essence in that instance. We think this is something that you need to consider. But why do significant limitations actually solve this problem? First, we say that less participation within the acts of tourism per day limits the amount of harm individuals can inflict on the environment, limits the amount that individuals can inflict on those particular tourist sites. To say that you don't have to close down the Inca Trail in cities like Peru because of the amount of damage that you have within those cities. I think this is something that you needed to consider. But lastly, we said that the moment that government doesn't attend to the uproar of these protesters, it's likely to escalate. In the early 2000s, people were carrying banners. Today, people are throwing stones at tourists. We're all for the government's response."

So, firstly, in terms of repair, what do they tell us about our arguments? So, firstly, they tell us that people are, they tell us that none of our economic benefits are valuable at the point at which you're not getting proper wages, right? We think that you are getting proper wages for two reasons, right? So, firstly, local business owners have empathy towards people who are from their own region, from their country, right? Secondly, employees just work more productively when they are satisfied in their wage at the point at which you are making a ton of money off of tourists. The benefit that you get from your employees being fast, being able to out-compete other restaurants because they're satisfied, because they're able to afford nice meals and everything and not be malnourished, so they can't get the food there on time. We think that that benefit far outweighs the money that you would be paying them at the point at which you're making so much. Secondly, what else do they tell us? They tell us that our benefits to infrastructure do not matter because most of the money is spent on maintenance. Note that this is not true. Most of the money is spent on establishing the infrastructure in the first place. Because often, places that have a lot of tourism are not very well connected. They are not super interconnected with other regions, which is why they're unique, which is why they have so much tourism in their first place, right? And obviously, the most cost comes when you're first laying that rope. Retouching it costs much less. So the benefits are way, way bigger because of tourism. Without tourism, governments simply don't have an incentive to do this, often because, again, these regions are not inherently super-connected through other regions, through other areas of the economy."

                "text": "Okay, now on rebuttal. What do they give us on their principle, right? They give us, well, it's not really a principle, but they mostly give us analysis on why people hate tourists, why there's so much conflict between locals and tourists. Firstly, we think this is grossly exaggerated, because if people were really throwing rocks at tourists everywhere, and I think tourists would pretty quickly be told about this by other tourists, by their friends and family, read about it on the internet, they would stop coming there gradually, right? I am not sure why the government needs to intervene here and suddenly cut tourism down, just suddenly creating a vacuum in the economy. We see that this has happened before when tourists feel unsafe, as they tell you that they do in these situations. For instance, in Egypt, when there was a lot of terrorism, tourists stopped coming pretty quickly. So if they really want tourists to stop coming, then that's already going to happen anyways. There's no reason to enforce this actively. But secondly, we don't think that this just happens a lot. We think that a lot of people depend on tourism. For instance, in Bali, as we told you, where 60% of the population works in tourism, I'm unsure why these people would be throwing rocks at the very people who pay them. Before I continue, I'll take a POI, yes. As we were already showing, I think that normal-time tourist destinations don't make it much money. How do you ensure that normal-time can continue to maintain their status in tourism? Okay. So, yeah. I'll be getting to this in a second. Now, secondly, yeah. Secondly, on this principle, please note that if they really care about the locals' wishes, I'm not sure why they would not be respecting those wishes Because those wishes are what prompted them to get into the tourism sector in the first place, to welcome tourists I am unsure why they would want to limit their autonomy in this case"

                "text": "Secondly, on their argument about the environment, what do they tell us? First off, tourists go scuba diving and shoot fish. I think it's a bit ridiculous, panel, because generally governments are not going to allow people to destroy the very nature that they are profiting off of via tourism. There are fines in place, there's often jail time. This includes both things like natural resources but also cultural heritage. We see that the person who defiled the Rome Coliseum recently got actual jail time for it. And that's just drawing graffiti on an old building. Secondly, please note that it is necessary to have tourists for conservation. For instance, national parks let in tourists so that they can finance upkeep, so that they can hire people to stop poaching or to stop overfishing, which are the real biggest threats to these communities, right? We see globally that the biggest damage to the environment comes not from, like, several tourists, you know, going diving. I'm not sure why this would happen. It is from people fishing illegally in areas that are already depleted of biodiversity, right? But secondly, yeah, it's also just really expensive to hire specialists in, like, for instance, restoring frescoes or keeping thousand-year-old concrete intact, right? And thirdly, even if there is damage, we think that it's less important that these things are perfectly preserved, for instance, in the case of cultural heritage like the Great Wall of China, and that their value, their cultural value is transmitted. Because here in Serbia, for instance, a major source of cultural heritage like the Great Wall of China, and that their value, their cultural value, is transmitted. Because here in Serbia, for instance, a major source of tourism is monasteries. But all these monasteries have a ton of restoration done on them. This doesn't make them any less valuable. It doesn't make them any less attractive. Because the point is not whether the rocks are the same ones that were placed there 100 years ago. It's why they were built, what culture they represent, and what they can teach us about history. Before I continue, I'll take another PYS. If the assumption is that no jobs are of tourism, what is the incentive to pay high wages when there is more supply than demand?"

                "text": "Yeah, that's basically it. Okay now on our extension about About why tourism is actively decreasing inequality I will give you two reasons as to why it is more equal than other areas of the economy So firstly tourism's primary resource is culture culture that cannot be monopolized and it cannot be bought. It originates within masses and is an expression of their way of life. It allows the poor to transform their hitherto invisible cultural capital into monetary capital to improve their lives. Poverty solutions like hot pots become unique, authentic specialty dishes. The traditional songs of fishermen and beggars, shunned as crude and unbecoming by locals for generations, become expressions of the most beautiful emotions. They can sing these in tourist areas for massive tips in dollars or in bars for a regular wage. Cave homes built into a mountainside or thatched-roof houses are transformed into miracles of resilience and unstated beauty. Real estate in the most impractical or secluded areas of a region skyrocket in value because their limitations have given them unique characteristics that set them apart from anywhere else in the world because this is attractive to tourists. Whether locals begin charging for tours or sell their houses to rich proprietors for tons of money, that money is probably pretty significant to these poor people who have never had access to any kind of proper working standards, but it's probably pretty affordable to rich proprietors, their economic but also social status is elevated immediately. This reduces economic inequality, but it also erases absolute standards of living. And note that this takes place regardless of whether rich people are able to replicate elements of culture. Tourism is a search for authenticity in the face of an ever-globalizing world. Tourists are going to want to go to the places where real people live, not just a replica of the city that they just came from. So what we have told you so far is that if you want to care for the people in the favelas like they talk about, the key is not to reduce tourism because, okay, first off, they never analyze why like tourist goods such as like, you know, you know, going to restaurants or like ready-made food, are the same goods that the people need. I'm unsure why powdered milk is something that tourists need en masse, so I'm not sure why the prices would rise that massively. In any case, we really want to care about these people. Please vote opposition. Thank you very much. For the second time this is Mason."

They said that if these areas are so bad, there will be a gradual decrease. We don't think that it's gradual. If people are having stones thrown at them, nobody is going to want to go to Venice, nobody is going to want to go to Barcelona. So I think the comparative here is that we reduce tourism now and we allow tourism to be sustainable for future. Instead of 100,000 individuals coming at one time in the year, we have 5,000 individuals coming in every single month of the year because the demand is too inelastic. So people are still going to come, but the locals won't be bad. On this side of the house, when individuals see that stones are being thrown at them, they are going to stop going to Venice. The idea here then becomes that all of the economic harms which they talk about happen on their side. The second reason why they can't access economic harms is specifically for natural tourist destinations. If these areas are degraded beyond use and nobody wants to go to them like the Great Wall of China where two-thirds of it are beyond use, like the Guadalupe Islands where they had to be closed because only eight fur seals remained because tourists were causing these seals to die. That is when we have the tourism sector completely dying. It is only on their side. We think they have to contend with this if they want to argue economic benefits. We think we are winning on that front. But finally, going on to Clash Matter, my first Clash Matter debate is where are we better for the tourism industry?"

                "text": "Before I move on, I'll take a point. So, what do you think is the incentive for landlords to rent out exclusively to tourists who, if they mess something up, can just go back to their country and then make the process soon then extremely difficult? Well, one, as you have analysed in all of your speeches, tourists have more money and are willing to pay more money. But two, I just don't think it's true that somebody can break my house and it will be really difficult for me to sue them. I think the legal system can cross through countries. The part would be called back to go into court. I don't understand the importance of that. First clash here. Where are we better for destinations? Three parts here. Firstly, on regulation. We already proved to you why regulations are not effective. We tell you that, one, there is something which makes the enjoyment less possible. For example, if you aren't allowed to do certain things at tourist destinations, like take photos of fish because you disturb them, of course that is going to be something which makes individuals not want to enjoy them. The comparative there on their side of the house is that they say that we're going to regulate. We try that this regulation doesn't work several times throughout all of our speeches. They need to prove to us why this regulation is able to work. They need to contend on that. But secondly, on the idea of sustainable tourism, we already try that the tourism on our side of the house is still going to exist. Individuals are still going to have jobs in tourism, they're just going to be on a lower scale. The impact of this then becomes that on our side of the house there's an incentive for the economy to diversify. Individuals are going to invest into making factories, into creating farms, into creating all of these other jobs which individuals can enjoy. All the comparative individuals are stuck in this cycle where they have to be in tourism? They have no other choice. But secondly, which other tourism is eventually going to fall on their side of the house? When tourism does fall, it will be an extremely stark shift. Nobody will have a job with that very much regrettable. Finally, we have to talk about the incentive to develop. We told you in first that the only reason we're going to get things like virtual tourism is when real tourism doesn't exist. We tell you that when there's more of an incentive to diversify your forms of tourism, to partake in things like eco-tourism, that is when you get tourism developed as an industry. Whereas in the comparative, when all of these tourists are coming physically, there is no incentive to change. We think that that is going to be much worse on their side. We think the reason why we're winning on this level of tourism is because we proved to you that, one, we get sustainable tourism. Two, we get development of the form of tourism on the side of the house, they get none of those. But secondly, on the environment, we told you in second that there's high levels of pollution. When there's high levels of pollution, people suffer. If the water is contaminated, I'm going to get sick. If I'm sick, I can't work a job. That's something which is so regrettable. My children don't get to go to school. But this doesn't only affect the tourism industry because in Bali, anybody who wants to drink water"

                "text": "three two things here, on the principle. We already told you that the hatred that these locals have is directly tied to the existence of tourists. It particularly looks like when it's overcrowding, when individuals are noisy, when they're polluting your waters, when they're disrespecting your culture, you are angry at them. We don't particularly understand why these individuals are going to be so happy at these tourists. We have forced them into a cycle of poverty. We have forced them to work these tourist jobs where they don't get a lot of money, as I already proved to you in my POI to them, because there is so much supply for this. Like if everybody wants to get a tourist job, I don't particularly understand why they are all going to be paid such high wages. Like fair and fine, maybe people will be empathetic, but I don't think that empathy is going to supersede capitalism. Capitalism is a system where you want to make money, people are going to give you minimum wage, within hours of your importance there. But moreover, we think that on the economic clash, we've told you quite a few things. In terms of price increases, we've said there's going to be universal price increases. Without that, the groceries are going to increase, individuals can't afford to buy birth control, individuals can't afford to buy birth formula for their children, their children are going to suffer, their children are going to starve. Secondly, individuals are going to be displaced. So even if they do get this level for their children. Their children are going to suffer. Their children are going to starve. Secondly, individuals are going to be displaced. So even if they do get this level of investment, only the tourists are going to benefit because the investment is going to be centralized on these tourist areas. On the comparative, locals are moved to the outskirts where there's no education, where there's no hospitals. This is very regrettable. So even in the best case, where there is investment, we make a useless investment when the locals don't benefit. What is the contention here? We already proved to you why investment is unlikely to happen because this money has to either go into maintaining these areas or into then investment. I would think if these areas aren't maintained, it is going to fall anyway. So again, we need to get a choice. Before I move on, I'll take one more. What are the incentives then on your side to actually develop infrastructure and maintain things that are not making any money? To create jobs. At a point in time in which you create factories and you create industry, people can get jobs. That is why the government does anything. Like, for example, in other countries where there isn't a tourist sector, people still have jobs. The government still performs their basic role. I don't particularly understand why the government suddenly becomes an evil actor who does nothing for the people just because there aren't tourists coming into the area. But even if that was true, we think it's very regrettable that the government is only doing things for tourists and is ignoring the local people. We think that is an evil government which we can't support. Finally, where are we better for tourists? Two things here. One, on the experience. We thought that when there's less tourists visiting, the experience overall better there's less overcrowding there's this noise pollution there's this whole growth pollution so those 5 000 tourists who are going to be going throughout all 12 months are going to be enjoying enjoying this tourism more they will be willing to spend more money when that is good but second in turn they're going to be better able to appreciate the culture because these 1 000 tourists can go with the tour guide and actually can learn things about this culture whereas on the comparative if there's 100,000 tourists, nothing is really going to happen on that front. Nobody's going to learn anything. What do we bring you on site provision? We bring you a safe hold. We appease the locals and we keep tourism safe. We are the winning side. We are proud. Thank you.

                "text": "case now. What did we tell you? Firstly, note that we tell you that we create jobs, right? We have two responses to this. Firstly, all that is low wages. Finally, we know that this is likely better than the alternative, right? In most of these regions, the alternative is, for example, living in, working in a factory, an efficient job, whatever. Note firstly that these wages are likely to be higher because we are better able to regulate this, right? That is, at the moment that you have big companies such as the marriott there's uh there's more international attention on them these companies are often based in the west therefore we are actually able to regulate that the that they are in fact paying these workers a minimum wage even if we are taking proposition at their absolute best and they say and saying that they are only going to get a minimum wage at least we are able to ensure that they actually get a minimum wage they have no means to do that at the moment that these locals are likely going to be working in sweatshops otherwise. Secondly, even if you do have a low wage, I mean, you get a massive amount of tips from tourists, right? That is, if you are a tourist, it is very customary to tip people in a hotel, to tip people in restaurants. This might seem very small to you, but if you're thinking that these tourists usually tip in euros and dollars, that foreign currency has a massive value if you convert it to the local currency right these tips are usually make up a massive percentage of these people's salary of these people incomes by dropping them of this they no longer are able to afford their basic needs secondly they tell you that this work is only in high season even if that is the case then they rely on that income to get through the rest of the year, right? Okay, on to infrastructure then. Before that, I'll take a POI. Even if it is true that significant limitation causes jobs to decrease, it's not better for governments to control this than for it to happen abruptly when the area either becomes unlivable or people no longer want to go there. Yeah, okay. So, a couple of responses to this, right? Firstly, notice uncertainty. They've never actually given us any analysis as to why this is the case, right? That is, sure, you see beaches on Hawaii eroding. However, Hawaii is still known for its beautiful nature. Even if it's not, it's still known as like an historically beautiful place to visit. Therefore, these people are still going to visit it, right? Sure, Rome has been vandalized. Rome sells a massive historical status as a beautiful place to visit. It's still going to be popular even 20 years from now. They've never given any sort of likelihood analysis as to why this is actually going to happen, right? But also, intuition check. If you see a child on a balance beam and you think that there's a chance that they're going to fall, is it intuitive to then push them over? No, obviously not. That is exactly what proposition is doing. Secondly, on infrastructure then. They say that this money is going to be purely doing secondly on infrastructure then they say that this money is going to be purely spent on maintenance therefore they don't benefit firstly note that tourists often pay taxes directly to the infrastructure they use right for example road taxes are really common for tourists to pay therefore we think that there's going to be enough left but secondly note that you can uniquely get fdi to develop these regions and attract them for example foreign companies coming in and setting up internet because that attracts tourists. No, there's infrastructure you cannot get from any other industry. That moves me on to my second point of analysis, as to why even if other industries are going to be developed on their side, why tourism is a uniquely better industry for these locals, right? Firstly, on labour, note that tourism is uniquely very dependent on human labor that is under industries such as fishing such as um like factories for example you're very easily able to replace that with machines therefore on tourism you get actually these jobs being filled by human labor rather than being placed by machines secondly on infrastructure tourism is the only industry where that infrastructure also benefits locals. A factory being set up in your city does not benefit you. A road being set up in your city or internet being set up in your city does benefit you. Those are two unique benefits that we get on our side of the house. At the end of the day, panel, note that at the end of the day, panel, we already take this cash massively because your economic well-being as a local has a much more direct impact on your quality of life. That is, even if my beaches are being littered, if I'm living in Indonesia, at least I have money to feed my family. This matters significantly more to me. But if we really care about the environment, not that these funds for preservation are a prerequisite to actually preserving this environment. Beaches erode naturally. We have to fund money to actually preserve these beaches. That is something that opposition can never get. At the end of the day, Paolo, vote for the true well-being of locals, vote opposition."

In the best case, tourists are annoying, but in great quantities, they are a scourge to the earth. Two arguments in the proposition case. Firstly, improving the life of the locals. And secondly, reshaping travel culture and combating climate change. Now, into the frame. We tell you, PAC, that the locals are the most important stakeholder in the debate. Because they are the people that still have to live in these major tourist destinations even when the tourists leave. They are the people that pay taxes to maintain these destinations. They are also the people that are building these cities throughout generations. They are, most importantly, the people that will have to stay there and deal with whatever consequences the tourists leave afterwards. Therefore, I urge the panel to care the most about locals in this debate. So now, how can we win this debate? Two things. First, we can prove to the panel that locals are better on our side of the house. Or then we can prove to the panel that locals are better on our side of the house, or then we can prove to the panel that climate change is significantly combated on our side of the house. Both ways, by proving either, we will win this debate."

And there will only be a limited amount of passes that are solved within a single time frame."

Three parts in this argument. Firstly, we're telling you that we're directly reducing the disturbance of locals. What do we mean by this? Three parts in this argument. Firstly, we're telling you that we're directly reducing the disturbance of locals. What do we mean by this? We tell you that in excessive amounts of these tourists, there are flooding restaurants, there are flooding streets, there are flooding bars, there are flooding every single part of the city. This makes the lives of the locals extremely hard because it's very hard for me to get to a hospital, for example, to see my mother, if there's an excessive amount of crowd near the Colosseum and I have to get through the Colosseum to the hospital. It's not convenient for the locals. It's not great for the locals. Moreover, these tourists leave a significant amount of trash and litter and all kinds of disposable material behind. Moreover, they also consume much more than these locals. They consume much more plastic. They consume six times the amount of water than the locals consume. And this is not sustainable for these major tourist destination cities. Moreover, there is noise. There's significantly more noise with overcrowdings, with just, you know, the people walking through the streets or the crowd shouting when they see the Eiffel Tower because it's just so great for them. And even, no, you know, the people walking through the streets or the crowd shouting when they see the Eiffel Tower because it's just so great for them. And even, no, thank you, and even if we do not take these examples into consideration, just because I live in an apartment building and my rich neighbor landlord is renting their apartment continuously to tourists, when they continuously rent their Airbnb to tourists that do not care about regulation, that party every single night. It's very hard for me as a student to study for my medical school entrance exam. We tell you that all of these are directly reduced on our side of the house, because just by limiting the sheer quantity of tourists that visit, all of these problems are already significantly reduced on our side of the house. But now, secondly, we're also reducing the indirect harms that these tourists cause to these major tourist destinations. We tell you that these tourists, with their share quantity, they are directly pushing up the prices of all services. This means, for example, food prices, gas, every single thing that you can imagine are going up because there's so many of these tourists in these places that you know Everyone can just charge so much more but we tell you that this still does not benefit the locals Even if opposition tells you that why we tell you that the only people that are actually Benefiting from these are already the wealthy we tell you that it's only the rich landlords, those who have owned this property for already 100 years or big international or regional corporations. It's only these three kinds of people that actually benefit from there because they already own this property in these major, you know, tourist destinations. They have property there and they can rent them with extremely high prices to these local businesses. We tell you that these people will rent with a high price, and this makes the people who actually are in these places, these local business owners, they have to sell at a significantly higher price if they want to make any kind of return or profit from this. And this, again, makes the lives of those who don't do this much harder because you have to now pay at a much higher price. But you don't have this because you are a local. And we tell you that only tourists are able to do this because they are only temporary. They come for a fixed amount of one, two days. They're able to afford this because they think that, okay, I'm going to pamper myself for two days, pay a bit more. It doesn't matter for them. But it matters for these locals that have to stay there even when the tourists leave. That is not true in the status quo. The status quo is so that these tourist destinations, these cities are flooded with tourists everywhere. There is no local or tourist quarter because all of this is a tourist quarter. Everywhere in the city, there is so much demand from the tourists that all of the prices are spiked up. Moreover, we also tell you that this problem manifests even more when you look at housing prices. Because I already gave you the example of people renting more and more Airbnb's because they know that hotels cannot accommodate they simply cannot accommodate all of the people that want to go to paris that want to go to rome that want to go to bernice it's simply they know that they have they can you know rent more and more airbnbs at you know limited amount of time it's for them it's even more profitable to maybe keep them for a few days without anyone leaving living there then you know they are able to do that and you know still rent at a much higher price and, you know, still rent at a much higher price because when they know, when someone rents it, it's so much more profitable this way than to rent for a longer period of time for, you know, a local."

We tell you that tourists will want to come as long as the Eiffel Tower is there, as long as the Eiffel Tower is in good condition, and on their side of the house, because they do not want to limit, because they do nothing to stop the deterioration of these, tourists will, in the future, not even want to come to these places, and therefore, even whatever beneficial economic impacts that they are providing"

In our second speech we will explain how this motion leads to massive loss of current and future infrastructure. But first some responses regarding the quantity of tourists versus the quantity of tourists. On our side, we still can have and likely will have regulations and incentives for tourists to behave well. These also rebut all of your points. Note, panel, that the proposition cannot claim we have no regulations on our side of the house. We simply do not regulate the number of tourists, which does not mean we do not regulate certain behaviors. In the status quo, we see that regulation of behaviors is happening. A. Barcelona is banning Airbnbs, which rebutts all their point about housing prices. B. As we have seen in Copenhagen and Japan, they are offering perks like free lunches for tourists who use public transportation, who participate in cleanup activities, or support local businesses. Also, it rebuts the whole environment part. D, or we see that they are limiting the hours where alcohol can be bought to reduce bad behavior. E, we also see that there are stricter regulations and are being implemented, and there are increased fines for littering or damaging cultural sites, which are directly used for resuscitation or upkeep the very same. So these regulations are voting issues and popular among locals, which is the reason they are implemented."

                "text": "Moving up to my first argument, the lack of viable alternative industries. We see this because of geographic constraints. Most of these countries simply do not have anything else to offer. So they have no minerals to mine, they have infertile land, they have multiple regions that are hard to access. Prop would need to explain why any ship is feasible and most countries would have the geographical ability. So second, there's no incentives for companies to establish themselves in these regions. A, in many countries you have comparatively higher tax rates and workers' rights. For example, Ireland, which is a tax hub and has very low tax rates compared to any other European country or Asian country. B, therefore, it is very easy for companies to move to a place where they don't pay taxes, like Ireland, for example, or Bangladesh, where you don't have any workers' rights. So in countries like Italy, it is way harder to establish yourself. Our third point is investor trust. Because there are tourism-specific investments, you have first a lack of high-speed internet, you have lack of heavy-duty roads, and your priorities easy and quick to build roads for tourist purposes. You have lack of industrial ports because beaches were prioritized. Four, you have localized skills and knowledge gap. Hali specializes workforce which needs to be re-educated to fit in a new industry. A. The workforce in these tourist-centric regions has developed skills specifically tailored to the tourism industry. Tour guides, hotel managers and cultural event coordinators possess skills that are directly tied to local tourism. So B. There is a lack of knowledge for new sectors. Developing alternative industries would require new skills and expertise that the local population currently lacks, for example, programming, mining or fishing. This is expensive and relies on the cooperation of the local people which is not guaranteed. We believe the fear of economic instability bothers the willingness and the ability of individuals to invest in learning skills. This means even if taxes and worker's rights would not be the problem, the local infrastructure and population will. We think it is unlikely that government should be able to attract and lobby companies and investors to move there. Historically, they are a huge competitive disadvantage against other countries who have worked on this relationship for decades and also they have way less to offer them because infrastructure, as I already mentioned, wasn't built and the knowledge was focused on tourism. This means that investors are not going to want to invest before these accommodations are built. And without investment, it is unlikely they will be able to build them. Because at the same time, the tourist countries are missing out on their biggest income, which is tourism. Especially if we look at the investment on a comparative, we are losing out on massive amounts of money. Currently, there is high investor trust in these regions because they have huge amounts of people coming in and the direction is increasing. Before I move on to my second argument, I will take it away."

                "text": "Argument two, massive unemployment and economic regression. How does this happen? We have direct job losses. The tourism industry directly employs millions in sectors such as hospitality, transportation and retail. Significantly reductions in numbers mean significant amount of people will lose their jobs. There are less customers, less visitors, and less clients. So we also have indirect job losses because tourism supports numerous of other industries such as agriculture, this means food supplies for restaurants, and manufacturing goods for tourists. The loss of tourism would ripple through the supply chain. Also, third point is financial burden on the state. We would have massive unemployment benefits and business support needed. The state would need to provide unemployment benefits to displaced workers and provide business and previous business owners. This would strain public finances. This would require reallocating budget resources and impacting public services like healthcare and education. This is especially bad at the same time you significantly limit the biggest income source of the government, which is tourism. So, then we have a psychological and social impact. The fear and uncertainty. Even a slow implementation of tourist limits would create fear and uncertainty among the local population, undermining confidence in economic stability. This is crucial because the development of new industries is dependent on people spending money on this new industry and supporting its development. Why will this not be the case? A. People fear the unknown. They have worked in tourism for decades. Their whole family is specialized in it. This means when the government passes this policy, they will fear for their existence even if the government promises unemployment benefits or other compensation. First, people are often mistrustful of politicians and promises because they are rarely keep them. Second, also they cannot imagine how else the government could get money if not through tourism. This leads to people behaving extremely risk-averse, and they will only spend money on their very basic necessaries because they are saving money for hard times to come. This includes additional education. So note that the basic for economic growth is that people are willing to spend money on goods and services. The more people spend, the more money is circulated and added to the economy. This means that people can have jobs and pay employees. If the amount of money is now significantly restricted because we limit tourism significantly, people start hoarding and saving money rather than spending. This leads to a nationwide regression. This means even if some other industry was planned to develop, it will not be able to do so because people will be unwilling to spend money on goods and services from that industry. And investors will not want to invest in a regressive economy because it is extremely unstable and violent. Never be proud of your course. I'm going to ask you to not hold this. I'm going to ask you to sit down. Will it be possible for me to be able to hear you?"

So, what will tourists do now that there are these major restrictions? What will happen? We here in Team Proposition have identified approximately three types of travelers. Number one, those who will go anyway to these major tourist destinations, right? Number two, those who will go somewhere else, either within the country or within some other country or within their own country. And three, those who simply will not go. Number one, those who will go anyways. We have to remember that despite the fact that these restrictions still exist, despite the fact that we are putting restrictions on, people can still go to these locations. We have to remember the example of Venice, right? Venice has implemented these restrictions, but there are still millions of amateurs who go there every day. Who go there at all times, right? Simply because we are limiting the amount of tourists doesn't mean that they won't go. Not to mention that because we have this entrance fee, which team opposition doesn't seem to want to talk about, it means that we can still uphold the economy of the city, and we can still help these tourists, we can still help these tourist industries, and they will still get their money. Not to mention that with this entrance fee, we can also ensure that these major cultural sites can uphold themselves, that they have the money to invest into themselves so that they are not eroded due to the amount of tourists that go there. Not to mention that now that there is no more over-tourism, now that there is no more over-crowding, these natural sites and these very important cultural artifacts can stay and that they can stay and they will not be eroded due to the massive amounts of people that go there every day. For example, when it comes to the Greek islands, a very big problem with the Greek islands right now is that their vineyards are slowly dying, right? Because there's simply so many people going there every day. There's simply so many people visiting these sites every day. And it is estimated that by 2045, the Greek islands will no longer have vineyards, simply because of the fact that there are so many tourists that go there all the time, who stomp on those places, who stomp on them, make the soil worse, and generally do not let the vineyards breathe. Which is not just destroying the natural beautiful sights of these islands, but also destroying a wine industry."

Now that people cannot or do not want to go to major tourist destinations, they can still go to other places in the country. They can still go to smaller towns. They can still travel to other places, meaning that even if they do not go to Paris, they can go to other places in France. A lot of people want to go to Paris because it's French, right? Because they see it as the French capital. Because they see it as the culture capital of France. However, now that they might not want to go to these places because of these restrictions, it's still very possible that those people who wanted to go to Paris because it's French culture will still be interested in going to other places in France, meaning that these since it's still very possible that those people who wanted to go to Paris because it's French culture will still be interested in going to other places in France, meaning that these jobs that the opposition is so worried about can simply continue in these smaller locations, which will now also have more tourists in them.

And what we have to do is try and combat it in any way that we can. And something that we have to remember is that in order to make big change, we first have to take small steps, right? And we believe that limiting the amount of people who can go to these first destinations, limiting travel in general, is a very good way of taking that first step. Because one of the major reasons of climate change is due to the fact that we are simply, is that we are consuming too much, we are spending too much, we are living these extravagant lives without thinking about what it does to the ecosystem, without thinking about what it does to these areas. And this small change of limiting who can go can in the future lead to bigger precedents. Not to mention that this small change is fixing a massive issue for locals, right? As we talked about within our first speech, it is fixing the problem of overcrowding, it is fixing the problem of these places being too expensive, it is fixing the problem of locals not being able to properly live their lives in these cities where they grew up, in these cities in which they pay taxes to, in these cities in which they have so much emotional attachment to. We believe that this is one of the best ways in order to ensure that not only these cities have the best upkeep for themselves, but also that the locals can stay within their communities and can have this national pride within their beautiful places. And because of all these reasons, we are so happy to propose, because we believe that even with these small steps, we can make big changes. Even with these small steps, we can do so much good within the world not only for the cities for locals but also for the environment thank you All right. We don't limit people, we limit hearts."

You significantly have less tourists because you limit them. This means you have significantly less workers. These major destinations heavily rely on the tourism sector, and the millions of tourists they are missing will also result in millions of workers being now unemployed, which is a huge harm to these locals you characterize as the most vulnerable and important stakeholders. So, you also point out that your entrance fee is enough for the economy, but you agree that millions of tourists are less on your side, so how high would your entrance fee have to be? A million times as high? This is just simply unrealistic on your side, and you are not facing the economical harms that my first speaker has mentioned quite thoroughly. Second of all, I think you agree that regulations can mitigate many of the harms. Then why would you voluntarily face the huge economic harms of significantly limiting the tourism if you could also mitigate these harms with the regulations and penalties for violation or reward programs for good behavior that we have mentioned in our speech."

                "text": "Second point of rebuttal on the pricing being spiked by mass tourism. I told you on my POI this is simply untrue and locals are actually profiting from charging more to the tourists because the spheres where tourists and citizens compete for services is limited. What do I mean by that? First of all, different consumption patterns lead to limited overlap in high-demand goods. For example, tourists don't buy a significant quantity of basic goods or utilities, but rather go to fancy restaurants, souvenirs, and local artifacts. There is no shortage in the goods the locals actually need, which means the price stays quite constant. Second of all, in the rare case that they do compete, as you mentioned, housing and transport, there are easy implementations on our side taken to separate the competition. First of all, differentiate it through a pricing system, where, for example, citizens and local students have passes in public transport to pay less. Politicians that implement this, as my first speaker has explained, are extremely popular, which means this issue will be likely solved through voting. Second, tourists just pay more for attractions, like fish markets in Barcelona, taxis, restaurants in Asia, or Thailand's national parks, which means the revenue is reinvested in the same industry, so the infrastructure or the buses or the drivers are just upgraded so the locals aren't harmed because this balances out due to the more money they get from the tourists. Third of all, tourists prefer convenience, so they will opt for private transport options like a rental car, and this reduces the strain on public transport, so there's not really an overlap. On the housing issue, tourists often seek accommodations near major attractions, not in the residential areas, so this is not an actual problem. Second, if too much overlap happens, measures will be taken, as we see in Barcelona, banning Airbnb, and then government will likely implement seams to offer registered housing offers for the tourists, so they can, again, control the accessibility and pricing and free of housing for the locals. So this is, once again, mitigated. And even in the worst case where locals now have to drive a bit further to get to the next big local store, the money and benefits they earn from selling to all these high volumes of mass tourists more expensively just simply outweighs this minor possible part. Now, on"

                "text": "the point of vulnerable locals, we have to focus on where the delta is between mass tourism and your side of tourism. On your side, we have basically exclusively large chains like the Crowne Plaza, Hilton, McDonald's, that still exist because of market dominance and economies of scale. Comparatively, on our side, we additionally have support and opportunity for small and family-run businesses, hotels, and restaurants. Why is this? First of all, this bill will perfect. When major hotels are crowded, fully booked, or too expensive due to high demand, tourists turn to smaller local businesses. This only happens with tourism because of this high threshold. Second of all, economies of scale. Shades offer competitive prices and consistent quality, which small businesses can simply not match without the high volume of tourists frequenting their stores and restaurants and hotels every day. Furthermore, the extended tourism reach, which leads to infrastructure improvements and economic growth in the proximity, which extends beyond the major destinations to nearby smaller towns and coastal areas, as we see in Dubrovnik, where the tourists also go to see the surrounding coastline, but still have Dubrovnik as the main incentive to go there in the first place. Furthermore, reductions in mass urban migration that happens due to this because the establishment of transport lines to these surrounding areas reduces the need and burden for residents to migrate to urban centers in order for better opportunities. So they can commute easily, and this spillover effect also gives them jobs in more places. And these points specifically address your most vulnerable stakeholder. You think the problem for them is overcrowding, but the problem is poverty and unemployment that you cause on your side."

                "text": "Now, on your point on environmental destruction. First of all, if tourism exists on both sides, how does the shift in environmental improvement happen on your side? This is the quality versus quantity thing again, where we explain to you that we have regulations that specifically address the biggest harms that tourists cause and on the other hand we have the resources due to the tax revenue from tourism and incentive and incentive to enforce better um like environmental sustainability because we also want to make this place nicely livable for locals and tourists now rebuttal on limits being beneficial for tourists this is simply not true because first of all on scale you are excluding so many of the people you are visiting. Second of all, it's not beneficial because you lack the high volume of tourist revenue which is necessary to establish and invest and maintain the infrastructure, which I will go into my argument. And then it is just simply more important for the locals. Last point of rebuttal I want to go into before I go into my argument is the culture point. First of all, there is the incentive to keep the culture because it makes it attractive both for tourists and locals. Second, we need the money to get generated from tourism to maintain and even live out this culture. For example, Mexico has cultural festivals where tourists and locals can enjoy the side-by-side, but the locals need the money from tourism to even live and be able to enjoy this. Now, on to my argument why massive loss of infrastructure for current infrastructure and future projects happen. Well, we're losing the tax revenue that is exclusive to tourism because, first of all, they majorly rely on tourism in these destinations, and second, due to the inherent locality of tourism, which means that they cannot relocate to avoid taxes because they're actually specifically located there. And tourism just simply has a high tax revenue because there are so various channels. Hotel taxes, overnight fees, sale taxes on goods and services, and entry fees to attractions. So this is not like a one-time thing as your access fee, but rather the tourists every day going for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or hotel, and buying some expensive souvenirs on the way. So what will the impact be on your side? You simply have a loss of investment as well as a loss of tax revenue and thereby reduced government funding. My first speaker has already explained to you why this is detrimental to the people facing unemployment because the government no longer has the budget and the funds to help them. And second, how this leads to them being super scared and insecure to join with any other sectors, even though these other sectors are unlikely to happen anyway due to all the reasons why tourism is exclusive to these places. But going deeper into my question. Is the state government not so dependent on tourism because they don't deteriorate during the off-season? Of course they are. Major tourist destinations are major tourist destinations. This means they are majorly and significantly reliant on tourism to fund them and to make them, like, that is their main income area. So, where does this income lead to? This income currently is being used for infrastructure development, because mass tourism necessitates improvement for infrastructure, roads, airports, electricity and life airlines, as well as sanitation and waste. As well as, like, healthcare and emergency. You mentioned that crowded hospitals are a problem, but at least we have hospitals on our side because tourism is generating the money to actually build these things in the first place. Second of all, tourism is an incentive for enhanced safety measures because the incentive is on the one hand, the locals want to protect their national heritage and they want a positive reputation for more tourists to come, and they have the capability due to the tax revenue from tourism that we have exclusively on our side on this scale. The result is they hire more police officers, install surveillance cameras, and improve emergency response services. All of these benefits are also accessible to the locals due to the spillover effect I mentioned, simply to the state funding having a higher budget, the auxiliary industry trickle-down effect, and the spaces for progress being established, because we have the money to at least establish the spaces that they can then build on later on. The alternative on your side is not better, and restricting tourism will significantly slow such developments and hinder overall progress in the whole region. We don't limit people, we limit harms."

Maybe it is now that investors don't come in the status quo for any other field in these countries but the tourism field, purely because the tourism is the main field that is profit-giving. Maybe if we limit these major tourist destinations, we are going to finally get proper services, proper businesses that serve locals to the main part, right? Yes. First thing. Secondly, we told you that tourism is still in place. We told you that, yes, we're significantly limiting the amount of tourists. We are. However, firstly, the amount of tourists is still there.

People do not feel good inside in the status quo. People are not feel good in the status quo. People are not benefiting more from the tourist destinations. They said it right in their previous speech. These people are poor. These people are unemployed. And this is because the state does not care for them. They do just develop the area of tourism, forgetting about the services for locals, about their well-being. On your side of the state, it doesn't have the funds to finance these people, and people are massively unemployed because there's less tourists. How are they not having it there?"

They also talked about COVID, and about how tourism collapsed during COVID. And we tell you, sure, it did, but so did the entire world economy, right? And tourism was the first"

And as they actually have said, if you're a tourist, you probably want to splurge on location, meaning you're not likely to stuff yourself into a metro, but you actually take a taxi, meaning if you as a person need, like, as a local need public transport, it likely won't be crowded by tourists as much."

If we do not have Airbnbs, it is likely that the government will have schemes where you have to register these houses officially, which is already happening, right? So even if you want to rent this out, there will be additional taxes, and it will be far more regulated in price. This has two potential impacts. First of all, it's either that less people are ready to go for this, but even if a lot of people go for this, at least we have more money to invest in local people actually benefiting from this as well, right?"

Now, if we limit the amount of people who can visit the Great Wall of China, going there becomes so much more exclusive. And you're so much cooler if you can say, oh, look, I went there, meaning the incentive for you to prove that you actually were there by taking a stone is so much higher than in the status quo where a bunch of people do this and you're not so special because you went to China, right? And we have far more money now, meaning it's far easier to have resource and personnel to supervise these tours. And if they really care about the environment, they have to explain why on their side of the house, anything is better for the environment. Because although they have still not managed to prove that there will be any alternative industry to prevent this mass unemployment, let's say they would actually have done this. Then they would still not have been able to prove why any other industry is better, right? Look, how is mining good for the environment? How is animal agriculture good for the environment? It is absolutely not. And if a lot of jobs are dependent on any other industry, like for example mining, it is very hard to bring in regulations like making mining more eco-friendly. However, with tourism, it is very, very easy to make minor adjustments, like for example, offering people free lunch so that they help in beach cleanups, which is far harder to do in any other industry, right? And we're telling you that countries already have preemptive measures, like rewarding tourists for being, like for clean up or something. And even if only 1% ups in because of the scale we get in our sense of the house, that's still a lot of people who are doing positive stuff, like for example, beach cleanups, right?

And secondly, in cases where it's really, really so bad, again, we have other regulations, like erosion, we just tell, like, we just put policemen there and tell the tourists, hey, please don't litter, which is easier to do in our sense of the house, because now we actually have more capital in order to finance this sort of surveillance.

On their side of the house, you only have crown plaza because there's no need for local business because crown plaza is not as expensive um as it is on our side of the house we're also telling you that on scale the large scale of tourists allows for so much monetary gain which contributes so much to the local economy right on proposition the severity of impact is so much worse because workers do lose jobs and people are not willing to spend money as pointed out in first speech meaning all the areas of the economy suffer.

Second one, on economy and how we win here on scale. You say there's still some tourism jobs, but like, let's look at it. If there's one of 100 people that still have a job and the rest no longer have jobs but face unemployment and uncertainty and fear but no longer have noise complaints. This just does not weigh up to the most beneficial economy of tourism which gives them all employment, which gives their state money, which stabilizes the prices for locals and oftentimes Dubrovnik finances the whole of Croatia's sanitation system with their tourism revenue. This is something we can only achieve on scale on our side. I think that is also the logical fallacy where you point out that locals pay taxes.
