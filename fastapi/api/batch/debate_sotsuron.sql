(1, 0, 0, 1, 'Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen in this house. Our side believes that we want to protect most moral people, every people, so every innocent people. And now another thing that\'s called the technology of hacking system or security camera is developing now and police can capture surprise information in the group of terrorists. So, thanks to those things, we can search those terrorists\' move and act. ', 1),
(2, 1, 1, 2, 'And the payment of ransom is money source of terrorist and criminal group. Huge rate of money source is ransom. Plus, criminal is very malicious. So, in many cases, even if victim\'s side pays huge money to the terrorist group and criminal groups, the victim will be killed by them. This is a very major case, but the family wants to protect their own family or own child, so they give money.', 1),
(3, 2, 2, 3, 'Okay, let\'s move on to my argument. I have two arguments in this round. Firstly, I\'d like to talk about long-term benefits, capturing those terrorists\' source of money. And secondly, to save all people and victims, this plan is a very efficient way. ', 1),
(4, 3, 3, 4, 'Before, I want to define this motion. This house means all liberal democratic country. And when a criminal requests ransom from individual victims, family, or government or bank, in all situations, we criminalize the payment of ransom.', 1),
(5, 4, 4, 5, 'Okay, let\'s move on to my argument. Firstly, I\'d like to talk about the long-term benefits. Under the status quo, family strongly love the child or they have a very great memory from the child, so they strongly want to save, right? So, suddenly, they give money to terrorist groups. They are very confused about the situation; it\'s a crazy situation. So, they easily do without concern with police or specialists, so they cannot judge this system objectively. ', 1),
(6, 5, 5, 6, 'So, in the rare case, they are very rich, so they can give the money. Another rare case, they are poor, they rent from the black market or something, not so good source of the money, comes to the poor family\'s house, and this money goes to the terrorist groups. So, terrorists get a huge source of money. ', 1),
(7, 6, 6, 7, 'Why is it so big harm? Because if the terrorists have huge money, they can buy more weapons, such as guns and more harmful drugs or something, so they can expand power easily if they have more money. So, worse accidents will occur due to the money. So, we want to stop this source.', 1),
(8, 7, 7, 8, 'After taking this plan, we criminalize this payment of ransom. So, reduce payment. Many people don\'t want to criminalize the ransom, so they can see this situation more objectively, and this is criminalized. So, if I give the money, it is criminalized, so we should consult with specialists or police. ', 1),
(9, 8, 8, 9, 'So, in that case, police can effectively solve the situation because they have the technology, as I mentioned in the introduction, hacking or searching through the security camera, we can effectively search the terrorists and arrest them. So, in this case, we believe that long term, we can arrest the terrorists and save more, not expand the harm for another people and worse case.', 1),
(10, 9, 9, 10, 'And secondly, I would like to explain why this plan can effectively save more people than now. So, as I mentioned in the introduction, even just paying of ransom to terrorist groups, this money, in the end, the terrorist is very malicious, so they kill or request more money. So, this request is not cut by only one request of ransom, so this ransom cannot save the victims, surely. ', 1),
(11, 10, 10, 11, 'And also, as I mentioned again and again, this money is very harmful to society because worse accidents occur and also the individual family and victims cannot save thanks to ransom. So, we strongly believe that ransom is meaningless for saving the individual victims and also it is very harmful for the society. In this viewpoint, we strongly propose this motion and I am happy to propose. Thank you.', 1),
(12, 11, 11, 12, 'Ladies and gentlemen, what the government says is that the reason why we have to prosecute the terrorists is that because they killed the citizens. They murdered the citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, we think that because we know that in order not to concede the terrorists, they are going to sacrifice the citizens. We believe that it is not very counterproductive if the fundamental purpose was against terrorism. ', 2),
(13, 12, 12, 13, 'So, before landing on my argumentation, I have to talk about something about the science department.', 2),
(14, 13, 13, 14, 'Firstly, we have to confirm that the resource for the terrorists does not necessarily come from the nation itself. Ladies and gentlemen, for example, the income of the ISIS does not come from the oil field they took or the donation from some assistance to these kinds of terrorist groups. We think that in those cases, it is very unclear from the government\'s argumentation how to what extent the existence of ransom is going to contribute to the genocide of the terrorist groups. However, we think that in those cases, in this debate, we think that because the ransom itself does not so contribute to the empowerment of the terrorists, we don\'t think it is a good proposal.', 2),
(15, 14, 14, 15, 'So, about the model of the government side, the government side has said that they are going to let the police to censor the citizens. We think it is not realistic. Under their model, they are going to let the police to write a statement. We think it is not something justifiable, even if it can contribute to the vanishment of the terrorists. And also, we think that because even if the government does state that its citizens not to go to the terrorist group, we think that as long as the government can\'t fulfill their duty to protect the citizens, that means the government should not respect individuals to save the others or to save the citizens.', 2),
(16, 15, 15, 16, 'So, moving on to the government or the opposition side. About the model of the opposition side, we have to go by four. First, we are going to take the countermeasure against the terrorists. That is to say, after helping the hostages, we are going to do the air strike and so on.', 2),
(17, 16, 16, 17, 'Secondly, as I said, the income of the terrorists comes from not only the ransom, but rather comes from the other resources such as the oil fields, such as QSOS, ISIS, and so on. We see that we don\'t necessarily pay the ransom in the first place.', 2),
(18, 17, 17, 18, 'Third, we are going to give the choice for citizens whether or not they are going to pay the ransom or not. We require citizens to compare the risk that it is beneficial for themselves to save the hostages and so on. ', 2),
(19, 18, 18, 19, 'And also, fourth, in the paradigm, we are going to require every state to intervene in the negotiation of terrorists in order to moderate the amount of ransom that the citizens are going to pay for saving the hostages and so on.', 2),
(20, 19, 19, 20, 'So, fundamentally, we think that because there are some factors, the inevitable kidnapper is one of those. This is my first idea. We think that fundamentally, in the case of the spy or the social, that is, government, that is sent to the territory of terrorists, we think that they are not responsible for their own fault. That is to say, they kidnap them. We think that because the government forced these kind of people to go to the terrorist\'s territory, and as a consequence, they are going to be arrested by terrorists. In that case, you have to immobilize the government and make them fully responsible for saving these kind of people because we think that the government let them to go to the very dangerous area, and as a consequence, they are going to pay for their safety. We think that in that case, the government shouldn\'t anyway to deny the payment for ransom. ', 2),
(21, 20, 20, 21, 'And also, we think that payment for ransom is the most effective way to save these kind of hostages because we think that if terrorists does not release these kind of hostages, that means that terrorists are going to express in public that if we are going to get the ransom, we are not going to release, we are not going to return those hostages. So if they say that the terrorist group is going to be incentivized by the public to pay ransom, so in that case, the case is a complete counter-vote for the terrorist group. Therefore, we think that if they pay the ransom, the terrorist group has an incentive to return these kind of hostages. ', 2),
(22, 21, 21, 22, 'And also, even if they stop the payment for ransom, the kidnapping does not stop because we think that the purpose of kidnapping does not necessarily come from the income of the ransom, ladies and gentlemen. For example, ISIS kidnapped the Syrians in order for their local government in order to fear the public and also it can be beneficial for itself. And also, in those cases, the purpose of kidnapping does not necessarily come from the ransom itself. Therefore, we think that because sometimes the government is fully responsible for the payment of ransom and also there is an inevitable case of kidnapping and also even after the kidnapping, the oppressor will not protect or prevent the kidnapping to be possible for the oppressor.', 2),
(23, 22, 22, 23, 'And also, in addition to that, we have to recognize that even if people fully take care about and fully pay attention, they sometimes will be caught by terrorism. For example, even if you are outside of the terrorist territory, in any state that\'s caught, for example, the member of ISIS is going to cause you beyond the border of the country and also as a consequence, even if you pay full attention for that, you are going to be arrested by terrorism. That is to say, we need to ensure that each citizen can protect themselves. ', 2),
(24, 23, 23, 24, 'And also, why do we need to ensure the right to help others? We think that the reason why we allow the citizens as a self-defense to kill other people is that because the government does not have the total self-duty to protect its citizens, citizens do not have any way to protect themselves by themselves. We think that in this case, it can be applicable because we think that the government fails to stop the citizens to go to these kinds of dangerous areas or from being captured by terrorism. We think that in that case, because citizens have no way to protect themselves, and also, government cannot fulfill these kinds of rights and these kinds of duties, in that case, obviously, government should ensure that they help themselves.', 2),
(25, 24, 24, 25, 'And also, in addition to that, the biggest problem of this government side is that why they can justify to criminalize the act to save these kinds of citizens? Because we think that this is completely against the purpose of against terrorism.', 2),
(26, 25, 25, 26, 'Under the status quo, there are many incidents that are by terrorists. Many people are killed in airports or by Islamic State or ISIS. Many victims are existing and the victims\' families suffer from the blacking of the family. They are killed by the terrorist, the service terrorists. So, we have to stop the situation. But after taking a bath, under the status quo, there are no solutions to stop. Uniquely, there is a high possibility to save the innocent citizens. So, we cannot stop the terrorists from killing people.', 3),
(27, 26, 26, 27, 'After taking this plan, we can minimize the situation because the almost payment of the terrorists is non-sum now. Many money is contributed to the terrorists by the citizens or government. Also, the individual issue. This is selfish and this makes the more serious situation around the world. So, we have to propose this proposal. Sorry.', 3),
(28, 27, 27, 28, 'Firstly, I will refute my previous speaker. The previous speaker told you that the payment of ransom is small and it does not affect the revenue of the terrorists and it does not cause a terrible situation for the terrorists. But this is not true. Because if one person is caught by the terrorists, the government or someone who wants to save that person has to pay 1 billion yen or 10 billion yen or some very expensive money. So that\'s why, please imagine, the tank or rocket is about 1 billion yen or 10 million yen or so on. So, that\'s why, by one person, only one person, the terrorists can buy many weapons. And by buying only that weapon, many people are threatened by the situation. So, there is a possibility to be killed by the rocket or tank or so, a very serious, a very powerful weapon.', 3),
(29, 28, 28, 29, 'So, if around the world, the many, sorry, the many victims and many people pay so much money to the terrorists, terrorist groups, as my partner told you that the terrorists can get much money and can have possibility to expand their power and after that, around the world, there are many incidents by terrorists and many people will suffer from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for the around the world, many people. Sorry, let me move on our argument.', 3),
(30, 29, 29, 30, 'I will explain the, by payment of ransom, the terrorists will abuse that right to get the money, much money, and the harmful of the situation. One argument. And secondly, I will comparison the both side. Firstly, I will explain the payment of ransom is harmful. Okay.', 3),
(31, 30, 30, 31, '<POI> So, do you think that the bomb which killed thousands of people are 2 billion yen?', 3),
(32, 31, 31, 32, 'If the terrorists are followed by the government or police, it is harmful for terrorists itself. So, no. The payment of ransom should be expensive because also terrorists have risk to be watched by the government or catched by the government because of the interaction with the terrorists and government. So, terrorists have risk, so terrorists can need much money. So, in order to save the victims, the citizens have to pay much money, something billion yen.', 3),
(33, 32, 32, 33, 'Firstly, I will explain the status quo, the payment of ransom. The payment of ransom is very expensive, so that\'s why the terrorists, as I told you in my presentation, there are many weapons in the terrorist group and they can kill other people. Please imagine, if one country, one person pay much money, rich man, and pay much money for terrorists, and terrorists have much money, and even if the people can only save that victim, important for me, many people around the world will be, other countries, other innocent citizens will be suffered from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for other people or many citizens. So, that\'s why we have to save that many people.', 3),
(34, 33, 33, 34, 'Secondly, I will comparison the both sides. After taking this plan, in the opposition paradigm, there are many incidents than now, and many people were killed by the terrorists, so we have to save that person by taking this proposal. Thank you very much.', 3),
(35, 34, 34, 35, 'Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that today, all of the points, uh, today, the government side has not pointed out any justification in which why we can actually criminalize these people who actually want to just say solely want to save their families, their loved ones\' lives. So we believe, so, uh, I\'d like to point out, uh, why under the criminal justice system, this is not justifiable in my speech later on.', 4),
(36, 35, 35, 36, 'So, uh, we are here to oppose. So, uh, basically in my speech, I\'d like to do, uh, three things. Firstly, I\'d like to talk about, so why under the criminal justice system, why this is not justifiable. So we have, uh, brought the criteria here. And, um, secondly, I\'d like to talk about how in the practical terms, this is, this plan is actually going to be counterproductive and, uh, this will actually, uh, kill many more innocent people under their paradigm. And thirdly, I\'d like to talk about how, uh, how it is the state\'s responsibility and, uh, it is only one form of self-defense in this term.', 4),
(37, 36, 36, 37, 'So, uh, so yes, but before that, some couple of rebuttals to their points. Um, so firstly, about their point about, um, how we are going to, like, censor, uh, uh, security cameras and, like, hacking systems to these families or something. Well, we are very, uh, so we do not understand this vulnerability at all, right? How are these people going to be safe after doing this? And why is this going to be justified to continue censoring these, like, innocent people?', 4),
(38, 37, 37, 38, 'And secondly, uh, they talked about the long-term benefit, how we can stop the source and it will, um, somehow, uh, lead to saving people. But they have not given any mechanism to this point, right? ', 4),
(39, 38, 38, 39, 'So how will the stopping of payment of ransom actually save people, which I will talk about later on because the source of, source is not only ransom and there are many other criteria and factors that actually is empowering these terrorist groups.', 4),
(40, 39, 39, 40, 'And, um, we believe that actually, uh, when we, uh, this causes, this causes detrimental harm because when we stop these families from being able to pay this ransom, what will actually happen is that these families will not forget this fact that they were not allowed to, uh, that they, that if they, like, pay this ransom, they are going to be criminalized. They will feel like they will be betrayed by the state. So it\'s actually rather just empowering the terrorists if they see that the state is like conflicting within themselves. So this is actually causes much more harm.', 4),
(41, 40, 40, 41, 'And so, uh, and also, uh, there is like other ways, like we can, uh, we can at first like pay and save this one individual that will, that will definitely be, uh, that will definitely be, uh, their lives will be taken away under their paradigm. And later on we can combat the terrorists in other ways, which is, uh, which is much more going to be important and collect the money afterwards. So, uh, we should leave this choice to be able to, uh, pay this ransom. So I will talk about that later on. So moving on to this, just, uh, to why this is, uh, to my point.', 4),
(42, 41, 41, 42, 'So firstly, why this is not, why this plan is not justifiable under the criminal justice system. So in the criminal justice system, firstly, we need to see whether this act is illegal or not, right? So, um, in the case of the payment of ransom, it does not connect to the direct harm to somebody else. So like maybe the harm is like, no, maybe the harm is like, uh, might occur, but maybe it might not. ', 4),
(43, 42, 42, 43, 'So in this criminal justice system, the punishment has to be objective. But in this case, it is extremely subjective because like even now there are still cases where, uh, people, uh, where like ransom is not paid. However, these terrorist groups still exist, right? So like for example, in the cases of ISIS, they export, uh, oil and they, uh, collect the money from that. And rather these kinds of things are, uh, these kinds of things are the factors and resources for these terrorist groups. So just by, uh, just by stopping this payment of ransom does not lead to, uh, the benefits that they want to talk about. So we have to, uh, combat in other ways.', 4),
(44, 43, 43, 44, 'And secondly, uh, we have to, uh, consider the responsibility of these individuals. So, uh, if these, uh, so the people who paid the ransom has no intention to harm others, right? They solely want to save their families and their loved ones. So we cannot, um, just simply say that, uh, they are not, they are going to be criminalized just because they want to save these people. And it is not justifiable because it means that the, uh, criminalizing means that the state is actually going to ignore these people\'s, uh, these people\'s lifestyle. It\'s definitely going to be taken away under their paradigm.', 4),
(45, 44, 44, 45, 'So moving on to this practical benefits, uh, we believe that, um, uh, taking this plan is completely counterproductive and will cause many more innocent people\'s lives to be deprived. So, uh, there\'s going to be two consequences that can be, uh, that can be thought. ', 4),
(46, 45, 45, 46, 'So firstly, uh, when we criminalize it, uh, uh, what might happen is that the families are going to, um, are going to negotiate with the criminal individually and secretly. So rather taking this plan is just going to push this, uh, push this payment of ransom underground. And, uh, if so, we believe it\'s a comparative better than the status quo when the state, when the state can actually intervene and the state can also, like, uh, negotiate instead of, uh, instead of making these families do it. ', 4),
(47, 46, 46, 47, 'And when the families do it individually and secretly, they will have to pay a huge amount of money. And rather this means that, uh, like huge, much more big, huger and bigger amounts of money. So rather this is going to empower terrorists, right? ', 4),
(48, 47, 47, 48, 'And secondly, uh, when, uh, uh, we should leave, like, a ground for these, uh, uh, to, like, negotiate and pay. Because when, like, we cannot pay making ransom, it\'s going to be difficult. These terrorists are not going to be satisfied, right? They are going to be desperate to get more money. So what will happen is that they are going to be kidnapped more people and they are going to kill more people. And for example, they will take, take over the states within that, uh, territory of their terrorist groups and they are going to kill innocent people and they are going to, like, uh, take over the, uh, banks and et cetera to get even more money and to empower themselves. And so we, we believe that this is actually going to kill many, many more innocent people under their power then.', 4),
(49, 48, 48, 49, 'So thirdly, uh, we believe that, um, uh, this, as, as we have already told you, uh, it is the state\'s responsibility that the state cannot seek and protect the safety of its citizens, right? So, uh, it is not justifiable to criminalize the act of saving someone as we have already told you. So we believe that the government has to do its best to save these people and completely ignoring them and completely just pushing them that saying that it is, uh, it is something, it is going to be criminalized is, uh, uh, is very detrimental, uh, is very harmful because, uh, it means that the state is going to actively kill someone, right?', 4),
(50, 49, 49, 50, 'Uh, they are going to ignore this one definite victim that is going to actually happen. So like, for example, even in today, like when the police is not there, others can try to save it, save someone even if, uh, even if, even if, even if it causes harms to others. So in this case, it is the state\'s responsibility to, uh, uh, to be able to leave a choice, at least leave a choice for these people to pay the ransom and, and save this one, uh, life that is definitely going to be deprived under their paradigm.', 4),
(51, 50, 50, 51, 'So, uh, so, uh, concluding my speech, when you consider how many lives are actually going to be taken away, how many innocent people are actually going to be killed, uh, the opposition side win about the uncertain benefits coming from the, uh, government side.', 4),
(52, 51, 51, 52, 'The overall foundation coming from the government\'s guidelines are, in order to save the mass population, they are going to sacrifice the financial. But if it is possible, then we think it is better. ', 5),
(53, 52, 52, 53, 'However, we think that because of lack of mechanism, how they are going to de-empower the terrorists is unclear. And also, that it does not believe that they actually the weaken the terrorists. And also, perfectly to prevent terrorism, we oppose this proposal.', 5),
(54, 53, 53, 54, 'Because we think that by taking this proposal, we are going to sacrifice that individual who are not responsible for being captured by terrorists. And also, because the government has a responsibility to save these kind of individuals. ', 5),
(55, 54, 54, 55, 'So, firstly, I\'m going to point out why this government side does not have any work ability to prevent terrorism. And secondly, given that, what state should do and what is the responsibility of the state and the government.', 5),
(56, 55, 55, 56, 'Firstly, the government has constantly told you, by taking this proposal, they are going to prevent, they are going to protect civilians. However, we don\'t think that it is the case. And lastly, as I and my partner have constantly told you, because the income of terrorists does not necessarily come from the ransom, it is not genuine. Because they have any way to gain the financial power, such as the exploitation, and so on.', 5),
(57, 56, 56, 57, 'In that case, if you want to do terrorism, what you need is a bomb, a gun, and so on. We don\'t think that they need to gain thousands of money in order to get that gun or bomb, ladies and gentlemen. We think that in those cases, we cannot understand why in their paradigm they can completely protect the citizens, and also why they can justify the sacrifice of citizens, ladies and gentlemen.', 5),
(58, 57, 57, 58, 'So, secondly, what state should do? As I said in the past speeches, though the auditing was different, there are people who are not responsible for their being captured. For example, spies, soldiers, journalists, and so on. These kind of people do not arbitrarily go to these kind of areas to be captured by terrorists, ladies and gentlemen. Because these kind of people are sometimes forced to go to these kind of dangerous areas, like government, companies, and so on.', 5),
(59, 58, 58, 59, 'Because we think that it is understandable that those people who are going to be forced to go to these kind of areas, and also selfishly being captured, it can be understandable, but there is no mention of that one. We think that in that case, those people were not fully responsible for their own act. They believed that the government had a responsibility to protect its citizens, and also there\'s no justification to prohibit to save these kind of people by the family or state, ladies and gentlemen. So because we believe that the government feels its responsibility to protect citizens, to ensure the safety of citizens, we believe that the government should make an effort to protect citizens.', 5),
(60, 59, 59, 60, 'And also, as the opposition side constantly told you, because the reason why we have to prosecute the terrorists is to save its citizens. However, this government is going to sacrifice citizens in order to weaken the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen. Even if in that paradigm, the terrorism will constantly occur, and also they have not abandoned the protection of citizens, and also, however, in the paradigm of the opposition side, we are going to protect citizens, however, the situation does not slightly change.', 5),
(61, 60, 60, 61, 'As my partner has told you, because after taking this proposal, because the family wants to protect, wants to save their members of the family, they are going to do the negotiation with every secrecy. That is to say that the payment of ransom will not be possible, and also in that scenario, it is more harmful because we believe that there\'s no government protection in that negotiation, and also they cannot supervise the negotiation. In those cases, because we are against terrorism.', 5),
(62, 61, 61, 62, 'Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen in this house. We want to cut the source and we want to protect the warse accidents such as more 100,000 or 1 billion people are killed by the gas or bombs in advance.', 6),
(63, 62, 62, 63, 'So and where after taking this plan, our government clearly showed that the citizen and terrorists, the government\'s stance that ransom is guilty. Terrorist group\'s action won\'t escalate. As usual, government remain to give money to terrorists. They request a yen and yen. And we want to stop this occasion and this motion is uniquely and only way to cut source of this case. ', 6),
(64, 63, 63, 64, 'OK. Let\'s move on my summarize. But I want to repeat my previous speaker. I have three refutations. Firstly, she said family cannot save because they cannot give ransom to terrorists. So it is pity. But it is not true. But as I mentioned in my constructive speech, but even if the ransom, they are family in the ransom, in the major case, the victim, the child will be killed by the terrorist. So even if they cannot save, in most case, they are pity. So we stop this. It is no problem. ', 6),
(65, 64, 64, 65, 'And secondly, she said we don\'t save the justification, so I want to justificate now. Namsung is equal to give money to terrorists. It is equal to support terrorist act. It is very guilty. Even if subjective, but support is very guilty. So it is in the criminal justice system, they should be criminalized, right? Yes. OK. ', 6),
(66, 65, 65, 66, 'And thirdly, they negotiate secretly. So this is a good point. But we believe that police is not so, so police can intervene also secretly not to know from terrorists. They do more secretly and they can, police is good, is specialist. So only families or not specialist are nervous people, negotiate secretly is more than our police can do well than our individual. So we think thanks to police, it is effectively solve the problem. ', 6),

In the status quo, due to the diversity of the privatization of the porn industry, many corporations want to make the profit. And they make many diversified videos, such as the rape video and the pedophilia video and these kinds of immoral videos and so forth. Why is that? The reason is very simple. Basically, the profit-seekers want to get the profit by the many numbers of people. Because if they just focus on the particular target, this profit is not maximized in the first place.

That\'s why the state never makes this violent content. Because if the state makes the violent content, this criticism is very large compared to this private industry. Because also, many of the citizens, many of the stakeholders, are always supervised by the state itself. That\'s why states also don\'t have the possibility to make violent content in the past. That\'s why compared to the status quo, we can only make moderate content of the porn industry. ', 7),

Because in the existence of the rape video, in the existence of the pedophilia video, some number of people see it, and after that, they mimic this video in the first place.

I\'m going to prove to you three things in my speech. First, I\'m going to prove to you why, like, according to their, like, um, given the analysis they said, why our side can achieve that much better. Secondly, I\'m going to be talking upon, like, their talk about entertainment and why that could be limited.

But I, I would argue that these small companies are not equally capable of looking after these kind of actresses. We think in the majority of time in, um, in order to like seek the maximum profit, we think they\'re more likely to abuse. They\'re more likely to exploit and go to radical videos like rape, which can gather a lot of money by a lot of extremists. We think upon this, we think that our side, when you nationalize this industry, you\'re able to provide more care for actors because you ensure that there\'s going to be a sustainable environment. You ensure that there\'s not going to be no legal behavior and you allow these actresses always a system to opt out by going to court instead of engaging in potentially illegal behavior by small companies.', 9),

That\'s why we think when our side is able to nationalize and prevent any kind of, well, like amateur video to go out, we\'ve confined the imagery to a very restricted and controlled. We think that the States can like enforce regulations and what\'s acceptable and what\'s not much better than a, what a small company can do.

They will be able to use those money according to their own will. They will start to work just to get the minimum amount of money that they can live. When this happens, the economy will be deactivated and stigmatized. Obviously, the money that will be spent on the elderly will get smaller.

But, think about if, in the first place, women who want to have children and have to bear babies with their strong feelings, they must not bear under the forcing. Because if they do that, they would have a burden to raise their babies, right? Because of the additional tax. So, if some of them don\'t want to pay additional tax and bear babies, they have no strong feeling to raise them. And some of them would abandon babies. And this case will occur.', 24),

And our side thinks that children are important, too. Because we already share the goal that achieves having many babies in the aging society. So, however, our side, we have a counter plan.

So, this counter plan doesn\'t have to pay an additional tax on people without children. Because people who raise their babies can get money.

First of all, the people who are extremely poor. Secondly, the people who don\'t want to have children in the first place. And third, the people who can but they just don\'t want, for several reasons. We think that this is actually true. But the problem here is that the first two characters here are totally not mutually exclusive. And on the other side, they will still not have babies. So what I\'m trying to say here is that the most important actor, the vast majority of the actors in this debate, stakeholders in this debate, is the people who can but just don\'t want, just don\'t have babies for several reasons.', 25),

So the reason why the people, the reason why these people in the first place do not have babies is because I think there are mainly two reasons. First of all, they only have an average income. They\'re not extremely poor, but they just only have an average income. And they\'re really worried that they cannot fully support their children, cannot provide an extreme or enough amount of education to their children, even if they have them. And secondly, the people who are just worried about their own career, their own future themselves. But the government side totally mischaracterized or even failed to even characterize these kinds of people in the first place. So I think we already win this debate by clearly clarifying them.', 25),
(264, 41, 41, 42, 'And secondly, why we can actually achieve this, why these people will actually actively have more children in the future is because, first of all, just as our first speaker and second speaker have clearly mentioned, we\'re going to provide more maternity leave and even actually support these people in the first place. So like even if they only have an average income, because we will support them financially, they\'ll also be able to have more babies or even try to have more babies because they actually receive those kinds of financial support. And secondly, the people worried about their career, their future, because we\'ll provide them more maternity leave or other kinds of options, they will definitely try to make more babies by taking this plan.', 25),

(266, 43, 43, 44, 'First of all, what will happen to the parents? Just as an explanation, people who have only the average income are worried if they can fully support their children. Because these people are just literally forced to have children just because they just want to get away from these taxes or even maybe forced by the whole social norm in the first place. They\'re basically forcing their own lives into a very endangered situation where they do not have enough money, they do not have enough support. ', 25),

Second, even if their plan did work, even if we think that our plan would work faster, it would be much more efficient, and we emphasize the efficiency of our plan. Third, by having additional tax, it will be much easier to create a great environment for women, and we think that with the status quo, their plan is not realistic at all because it\'s hard to get money, and money doesn\'t just come out of nowhere, and we don\'t understand how they are going to pursue their goals.', 26),

So we, the government side, follow the current law for part-time workers by which we allow students to work for no more than 10 hours a week. We set these hours because high schoolers should spend a certain amount of time on studying, not only part-time jobs. And also, if they extend these hours to the late night, there might be more dangerous jobs, more dangerous part-time jobs for high schoolers. So we fought to prevent those dangerous jobs. And for the first reason, we set these hours.', 27),

This is really good for high schoolers because in college, they will do what they are interested in or what they want to do or something that is good for their future. By experiencing part-time job before college, in which they do what they are interested in, they can know what they should do in college or what is good for them before college.

So, that means letting high schoolers doing part-time job during their high school days means that there will be much more time for preparation for society.

Because the reason being that the fact that you get money, the fact that you get slightly economic independence from your parents is likely to attract many high schoolers and they\'re likely to prioritize the part-time job over school or over the club activities.

First is that the part-time job is probably going to be manual labor in the vast majority of cases, like dish, like washing dish in restaurants, in McDonald\'s, that sort of thing. Because those sorts of jobs do not provide any knowledge, do not provide any actual experience that is going to be valuable in the long run. And they might talk about like internships, for instance, but in the majority of cases, like as for internships, the sphere of choice is extremely narrow because not many corporations offer internships to high school students, even though it\'s available in the vast majority of cases only and exclusively for university students.

(295, 19, 19, 20, 'Second point, in comparison to alternative, why part-time is bad. Now, there are two kinds of skills that I think matter in consideration of the future choices that children are going to have. One is communicative skill and two is academic skill.

(296, 20, 20, 21, 'Now, firstly, as for communicative skill, we think that it can be acquired through club activities, for instance, within the framework of school activities like you do, like you do debating, you do basketball, you do baseball, you do soccer, that sort of thing. Firstly, you\'re going to be able to learn how to interact with others, how to interact with your senior, with your junior. But secondly, like you\'re able to find what is fun for you, right?

That is to say, when you apply for a job, you have to graduate from an elite university in order to expand the choice that you have in the first place. If you have a job that you want to apply for, you need to have graduated from an elite university. That\'s why we think that in high school, it\'s particularly important for you to go to a summer program in Tetsuryokukai, which is a cram school for students who want to go to the University of Tokyo, instead of wasting your time, like washing dishes in McDonald\'s.', 28),

But like first of all, I don\'t think we have that much of a burden to say that high schoolers have to be 100% within club activities because we also say that not all high schoolers would be 100% polite once they start like doing a part-time job, even if you have that legal contract. I think like that doesn\'t necessarily mean that all kinds of high schoolers would like suddenly be polite.So all in all what we basically want to see is that this kind of legal contract or your fear of being fired is not enough of a reason to say that like you, that say that part-time jobs are necessary to gain this kind of sense of responsibility. ', 30),
(318, 42, 42, 43, 'Secondly, they also talked about how, and I was talking about how you have to interact with like you get to interact with many people but because there\'s like a lot of, but because there\'s a lot of like manual labor involved in part-time jobs, this is not necessarily the case.', 30),
(319, 43, 43, 44, 'Finally, they also talked about the sense of responsibility of using money that can be gained through part-time jobs, but we think that firstly they already contradict their main point when they say that students can learn how to take care of money, but at the same time they also say that parents would control it. We think that like this kind of control from their parents like your own like autonomy as like a. As like a spender wouldn\'t like be able to coexist so it\'ll either be the student like freely using their money or like the parents getting like a complete hold of their salary. So like either way, I don\'t get why they would be able to learn this kind of responsibility in the first place. ', 30),
(320, 44, 44, 45, 'And even then we still don\'t see the specific reason why they have to gain this kind of sense of responsibility while they\'re in high school. Especially if they have another four years or like for some people like six years in university. So in the end, we think that this kind of skill is not necessarily something that should be gained within the three years of high school life, but what we really need to gain during our three years of high school life is things like academic skills.', 30),
(321, 45, 45, 46, 'For communicative skills that my first speaker talked about which brings us back to our main points. Firstly, the role of high school education. A side opposition believes it\'s to learn like the basis of how to live in society in the future and like in the long-term, right? In order to do that, firstly, you need to gain like a lot of knowledge to either get into university or maybe it\'s to get into a specific job or whatever reason. Then you also need to gain things like communication skills, teamwork, or leadership skills, or other soft skills that you need to survive in society. You gain that through daily classes at school and after-school activities, clubs, and we think that these kinds of activities are something that you could only gain in the three years of high school education. Specifically, this kind of opportunity should be the highest priority for students.', 30),
(322, 46, 46, 47, 'Secondly, I\'ll explain to you why this kind of opportunity would not be able to be achieved once students start gaining a part-time job. So ... the government second speaker said that the wage is not that cheap for part-time jobs, like it\'s enough for them to sustain themselves and have fun. We think that this is the specific reason why a lot of high school students will keep doing their part-time jobs even at the expense of their academic career getting damaged. Because you\'re able to gain that money to buy things like bubble tea or go to karaoke or whatever.', 30),
(323, 47, 47, 48, 'This kind of immediate pleasure and immediate financial gain that you can get from part-time jobs is what keeps the students going, and we think that this is very harmful because they don\'t realize that the long-term benefits that could be gained from studying or going to clubs would not be achieved. But then they prioritize this short-term gain that they can have from part-time jobs, and therefore they keep working. As a result, this is going to be a huge distraction that severely harms their future in the long term. Imagine you have to spend, they said that it could be like 10 hours or so, but we think 10 hours is pretty long for you to spend washing dishes or asking customers what they want for dinner.', 30),
(324, 48, 48, 49, 'We think that this is like a huge distraction for their lives, especially if they have this financial incentive that keeps them going at all costs. The specific difference between clubs and part-time jobs is that clubs in school are made to coexist with the school work. That is to say, like, you can only practice until a certain time. For instance, if you go to a club, there\'s probably a limit to the time that you can stay at school. Then, you also have a schedule of the club that is suited to your academic work. Maybe you don\'t have clubs during the test periods, for example.', 30),
(325, 49, 49, 50, 'So, we think that clubs are made to coexist within the school system, and therefore, it\'s really easy to balance your studying and all the other stuff. The unique thing about part-time jobs is that it\'s just not made to coexist in the first place. Therefore, what ultimately happens is you either get exploited or pressured by your boss to keep working at all costs and keep working for that money. This leads to getting distracted from a lot of the academic activities that you need to gain during your high school years. This would be a huge harm to your long-term prospects. For all these reasons, we\'re so proud to oppose.', 30),
(326, 50, 50, 51, 'First of all, let me set ground for this, for my speech. So there\'s two analysis. First is what is high schoolers. So let me analyze high schoolers. There\'s two analysis. First, those go to college. And the second, those not go to college, as the first speaker said. So the important thing of this analysis is majority of students will work after high school. So let me move on to second one.', 31),
(327, 51, 51, 52, 'So skills they claim, the opposition side claim to be needed. So they argue two points. First, we need communication skills. And secondly, we need academic skills for high schoolers. So they focused on the harm, the harm part-time job have. For example, they, so their first point was harm to academic skills. However, we\'re very skeptical about the need for academic skills. So as we argued, the majority of students work after, will work after high school, meaning not going to university. So academic skill is not needed for like work, right? So just get into the university. So even though there\'s a little harm, which club activities will not have that part-time job has to academic skills, it doesn\'t matter because a lot of, a majority of high schoolers will work after high school. So as we argued, as we argued in the first speaker, primary working, part-time job, primary working experience is good for those students who works after college. ', 31),
(328, 52, 52, 53, 'And secondly, they argued club activity is enough for what we need. So let me compare club activities and part-time jobs. So there\'s two axes. First, age. So in club activities, there\'s just like a two-year difference between senpai and kohai. And also, they go to the, because they go to the same school, they have, they have common background. Meanwhile, part-time, in part-time job, the co-worker, the age and backgrounds of co-workers will vary. So communication skills or like some special experience towards a wider variety of people will be there in the part-time job.', 31),
(329, 53, 53, 54, 'And the second axis is responsibility. So they, the opposition side argued club is not the place. So we can, we can have a sense of responsibility throughout the club activities. However, it is not enough because the club is not the place for responsibility. It\'s, so it\'s, it\'s the place for just fun. So even though there\'s, there\'s a few club activities which require responsibility, for example, like very strict physical clubs, there is, it really depends on the club\'s atmosphere. For example, so as we, I said, the club is just for fun. So generally, generally, there\'s no need to be responsible. ', 31),
(330, 54, 54, 55, 'However, in part-time jobs, there\'s legal contracts, as I said, no thanks. There\'s legal contracts, as I said. So there\'s, and also there\'s an exchange of money. There\'s an exchange of money in exchange for their labor. So, and also as the second speaker said, there\'s, there\'s always the risk of getting fired. So incentive, incentive for, to be responsible, it\'s far more stronger in part-time job.', 31),
(331, 55, 55, 56, 'So let me conclude my speech. So because the opposition side misunderstood what they needed, meaning they, so they misunderstandingly believe that academic, academic skill is needed. The harm they argued is meaningless. The harm they argued is meaningless. And also because, and also because club activities will not be the counterpart of the part-time jobs, we are happy to propose. Thank you.', 31),
(332, 56, 56, 57, 'The problem that opposition bench faces with proposition bench is that they haven\'t been able to explain first what high school students want. And then we think that there wasn\'t any kind of clear description and explanation of the mutually exclusiveness of part-time jobs. I\'m very happy to propose.', 32),
(333, 57, 57, 58, 'Two things I\'ll be talking about. First, I\'ll be explaining what high school students really want. And secondly, I\'ll be explaining what part-time jobs bring and why, in the majority of instances, there are going to be more harms than benefits of experiencing part-time jobs as uniquely as a high school student.', 32),
(334, 58, 58, 59, 'So first, what do high school students want? I\'ll be using the classification that the prime minister brings, which is first, people who want to go to universities and people who don\'t want to go to universities. I\'ll be explaining why, in both of these situations, there\'s going to be much bigger harms.', 32),
(335, 59, 59, 60, 'So first, let\'s look at students who want to go to university. Given that around 90 to 95% of high school students usually want to go to universities, and this is a debate about whether part-time jobs have benefits or harms as a majority. We think this point should be more important than the whip speeches wholly talking about students who don\'t want to go to universities. We think it\'s much better on our side if you don\'t experience part-time jobs for two reasons.', 32),
(336, 60, 60, 61, 'First is because you gain more time to prepare and be provided and you have more opportunities provided to see what you want to do in the future than spending and wasting your time on part-time jobs, right? You\'re able to study, you\'re able to gain important skills and knowledge, which is essential to choosing universities and careers because you need to actually have information to do so. For instance, we think it\'s much better if you study biology to be a biologist, or if you study law to be a lawyer, or play sports to be a professional player. And we think these points are much more important, much more feasible and robust than just, than just, I don\'t know, for instance, smiling at Burger King or McDonald\'s, right? We think it\'s much better.　This is especially important when you consider that you are a high school student and you only have a limited time of three years. We think it\'s most important to know how to use time management. We think it\'s much better on our side where you actually have more time to absolutely dedicate all your time on things that are actually important.', 32),
(337, 61, 61, 62, 'On their side, they say that, hey, we could also do club activities and you could just do both club activities and part-time jobs. Notice how this point specifically neglects the variable of high school students because a high school student usually has homework they have to prepare for universities. They also want to have fun with friends, right? The physical burden on mental stress is accelerated when you have to have both clubs and part-time jobs, right? Just one day is enough to save my energy and me having to go to a five-hour shift after that washing dishes for no reason is, I think, rather like meaningless and something that is rather unfeasible. On our side, we do not have these distractions. We also have time to work to polish our resumes for extracurriculars to provide to universities, for instance, which we think part-time jobs rather distracts you. So we say on our side, our side has much more benefits.', 32),
(338, 62, 62, 63, 'But secondly, we say it\'s much better for poor people because it\'s going to be a much better investment of trying to go to universities and actually find a good job and a good career and gaining much better income instead of sacrificing your time during your limited three years of high school trying to do something you don\'t know if you want to do that in the future. Instead, we think that it\'s irrational for the government side to come up here and just say that these high school students are always going to know what to do from just doing part-time jobs.', 32),
(339, 63, 63, 64, 'But let\'s look at the second case, right, of students who don\'t want to go to a university. The problem is this, is that they haven\'t been able to characterize these people, right? People usually who don\'t want to go to universities and immediately work are people who want to work at their parents\' shop or being a fisherman or people with fixed jobs, right? These people already have jobs they want to do, so this negates proposition\'s own premise that these people would know what to do from doing part-time jobs because they already have jobs they want to do, right? At this point, we think this is meaningless and this is a waste of time because now they have to do things that won\'t help you at all.', 32),
(340, 64, 64, 65, 'The government says that academics aren\'t so important, but we say it is, right? Because if you want to work after your parents\' shop, you should rather spend your time being able to focus on what the shop wants looking after all its geographical locations and how it\'s doing in the economy in the market, for instance, much than just working at a part-time jobs which you\'re never going to be affiliated without in the future. Therefore, we say it\'s better for these people to spend time on focusing on the job you\'re getting rather on their side. That\'s why for the first point, for what high school students want, our side is able to match the benefits more.', 32),
(341, 65, 65, 66, 'But secondly, let\'s characterize what part-time jobs and what part-time jobs brings. The whole bench of our proposition was that the part-time jobs extend high school students\' vision of the future. This is problematic for two reasons. First, because it simply cannot because part-time jobs offered to high school students is usually the things like washing dishes at Caesarea, pushing buttons at 7-Eleven, or creating fake smiles at Burger King. Why is this so? Because we say there\'s a structural system in society which makes high school students have to do manual labor. ', 32),
(342, 66, 66, 67, 'This is for two reasons. First is because as high school students, we don\'t have the certificate or achievements as other people who are higher of age. There\'s a lack of credibility for high school students which makes them have to do manual labor instead of in kind of high-tech programming, for instance. That\'s why it\'s worse on their side and it\'s much better on our side because we get to prioritize these friends. We get to prioritize our limited time at high school. We say we\'re much better in not having to waste time in all these meaningless manual labor, which you probably never have to use in the future.', 32),
(343, 67, 67, 68, 'But secondly, even if you neglect all our points coming up for now, we say that their side wasn\'t able to provide any kind of mutually exclusivity for this point. The only thing that came up here was that, hey, we could just do clubs too. I already explained why that doesn\'t work. The only unique thing that came up here was that apparently, you know how to use your money management. ', 32),
(344, 68, 68, 69, 'The problem is, right after the second speaker came up here and said that if parents are able to control the money of high school students, that doesn\'t teach money management, right? It simply doesn\'t make sense. And it\'s also not related to the point where part-time jobs offer you money but don\'t teach you how to manage your money properly. If you want to know how to manage money, you should just do that with the allowance your parents provide you.', 32),
(345, 69, 69, 70, 'At this point, we think that failing in explaining the difference between part-time jobs while we explain it uniquely just in clubs or prioritizing your friends is much better. Because we prioritize the needs of students and talk to you about how part-time jobs bring more harms, I\'m happy to oppose.', 32),
(346, 70, 70, 71, 'The biggest issue with Proposition\'s case is that they do not have a clear benefit of what you could specifically gain from the three years of part-time job experience that you gained during high school.', 33),
(347, 71, 71, 72, 'On the other hand, what we as opposition have consistently been telling you from the beginning is that these kinds of academic and communicative skills that you could gain from your school classes or your club activities are something unique to high school and something that we need to protect. That is why we\'re so proud to oppose today\'s motion.', 33),
(348, 72, 72, 73, 'So let\'s go over today\'s debate. The two main clashes are which side has long term benefits that are actually useful for the child\'s future. All in all, we think that as a premise, we see the high schoolers because they don\'t have any academic record or a cool master\'s degree or something. We simply don\'t have the capability nor credibility to get into a really high skill job. So as a result, the majority of the part-time jobs that they will be experiencing is manual labor. This is like washing dishes or doing like asking what they want to eat for dinner or stuff like that. And we think that as a result, opposition fails to clarify the specific benefits that you can gain from these kinds of part-time jobs.', 33),
(349, 73, 73, 74, 'So let\'s take their best case and assume that this kind of legal contract makes you like a more responsible person. Even if that is the case, we still see that the kind of responsibility that you do gain out of it is quite marginal. We think that all you have to do to be responsible in a part-time job is simply to be at that shop at the designated time and do some chores. Right. And then you\'re like counted as responsible. We think that this kind of responsibility is not really valuable compared to the responsibility that you gain as a member of a sport team or like fulfilling your role as like a reply speaker or like whatever thing you do in clubs. We think that the kind of skills and the kind of responsibility that you ultimately get out of part-time jobs is quite small compared to the benefits that can be achieved on our side.', 33),
(350, 74, 74, 75, 'And secondly, the other benefit that they talked about was about this kind of interaction that you can gain between people. Firstly, we say that their model already contradicts with their stance because it seems that high schoolers only get to work for like 10 hours a week. But still, we also see that like the kind of like manual labor prevents them from like any kind of like constructive communication with like peers or like people older than you in the first place. So compared to that, again, the communication that you can gain within the school is more sufficient and more beneficial for these students.', 33),
(351, 75, 75, 76, 'But finally, they also talk about the financial responsibility that they can gain through the motion. But we think that this ends up in like two spectrums. It\'s either you waste off all your salary on bubble tea or like your parents take all the cash. Right. So in the end, we don\'t think the high schoolers are capable and nor is it feasible for them to gain this kind of financial responsibility once they start doing a part-time job.', 33),
(352, 76, 76, 77, 'So let\'s look at the comparative. Right. What can we actually gain by preventing them from doing part-time jobs? We think that by focusing on your school life, whether it\'s like academic or whether it\'s something to do with clubs, we think that this has like a long term benefit on the students because first of all, they gain these kinds of soft skills, right? Like communication skills or like teamwork or like learning to respect your seniors or like fulfilling your role in like a team or like leadership and like other other skills.', 33),
(353, 77, 77, 78, 'And let\'s look at like academic skills. Right. So again, let\'s take their best case and say that like most students don\'t go to university anyway. So academic skills are important. We think that like firstly, we think that academic skills are not necessarily like getting into that university or having like an elite record. We think that like even if you don\'t go to university in the end, like working hard to get that good grade on the test or like studying and like sharing your thoughts together with your peers is in itself like a valuable experience. Even if you don\'t go to university in the future. ', 33),
(354, 78, 78, 79, 'And compared to that, the kind of like tedious and repetitive manual labor that you\'re going to experience through a part-time job is like a meaningless act. And that doesn\'t lead to any useful skills compared to what you could gain from working hard studying.', 33),
(355, 79, 79, 80, 'So all in all, regardless of what kind of future that you are going into for the long term benefit and the happiness of the students as a whole, we think that they should never experience part-time jobs during their high school career. And that is why we\'re so proud to oppose. Thank you.', 33),
(356, 80, 80, 81, 'Part-time jobs are an easier way for students to learn social skills. At a point that the manners are written and they have to behave responsibly, and they can learn how to use the money. At this point, we strongly believe today\'s motion. So, today we have two main points here. The first point is about the academic skills, and the second point is about the social skills.', 34),
(357, 81, 81, 82, 'So, first, let me talk about the academic skills. We believe that the students can also maintain a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. So, high school students have enough chance to think of the future. No one will do a part-time job all day when the entrance exam will be held two months later. So, they will be able to maintain the balance between studying and part-time job. ', 34),
(358, 82, 82, 83, 'And this is also done when it comes to club activities. Students are able to maintain, even now, the balance between studying and club activities, which is club activities are the same as part-time jobs. At a point that they spend about 10 hours a week, which is completely different from studying. We believe that they can maintain the balance between the part-time jobs and studying. And if they cannot do that, it can also be said that they cannot maintain the balance between club activities and studying. So, we believe that there will be no difference between the people who are doing club activities and people who are doing the part-time jobs and club activities.', 34),
(359, 83, 83, 84, 'Next, let me talk about the social skills, which is the most important thing in the participation. So, they said that they can learn a lot of social skills in the club activities. They said that they can learn how to behave against seniors. However, they can learn a lot of social skills, for example, how to behave against senior people. However, we believe that club activities are completely different from part-time jobs. To the point that they can quit easily the club activities when they have some difficulty in the club activities. ', 34),
(360, 84, 84, 85, 'And also, the rules are not written. So, it is difficult for students to know the rules. Feeling the atmosphere and changing behavior is so difficult for high school students. On the other hand, in part-time jobs, first of all, the manners are written. So, it is easier for students to learn social skills because they can learn the manners while they are doing part-time jobs because the manners are written.', 34),
(361, 85, 85, 86, 'The second point is that they have to behave responsibly, and they can somehow find a way to get along with who they hate. And the salary can be a huge motivation for these kinds of things which cannot be done when they are in the club activities. Because if there are some people they hate, they can quit easily. But salary can be a huge motivation in the part-time jobs.', 34),
(362, 86, 86, 87, 'The third thing is about how to use money. So, what will happen if they do not do part-time jobs in high school and they just get a lot of huge money when they are in the universities? So, when they are in the universities, they can do a lot of part-time jobs and they will get a lot of money. However, there is no one who can tell the importance and tell how to use the money. So, at the point when they are high school students, parents can control to some extent. ', 34),
(363, 87, 87, 88, 'And this is important because the parents can realize, can make them know how it is important to use and how they can truly use the money for themselves.

(364, 0, 0, 1, 'Just like the word \"her\" is in the word \"hero,\" we think that females are also capable of being heroes just similar to male figures like Captain America or any kind of Go Rangers.

We think that these kind of notions are unhealthy for the people in the audience that are watching it, and especially the children. I\'m very happy to propose. I\'m going to be setting up the motion before I begin. On our side, we don\'t think that all female characters should always be the leader. What we support as proposition is a healthy mixture of decent female leaders as also male leaders. We think that we want to pursue and promote the idea of females being capable of being a leader as much as males, and we think that this is a brilliant idea in reducing discrimination.', 35),

(367, 3, 3, 4, 'Two things. First, is that we think that the concept of leaders is not something that is dependent on gender. Just like in real life, how there are many female leaders as well as male leaders, we think that even in Marvel or any kind of film industry, we think that female characters are also capable of being leaders. We think there needs to be a strong image, especially in the media, where everyone is directly influenced by every single day, that there needs to be a strong message that women are also capable. That the fact that they are being leaders and being in control of certain groups does not necessarily mean that we think that if they are being able to be a strong leader in a field, we think that is able to promote a bigger message in real life in promoting gender justice. And I\'ll be talking about this later.', 35),

And we think this is seen in the cases of a lot of movies where there are certain like female heroes such as Wonder Woman or any those kind of instances. And we think that the state should actively promote any kind of gender equality. And we think this side is just in including female characters by the simple fact that there are female characters that are excluded from being leaders just on the basis of their gender. Given this, we think this is a necessary motion given the benefits. There\'s going to be female actors. And we think this is my second argument. I\'ll be talking about this.', 35),

That is, the women do not currently have basically any kind of female role model to look forward to. We think that, sure, there might be some central characters. But the problem is that we think we need more female characters in the pursuit of leadership. Because we think that these few examples are likely to be sexualized just because of the fact that producers have to choose always the most sexiest and hottest woman. And we think that tends to get sexualized. We don\'t think that the sexualization of women leaders is necessarily a good thing. We think that on our side, when we include more female actors and make sure there are more central characters, we think that you don\'t really need to rely on this facial benefit.

And we think this emphasizes the masculinity of males. And we think this isn\'t necessarily a good thing.', 35),
(375, 11, 11, 12, 'So how does this change under our world? Two things. First, is that these leaders are going to become a central figure, right? We think that\'s going to mean you\'re going to have closer proximity to males and females. And we think that female leaders are capable as similar to male leaders. ', 35),
(376, 12, 12, 13, 'But B is that these female characters as a leader are going to have more power. We think this is going to promote the message that women are also capable of resolving conflicts, that they are also capable of negotiating certain conflicts to negotiate this in a peaceful manner. ', 35),
(377, 13, 13, 14, 'Now, to answer the POI of opposition, that is the difference between male leaders and female leaders, we say there is no difference. That is, the females are also as enough capable as the males. And we think this is a necessary policy because currently there\'s a status quo which stigmatizes against female characters as leaders. This is because of the unconceived notion that like just the patriarchal society deems females as more incapable than males. And we think this isn\'t untrue, right? We think that female characters are also capable. So we see that there\'s no difference at all, that they are both capable and we think we should remove that kind of stigmatization.', 35),
(378, 14, 14, 15, 'So what happens once we have these kind of powerful central figured characters is that children who are easily influenced by the media just by the fact that they don\'t have any kind of like preconceived ideas are going to now look at this and we think that female children are now going to have a more active and positive role model of a leader. So in the future, we think they\'re less likely to feel like females are unable to do anything. We think that rather they\'re going to have the feeling that they can be a leader, that they can strive to be a female CEO. So even in the real life, we think that the sense message of female leadership is going to be promoted and we think this is something we always ought to pursue. I\'m very happy.', 35),
(379, 15, 15, 16, 'So, we have three points. First, about how women can be seen as having roles for unsuccessful people. And about the impact, and the second about the impact on children. And the third about violence.', 36),
(380, 16, 16, 17, 'So first, I\'d like to move on to the first point about leaders. This motion says that the female character in hero programs as a leader, and as a leader, women can be portrayed as also unsuccessful people. And in this reality where men tend to be leaders. This motion won\'t necessarily make women successful leaders, which are actually morally correct.', 36),
(381, 17, 17, 18, 'And so we\'re moving on to the second point. I think we can all agree that when children watch hero programs, they are inspired by the characters\' actions, and therefore they will start acting like them. And for example, for girls, there are hero programs for girls like PQR, and for boys, there are hero programs such as Coming Data. And if girls start being the main leader in programs like Coming Data, even the boys mostly watch. There is a possibility that boys will feel reluctant to act like leaders, and that is the complete opposite of what we are actually trying to do. But this motion may not be able to inspire boys to become leaders.', 36),
(382, 18, 18, 19, 'And moving on to the third point. We think that, in a way, the government supporting hero programs can be seen as supporting violence. If you look at classic hero programs like Marvel movies. It is pretty clear that the characters are using violence in order to solve their problems. However, removing an insane amount of these programs is not realistic because they are some of the biggest industries in the world. This is why instead of including female characters in hero programs, we should keep supporting feminism like we have in the past.', 36),
(383, 19, 19, 20, 'Now I\'d like to move on to my rebuttals. The government side said that in hero movies, women tend to fall in love. And this is not telling girls to be independent. And yeah, but just because girls become. Just because women fall in love with a hot guy, for example, that doesn\'t mean that they won\'t be willing to become leaders. ', 36),
(384, 20, 20, 21, 'And the government also said that women are this. But that doesn\'t necessarily mean this motion doesn\'t necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable. Not including female characters in hero programs can be seen as a message that women are incapable of resolving conflict. But that doesn\'t necessarily mean this motion doesn\'t necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable of being independent and resolving conflict.', 36),
(385, 21, 21, 22, 'In summary, women can be seen as having roles for unsuccessful characters because of the norm that we have right now. This motion can lead to women being portrayed as unsuccessful characters and that children might receive the wrong message, such as they might feel reluctant to become leaders, which is the opposite of the message we\'re trying to send out. And supporting current hero programs is not something the government should do because, in a way, it\'s supporting violence. Thank you.', 36),
(386, 22, 22, 23, 'In the world, there are many, many movies of hero programs where the male is the leader. So, it means that there also have accessible people, not only female but also male. ', 37),
(387, 23, 23, 24, 'Second, they have said that children are part of the hero program. For example, Kamen Rider is a hero program that boys also watch. But we already defined that we can make not only a female leader but also a male leader, right? So, we don\'t say that Kamen Rider\'s leader is female. But that program can continue with a male becoming a leader. ', 37),
(388, 24, 24, 25, 'And third, they talk about violence. So, violence shows how strong they are. Even if the woman becomes a leader, they can show strength to the people who are watching. And I\'m gonna explain later, too. And also, even if they use violence, it means that males also use violence, right? So, they explain that males can use violence, but women can\'t use that, right?

(389, 25, 25, 26, 'So, I\'m gonna talk about reconstruction. First, we think that, for example, Marvel or Kamen Rider has a female hero, right? For a supporting role. But why is it important to become a leader? By making a female a leader, it will be a model for everyone that females also can become a leader in society, right? Because now in the world, there are many leaders that are male or some male and fewer leaders that are female. ', 37),
(390, 26, 26, 27, 'And if we take this notion, we can have a good effect for children in society. First of all, about children. As the first speaker has said, they have a good effect on children because children always watch hero programs. And it will affect people. For example, Kamen Rider, children watch every Sunday morning, right? And children watch for the long term. So, we feel that it is general that females will become a leader, right? So, children can have less of an image of a gender gap. Even if they get older, they have no feeling of having a gender gap. ', 37),
(391, 27, 27, 28, 'And also, why this is good for society? If the female character becomes a leader in a hero program, it will be the movement that females become a leader in society, right? Because hero programs are watched not only by children but also by adults, right? Like Marvel or something like that is also popular among adults, right? So, this is a good effect for society. ', 37),
(392, 28, 28, 29, 'And they have said about violence. So, I would like to explain more. So, most hero programs like Kamen Rider or some other hero programs have a person affected by evil, right? So, this person is mostly girls or people who have a weak situation, right? But this is not equal, right? So, by women becoming a leader and so strong, it will remove the image that girls are weak and males are strong, right? For these reasons, we would like to proudly support this motion. Thank you.', 37),
(393, 29, 29, 30, 'We believe Hero Program is for those people who are children, right? Hero Program can make children inspired and shape their identity and thoughts in childhood, right? So if we have an issue or problem that is given in, for example, gender discrimination or another problem, if we can make that, we believe both children\'s dreams will be crushed and we believe that as a result, those societies will be counterproductive for those females, right? So we\'re proud to oppose.', 38),
(394, 30, 30, 31, 'Today\'s debate, let me have two arguments. One, why will this motion make females counterproductive? Two, let me compare the paradigm between the government and opposition, right?', 38),
(395, 31, 31, 32, 'So firstly, let me make a rebuttal of what the previous speaker was talking about. So the government\'s main case was solving the discrimination of those people by having a leader, right? But as my first speaker was talking about, my first speaker clearly talked about that these data schools are providing female characters, for example, Marvel. ', 38),
(396, 32, 32, 33, 'Moreover, my first speaker talked about that those female romantic loves won\'t be solved by those leaders, by providing leaders, right? The reason was, I think that romantic things are not just because of not having leaders, but this is because of a general narrative, right? Even though if we take this situation, those romantic scenes won\'t be taken, right? Those romantic scenes will be remade, and we believe this motion is inappropriate, right? ', 38),
(397, 33, 33, 34, 'Moreover, what they talked about was that they said that children won\'t change their images, and it will influence better to the society, but our side completely talked about that this certain image will make females counterproductive, and we believe this is unjustifiable, right?', 38),
(398, 34, 34, 35, 'So moving on to my argument, one, why will this motion make counterproductive for those females, right? So let me make a clear analysis of what is HERO. Two points. One, HERO makes a dream for every child, and it\'s a certain definition called inspiration for children. Two, it will make strong messages for every people, and for, no, it will make strong messages for the people in today\'s society, right? So the reason why it will make a dream for those children is that children see those HERO programs for a long time, right? In childhood, children see those HERO programs on the screen, and they have a dream that they want to be a HERO, right? So every people have an experience for having a dream that they want to be a HERO and seeing those HERO programs, right? ', 38),
(399, 35, 35, 36, 'And second, it will make a strong message in today\'s society. But today\'s debate is like a thing we have to talk about, that there\'s like two messages, right? There\'s two messages. One, it\'s for like boys\' messages, and two, there\'s a message for like those girls, right? So mainly, let\'s just talk about messages of like girls and boys. We believe like those kind of HERO programs are not just particularly for like boys and particularly for like those girls, right? Like we believe there\'s like a lot of HERO programs, such as Pretty Cura, right? If we see Pretty Cura, most of the time, like those kinds of girls are going to be the leader, right? What we want to say is that like if we see HERO programs, it\'s like mainly for action for like those boys, right? Boys mainly see HERO programs, and they\'ll be attracted, right? Pretty Cura is for like girls, so that\'s why leaders are given.', 38);

It will hinder boys\' like narrative, and we can make like those kind of female, we can crush like those kind of children\'s dream, right? So like those messages are really strong, and as we make female leaders, what will happen is that as my first speaker said, those kinds of females will be in like an unsuccessful situation, or they\'ll be like in a situation that they\'ll be criticized by like those society, right? So as a conclusion for my first argument, when like those kind of female leaders are included, they\'ll be in a bad circumstance.', 38),

So as we like give like those kind of problem from adults, as if we make that, it will just hinder the dreams of children, and hindering like those dreams of the boys as we hear like those HERO program.

(404, 40, 40, 41, 'Okay, thank you, speakers. So we are seeing that the women are so marginalized that, you know, the society pushes the message that women should be the more housewife, becoming the other women, not becoming the leadership, and so forth. ', 39),
(405, 41, 41, 42, 'But we believe that because the society requires women to become more such things, so used to be the make a boyfriend and romantic love, that this kind of social pressure is making a woman more so unfair, and it\'s not good.

(406, 42, 42, 43, 'So basically, I\'m going to talk about three things. Firstly, engage with the opposition\'s cases. So what is the hero story, and the kinder or the boy\'s dream or not? Secondly, the principle level, whether it is justified, this social structure, the pushing the burden for the women and the girls. Thirdly, the practical change, how the effect is going on.', 39),
(407, 43, 43, 44, 'So let\'s engage with the first cross point, whether or not what is the hero story, and the boy\'s dream is going to be right or not. So basically, opposition side is saying that, what is the hero, it\'s a boy\'s dream. So the question is that, whether we don\'t think that they are fitting the motions, or KCPM have said on this debate is. So basically, we are not going to prohibit those kinds of movies, like it\'s balanced. If you want to see the Kamen Rider, who the main character is leaders, then you can watch. And if you want to watch the program, the leader is women, then you can watch it. So this kind of choice is shared. ', 39),
(408, 44, 44, 45, 'So we believe that on our side, some people, some girls who want to watch the movies, cannot consume those ideas at all. So they feel happy and they cannot become good.

So we don\'t destroy the dream of those people, boys.', 39),
(409, 45, 45, 46, 'Secondly, they are also saying that women should enjoy the \"Pri-kyua\" or romantic love. That is unrealistic. Basically, the first point is that, who decides, who can determine that women should, making a boyfriend or a husband, or supporting someone, partner, is very important things. So this kind of social pressure is unjustifiable because those girls cannot agree on, or consensus for this issue. So having this kind of pressure that woman must like to support a man, such mindset or stereotype itself is problematic. ', 39),
(410, 46, 46, 47, 'Therefore, we are going to increase the, yes, you know, program, which can, the women are taking a leadership, like man or masculinity. This kind of characteristic is required. Therefore, we are proposing.', 39),
(411, 47, 47, 48, 'Thirdly, the pre-cure cases, they are saying that pre-cure, those girls can be happy, but that\'s also unrealistic. Simply because the pre-cure is only women\'s group. The member of the group is only women and girls. So in that sense that, they are regarded as only in the women\'s communities, that the leader is working. But if there were a man, maybe she is a supporter. Those kinds of things, is going to be regarded and perceived. ', 39),

Even on our paradigm, there are those characteristics opposition side is saying, it\'s supported. So that\'s not the important thing. So therefore, the opposition case is not making sense.', 39),
(413, 49, 49, 50, 'Lastly, even if all my analysis was false, but still the social structure or mindset, or social recognition can be changed. So in the status quo, yes, what we have said might be true. The women are regarded as, yes, you know, backfire might be because, but that\'s just only short term. In the middle term and long term, the social recognition for the feminist movement or other kind of people, about these kinds of actions, in that sense, we do not assume that it\'s not harmful. So therefore, the logic doesn\'t stand.', 39),
(414, 50, 50, 51, 'Okay, let\'s move on to the next first point. Whether or not it is justified in the principle level? Can our paradigm be justified or not? So we are saying that as a leader, those program is justified or not. We say that basically the opposition side thinks that the hero should be the leader as a man, but that\'s nonsense because simply, the biological relationship already can\'t be clarified. There\'s no connection. Just because you are a woman, you are incapable of taking a leadership. So there\'s no scientific proof or evidence on this matter. So we believe that this artificial and arbitrary structure is so problematic. ', 39),

(417, 53, 53, 54, 'We think that this is not a simple question that if we like include female characters and hero programs as leader all kind of like female and female problems are going to be solved and female leaders can advance in society. We don\'t think that these kind of studies are not being made because now in America or like in other places like Ghostbusters or like other things included these female characters in their ones. However, nothing is going to change; rather, it\'s going to harm these situations. We like talking our point, but we say these situations will never be solved but in their paradigm but it is going to cause more harm to these people.

Well, firstly they say that like these kind of like gender gaps it\'s going to the gender gap of these children is going to decline.

We\'ll talk later, okay?', 40),
(425, 61, 61, 62, 'All right, so I\'d like to go to the comparison, firstly about the boy\'s dreams. They mostly didn\'t talk about it; well, they sometimes talk about it, but what we say on our side is that the boy streams are going to be deprived. Why is it so? Because we say that if you\'re going to show up some kind of female leaders or other things, some are going to think, \"Oh, my dream is going to be deprived.\" If you think that the females are going to be in there, the boys will be discouraged in their dreams to become a leader. We say that this is going to happen in their paradigm, and we say that because of this, the boys are going to be shrinking in the body.', 40),
(426, 62, 62, 63, 'However, what\'s going to happen to these females if you\'re going to have some, even if you don\'t have these kinds of female characters as a hero?

For example, if some people, if some kind of person, like, for example, the Avengers or other things, if you\'re going to say that these people are actually having some kind of member of the females, you still know these females have the power and have enough ability to be independent, to be or fight as one of the people is as a hero member or like that.

(428, 64, 64, 65, 'Okay, so all through this debate, the government side has been imposing itself to the light burden of proof. So their stance went like this.

(438, 74, 74, 75, 'The opposition claims that the percentage of male first-place winners in competitions is larger than the female population in the country now. While it is true that more males can become leaders, taking this motion doesn\'t crush the dream of being a leader for boys in the future. For these reasons, the effect for girls is more substantial by taking this motion.', 42),
(439, 75, 75, 76, 'Now, moving on to the second point: why is this effective for society? Because people\'s problems are the only TV programs that children want to watch. Children don\'t want to watch news or documentaries about social problems because they can\'t understand enough about these issues. Thus, a program with a female leader has the most significant influence to tell children that women can be leaders, promoting more males to be leaders in the future. This can reduce gender discrimination.', 42),
(440, 76, 76, 77, 'The opposition side raised concerns about potential violence in these programs, but violence is not an explanation that we brought up in our rebuttal. Instead, we argue that this can make males strong leaders in society to solve problems. We believe that taking this motion has a positive effect on society. Thank you.', 42),
(441, 0, 0, 1, 'Ladies and gentlemen, imagine when there\'s a certain criminal that killed your family. Killed all your family and in a bloody situation and you can\'t do anything in those kinds of circumstances. We believe in those kinds of situations, those individuals are suffering from those kinds of coercive situations and they can\'t relieve their stress, relieve their desire in the student school. What we have to do is as a government, we have to respect like those kinds of people\'s choices and those kinds of people\'s desire to have to win to them. These are reasons why we are proud to propose. ', 43),
(442, 1, 1, 2, 'For today\'s debate, I have two arguments, one why we can justify for taking this motion to how society can move to respect innocent people\'s choices.', 43),
(443, 2, 2, 3, 'Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear definition and model for today\'s debate. So like let me have a three-model for today\'s debate. One, we are fully respecting choices and having a constant between the people who are doing dueling to death, which is having a prescription that is before having dueling to death and several steps are given by doing as a rule. And we are preventing a forceful situation like such as using dueling to death as a bad thing. So what we are going to do is second, having government control, which government can like access those dueling to death quickly. And as I said in the first, like constant and having several prescription, government is having like those kinds of prescriptions and receiving like those kinds of prescriptions. So as like forceful situation will be given, government will like stop like dueling to death. Thirdly, but most importantly, we\'re making dueling to death as a fight, as an ability, not like using like those kinds of weapons. And that\'s all.', 43),
(444, 3, 3, 4, 'So move on to my argument. One, why we can justify this motion by taking into the society. So like firstly, let me like clarify what is happening in the status quo. In the status quo, no regulation to fight and respect choices and like no regulation for respecting people are given, right? So the reason is because this society is now like neglecting from having a duel and neglecting from killing each other, right? But those kinds of virtue given in today\'s society is now having a horrible situation for individuals. ', 43),
(445, 4, 4, 5, '<POI> What are the situations when people are willing to duel to death, when they know that like in the 50% possibility, they are going to die? Tell me the context of that, of this debate. ', 43),
(446, 5, 5, 6, 'Okay, the context is really simple. Like when like those individuals have a certain like desire that wants to kill like such a person, we\'re going to respect like those kinds of people. And so if they want to kill someone, like maybe like the opponent side won\'t be like accepted. But when there\'s a such like situation, when the opponent side like accepts like those kinds of desire, like we will like have dueling to death. ', 43),
(447, 6, 6, 7, 'But I will like explain that more in my constructive speech, right? So as I showed in the status quo, like those kinds of like government is not like having a certain respectful situation for this society, right? But the problem is in the status quo, there\'s some individual that have a desire that wants to kill people as a reason to hate people, to wanted to kill people, and wanted to like accomplish their like certain suffer in the status quo, right? For example, like when, as I said in the introduction, when family is killed, like in those kinds of situations, individuals are like now having a certain suffer that they want to kill like the criminals, right? So as an extension of like those kinds of choices, we have to respect like those individuals that want to kill like those criminals, or want to kill like those opponent side. ', 43),
(448, 7, 7, 8, 'So what is the reason that these kinds of like criminals or like these kinds of persons who have the high possibility to be killed are going to do these kinds of like dueling to the death? Why is it so? So like we\'re not saying that like 100% this like dueling to death will be given, but we believe that this motion will like at some like part or at some like point, we can respect and we can like accomplish like those kinds of situations. So for like the conclusion of my like first argument, why we can justify is that we have to respect innocent people that suffer from stress, suffering from like desire that are taken, right? So when like both like choices were now accomplished, and when like those both choices at some like point they like accomplished, we will like take this motion and this is justifiable in today\'s society. ', 43),
(449, 8, 8, 9, 'So second, like how it will like change this society and respect innocent choices. I have like no time, so I will give it to like my second speaker, but we like strongly believe that this motion will like make like those individuals that couldn\'t like accomplish this desire in the status quo can like accomplish and we can save those people that can\'t like pursue like in the status quo. So these are reasons why we\'re part of it.', 43),
(450, 9, 9, 10, 'In dueling, there is always the winner and the loser. It is definitely murder. So even if the loser has already given consent to the risk, that kind of murder is not something that is justified. And we say that choice is not even possible in practical perspective.', 44),
(451, 10, 10, 11, 'So firstly, I\'ll get some responses to the Prime Minister. And then the three things. Firstly, what kind of people opt in dwelling? Secondly, why dwelling is not justified? And thirdly, why legal institutions are better?', 44),
(452, 11, 11, 12, 'So firstly, the idea that the Prime Minister gave you is such a nonsense. So they are practically standing for murder. They said when someone wants to kill someone, we should respect their choices, but we don\'t see any difference from murder. ', 44),
(453, 12, 12, 13, 'And moreover, their main example was the revenge by the families of the victim. We have two responses. So firstly, this is completely out of this debate because as for the criminals, we already have justice system that seeks to the fair punishment for those criminals. And those revenge.', 44),
(454, 13, 13, 14, 'And so secondly, even if the victim needs to kill the criminal, we don\'t see any difference from death penalty because if the government wants the criminal to be killed, they can introduce death penalty. And that is better for them because the family of victim won\'t have to risk their lives to commit their revenge. So their argument falls out of this debate.', 44),
(455, 14, 14, 15, 'And now we want to my constructs. So firstly, why dueling to death is unjustifiable? We say because the choice to opt in dueling is such an irrational and forced choice. So in order to protect people from dying because of the irrational choice, we should not take this motion. ', 44),
(456, 15, 15, 16, 'So three reasons why their choices are irrational. So first of all, but before that, we say the kind of people who want to opt in dueling is the people who have troubles that they don\'t want to solve in courts. But especially, we think mafias are likely to use dueling as their means to solve problems because mafia is a kind of people who can risk their life in their jobs. So and another example is like people who are fighting for their partners. For example, the two men can fight for a woman and those kind of things are so arbitrary and they don\'t want to settle in courts.', 44),
(457, 16, 16, 17, 'So having said that, why those choices are irrational? So firstly, as for mafias, the duelers are pursued by their bosses. Why? Because it is likely that the bosses in the gangs don\'t want to risk their own lives. So they are likely to force their fellow members to get into dueling. And the fellow member has to do dueling because if they reject their job, they will get killed by their boss. So they\'ll take risk and they engage in dueling.', 44),
(458, 17, 17, 18, 'So second of all, the circumstances can force people into dueling. In example that the two men are fighting for one woman, the fight heats up and the woman can say things like, show me your power and now get married with one of you that will win the duel. In this case, the both men will have such pressure and will have practically no choice to not get into dueling and still will make irrational choices.', 44),
(459, 18, 18, 19, 'And thirdly, there is no informed consent. Think about who will talk about the experience of dueling because the loser will no longer exist in this world anymore. People who are considering dueling will only hear stories from survivors. The survivors might talk about how their problems perfectly solved after experiencing dueling, but they won\'t talk about, they don\'t talk about how the victim were suffering or something. So this will lead to possible dealers unseeing their risk.', 44),
(460, 19, 19, 20, 'And fourthly, people cannot experience being harmed, being injured or being killed because that\'s because of obvious reason.', 44),
(461, 20, 20, 21, 'And lastly, why irrational choice is so bad? Because the harms cannot be reversed. That in the dueling, people will die and they are no way to return from this. And also they will have a traumatic experience of seeing someone die or huge injury that will make them impossible to walk for their whole life. And there is no going back before the moment of dueling. So we have to protect those citizens. ', 44),
(462, 21, 21, 22, 'And even if the choice is irrational, the government has a moral obligation to protect its people. For example, there is a seat belt law. When people don\'t put on seat belt, no one will get in trouble except those person, but the government asks people to put on seat belts to protect themselves. So states have the right to protect its people.', 44),
(463, 22, 22, 23, 'So second, why legal institutions feel better? So the next speaker will explain about this more in detail, but because of obvious reasons, courts have less harm because in courts, no one will die, obviously. ', 44),
(464, 23, 23, 24, 'And secondly, this will become a more fundamental solution. Why? Because in dueling, even if we introduce more fair power, people who have more power will live. And this is not something that is justified and the government has to protect especially weak people. Therefore, in order to protect its people, we should not take this motion. Thank you.', 44),
(465, 24, 24, 25, 'So let me explain what the differences are between murder and the people who do duels. There are three differences. First of all, the people who do jewels know probably they might be killed, right? Because a murderer kills somebody thinking they won\'t be killed the next day or something like that. So this is the first difference. The next difference is that both have a clear aim to fight. This is because the first speaker has said that there is mutual consent before they go to do duels. So and then the third difference is they do it for themselves and have a strong will for each other. They have a strong will, and I\'ll talk about it later too, but they have strong wills to fight others. So they have the will to kill by the fight. And this is the difference. So I would like to move on to the rebuttal.', 45),
(466, 25, 25, 26, 'The opposition side has said mafias do pressure to the member of the gang or something like that. So people who do jewels might be the member of a gangster or etc. So they might have pressure from mafias. But we have two rebuttals. First of all, they will have preceding to do that, as the first speaker has explained at the definition. ', 45),
(467, 26, 26, 27, 'And secondly, the government already knows which is the gang, for example, Yamaguchi-gumi or Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi. And the government has to be strict in the research. So I will explain that later too.', 45),
(468, 27, 27, 28, 'Next, about the fight for like two men fighting for a woman. So the government will do the research. What are the aims to do duels? These examples are maybe not a good aim to fight. So maybe the government will research about that. Maybe like you cannot do the duel. ', 45),
(469, 28, 28, 29, 'And next, we would like to rebut to informed consent. So why this is not true, because they have that risk that the winner says him or herself about he\'s a bad guy or something like that to fight with. So they have well that like others can say anything about that if he or she loses. ', 45),
(470, 29, 29, 30, 'So I would like to move on to the reconstruction. And they also talk about our second argument and about changing society. So we think that changing, they said if we don\'t take this motion, we can have less harm. But nowadays, there are many murders. There are many murders to kill someone. But we think that we can reduce the crime by murder because they can reflect their minds by doing duels. This can be a point that can reduce the number of people who don\'t want to be killed by someone. So this is a benefit for our side.', 45),
(471, 30, 30, 31, 'So our first argument about our argument was the initial hate. We can respect individual hate and do the drills. So they have rights. And if we don\'t take this motion, is it difficult to fulfill? Not like difficult to fulfill, right? So if we take this motion, we can reflect their minds that by not being arrested or not illegal, and this is the only choice to reflect their feeling and suffer.', 45),
(472, 31, 31, 32, 'So next, I would like to talk about it is okay to urge ways to do duels that the government urges ways to do duels. So this is necessary to save the choice that respects the individual. So these drills give people the reflection, right? This means that the government can pursue their freedom. So the government has the responsibility to make options for people to make them happy or make freedom.', 45),
(473, 32, 32, 33, 'So maybe they might say mutual contents are not good because not good or like they cannot find the people who have pressure from others. But recently, we had lots of information to research everything, even if it\'s the information of gangs or other secret organizations. By this research, we can prevent fights that people do drills by tops pressure, tops, or mafia\'s pressure. So for these reasons, we would like to strongly propose the motion. Thank you.', 45),
(474, 33, 33, 34, 'I think they\'ve already lost this debate at the point when Deputy Prime Minister told us that killing based on the aim of gangs or killing based on relationship is something unjust. ', 46),
(475, 34, 34, 35, 'On the other hand, when the Prime Minister told us that the desire to kill other people is justified and the government needs to respect that, we don\'t really understand where the criteria are being drawn to begin with. ', 46),
(476, 35, 35, 36, 'But second of all, we told you that that criteria in itself is obviously going to be arbitrary. They either have to ban everything or they need to allow individuals to duel to death in any circumstances at the point when the Prime Minister told us that the primary principle why we have to allow it is the desire to kill other people and the rational mindset that they have. When the fight between relationships is due to the rational mindset, as they say, we think that they have to agree in the contextualization that we have provided from the side opposition.', 46),
(477, 36, 36, 37, 'Several independent responses to a side opposition. First of all, they told us they have this desire to kill other people and the government needs to respect that. I\'m going to have a substantial why killing other people in itself is morally wrong. But before several independent responses, number one, we tell you that it\'s completely an unrealistic characterization where many people have this desire to kill other people. You don\'t often see those people to begin with because your morality in itself is going to pressurize your desire to kill other people. And obviously, I think in the vast majority of cases, people will even think about killing other people as their desires. ', 46),
(478, 37, 37, 38, 'But second of all, even if you agree to a certain extent that those psychopaths exist under the status quo, those people wouldn\'t be fulfilled by dueling to death. Because most of the time, those psychopaths\' aim is not to kill other people by fighting. Their goal is to batter others, is to abuse others and to torture others with you standing upon the person who you are torturing upon, right? Those cases happen when people sexually assault other people and after that, murder that person. Or those instances come when people use your gun and mass shoot everywhere. That\'s the desire that those individuals want to have, the desire that you are actually oppressing those individuals and that person cannot even revenge to you. These kinds of emotions are urging them to kill other people and we don\'t think fighting with other people by fist to fist is going to help their desires to begin with. ', 46),
(479, 38, 38, 39, 'But secondly, they told us that the criminal justice system people, like the victims, want to kill other people, want to kill the perpetrators that killed your family. Several independent responses to that. Number one, we tell you that those murderers are going to be put on justice in the criminal justice system and we don\'t necessarily think that this is inside the debate to begin with. We think that it\'s irrelevant. ', 46),
(480, 39, 39, 40, 'But secondly, we tell you, even if that is true to a certain extent, we tell you that obviously that perpetrator is not going to agree to the fight where he has the possibility to be killed. I don\'t know what they are talking about to begin with. We don\'t think that the benefit that they are talking about is actually going to be tangible.', 46),
(481, 40, 40, 41, 'So two things that I\'m going to be talking about in my debate. Number one, I\'m going to be talking about why the counterfactual on their side is going to be worse off and why the counterfactual is going to be better off on our side of the house. Number two, I\'m going to be talking about why killing other people in itself is something morally wrong.', 46),
(482, 41, 41, 42, 'First of all, talking about why the counterfactual is going to look like. I think that the leader of opposition did a really great job by providing a certain kind of context that we need to debate in this debate, right? These kinds of contexts are like arguing between a relationship or arguing between gangs or financial troubles that happen under the status quo. ', 46),
(483, 42, 42, 43, 'So let\'s look at it one by one. First of all, when it comes to the context of the relationship, I think that it wouldn\'t be solved in any kind of circumstances to begin with, right? Even if you win by killing or harming other people, the fact that you killed someone and the fact that you harmed the other person is going to force you to have a sense of regret, right? Because in general, in society, it\'s regarded to kill other people as a morally wrong thing. It is regarded morally wrong to harm other people, right? And I don\'t think that it\'s going to change even after taking this motion. The vast majority of citizens are going to think like that, right? And that influences your idea as well. So even if you win that case, even if you get that female, we think that it is not going to make them happy. But rather, like whenever you look at your partner that you have won by dueling to death, you have this sense of regret that you actually have killed that person and that you did something morally wrong that you shouldn\'t even exist under the society, right? ', 46),
(484, 43, 43, 44, 'But secondly, we tell you that when it comes to like financial trouble, we say that the counterfactual is far more likely better than we can provide on our side of the house, right? The court can objectively decide who actually has the responsibility to pay to someone. And we think that this is completely better because it doesn\'t involve an arbitrary factor, right? ', 46),
(485, 44, 44, 45, 'So when it comes to dueling to death, your strength or like the fortune that you had is going to matter in the vast majority of cases. ', 46),
(486, 45, 45, 46, 'On the other hand, when it comes to courts, courts can decide objectively based on evidence, based on facts, right? We tell you that it\'s far more better for courts to decide in those instances as well. Even for the relationship case, we tell you that like talking with the other person is definitely going to be better because you will no longer have this sense of regret even if you can win that person. When you win that person, you can win that person and that is going to be, that\'s going to satisfy you for a long time.', 46),
(487, 46, 46, 47, 'Briefly, why killing another person is regarded as morally wrong thing? Like I think in general, people would agree that killing other people is morally wrong thing even with a consent, right? Even when you see the instance of gang having a dispute with consent, still you regard that as something morally wrong thing, right? ', 46),
(488, 47, 47, 48, 'And we tell you that the states have to follow the general principle that society has in general, right? That means that when people regard something as a morally wrong thing, when people regard hate speech as a morally wrong thing, obviously you need to ban that. The same thing applies here as well. Even if there\'s consent, like when people regard like dispute against, dispute between gangs or helping in committing suicide is a morally wrong thing, we tell you that the state needs to follow that. Therefore, we are happy to oppose.', 46),
(489, 48, 48, 49, 'First, I\'m going to talk about how dueling begins. First, someone has heard it from someone or has a desire to kill someone. For example, if one of the family members is killed by murder, they have a strong desire to kill someone and also have strong hatred for someone. Hatred can\'t be dealt with in other ways. So, when we face this motion, when we face this situation, we can support this motion. ', 47),
(490, 49, 49, 50, 'What is the difference between murder and duels? Murderers are not aware that their actions will lead to someone\'s death, but duelists are aware that their actions will lead to this. Duels are more justified than murder because we are aware that we are going to duel from now on, and this requires the agreement of both parties. By taking this motion, regrets are never formed because we are aware that this action leads to this exact consequence. So, this is justified, and we are going to move on to reconstruction.', 47),
(491, 50, 50, 51, 'The first and second speakers said to respect their choice. The government legalized in the constitution clearly states that the country respects the nation\'s freedom rights, but the government doesn\'t legalize that people don\'t die by intentional action. For example, in some countries, assisted suicide is accepted by respecting one\'s decision to choose this. ', 47),
(492, 51, 51, 52, 'I know that this example and duels are truly different because assisted suicide does not involve killing others. But the common point between duels and assisted suicide is that both involve a person with strong will. Respecting one\'s choice is one of the most important things that the government must make everyone aware of. Even if someone was forced by a strong person, whether to die or not is a personal decision, and this decision cannot be made by others. Whether to die or not is a personal decision, so if they decide to duel to the death, we must respect their choice, and this is the government\'s responsibility. So, for these reasons, we should take this motion.', 47),

(494, 53, 53, 54, 'One is that these things, like the personal lives, are the precious and are the are never going going back or recover after you lose it once. If you lose your life once, you dismiss that your life is not going to be go back again, and if these things are going to dumb by like irrational choices, we think that is very harmful. ', 48),
(495, 54, 54, 55, 'However, the government, even there\'s some kind of like governmental control, we cannot like, we cannot regulate all the things.

We say that the government should intervene and and should not allow any kind of thing because we cannot judge and we should stop any kind of thing.

(496, 55, 55, 56, 'So we say and and now and we think that now it is better than them because we say that in in the present situation, people don\'t have these kinds of choices, so they\'re not going to be rationalized and try to kill a something like a murderer who is strong enough like Muhammad or like death hunting even you\'re going to die or like that.

For example, if you\'re going to see porn movies, people may say that they think it\'s not fun and do not want to watch it anymore. Porn movies are made to try to make more funny things. For example, more radical porn movie. This is the same kind of thing we say that if you\'re going to have these kind of things.

A, because this is oftentimes forced choice. Like we say, the gang member, for example, trouble in partnership is going to be a massive reason for someone to start participating in dueling. And obviously, there is no rational consideration behind that. If gang members, lower-class persons, are forced or told to participate in dueling for financial reasons or land traveling reasons, there is no optional choice to reject that, right? ', 49),

However, duels that apply to this emotion are personal, and the only person whose pride will be hurt is the opponent, who is 100% sure that they have enough ability to have a fair fight, and they know that there won\'t be abuse or torture.

These people who just are so ignorant that they don\'t even know what\'s going on. The key problem to actually solving these kind of issues is to actually letting these people know about what\'s happening in the current situation, actually providing them the correct image.', 51),

(529, 5, 5, 6, 'So moving on to my two points, my first point is that increased media people can be exposed to. So actually, so I would like to explain first, how will actually, how will these medias like, or these, the amount of these videos increase in the current situation. So I\'d like to compare it with the status quo. So in the status quo, when people are basically walking on the street and encounter these kinds of social issues, what will happen is because like, first of all, like the, either don\'t have interest, like they don\'t want to be related to these kinds of issues because it\'s so sensitive. They will actually try to avoid these kinds of situations and not really interact actively interact with this kind of situation. ', 51),

They can actually save, save their savings for like one meal, like they\'ll actually be incentivized to actually, actually take part. All you have to do is just basically take a video of this whole situation uploaded on the internet. It\'s so easy. It\'s, there\'s no reason actually to avoid this. And we believe that actually many kinds of people will actually take action to, in order to just take videos and upload it on the internet.', 51),
(531, 7, 7, 8, 'And the uniqueness here is that because these kinds of popular sites are so popular, trill millions and billions of users around the world are using this.

(532, 8, 8, 9, 'And actually I would like next, I would like to explain why it\'s increasing the amount of these kinds of videos important. So I have two announcements here. First A, that the chances that people can actually see or witness these problems will increase. So the current, the problem in the current situation is that even if these kind of police brutality cases are happening, like only a few people upload these videos. So like not many people can actually have the chance to access to these cases in the current situation. But actually, just as I explained, if we take this motion, the chances that people, because there\'s so many people uploading videos, the chances, definitely the chances that people can actually have one look of these videos will tremendously increase. And therefore the chances that people can actually witness this problem will increase. ', 51),
(533, 9, 9, 10, 'And secondly, we can actually provide many aspects of this problem, not only from one perspective, like only one person standing from one angle, not those kinds of situations, but actually tens of thousands of people can actually take these videos and actually understand the whole image of the current situation.', 51),
(534, 10, 10, 11, 'And the importance here is leading on to my second point. My second point is spreading the correct image. Before I move on, yeah', 51),

(536, 12, 12, 13, 'That\'s what has been said.', 51),
(537, 13, 13, 14, 'So next, moving on to my second point, spreading the correct image. Okay. So what does the status quo look like here? Like because there\'s several reasons why we cannot portray this correct image of these kinds of social actions. For example, the news does not have enough screen time to actually focus on one, one problem. Like, because they only have like, I don\'t know, 30 seconds to portray a picture. Like they have to cut off many other kinds of parts and only show, for example, the parts that the, that the black person was shot by the white person, but by the white, um, by the white police officer. And like, because of this, people don\'t actually understand what is, what has happened in the background. They don\'t even know who actually started the fight, who actually, like what kind of, what kind of, um, conflict happened in the past. So people basically cannot understand the background.', 51),
(538, 14, 14, 15, 'And secondly, because for example, only one video or only one image like has been posted on the internet. They don\'t even know what it\'s actually the whole image, the whole, um, the whole image of the situation. They cannot understand. They cannot perceive what has actually happened.', 51),
(539, 15, 15, 16, 'But after we take this motion, because we can increase in number, just that I explained previously, what will happen is that people, people in general can actually understand what is happening because not only the scene they\'re getting shot, but also like, like from the whole start, like who started the fight or like who actually started the punch, who like those kinds of like, like those kinds of cases can actually, people can actually perceive and people can actually understand by looking at those cases.', 51),
(540, 16, 16, 17, 'And obviously the most cases of police brutality in the United States, like are usually the police, the white police officers, like starting, start to like, um, starting to like, uh, argue with these kinds of black people. And in most cases, actually the white people are the, are the people who have started this whole cases. And they\'re the actually, they\'re the actually ones who are bad. But if we only portray the scene that someone has been, um, someone has been, um, punched by someone, like people can not actually know what\'s happening and the impact here is that basically what is crucial in solving these kinds', 51),
(541, 17, 17, 18, 'This motion will only lead to, and will only do such a shallow thing, and only solve the very thin and outer layer of the problem that we are actually facing. So our stance is that if we have the money to financially reward those people, it is better to use those money to things like the education for the, for things like the better education for the police, and the additional aptitude test for the police. And this will lead to much better consequences and much deeper solution of the problem that we are actually facing. ', 52),
(542, 18, 18, 19, 'So we have three arguments, and first is that this motion will only, will not solve the core of the problem, and second that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the core of the problem, and third, I will talk about the alternatives that we can take.', 52),
(543, 19, 19, 20, 'Our first argument is that this motion will only solve the superficial and the shallow things. So what is the core of this Chinese brutality problem? The issue is that police are abusing their privilege, their job, and their social position to the public. Because police are the institution that supervises the public, they do not have the absolute and clear organizations that supervise those police, unlike the citizens. And because they don\'t have this absolute institution that supervises them, the police have this feeling of superiority towards the public.', 52),
(544, 20, 20, 21, 'And even if we take this motion, this idea that police are having will not be terminated at all. Yes, the police might have started thinking that they should not do such violent things because they don\'t want to be criticized by the media or by the government or by the public. However, this is just a superficial change. And this will not alter the fundamental idea that police are having, which is the superiority that they are feeling, and which is the true cause of this whole problem. So if we want to truly solve this problem, if we want to solve this problem from the cause, from the true cause, we have to change police minds. However, this motion will not be achieved by this.', 52),
(545, 21, 21, 22, 'But with our alternatives, which I will be talking in my third argument, if we take that alternatives, we will be able to achieve this.', 52),
(546, 22, 22, 23, 'And moving on to a second argument, that people will, that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the truth, not the cause of the problem. So also the public will start acting with superficial motivation, and also that they will not, and also they will not move on to action actions to prevent or interfere with the police brutality. So in short, what I want to say in this second argument is that this motion will only lead to superficial actions that only damages the society and not solve the actual problem.', 52),
(547, 23, 23, 24, 'Moving on to a third argument, which is the alternatives. If we have the money to financially reward those people, why can\'t we use those money to do better education of the police? Well, when we see the reality, it is the fact that the quality of police is declining severely. And if we were able to enhance the quality of the education that police are having, we\'ll be able to improve the police. And the improvement of police will not only lead to the solution of this police brutality, but it will also lead to other better consequences, such as safer and better security of the society. So for this reason, we believe that we should not take this motion. And if we want to solve the problem, we should spend those money to other things such as the education of police. Thank you.', 52),
(548, 24, 24, 25, 'So, our goal is to find the police for terrorism. And this is because of their public eyes. And this can be made by giving financial rewards to people. So, I would like to add an argument.', 53),
(549, 25, 25, 26, 'So, our third argument is if we take this motion, we can protect people who do demonstrations. And we have two reasons. First of all, about informed consent. And if we take this motion, we can do that. And second, people who participate in demonstrations can prepare for demonstrations because they can realize what the police can do or not. Like putting gases or etc. And this makes these people safe.', 53),
(550, 26, 26, 27, 'So, what is important? So, we have imagined that they have a strong will to participate. Like these people have a strong will to participate and don\'t care about their lives or their bodies to show their wills. But this is not true because they have rights to be safe because they are all humans and have rights to be safe. So, if we take this motion, we can protect those people. So, the opposition side must protect the police. But our side can protect those people. And this is our majority. ', 53),
(551, 27, 27, 28, 'And moving on to the rebuttal. So, they said about two arguments and one alternative. So, about the arguments. So, they said that if we take this motion, we have harm for the police. However, in this debate, police who do brutality can find by using SNS and upload it. And our world can change police minds because police have to be like not to discriminate people.', 53),
(552, 28, 28, 29, 'So, their alternative was to educate police and it\'s better than pay people. But we were financially, but police are all human and have feel to, maybe someone have feel to discriminate someone like black or Spanish or et cetera.', 53),
(553, 29, 29, 30, 'So, but our side is better than the opposition side because our side has more public eyes because they wanna upload videos and get rewards. ', 53),
(554, 30, 30, 31, 'And this movement will also affect the media because media will broadcast those videos, etc., etc. And police don\'t want to be on the TV as the opposition side also said. So, they will stop doing brutality. So, our side is more better.', 53),
(555, 31, 31, 32, 'So, I would like to move on to why is better than our side. So, we have, people can get financial reward if they upload video of police brutality. So, it will make the increase the number of video. So, at the opposition side, they also have videos about the police brutality. But our side is have more number of video. So, their side, the number of video is, they have few videos. So, there\'s an edited video in a worse way on purpose. So, if we take this motion, these videos will increase because many videos will be uploaded. ', 53),
(556, 32, 32, 33, 'So, in the status quo, we have few videos. So, if they have the edited video and can make misunderstanding, it is not reliable. But if these would be uploaded on SNS, it will be the truth on those people. So, for example, a crew person received police questioning from a Japanese police last month or this month, maybe. But the person who took the video edited and just uploaded only the scene that the police hold the crew. But the police just did a questioning and there were no racial discrimination. ', 53),
(557, 33, 33, 34, 'So, after plan, many people will upload some videos or upload many videos. So, some videos are the edited video. But others are the whole scene of the action. So, the number of the police who do brutality will decrease because we have public eyes more than opposition. So, maybe we have to consider about the video violence. ', 53),
(558, 34, 34, 35, 'And if the children watch, it might have a bad effect on them. But this is not true because it is a social issue.

(559, 35, 35, 36, 'This is not enough situation, producing only violence and only a number of violence and muter. Because there is still discriminately thinking of people and police.

(560, 36, 36, 37, 'Now I\'m going to move to the rebuttal. The government says that if we take this motion, we can protect people who participate in the demo. But this is not true. Rebutting isn\'t, can\'t protect people. Because this is only giving money to people, and the government doesn\'t have any radical solution, does not provide any radical situation. So this is not, this can\'t protect people. Because the police are prejudiced, and the people\'s thinking that they can\'t change, don\'t change. ', 54),
(561, 37, 37, 38, 'And the second, the government says that we can change police\'s mind. But these posts contain emotional posts, and these posts can\'t say the truth, totally true. So these posts can\'t change police\'s mind radically.', 54),
(562, 38, 38, 39, 'Next, I\'m going to move on to our argument. You said that \"People who participate in demonstrations cannot be protected with the status quo. But if people watch the video, they can know what the police do or what the police can do.\" But if people know about what police do or something, this does not directly protect them.', 54),
(563, 39, 39, 40, 'Next, I\'m going to move on to the reconstruction and new arguments. If we take this motion, the revolt will become more big. Because there are three reasons. First, big impact more effect government. And second, some people disregard essence and get benefits by using this situation. And third, media is so unstable, and this may cause populism to the world.', 54),
(564, 40, 40, 41, 'First, I\'m going to explain the big impact more effect government. The government side, he said that the government rewards all people posted about brutally police on SNS. But there is a question, how does the government manage a large amount of posts? So this is so hard and difficult. But this is exactly. Effective posts will be watched more by the government than small effect posts. And the government doesn\'t always reward. Like regularly demonstration or little accident. So rewarding all posts are difficult and are so hard. And the government doesn\'t have so much money. ', 54),
(565, 41, 41, 42, 'And there is an alternative to use money for other solutions. Like police, teaching police or something. ', 54),
(566, 42, 42, 43, 'So for these reasons, bigger effect posts take attention of the government. And bigger effect posts definitely get a reward for people.

(569, 45, 45, 46, 'So, we can see the goal of, like, saving the people from brutality and saving the victims like black people and having some movement like hashtag Black Lives Matter.

(570, 46, 46, 47, 'For today\'s debate, I have two clash points, right? So, one, which methods can effectively achieve the goal, which is saving brutality victims to which can lead to proper discourse, right? So one, which method can effectively achieve, right? As I said in the POI, the reason why I did POI is to know how much money to use, right? But unfortunately, or fortunately, the government side said all of the financial reward people will be rewarded, right? But we see that a simple question here, how many Twitter users are in today\'s society? Millions and thousands, right?

(572, 48, 48, 49, 'Two, which can lead to proper discourse, right? So let me like clarify again, what is the government stance, right? The government stance was like the vast majority can\'t understand like those instances. So we have to like increase the amount of reports, right? ', 55),

But secondly, granted that opposition might attack the feasibility saying that this is impossible. We say that we characterize adult children as around 35 to 40, where they have extra income, where they have a stable life. We say this is going to be more than capable of having parents move in. We say this is going to be better for two reasons. Two substantive in my point. First is upon why this is good for elderly. And secondly, why this is good for children.', 57),
(587, 2, 2, 3, 'Let\'s talk about a first argument. Why is this good for elderly? But before I talk about that, let\'s characterize what the elderly really need. What they don\'t need is material consideration because they already have pension fees. They already have money built up from a young age. What they actually need is fulfillment, a care and emergency responses, especially in the age where you are likely to have more health issues or more mental issues. We think that when they live where their husband or wife might have passed away, they might have Alzheimer\'s. They\'re isolated away. We think what these elderly require the most in terms of practical is a sense of fulfillment. And we say our side is able to better prove that.', 57),
(588, 3, 3, 4, 'Before explaining why a world is better, two likely cases upon opposition. That is first is that under their side, they\'re likely to send elderly to retirement homes. The reason why this doesn\'t provide a sense of fulfillment is because these retirement homes are usually consisted of workers who only care about getting money. That means that if they\'re fed up, they\'re only going to give you the bare minimum. They\'re not going to care how their day was. But even if that these workers were able to provide the sense of fulfillment, we say that they\'re less likely and less susceptible to treat any kind of mental or health issues of these parents, just because the ratio of these workers to the number of elderly, especially in this world of aging population and a lack of nursery homes are proven. That\'s why we say that in the retirement homes, this is going to be impossible. ', 57),
(589, 4, 4, 5, 'But secondly, we say that in the case, the best case scenario that we assume that the child can assume and invest and get these elderly their own house.

They don\'t want to care because they already feel bad about getting their own house. They\'re going to love you and assume you\'re busy. That\'s why if you have back pain, you won\'t tell your children. And at this point, we say that issues are more likely to become too late to respond to. We think there\'s going to be a little world in turn, possibly even death, whether injuries or any kind of damage is untreated.', 57),
(590, 5, 5, 6, 'With this in mind, why is our world better? Three reasons. First is because when you live together, you\'re going to be more comfortable sharing your issues.

You see them less, they become a secondary consideration that when you go there, it\'s just going to be a two-hour visit, which it was kind of an obligation, right?

(593, 8, 8, 9, 'Why do we get better fulfillment? It\'s two reasons. First is because we say that we provide a sense of fulfillment because the elderly can watch their grandchild raise up or watch their own child be independent and go on with their lives. We say this is going to be much better. But secondly, is that the problem of the status quo in retirement homes is all the old people do is they just watch TV all day or just play bingo with their elderly friends. This is problematic because this is usually the reason why they don\'t have any kind of sense of living. This is one of the reasons why many people say elderly are more likely to feel depressed because they don\'t do anything productive. On our side, we look for things for elderly to do, such as interacting with grandchildren on a daily basis, perhaps cooking or doing any kind of more chores to help out the family. We say that in terms of fulfillment, our side is better. So to weigh this is that elderly people want fulfillment. We provide them, unlike opposition, where because of our likely cases that are analyzed, this is impossible for opposition\'s case. ', 57),
(594, 9, 9, 10, 'Secondly, why is this going to be better for children? Two reasons. First is that we open up important opportunities for women or single parents who are unable to afford nannies or cannot afford babysitters. That means that they\'re not able to take the jobs they want to take. They have to quit jobs they want to participate because they have to take care of their child and stay at home. At this side, we say that it\'s much better because women are able to seek help from parents. The parents are staying home. And instead of perhaps like affording some kind of stranger or some kind of shady babysitter, you\'re able to ask your parents for help to look after your grandchild. We think this is going to be better for both elderly because they could look after their grandchild. You\'re going to provide seek and affection, but also good for the child themselves because they can have their own child looked after.', 57),

Is that we think that in the status quo, these children usually feel regret, not feeling depressed because they weren\'t able to do what they could have done when their parents might have had an injury at a retirement home when they couldn\'t find out their injuries during the two-hour visit of an obligation. We think these can often be the stamp for suicide or differentiation. For instance, we take care of mental health and prevent any kind of regret happening.', 57),

(597, 12, 12, 13, 'But secondly, is that this isn\'t susceptible because since they\'re parents now, we think they will have decent footing with one other. It\'s unlikely that the elderly would just be super mean and angry and dominant over an adult child. ', 57),

So in our role, even if the children cannot live with the parents, we can support their parents. It is because they can support by the financial. So in the current situation, sometimes the parents cannot have enough money, only the pension. So our side, the children can help by the financial. So for example, if the parents want to hire a helper, the children can pay money instead of their parents. And secondly, even if they leave the superlative, of course, they can meet once a month.

(635, 50, 50, 51, 'Then on the other hand, what we see uniquely from the government side is things like physical health and physical comfort, and direct communication between the child and the parent. This kind of intimacy and this kind of physical proximity is what we can uniquely achieve on government side, and the reason why you should vote for the government.', 61),
(636, 51, 51, 52, 'But then let\'s look at what they themselves talk about in their arguments, right? So firstly, this whole issue about children getting a lot of stress because they have to cope with their grandparents or their parents\' lives and so on. But we negate the very premise that they wouldn\'t be able to coexist, right? Let\'s say like a working mother, and like their high school daughter have really different lifestyles, and have maybe different times to wake up, but they still live together, right? We think that just because you wake up at different times doesn\'t mean that you\'re incapable to live together. I think it\'s very possible for these two members to live happily in the house. ', 61),
(637, 52, 52, 53, 'But even if maybe they might say, oh, if they\'re together all the time, it might lead to a huge burden, etc. You don\'t have to always be together, right? The unique thing about side government is that you\'re always in close distance so that you can check on them when you have to or like when you need to, but that doesn\'t mean that you\'re always going to be standing over them and watching their every move, right? You could always have different rooms, for example, or you have like a lot of like in the first floor, there\'s the first generation, and the second floor, there\'s the grandparents that can also, there can be lots of flexible lifestyles within that one house, where like people can live both independently, but where people can also reach out when they actually do need help. So overall, we think that like the possibility of this a huge emotional cost or like huge disturbance to their lifestyle is pretty low. Also considering the fact that today we have a lot of things like paid leave, or like companies supporting their workers to leave their job in order to support their parents, I think it\'s very feasible for the child to live healthily, even when they have to take care of parents.', 61),
(638, 53, 53, 54, 'But secondly, they talk about how like elderly becomes like overly dependent on the child, and therefore like it becomes like easy for them to give up, etc, right? Two responses. Firstly, like, just because they\'re dependent doesn\'t mean that it\'s something bad, right? We think that it\'s the elderly deserve to get a bit more attention than they do now, considering the fact that they have a lot of mental and physical needs that they can\'t cope by their own. So I think it\'s okay for them to depend on their child for groceries or depend on their child for things like mental communication or like daily chats.', 61),
(639, 54, 54, 55, 'And we think that like the will to live and the will to survive and keep fighting wouldn\'t decrease onside government because you\'re always together with your family, your son or your daughter or your grandchildren. Being with your family together is your motivation to keep living, right? On the comparative, when we see old people dying off because they\'re so lonely in offside opposition\'s world, we think that there\'s a higher possibility that elderly becomes more motivated to keep living, and they wouldn\'t give up inside government\'s world.', 61),
(640, 55, 55, 56, 'So secondly, our second response is that like, in the end, it\'s comparatively better than what we see outside opposition, where like a lot of elderly people do not get the resources they need, do not get the mental support, the attention they need, and they ultimately die off, either from like mental, like lack of mental support, or lack of physical support. So overall, what we see onside government is both the elderly and children living together in harmony, supporting each other, and leading happier and sustainable lives for all these reasons.', 61),
(641, 56, 56, 57, 'Their characterization of elderly people is, to some extent, too much thought. The reason why I know this is because I have a teacher\'s license for junior high school and high school, and I visited a real nursery center, and I know the real situation of how elderly people look like. As exactly, they characterize some people with Alzheimer\'s. Those who have Alzheimer\'s really need immediate dependence right now, immediately. For those people, I don\'t think it\'s appropriate and realistic characterization that those with Alzheimer\'s or those kind of elderly people are capable of taking care of their grandchildren. It is very unrealistic. Rather, we think those with Alzheimer\'s or elderly people are often times, sometimes not, sometimes very getting angry or shouting around at midnight and they start walking around at midnight, and they have to find it. That excessive burden is too much. ', 62),
(642, 57, 57, 58, 'And we think there is no justification suggested by the government side why this kind of excessive care must be necessary except for sending them to the center or helper and why it should be done by children. This kind of justification is still not heard at the last of the debate except for the material benefit of the spiritual or psychological happiness for parents, and I don\'t think that\'s not a good enough reason.', 62),
(643, 58, 58, 59, 'Two crush points I found, first of all, which is better for children, last, which is better for elderly people. Very simple. ', 62),
(644, 59, 59, 60, 'Moving on, first of all, which is better for children. So we are saying is that in order to self-actualize for their children fully in terms of the flee from any specialization to choose whatever job they want, whatever partner they want to stay with, whatever hobby they like to do or the place they live, whatever. This kind of situation to live with parent is very narrowing down their entire choice. ', 62),
(645, 60, 60, 61, 'And they somehow rebuttaled to something. Number one, in terms of the benefit for their children as well, like I say, they can sometimes take care of their son, granddaughter or please kick out this kind of very independent elderly characterization should be kicked out of this debate. Rather, those elderly people are psychologically weak or those really need health care immediately. That\'s why they are not capable of doing that.', 62),
(646, 61, 61, 62, 'And also, in order to take care of those grandchildren, still we think relying on third-party systems such as babysitter, nursery center is much superior in comparison because they have child care knowledge based on theory, for example, the appropriate amount of food, education or emergency medicine, etc. On the other hand, those elderly people don\'t follow that theory. That\'s why we think at least when it comes to taking the criteria of child-caring, still a third-party system is superior rather than relying on these elderly people.', 62),
(647, 62, 62, 63, 'And also, that I confirmed at the rebuttal, is that sense of regret is happening. That\'s why in order to prevent that, they have to stay with parents. I don\'t think so. Because first of all, even right now, I sometimes visit their grandparents\' house, a parent\'s house, on a quarterly basis in a year. And for example, I\'m going to visit them in Golden Week and sometimes Obon and before the end of the year. And that\'s, I think, very good enough to see them, how they are doing. And that is very good enough. ', 62),
(648, 63, 63, 64, 'And also, sense of regret is anyway happening on both sides of the house. Because sense of regret is coming from the fact that people have already passed away, right? Just because you guys are staying together does not necessarily mean the sense of regret to death is suddenly disappearing. I don\'t think, in terms of the amount of the sense of regret, there is not much difference confirmed still.', 62),
(649, 64, 64, 65, 'On the other hand, let me flip the entire argument of the sense of the emotional points. We are saying, Mika-san greatly explained, rather in terms of the sense of psychology, that staying together is worse off. Why is that? Because, like I said, as an introduction, taking care of those parents is a very much burden, right? So they are sometimes shouting around at midnight. They sometimes walk around the street at midnight, they have to find it. It\'s too much. That\'s why sometimes it\'s called カイゴ疲れ, right? You know that. Sometimes it\'s called depression, sometimes it\'s called even suicide, or there are terrible consequences happening. That\'s why, in terms of the benefit of the sense of regret, it\'s much uncertain and rather we think the psychological cost is going to take too much. That\'s why don\'t rely on the affirmative argument. ', 62),
(650, 65, 65, 66, 'That\'s why, in terms of self-actualization for children, this point clearly stands. They can choose whatever job, they can stay with a partner, family relationship, whatever the form they like. They don\'t have to change the place to live; they don\'t need to go to the suburb area suddenly. That\'s why, in terms of self-actualization, I also took the debate.', 62),
(651, 66, 66, 67, 'Looking at two criteria. First of all, their safety. Second of all, their psychological aspect. ', 62),
(652, 67, 67, 68, 'First of all, safety. So, we have already suggested the superiority to this debate, right? In terms of safety, in terms of medication or scientific approach, relying on the center or helper is much superior to those children, because they have enough knowledge or they have enough, you know, they are already professioned based on the nutritious food, based on the what amount of exercise is appropriate to give, and human interaction and so forth.

(653, 68, 68, 69, 'They suggested that, first of all, there is no center available. Okay, by relying on the norm, children better to stay with parent. Because of relying on this norm, unfortunately center is in shortage. Rather, we live on our side that children should stay away from parents by relieving our pardon. Rather, we can have the consensus to send the money to the child care center and the elderly care center and the helper. That\'s why, in order to the amount of the center, this problem is already solved. ', 62),
(654, 69, 69, 70, 'And also, emotion, right? So, I understand to some extent, granted, right? But still, like I say, the kaigotsukare issue, because of depression, suicide, because of that, sometimes they even neglect to take care of them. Sometimes they start bullying their parents. In order to prevent, rather we think, an appropriate amount of separation is necessary for those reasons, rather than all.', 62),
(655, 70, 70, 71, 'Now, adult children are limited, and they are just before overwhelmed. So we need to give them more freedom and for also parents becoming more independent. So we are happy to oppose.', 63),
(656, 71, 71, 72, 'First of all, their government side. It is no necessity for all because first about the communication, like why only they need to communicate with, why the family is the most important. Because this just increases the possibility to not communicate with others because the parents only just depend on the adult children and the people around them. So if we make them more independent and communicate with more other people, this is more good for their communication. So it is no necessity.', 63),

(658, 73, 73, 74, 'And also about third, about the emotional support. Like, is it necessary to live together? Because like, they were saying that it\'s like they can\'t use this electronic thing and so on. But however, like they can still use their cell phones. But we can\'t talk to them and we can\'t know their conditions and so on. So and also, as my other speaker said, like they may neglect those things, bullying and those things, it is really emotional support. So to prevent the situation, it is no necessity.', 63),
(659, 74, 74, 75, 'And about their health problems. They were really talking about like they can\'t go to the helper and those things.

So we can also solve these communication problems, too.', 63),

So like they can do timetables and so on. But however, they first of all, they live together. So the adult children have to make up time. It is certain. So but time is very important for everyone. Right. So it is it\'s not good to intervene in their time. ', 63),
(661, 76, 76, 77, 'And also, again, about the emotional cost. If it\'s the if their parents have a serious disease, they will definitely become tired to support. So it is more good to use a professional helper because they know really about it. So it\'s not tired. So it is very necessary.', 63),

(664, 79, 79, 80, 'Start with the elderly. Many of the elderly in the status quo die from loneliness; they\'re unable to go to supermarkets because the supermarkets are like 50 miles away in extreme rural areas. So many of the elderly suffer from this kind of emotional and physical burden of being away from their family, being away from people they\'re comfortable with. We think that this sort of physical and emotional support is something that can only come from living in close proximity with their family, and we see that that sort of support is what the elderly need the most. So we think that this debate mainly came down to the question of which has more benefits for the elderly and the children. ', 64),

(666, 81, 81, 82, 'First, on the elderly, we think that opposition overall gave us not much of an explanation of how their side is comparatively better than our side in terms of giving a better life for the elderly.

(667, 82, 82, 83, 'First, they told us that financial aid is enough, but as we told you from the very first speaker, financial aid isn\'t what the elderly need. We say that what the elderly need is physical help like going to the supermarket to get groceries that they need or being able to walk around the house, being able to talk to someone about their health issues and so on. ', 64),
(668, 83, 83, 84, 'Second, they told us about hiring helpers and so on, right, but we told you, we told you that like daycare and like those helpers are lacking, especially within an aging population, like in Japan. But we also said that there are unique benefits that come from the children and the family of the family members of the elderly helping them because they\'re more comfortable in that situation. They\'re more comfortable talking about their health issues, and also, they\'re able to physically help within their own household, like help them around the house, help them get down the stairs, and so on.', 64),
(669, 84, 84, 85, 'Third of all, they talked about how an online environment is possible and so on, but we\'ve told you that these elderly are not very good at using these technologies in the first place. ', 64),
(670, 85, 85, 86, 'But second of all, we say that seeing your children\'s face once a year isn\'t enough for these elderly. ', 64),
(671, 86, 86, 87, 'So what have we told you under government? We\'ve told you that first of all, they need physical help right, they can\'t drive to the supermarket because it\'s so far away, or they have health issues that keep them from getting around properly around the house, and so on, and we think that this sort of physical help is uniquely achieved under our side because you\'re able to live under the same roof, which means that you can help them around the house or help them get the necessities that they need, and so on. ', 64),
(672, 87, 87, 88, 'But second of all, we also told you about how there\'s emotional help right, you\'re able to live in a comfortable environment with people that you care about, the people that care about you, and you\'re more likely to talk about your health issues and so on, and we think that that\'s a unique benefit that comes under our side that cannot be achieved under opposition.', 64),
(673, 88, 88, 89, 'The second of all, let\'s talk about the children opposition told us that there\'s going to be sort of extreme dependency, but first of all, we don\'t see why that\'s necessarily bad right because the children were also taken care of by their parents when they were younger. And we think that we don\'t see why they shouldn\'t be doing that once they become older right. So we think that because these children were dependent on their parents when they were older, we think that these children are justified, and these parents are justified in depending on their children in later life.', 64),
(674, 89, 89, 90, 'But second of all, all the cases that they talked about, like, even though the web speaker brought up most of them, which is pretty late but we think that those are mostly extreme cases right. ', 64),
(675, 90, 90, 91, 'So together we\'ve told you that three things that are like three benefits of the children. First, they\'ll be able to take care of their grandchildren.', 64),
(676, 91, 91, 92, 'And second, that the sort of, they will have this sort of regret, and they told us that that\'s not going to happen. But we didn\'t see why because we think that this regret comes from being unable to save them or help them when they needed it the most, if they live far away. And we think that that regret will be better under our side. ', 64),
(677, 92, 92, 93, 'And we\'ve also told you the relationship between the generations also become better under our side, no response on that point. ', 64),
(678, 93, 93, 94, 'So we think that overall, the elderly will be saved by this close proximity to their children, and we think that the children can also have a better bond with their parents, very proud to propose.', 64),

(680, 1, 1, 2, 'And next, I\'m going to talk about what is time parenting. The first is ignorance, fear, guilt of the child. Parents often times try to relive their life, their child, because parents failed their life, their effort of life. For example, if they fail in the university exams, they want to do their, they force their children to pass the exam, and they want them to live a part of parents\' life instead of them. But this deprives child the chance to find the passion and self-actualize.', 65),
(681, 2, 2, 3, 'And the second is deprives opportunities of child. The parents often cry from school, and the parents often go, often forced to go to their children from school and piano class, and like that. So if they, if the parents force their children to do that, they don\'t have, they don\'t, children don\'t have enough time to play and don\'t have a hobby and don\'t go out with friends. That is necessary for child\'s health and a dreading identity. Playing with their children causes children\'s heart more, heart more kind, and to play with their friends, to learn many, many about important things, more than a study and other, other skill, like point. No, thank you. So to lose their, to lose these times is, is harm their child.', 65),
(682, 3, 3, 4, 'And the third is preaches academic success of child, and parents often think, parents often think academics and other skills, like piano and sports, is most important, is most important than, than anything else. If they, if they force their children, that is, that is wrong, and that is not for you. Parents, parents, parents may have violence to their children, and parents mind, and parents mind be, be harmed, harmed by their, children\'s mind harmed by their parents. Point.', 65),
(683, 4, 4, 5, 'And, and the, and, and more parents often their children become first place, and they teach their child, other friend, your friends is in a mind, in a mind for you, and, and they teach their children, don\'t, don\'t, don\'t, don\'t. Point. Don\'t, do not become friends, then, and, friend, and, then parents force their children do only study or do only piano. So, children can\'t their, can\'t anything what they want to do, so, if we, if we take this motion we can\'t protect their children\'s rights for these reasons. But, we won\'t by reparenting. Thank you for listening.', 65),
(684, 5, 5, 6, 'So, I would like to oppose to the governments I have said. First of all, I would like to oppose about the parents who force the children is not good.And next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with other friends. ', 66),
(685, 6, 6, 7, 'First of all, about parents force the children is not good. So, this is not true because children have less ability to choose something.

(686, 7, 7, 8, 'And next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with friends.

(688, 9, 9, 10, 'So, first of all, about the choice for the future. We think this is very good for children.

If the parents let you to go to the schools, children can know what they are good at. And they can draw their potential.

The action might be abusing. And if the parents will be afraid of that action, the children might be abusing. They can school children or can let something to do. And also, we can define that.

(695, 16, 16, 17, 'I\'m going to give some rebuttals before I reconstruct the Prime Minister\'s material. The first thing to note, just on account of their model, is that they haven\'t been able to distinguish between what a tiger parenting and parenting is. On our side, we explicitly told you the importance of elephant impairing, where we prioritized the freedom of the child, and I explained the importance later, but the problem of Opposition is that they simply gave a one-liner about parents having the ability to choose something because they know society and they already study it.', 67),

(697, 18, 18, 19, 'Secondly, is that we kind of deny that premise, because I don\'t think tiger parents are more knowledgeable than other parents.

(699, 20, 20, 21, 'Let\'s look at whether this is just. We think that, as Prime Minister touched upon, we think that the government can intervene given there\'s a very foreseeable tangible harm. That\'s why the government is justified in implementing policies like mandatory education, because without education, society will collapse, and we also ban things like child neglect and child abuse because of the sake of the practical harms that are imposed to children. We think that on our side, I\'m going to prove to you why there are tangible harms, because we think that in our world, the children are rather capable of making independent decisions. The problem of tiger parenting is that they lock that skill up where they force the children to become dolls and become slaves to the dreams that parents were unable to do.', 67),

We think that the importance of the child wanting to play the piano or having friends, it may not necessarily be the practical outcomes of playing the piano, but what\'s important is the fact and the action that these children have the independence and have the capability of thinking for themselves and deciding that they want to do it.', 67),
(701, 22, 22, 23, 'Why is this so important? Because we think that we should prioritize the children\'s freedom over parental rights in these cases. Why? Because we think when we look at cases like where we condemned parents who are against LGBTQ children, we think rather now, we\'re fine and we\'re accepting of children who are able to make rational decisions by themselves. The problem of tiger parenting is that they don\'t grant any kind of free will or independence where we force parents to have authority to look after their children as their dolls. We don\'t think that\'s the kind of future children want either.', 67),

Therefore, the conclusion of the first half of my speech is that we think it is just because there are practical harms where we have to prioritize the children\'s freedom.

If the children are committed a crime, the parents also take responsibility for the victim. For example, if the children are robbed of something in the shop, the parents have to compensate for the disturbance. That\'s the reason why the children are living under the protection of the parents.

(715, 36, 36, 37, 'So, moving on to my first argumentation. Tiger parenting sometimes expands the children\'s choice. The reason is very simple. Parents cannot know what is necessary for the society if they live longer than the children. For example, the parents already experienced many success and failure in their life. Sometimes the parents are used to the raising, and they fail to enter the university. That time, parents think they want to prevent the children from failing by the Tiger parents. That\'s why we show, at least we show, this is necessary for the Tiger parents. If the kids are without the Tiger parents, sometimes the children continue to be raised. And the children also deprioritize their freedom. They also play with their friends. They just play on the piano. After that, the children regret the same as their parents, right? That\'s the reason why the Tiger parents are sometimes important. Because humanity is basically raised. Humanity is not always so stoic for themselves. That\'s why, as the guardian of the parents, guardian of the children, the parents sometimes are necessary for doing the Tiger parents.', 68),
(716, 37, 37, 38, 'Secondly, the important point is the analysis. This policy leads to a chilling effect for the child\'s education. The reason is very simple. The government doesn\'t explain what is the role of the Tiger parents in the necessary education. We think, also, we already banned many stoic education as child abuse. For example, the parents cannot love the children 24 hours in the home. Because it\'s one of the child\'s education. However, in so many extreme cases, it\'s already banned. However, after taking this proposal, some stoic education is also treated as a Tiger parenting. This is so unbeneficial for the parents. Because even if the parents love the children, however, if the parents are punished by the Tiger parenting, the parents cannot live with the children. Because the child abuse, one of the punishments of child abuse, parents have to live apart from the children. That\'s the reason why, in order to avoid this situation, they cannot teach stoically for the children. That is the sole problem of this policy.', 68),
(717, 38, 38, 39, 'Secondly, the parents cannot teach the necessary things for the children. The reason is very simple. Because the parents also cannot know this line of the Tiger parenting. Also, many of the third parties always supervise this parental action. If the children say, I always go to the discipline school, and they say, I don\'t like this studying, the parents force me to do studying. If some people hear this situation, they also sometimes have the opportunity to stand for the child protection center. Also, the child protection center can punish the parents in the first place. Even if the parents and the children love each other, this third party can\'t intervene easily. That is a very unbeneficial thing for both of the families in the first place. That\'s the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we think this policy is not so beneficial in terms of the feasibility point and in terms of the line of this Tiger parenting.', 68),

We think this policy is why the banning is the only way to reduce the child\'s education for the collective.

That is why we never see why this specific forcing and brainwashing from tiger parenting is necessary for the child to be stoic.

(724, 45, 45, 46, 'Secondly, they talked about how the line between, like, normal parenting and, like, tiger parenting is really vague. Therefore, we shouldn\'t take the plan. But no, right? Like, firstly, from the very Prime Minister, we told you three specific reasons of why tiger parenting are uniquely bad, right? Firstly, we told you that tiger parents ignore the free will of the child. So even if the child wants to be an actor, or wants to be a sports player, or wants to be any kind of dream job that they want to be, the tiger parent doesn\'t even let the child speak out. Because their goal is to make their child succeed and live a life that they couldn\'t live themselves. That is why they only prioritize academic success of their child, they neglect any kind of free will or opinion of their own child. We think that this is very harmful for the independence over the self-actualization and the overall long term happiness of the child. ', 69),
(725, 46, 46, 47, 'Secondly, we secondly told you that tiger parents deprived the opportunity of the child, right? This is like making sure that the child never has a chance to go out with friends, that they never have a chance to make their own hobbies and whatnot. All they have to do in their childhood is go to cram school, do piano, etc, etc. All those like cool, like, you know, those classes that they\'re forced to go. So we think that they don\'t have time to play, they don\'t have time to make relationships. We think that this is very crucial for the child\'s health, their mental health, and also for building your identity, right? Because your identity is built from your relationship with others. ', 69),
(726, 47, 47, 48, 'But tiger parents not only deprive the kids to go out with friends in the first place, they tell them that those friends out there in the classroom are their enemies, someone that they have to beat and test, someone that they have to beat in order to climb up the social ladder. This kind of wrong morality, skewed vision of the tiger parents is what deprives a child of having a happy social life. ', 69),
(727, 48, 48, 49, 'But more importantly, we told you that because tiger parents are so narrow-minded, and so desperate for their child\'s success, they ultimately use like harmful and very abusive words saying like, oh, you\'re worthless, or like, why can\'t you do this, etc, in order for the child to succeed. And we think that this puts like the wrong set of morals, as I told you before, and overall ignores the long term success of the child, because they think that, oh, as long as you can get into like a top university, like Harvard or Kodai, like everything is going to work out. That\'s their like narrow-minded, like a plan for their child. And we think that this is never good for the child.', 69),
(728, 49, 49, 50, 'Our second speaker told you that specifically what children need is independence and critical thinking. If they constantly follow the parents\' plans about like, which cram school to go, which universities to go, what like subjects to study, then they will never gain this kind of like self-independence, like self-thinking skills, right? We think that this is especially harmful, because children are never going to be with their parents forever, they have to step out into society at some point. And even if they do get into like a very good university, or like a very good job, once they leave their parents\' supervision, they wouldn\'t know what to do, right? ', 69),
(729, 50, 50, 51, 'So ultimately, even if we take side opposition\'s best case, is saying that the child does leave us with like a successful life in terms of with brand and career, they will never last. So even if they get into like a top university, what we would ultimately see is them falling apart, they wouldn\'t know what to do. Overall, we think that this is this would be this will not be a long term success of the child is something that we can never support.', 69),
(730, 51, 51, 52, 'Finally, this whole issue about whether tiger parenting or relying on the knowledge of other parents is discussed. Some argue that kids lack the knowledge to make decisions. We disagree; kids have access to schools, teachers, and the internet, providing ample resources to learn about their dream jobs. Additionally, we haven\'t seen evidence supporting the idea that tiger parenting is inherently better than other parenting styles. Therefore, in evaluating parents\' capabilities, this argument should not be considered.', 69),
(731, 52, 52, 53, 'The leader of the opposition suggests that in the government\'s world, kids will be spoiled, and parents won\'t be able to discipline them. Let\'s consider the average parent.

This approach is part of average parenting, and it would still be allowed in the government\'s world. ', 69),
(732, 53, 53, 54, 'However, what we don\'t support is parents ignoring a child\'s desire to socialize, confining them to their rooms, enforcing late-night studying, and responding to lower test scores with harmful and abusive words that undermine the child\'s identity and self-esteem.', 69),

This way, children can thrive, be happy, and succeed in the long term, forming the basis of our pride in this proposal.', 69),
(734, 55, 55, 56, 'I think that the one flaw coming from the government, and it\'s that they didn\'t show any workability within this version. They told us that tiger parenting is somehow a bad thing, but it didn\'t really show us why after taking this motion, the parents are suddenly going to change and going to stop tiger parenting. When it comes to domestic cases, we think that parents are still going to do tiger parenting to begin with. Within that, it doesn\'t really change the situation from two reasons.', 70),
(735, 56, 56, 57, 'Number one, we say that it\'s domestically happening. Same as domestic violence, because it is happening under your family, it\'s hard for the government to supervise all of those things. Unlike domestic violence, where your husband, your wife can run out and go to the police, when it comes to children, because they don\'t really have any knowledge about domestic violence or tiger parenting, they don\'t even know the fact that they are being tiger parenting and this is somehow illegal.', 70),
(736, 57, 57, 58, 'But number two, we say that because the harm that is being imposed if children are mild where it\'s a psychological harm compared to domestic violence or child abuse, which is a physical harm, it\'s unlikely for other people to find out to begin with. Secondly, we say that because it\'s a mild abuse, children don\'t really realize and don\'t really go to the police or other places and say that they are being tiger parenting. We think that it\'s unlikely for those parents to stop tiger parenting to begin with.', 70),
(737, 58, 58, 59, 'Secondly, we say that it\'s arbitrary. We\'ve told you that the line between tiger parenting and normal parenting is completely arbitrary. And there are three criteria why it is uniquely bad? Even if it is uniquely bad, we don\'t think how they are going to define tiger parenting to begin with. We say that I\'m just going to decide the amount of time that their children are going to study. We think that that\'s completely absurd. No, thank you.', 70),
(738, 59, 59, 60, 'Secondly, we say that we don\'t think that they have proven the BOP that they have to prove to begin with, because what they need to prove is not that to us, like to a certain extent it\'s harmful, but they have to prove all, or like 90 percent, it\'s most of the time harmful to children. We don\'t think that they have actually proven that BOP to begin with.', 70),
(739, 60, 60, 61, 'Three analyses to look at this debate. No, thank you. Number 1, in a principle way. Number 2, how it\'s going to be for their social interactive ability and last of all, talking about the academic ability that they are going to gain. First one, to a principle.', 70),
(740, 61, 61, 62, 'Somehow, the Deputy Prime Minister, I think that he didn\'t really have any strategy within the state to begin with, because the Deputy Prime Minister said that the practical outcome justifies this debate. Let\'s, if so, let\'s go with practical outcome. But then he said that the freedom of choice for children in itself is something important no matter the practical outcome. The Deputy Prime Minister proposed an example, LGBTQ plus and you shouldn\'t hinder the choice that that person has. The precise difference between LGBTQ plus and the difference between tiger parenting is that being LGBTQ plus isn\'t necessarily harmful. Well, without tiger parenting, without a lady child having any supervision, those children are going to have a bad practical outcome. We think that in terms of a principle argument, what they are just saying is that, consequently, what they are saying is that, let\'s compare with a practical outcome. So I\'m happy to compare this debate within a practical outcome.', 70),
(741, 62, 62, 63, 'So number 2, how about the children\'s social interactive ability? So the Prime Minister told us that they need to have time to play with their friends. Number 1, I say that in general, even they are doing tiger parenting, obviously, they can get once a week to play with their friends. But even in the hard case where tiger parenting is imposing an everyday schedule, we say that there\'s an existence of school, right? When you go to school, they can at least play with your children without any supervision from your parents. You can go out to the play field during lunch break. We think that with school, you can guarantee the social interactive ability for children.', 70),
(742, 63, 63, 64, 'So let\'s go to the academic ability, which is one of the most important parts of this debate. So the side of the government gave us one-liner analysis as the children have irrationality. We don\'t think so from several reasons. ', 70),
(743, 64, 64, 65, 'Number 1, we told you that children most of the time are irrational, right? They don\'t really see the society. They don\'t know how society works. And we think that they are unable or incapable to decide what kind of ability they need in order to succeed or in order to do what they want to do in the society.', 70),
(744, 65, 65, 66, 'But number 2, we say that there\'s peer pressure from your friends, right? When you look at other youth friends playing in the park, you also want to play and join that part because you don\'t necessarily think that studying is as much important as playing with your friends, right? So we think that peer pressure would force you to play with other friends as well. ', 70),
(745, 66, 66, 67, 'And number 3, we say that principly, parents have the right to decide over children\'s ability in terms of medical treatment and civil court because they are under the supervision of parents, right? ', 70),
(746, 67, 67, 68, 'And the side government told us from the opposition and from the government that teachers and the internet would help those children. The point here is that they don\'t even have the idea of asking those things to their teachers or the internet, right? Without any kind of supervision from their parents, we don\'t think that children know what to ask their teachers to begin with, right? ', 70),
(747, 68, 68, 69, 'And secondly, we talked about how independence is going to be lost by Tiger parents. We say that children are gradually going to acquire independence to begin with because we don\'t think that Tiger parents are going to last for high schoolers, right? Children are gradually going to gain independence. And when they go out into high school, although they might be Tiger parenting, at least they can decide what kind of friends that they want to hang out with, what kind of subject that they want to study, what kind of university that they want to study, right? We think that Tiger parents often take place in elementary school or like junior high school to begin with, right? ', 70),
(748, 69, 69, 70, 'And secondly, we told you here that there weren\'t any practical outcomes that came from the side government, right? We think that this is something important in this day because they somehow want to compare this today on a practical level. We didn\'t show any kind of practical outcome that is going to be beneficial for children, right? We explicitly told you the benefit of tiger parenting exists because academic achievement is regarded as the primal success in the society. Children have the necessity to go out to go to a good university and to go to a good high school, right? And we say, we told you that most children are normal, right? They can\'t really decide anything by themselves. And we say that this analysis is the primary analysis for children with one disability.', 70),
(749, 70, 70, 71, 'Okay, three failures from the government\'s side today. So, firstly, they talked about wrong things in this debate. Secondly, they have failed to refute our point. And thirdly, they made no engagement. So, I\'ll talk about those three things from one by one.', 71),
(750, 71, 71, 72, 'So first of all, we like to say that the government has been condemning tiger parents as if they are abusing children. The Whip government claimed that tiger parents say abusing words to children, or the Whip government told you how tiger parents brainwash children. We said that is different. The deputy leader, Opposition, told you how parents who experienced failure don\'t want their children to do the same thing. So, we told you, after all, tiger parents don\'t want to actively harm children, right? Because if parents actively harm children and narrow down their opportunities or narrow down their freedom of choice or whatever, that is called abusing, and that\'s out of this debate. Therefore, their point cannot be the voting issue here.', 71),
(751, 72, 72, 73, 'So, moving on to the second thing. This is about lazy children. We told you, we have proved that tiger parents are necessary in those cases. The Whip government claimed that we need a specific reason why tiger parents are uniquely good, and we did. ', 71),
(752, 73, 73, 74, 'So, we told you how lazy children are naturally lazy. They keep playing games and they don\'t have thoughts about their success or they don\'t have enough free will for their future, so they have no rebuttal for this point. The only rebuttal likely for this point is, oh, if children are playing video games, parents can\'t stop them from playing video games, and that\'s not called tiger parenting. This is so illogical here, because firstly, this actually supports our argument, because we told you, some children are lazy, so if the parents don\'t keep telling children to study or do something else, they wouldn\'t stop playing games, because that\'s what lazy means. ', 71),
(753, 74, 74, 75, 'Secondly, the other side is principally contradicting. They talk about how children are rational and have opinions as to what they want to do, but at the same time, the Whip government describes TV games as something that parents can stop if their children keep doing, and we don\'t understand that, because under this stance, parents have to respect children\'s freedom of will and let them play. But we told you how this is so problematic, and this harm is so tangible, so therefore, as the D Prime Minister said, we have tangible harm if we take this motion, therefore we mustn\'t take this motion.', 71),
(754, 75, 75, 76, 'So moving on to the third thing, why lazy children is the main issue in this debate? Because firstly, we told you that\'s necessary in terms of parental responsibility to children. We told you how parents who have experience than children have to make the choice instead of children, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told you. ', 71),
(755, 76, 76, 77, 'And secondly, we say that the government side has been talking about their best case all the time. They narrowed down this debate by telling you that children have free will from the point of their birth. ', 71),
(756, 77, 77, 78, 'And so thirdly, we engaged to that point because we told you how children have at least some choice who to hang out with or what to watch. So therefore, it is clear that we must not take this motion.', 71),
(757, 78, 78, 79, 'Just The Whip literally conceded that their own side has only like one fault, which was a minor case about feasibility. The opposition side only talks about the feasibility, but we don\'t think that this point is very strong. ', 72),
(758, 79, 79, 80, 'And secondly, we don\'t think the practical, like the enormous harm, which is going to outweigh our harm, that we talk about the paragraph parenting in their point, so we think that this point is very weak, that they should never take in this point. ', 72),
(759, 80, 80, 81, 'But moreover, the opposition side of The Whip has a lot of late arguments or justifications. Like they said, we should judge things like in the court, or the individual should have something like, the individual can have some kind of choices in high school, but they never told some kind of logic of this. And moreover, we think that it\'s too late talking in this debate, so this is late argument, so just please don\'t take it.', 72),
(760, 81, 81, 82, 'Okay, I\'d like to go to our comparison. Okay, well firstly, this debate is very simple. Well, the opposition side never told like how benefit it\'s going to happen by doing tiger parenting or like that, so we think that because of this, there is not this kind of benefit gained by this tiger parenting.

(761, 82, 82, 83, 'We think that the benefit is too small for it, but what the proposition side told you is that there is a lot of kind of harm, which is going to, which they never engage, so we think that this point is very strong, it\'s going to happen in our paradigm, so we think that comparing these two harms, or like these benefits, we think that our point is ending.', 72),
(762, 83, 83, 84, 'Okay, let\'s see in the micro cases. Okay, firstly, we\'d like to talk about which side can lead children to the better future. Alright, so they always say that they can have a better future by having like good jobs or big like academic skills or like that, but we never, we actually engage on this point by saying that alright, well maybe they can go to this like big corporation, but it\'s normal that you\'re going to be fired by bad human relationship or communication with your boss or co-workers and not, cannot be promoted in the society, rather you\'re going to quit this kind of job. These things are happening in the society. We think that there is this kind of like benefit is very little, and moreover, this is not good for these children, right?', 72),
(763, 84, 84, 85, 'So how our side can lead better future for it? Well firstly, we\'re going to say that by banning this kind of like tiger parenting, we\'re going to say that the individuals can have the choice or like the time that they\'re going to think about this future. If you\'re going to have tiger parenting, you don\'t have any kind of time which you\'re going to think about the future. For example, if you\'re in high school, you\'re going to say, oh please go to, you have to go to Todai. If you\'re not going to Todai, you\'re not like a human or like that, or like what these kind of tiger parenting is too pressuring these children, and we think that it is harming a lot. ', 72),

So this, we think that the students are going to think about what kind of like university or like jobs they want to have in the future, and we think that it\'s going to be the better one. How is it so? Because firstly, we say that we can have the aim that we\'re about studying or like that, right? Then secondly, we say that because the individual is going to have like the passion that they want to do it, we think that it\'s going to be the better future. And moreover, because certainly we think that individuality is going to be made, so we think it is better than their paradigm, which these children are being dependent on these parents or like that, and they can never think about like others or like that.', 72),

Well, they always say that the parents are very rational or like that, but we\'re just saying that our side is going to support elephant parenting, right? These parents are going to put the children\'s individual choices, try to see children to have a better future by giving choices, right? Because we say that the children are going to like have like passion or like other things, we think that we can lead to a better future. That is actually why we\'re going to propose.

(768, 2, 2, 3, 'How do we define what a gang is? Three layers. First is that we think the gang is when a member collectively identifies and adopts a group identity, and they create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation. This could look like holding a lot of tattoos, Mr. Speaker, where you collectively identify through group tattoos or any kind of weapons or certain weapons or certain drugs. Secondly, we define what a gang is when the purpose is to literally pursue violence in a crime as a whole organization. And thirdly, we say that in the case that we criminalize gang membership and the police is able to prosecute certain members by identifying that they were part of a gang, we\'re happy to put them through extensive rehabilitation at the moment in which they still don\'t have deep ties with the gang yet. In case that they are deeply involved with the gangs, we\'ll make sure that they go through rehabilitation and they\'re not part of gang culture, such as in countries like America, and make sure that they cut absolutely every single tie with the gangs for the sake of crime.', 73),
(769, 3, 3, 4, 'With this in mind, I\'m going to talk about three things. First, I\'m going to talk about the criteria to criminalize. Secondly, I\'m going to be talking about why this is a just and necessary policy. And thirdly, I\'ll be talking about why we decrease crime.', 73),
(770, 4, 4, 5, 'Quickly, on terms of the criteria to criminalize, we say that if we prove this criteria applies for the sake of gang membership, we should take this debate. We think criminalization comes with two metrics. First, is that if we ensure that criminalization is able to deter the occurrence of crime. That\'s why, for instance, we criminalize guns in a lot of nations because we think that guns are deeply correlated with the actions of crimes, even when guns aren\'t literally the sake of crimes. But just because in terms of correlation, we think that when criminalization deters crime, we think that is okay. ', 73),
(771, 5, 5, 6, 'And secondly, we think it is important to protect the sustenance of society and make sure that society is a more safer and more sustainable place for innocent citizens to live on. If we prove that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter crime or prove that society is going to be a better place, we should take this debate.', 73),
(772, 6, 6, 7, 'With this in mind, I\'m going to talk about my positive manner. First, let\'s talk about why this is a just and necessary policy. I have two layers in this argument. First, let me contextualize what gang members first do. We concede that membership does not equal violence, Mr. Speaker, but we say that gangs are inherently about committing violence and committing crimes.', 73),
(773, 7, 7, 8, 'I think that the fact that you are trying to opt into this cycle, in this organization of violence, in and of itself, is self-indicative of the fact that you are interested in crime. That you want to commit crimes, or you want to steal someone, or you want to brutally murder someone, or you want to rape someone. I think the criminal justice system is there in order to prevent any incentive to commit crimes, and we think that on our side, it\'s more important to stop before actual casualties happen.', 73),
(774, 8, 8, 9, 'How do we see this in the current status quo?

(775, 9, 9, 10, 'Similarly, we think this is analogous to this motion because we say that in the case of gangs, we think just the fact that there are gangs is enough evidence that they\'re probably going to commit crimes in the future, and we want to prevent any kind of casualties from happening. We think that based on this, we think we should win. ', 73),
(776, 10, 10, 11, 'But the second layer is that we think that there\'s many cases where usually youths or juveniles are coerced into this system. Given this, we think our side is going to be much better at preventing coercion. Why is this? Because we think the coercion by force, in and of itself, is firstly an unjust principle, that we should allow these people who have to coerce by using this illegality and this criminalization as an excuse to prevent entering these gangs in the first place. We think that given that youth and juveniles usually enter gangs because of this mild nuance that like, hey, being a part of a gang is cool, especially in countries like Mexico or Colombia, we are able to prevent this because we think that by the state in and of itself saying that gang membership is something illegal, that it is dangerous.', 73),
(777, 11, 11, 12, 'We think that youth and juveniles, first of all, won\'t have any incentives to go on, but secondly, they won\'t be able to be coerced as much because these other gang members know that they themselves are in a predicament where they can be arrested and have their futures taken away.

And I think that the fact that you are in a gang means that you\'re more likely to commit a crime than not doing so. ', 73),

(779, 13, 13, 14, '<POI> So if you\'re going to say that criminalizing is going to be a deterrent, why there are a lot of drug smugglers or doing other frauds, even you\'re a minor, and even you\'re going to be arrested if you did some of these kind of things, what do you think?', 73),
(780, 14, 14, 15, 'Let me talk about my case about why we decrease crime, and I\'m pretty sure that\'s going to be self-explanatory. Two layers. First, is that we actually reduce gangs in the first place. And I\'m sure just in the POI, opposition might say it has no effect. The reason why this is effective is for two reasons. ', 73),
(781, 15, 15, 16, 'First is because I think the fact the state is saying that it is dangerous in and of itself is important. They talked about in the case of scams, but we\'re able to decrease that because we\'re saying that even trying to be a part of an organization that does scam in the first place is bad. Given in the status quo, there\'s not enough deterrence. We think our side is just like an enhanced version of this. ', 73),
(782, 16, 16, 17, 'But secondly, it\'s because I think that on our side, like there\'s a lot of cases where police can\'t do anything, even when people are on motorcycles or holding bats. But on our side, we allow the police to prosecute them at any moment when they are suspect of being a gang. Why is this so important? Because we think organized crime is more important than individual crimes. The fact that youth and juveniles, this is going to be more like magnitude of crimes because just in terms of influence and money and authority, we think the gangs are much more dangerous. ', 73),
(783, 17, 17, 18, 'And this is the comparative that on their side, they can\'t do anything. They can only arrest people based at the moment in which they do commit a crime. We want to prevent future casualties and bury them.', 73),
(784, 18, 18, 19, 'The government side talks that as if we\'re going to criminalize something, that all kinds of crime is going to be prevented. We think that these things, well, if we can do it, we think that it\'s good. But even now, in the present situation, even if you criminalize some kind of like drugs or drug smuggling or like fraud, it doesn\'t be a deterrent. Rather, it\'s going to say that these cases are going to increase on the case of like minors or others. And actually, we think that it\'s going to actually harm the society. That\'s actually why we\'re going to say that we should not criminalize gang star membership because we want to protect the future of the minors and others.', 74),
(785, 19, 19, 20, 'All right. Before going to our argument, I\'d like to talk about, I\'d like to say about two things. Well, firstly, they say that these kind of people who are a gang member, it\'s the people who are going to do future crime, to rebuttal here. Firstly, this is actually one of the stigmatization, right? If they say that as if all members of the gang member is going to commit a crime, we say that this is not true. Because there are a lot of people like the people who are doing like cooking or like others, it doesn\'t commit a crime. ', 74),
(786, 20, 20, 21, 'Or like, secondly, we say that other people, and secondly, we say that it is very vague until who you\'re going to punish. It is very vague for it. And we think it is unjust to punish something, even the criteria is very vague.', 74),
(787, 21, 21, 22, 'We\'d like to go to our argument because we\'ve finished our point. Alright. Going to our argument, we have three things to talk about. Firstly, we\'d like to talk about the fundamental ideology of punishing individuals. Well, firstly, as our stance, we\'d like to say that we are going to welcome punishing the gang members who committed the crime. We oppose punishing the gangs who didn\'t commit the crime. For example, the cooks or the people who are like cleaning the room or like, yeah, these people doesn\'t commit harm others or doesn\'t did something wrong. And some people also didn\'t know the truth that they like cleaned the room of the gangs or like death. So we think these things are unjust for three reasons.', 74),
(788, 22, 22, 23, 'One is that there are the cases that you didn\'t know, for example, the Yami Egiro Mondays or like other cases. Even these people don\'t know. We think that some kind of like cooks or like other people are going to like be criminalized because you did something for the gangs or like other things in their paradigm. Right. We think that it is ridiculous because they did nothing wrong. They didn\'t kill anybody. They didn\'t rape somebody or like death. But they\'re going to be punished. We think that it is unjust.', 74),
(789, 23, 23, 24, 'Secondly, we say that the criteria and criteria is very big. So we think that it\'s going to isolate these people because if we say like other people want to help these like people who are in the gang and they want to go out of the gang. However, if these people are going to like help these individuals in the gang, maybe the police are going to have those like stigmatization that the people who are related to these like gang members or have the possibility of being a gang membership, we think that these people have the possibility to be punished. And because of this, the other people are going to have more hardship to help these people. Right. We think that because of this, we think it is actually not going to be a deterrent, but rather these people are going to be in these like gangs and no one is going to help them. We think it is. It is very harmful.', 74),
(790, 24, 24, 25, 'Actually, the third reason is that principally we think that if you\'re if you did something wrong, we think that these people should not be punished. For example, if you did something, if you didn\'t kill somebody or if you didn\'t do some kind of crime, we think that these individuals should not have any kind of any kind of like punishment or like death. Right. And people have the right to have and have the right to not to have like criminalization or like others.', 74),
(791, 25, 25, 26, 'We would like to talk in our second point. All right. Our second point is the rehabilitation just needs to infect the underlying and underling to cause more crime. All right. So firstly, now in the present situation, we say that the rehabilitation just just for these individuals to do more like work or like the simple work or like other things. And it\'s not going to be a fundamental solution for this. Right. And moreover, we think it is causing more harm because even though even now there are two people. One is the people who have rehabilitated. Second is the people who had not rehabilitated. Even they did all the terms of the rehabilitation. We think that these two people are existing.', 74),
(792, 26, 26, 27, 'However, even though there are these two people, these like the companies or the corporations are not going to accept these people because they\'re going to prioritize the main value or other things.

(793, 27, 27, 28, 'Actually, this rehabilitation is not working well. This means that these people are going to be excluded from society. What\'s going to happen? We say that these criminals are going to have more unionized cases and they are going to do more crimes because they don\'t have any weight or like any kind of like work that we think that these people have more possibilities, that they\'re going to commit more crimes, more or like make more like organized crimes or like organized gangs. And actually, we think that this is going to make a vicious cycle, which leads to more crimes because these organized gangs are going to do more crimes because they want to have money like drug smuggling or like others. And we think that it is very harmful.', 74),
(794, 28, 28, 29, 'And surely we like to talk that how these things, it\'s not going to, and even now, even though they are going to criminalize, we think that this is not going to be a fundamental solution because if it\'s going to be something like an organized crime now or like in the future, we think that the people who are going to be arrested, it\'s only these like the underling, which is the lower position people who have this, who are the minors or like who are the low position members. And we think that these people are going to be arrested. But if it\'s going to be an organized crime, it is very hard for to know who is the top leader or where is the top leader now. And we think that because of this, these people are going to put all of these crimes to these lower members people, and these lower members people are going to make more crimes in the future.', 74),
(795, 29, 29, 30, 'That\'s actually why we\'re going to say that these things are not never going to be solved, and it\'s going to increase the crime. That\'s actually why we\'re going to oppose. Thank you.', 74),
(796, 30, 30, 31, 'So first, I\'d like to state the purpose of taking this motion. So, why we want to criminalise? It is not because we want to exile the criminals or the gangs from the society, but our purpose is to help those criminals or the gangs rehabilitate and get back to the normal society. And the second purpose is to prevent the future crimes. So, that is our purpose.', 75),
(797, 31, 31, 32, 'And also, the opposition side said that the criteria for determining the gangs is vague. However, as the first piece of clearly explained, what gangs are, and which is that the group, which is the gangs, is the group where they encourage both directly or indirectly committing crimes.

(798, 32, 32, 33, 'And, okay, so next, I\'d like to revert to the opposition side\'s claim that this motion will not act as the deterrent. Well, even though the opposition side said so, as the first speaker clearly showed, there is a clear step that, by taking this motion, gangs will decrease and then eventually the crime number will decrease. And even if we hypothesise that it will not have direct results, such as the decrease of the crime, we believe that it is very important for a country to clearly show their stance.', 75),
(799, 33, 33, 34, 'So, currently, the government stance is very vague. And even though they criminalise the action that the gangs take, they haven\'t directly banned the gangs itself. However, as we all know, the police are always trying to disassemble those gangs by trying to find those crimes that they commit. So, there\'s this contradiction between the government and the police. Even though the government doesn\'t directly say that the gangs are out of law, the police is taking action that clearly shows that gangs are not under the law. And this is creating a confusion within the public, especially to the juvenile, as our first speaker briefly mentioned.', 75),
(800, 34, 34, 35, 'Because the government is standing on an unstable and unclear stance, the public do not have this strong understanding that being a gang member is a crime. But if we take this motion, this will change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime without conscience, and there\'s no doubt within it. Because we know, because the government is clearly stating that it is a crime to kill someone.', 75),
(801, 35, 35, 36, 'And so, this will apply similarly to this case too. And if the government clearly shows that being a gang member is a crime, even the youngs will eventually know and understand clearly that being a gang member is a crime. And by establishing this circumstance, we\'ll be able to decrease the number of youngs getting into the gangs, because they think that being a gang member is cruel. So, we believe that it is very important for the government to state their stance, even if we think that this motion will not have a direct effect.', 75),
(802, 36, 36, 37, 'And also, it may be questionable whether a gang member actually committed a crime. Well, it is true that not every single member of gangs does not commit a crime.

So, for these reasons, we propose this motion. Thank you.', 75),
(804, 38, 38, 39, 'So, before I would like to move on to the rebuttal, I would like to add two more arguments.

These days, many people have been invited by strange religion at the university or some other places and become a member of that, right? And this is a problem mostly in Japan. Those people have almost never mind to become a member, right?

(808, 42, 42, 43, 'But this happens the same in the invitation of gang organization, right? Because gang wants a member to expand their activity.

All we got was that, oh, that the concept of gang is very vague, very subjective, but we think that there was no actual critical feedback or any kind of rebuttal coming to a bulk of violent, like the majority of gangs which are violent on our side, how we decrease crimes, and we think the moment in which they failed to provide a counterfactual, they lost this debate.', 77),

The fact that they didn\'t respond to this is a concession that these gangs are dangerous, and that we have to stop them, and they concede that in the case of violent gangs, it is necessary to criminalize gang membership.

But let\'s assume that these gangs can be so fluffy that maybe their only intent is to hold a tea party and just eat cookies. Let\'s take this.

The reason why we are able to criminalize gangs, even if it is vague, because we think on our side, we include courts in the equation of criminalization, which opposition absolutely neglected.

And therefore, 50-minute speeches absolutely drops because this metric of vagueness is not a reason to oppose the criminalization of gang membership. Just in the same way that we have to look at incentive, and we prosecute attempted murder and not murder, but the intent of committing murder is in and of itself important.

Or just imagine an organization of scammers, of a gang that only commits thieves and burglaries to enter a very important finance company, we think, like Golden Saks, right?', 77),
(823, 57, 57, 58, 'We think that\'s bad because companies have a certain right to know that they have to protect other employees who are not gangs, and on their side, we think that it\'s simply, we think that it\'s good that companies do know if they\'re gangs or not because that\'s literally the point of criminalization, right, to ensure the benefit of society. They weren\'t able to engage with this.', 77),
(824, 58, 58, 59, 'However, let\'s say that we still want these criminals to employ these ex-convicts, right? Why is this better on our side? Because we think just in the same way we do for juveniles, we could just hide their identity up, that is, that we don\'t allow criminal, like, companies to give access to criminal records, and on our side, we\'re telling you that we\'re going to give rehab, job training, and community sentencing. We think this is more than enough incentive for companies to employ them in the first place. They weren\'t able to give a counterfactual, and thirdly, I\'m going to prove to you why on their side, they aren\'t able to, like, have effective rehabilitation.', 77),
(825, 59, 59, 60, 'Why is this the case? Because under their side, when these gang members enter prison, they\'re still deeply tied with gangs, that is, that they have to stay with gangs to survive, especially in countries like America or Colombia, where most, like, most prison inmates are usually gang members, so they\'re forced to hold ties with gangs, they\'re forced into a community of hatred and violence, and we think just in terms of broken window theory, which is that if you are in a community of violence, you\'re more likely to commit violence, we think that rehabilitation isn\'t effective, because you still have to, you\'re surrounded by a lot of people who commit crimes.', 77),
(826, 60, 60, 61, 'Just in the same way that if you\'re holding an anger management class, but you\'re literally forced into this gang or gang community and seeing, like, a lot of fights every day, we think that rehabilitation isn\'t effective. On our side, we told you, so we separate them from these groups because we, like, we take them out of the equation of gangs, the moment in which they try to enter, so they still don\'t have deep ties with these gang members yet, therefore, we\'re able to prevent them from holding deep ties and allowing them a better integrating society by having a lot of rehabilitation, so we think that in terms of rehabilitation and reintegrating society, we do it better on our side.', 77),
(827, 61, 61, 62, 'Look, the failure of opposition was that they weren\'t able to provide any reason why, like, the whole existence and allowing and accepting gang members to be in society is actually able to deter crime. We told you explicitly one. I\'m very happy for this.', 77),
(828, 62, 62, 63, 'So first, I\'m going to rebuttal the government\'s side. The government side said that we can hide criminal records, but even if we hide the criminal records, the company cares about profit seeking, and the company\'s main value. And so, after all, they don\'t employ employees, so this is not true. And also, we can ask support to detectives or experts, and we can ask the criminal records. So, this is not true.', 78),
(829, 63, 63, 64, 'Then, I\'m talking about the arraignment of our issues. First, the government side said that if we take this motion, we can prevent future crime, and protect the society, we\'re safer. But we think that if we take this motion, young members are must be rehabilitated by punishment. So, in this situation, they may contain the more bad group, and we can know about how to escape those agreements. And we think that they can think of a wiser way to escape this. ', 78),
(830, 64, 64, 65, 'And this is bad effect for society more than to take this motion. And which is better, to prevent crime before they do, or not prevent at that time, but after more bigger crime can be saved. I think that not take this motion is more safety for society. And take this motion is less bad effect for society. Because, I told before, we are company, we become a bad company in the gang member. And so, this is bad effect for society anymore.', 78),
(831, 65, 65, 66, 'And the opposition side also said, if we take this motion, even if we take this motion, we can only find weak gang members. Because, the government side said that government and police officers connection is strong, so we can find gang members really. But, this is not true, because to find those gang members is difficult, because they know how to escape this. And we are always thinking about how to escape that.', 78),
(832, 66, 66, 67, 'So, after all, we can only find weak or not big gang members. So, this is not solve the whole of gang members\' crime, and not effect for the future at all. So, not taking this motion is more good effect for society. And also, rehabilitation is give bad effect for them. So, we do not take this motion.', 78),
(833, 67, 67, 68, 'The government side mostly talks about three things. One is that the government should have the staff to oppose gang members, and it is important. But we, and secondly, they say that even, and secondly, they say that we should protect these kind of like societies rather than these individuals. And surely they say that even these kind of like gang members, the ex-gang members are going to be isolated in the societies rather it is better. We actually oppose to these three things.', 79),
(834, 68, 68, 69, 'Alright, why our side is better? We like talking our point. Well, firstly, we actually told us that, we actually listened to them, that why should we prioritize government staff rather than these kind of like retribution or like other things, right? Because we say the retribution, or we say the retribution is just the thing that even there is no like victims or other people, there is no reason that we have to prioritize like other things. Rather we say that we should like prioritize these like rehabilitation of the individuals or like that. We are going to talk about why our side is better. Alright.', 79),
(835, 69, 69, 70, 'And before that, I\'d like to do one rebuttal. Well, even now, the government is saying that being gang members corrupts our lives, or we have some kind of like posters or like other things. Why these individuals are not having like, are still going to be like gang members or other things? Because, and it\'s their thing that if these kind of like posters or other things are being noticed, and all things, it\'s going to change. What is the difference between criminalizing or like other things? We don\'t think that there is a clear difference, because even the minors are now doing like drug smuggling, and it is increasing every year. And actually, even if it\'s a crime, these individuals are going to do because they want to have money or like other, like fame for others. That\'s actually why we are going to think that this is not going to be solved.', 79),
(836, 70, 70, 71, 'Alright. Moving to our argument, we actually told you three things. One is the rehabilitation moves well or not. Well, actually, they didn\'t really engage on this point. And actually, they admitted that this rehabilitation is not going to work well, and the corporation or like other organizations are not going to be employed. Alright. And even, and one thing they say is that, well, all right, well, the government can prohibit to have like those criminal, to notice those criminal records of these like companies or like others. But actually, we think that it is very, it is impossible, because these like, as our week speaker told you, that these kind of like companies or corporations, they are profit seekers, and they\'re just going to know about these criminal records from like other people, from the third person. And we think that it is inevitable. And we think that it\'s unjust.', 79),

We say that if you\'re not going to be in society, and you\'re going to be isolated, rather these people are going to be a gang member again, to commit crime, because this is the only way that you\'re going to live, we think that these things are not going to be solved, rather it\'s going to be more radicalized, and the individuals, the minors who want to have money or like other like things, who are going to be inside these groups, and rather we say that these kind of crimes is going to increase, never going to be solved in their paradigm too, because there is no rehabilitation. That\'s actually why we\'re going to say it\'s harmful, and because the site is going to be harmed too.', 79),
(838, 72, 72, 73, 'And thirdly, we say that because these like organizations are not going to like fundamentally harm, and so we say that people who are doing like crips or like other people are going to have infected, they\'re going to be more a gang, and actually we think these things are going to increase more crimes, more things in society, which means that these organized crimes are going to be going to have more, which is going to harm the society, which they want to say, so actually their stance is very vague, because our site is going to say that there is more harm to them. Thank you.', 79),

They said that there are drug smugglers, but we can see that they\'ll presumably exist on both sides and mutually exclusive.

Because gangs are almost always committing crimes and many get away with committing crimes like frauds.

Every year many criminals get away with committing scams and frauds and if we retain the status quo, this situation is not going to get any better. And we on the other hand understand how serious this situation is and how this motion would help the gangs rehabilitate and learn about how they could actually earn money without damaging other people in society. And we also want to say that because to compare the status quo and the motion, we want to say that the damage done to gangs is smaller than the damage done to their victims. As we said, we understand how serious the situation is and we want to decrease the number of victims as much as possible.

That\'s the reason why in many, several cases, regardless of race, for instance, the reason why corporates are able to choose, regardless of affirmative action, is because they always want the people with the most skills.', 82),

There\'s going to be women who respect abortions, for instance, while there\'s women who don\'t respect abortion.

Because you now have to make voters have to choose, magically choose a female, even if they don\'t agree with their kind of beliefs.

Because in the case of having oppression and stereotypes, we think that even if you get these people into the parliament, they\'re still going to be just acted as a tokenization for instance, right? That they\'re going to be, these women are going to be treated as if they were just getting there without any kind of power, but just for the sake of filling up the number of females in the parliament.

First of all female candidates are necessity for the diet or currently right,although our honorable prime minister seems though unlike Mr. Shinzo Abe is highly capable to deal with educational or democratic issue that doesn\'t that does not mean like they have enough like perspective to,  to care about,  to care about the how these females are in a serious fault right because actually our prime minister do not have children they cannot, they do not, they cannot like make like make,  sympathetic emotion to,  to mothers who,  who are struggling with finding a kindergarten or have to do both working in a child care right?', 83),

So, government side complains female candidates will be free from stereotype with this motion. However, this motion contradicts from its purpose because this motion itself represents stereotype. In fact, it looks bad on women. So, let me explain. All this motion is saying is that women can\'t be elected with the help of this motion. ', 86),

So, government side claims that this motion can tackle the current problem of female inequality because there will be more female members of the parliament. However, this won\'t work. So, let\'s think why there looks no policy for women in the current situation. So, basically, government side misunderstands the current situation. So, why there looks less policy for women is because citizens as voters do not prefer such policy. So, basically, members of parliament are elected through equal vote including women or white, if any, or all people, right? So, this is the basic of democracy, by the way. So, because people have the right to vote equally based on their opinions, this current situation is not because of some stereotype or the problem government claims but it is because of the opinion of citizens as such.

So then they have to prove that in the status quo, women and men are competing on the same ground, which they didn\'t prove. Because they proved that in the status quo, the election is unfair.

(907, 63, 63, 64, 'So moving on to the second point, which is, is taking this motion beneficial for women? So women are, in the status quo, unfairly imposed on the government.

For example, if you have friends who are good at mathematics, you can rely on these kinds of friends. When you have friends, it means that there are a lot of people who you can rely on.

(937, 26, 26, 27, 'Then let me tell our first argument. Our first argument is that young adults will lose the long-term benefit. So let me talk about two things. First thing is about young adults do not have enough experience. So because of the not enough experience, they tend to make wrong decisions when they see back what they have done. For example, they will only think about what they want to do now. And they will behave to meet their immediate demand. For example, like eating or like playing with their friends or like drinking tapioca. These kinds of things will be much more done when they are young without these kinds of defining norms.', 90),
(938, 27, 27, 28, 'And the second thing is that there will be the habit to give up easily. So for example, without these kinds of norms, young adults will be much more or will tend to do what they want to do. And even if they have one thing that they want to do in the future, they will give up. Because to realize these kinds of dreams, it is common that young adults have to face a lot of difficulties. Young adults will only give up when they face these difficulties because they will not think of the future. They will just seek the immediate demand and they will give up when they face difficulties. So why these kinds of things are serious? So when you think about the situation that without defining the norm, in the short term, young adults may feel happiness. However, in the long term, there will be a habit to give up.', 90),
(939, 28, 28, 29, 'And these kinds of things will lead to low quality life. For example, when young adults do not study enough, they cannot get into a good university. And they will have difficulty in getting a job because the academic skills are now in society a lot prioritized. So they will have difficulty in getting a lot of money and money will lead to less choice. So a lot of choice will diminish because of the less of the money and less of the effort of themselves. For example, like buying a house, marrying, having a child. However, with these kinds of defining decay norms, there will be atmosphere that you will be happy in the future if you make effort now. Because of this atmosphere, young people can endure the effort and endure facing difficulties. In the long term, they will feel happiness because they can do what they want to do. They can do what they want to do, what they have been since they were young. Thank you.', 90),
(940, 29, 29, 30, 'First of all, I will revert their argument. They argue that it\'s okay to discard relationships because focusing on the future will lead to long-term happiness. However, this neglects the uniqueness of the defining decade norm, which emphasizes sacrificing immediate norms for the future. This is serious because individuals, driven to be future-oriented, may become too busy with studies or work, leading to strained relationships and friendships that cannot continue.', 91),
(941, 30, 30, 31, 'Additionally, I support the argument that only the younger generation has the right to make choices. Young people, being at a stage where they can choose between studying and working, have the freedom to decide.

(946, 35, 35, 36, 'But more importantly, let\'s talk about their issue about friends, right?

(948, 37, 37, 38, 'But then thirdly, they also talked about this like policymaking, right? How like, we won\'t be able to fund climate change or whatsoever.

I think that if you keep prioritizing immediate pleasure, if you keep going out to parties, if you keep slacking off, I think this is what makes you lose motivation for everything. As my first speaker talked to you, like you\'re the habit of like, procrastinating and the habit of prioritizing instant pleasure is what makes you like look away from these long term goals that you could be pursuing at the same time. So we think that like comparatively within the world with this kind of norm, when you push yourself to work hard, that\'s when you find new goals that you can work hard for, like life goals or dream jobs that you want to achieve in the future. So in terms of motivation, we also say the side opposition has a higher chance for people to be motivated and for people to be encouraged to keep working.', 92),

And this means like you gain lots of skills, or you make like important relationships within like a lot of industries that help you in the future, right? Like if I get like a couple of examples, maybe you take like online courses for vocational skills, like after you come back from work, or you make like acquaintances in like different industries, or like different companies, or you like climb up the social ladder at a very young age and gain a lot of responsibility and gain a lot of like connections, or like overall, like rather than wasting off that Friday night to go drink and go to karaoke, stuff like that, you will study for like a degree for like TOEFL, or you learn another language, etc. So all in all, you won\'t be resting much, but you also be gaining a lot of things in the time that you have. ', 92),
(954, 43, 43, 44, 'And we think that this is very beneficial. First point, the unique thing about this being a norm is that like encourages people to work hard, right? So in the end, you don\'t need anybody to tell you to slack off, it\'s really easy for you to procrastinate, and to like not like to seek instant pleasure, because that\'s your like natural instinct. That\'s why you specifically need a norm that like suppresses your natural instincts, and tells you that it\'s important to work hard, it\'s important to have a long vision, like and to seek for your future and for like future dreams.

(987, 13, 13, 14, 'Let\'s move, before moving on to my first argument. Refutation to the government side is included in my argument. So firstly, under the status quo, they can can decide what is good for children of believers. They can decide which medical care is best for the children, so this is very good for them, and good for children\'s life. Because parents love their children very much, so they can make parents very familiar with the religion. So they know how serious situation they are in.', 96),

And comparing those two, and of course, parents want to save children\'s lives, so they make an effort to touch another medical care, which is not relevant for their just rule. So only a few cases, few medical care is not good. They cannot, so it is okay to deny medical treatment to their children, or they\'re just wrong.', 96),
(989, 15, 15, 16, 'So let\'s move on to my second argument. After taking this prompt, parents cannot decide their children\'s medical care. So it\'s very harmful for their children and their family, because broke religious rule is very serious program for them because they devote to the good for a long time to keep the religious rule, so they feel the guiltiness, and they feel they will be betrayed. So they feel very guilty, and it is very miserable life for them.', 96),

(993, 19, 19, 20, 'Firstly, let me introduce my previous speaker. Firstly, she said that religious people will feel guilty because of the medical treatment, but it\'s not true, because religious people can justify post-medical care.

So they can justify their medical treatment, and the other people in the community of this religion will not think so badly of this.', 97),
(994, 20, 20, 21, 'And also, she said about the possibility of children\'s blaimed, but if the children are blaimed by the other student or other children, the government can or school can save them.

(995, 21, 21, 22, 'Even if there is a possibility of the feeling of guilty or being, but it is not more important than the children\'s forever right to choose their religion. Because, as my partner told you, children have the potential right to choose their religion, change their religion, and if children are killed in their little, defend their little, children will lose their right forever. So we government must protect the children\'s right to choose their religion.', 97),
(996, 22, 22, 23, 'And second, she said parents can decide because parents love their children and understand their children. But it\'s not true. We human beings are not about ourselves, mostly us, so we must decide about ourselves. ', 97),

As my partner told you, little children are immature in this consensus, and so to some extent, and could be possible extent, parents can decide when they are very little, for example, name of what they wear, and so on, because it is reversible in the future. But this is irreversible. We cannot bring the dead back. So children will lose their right to choose their religion forever.', 97),

I think it is a consensus, religion is important, religion is a very fundamental part of our life, but the opposition side only considers the parental religious issues and so on.

(1003, 29, 29, 30, 'So let me compare the importance again. The feeling of guilt or blame is reversible, and in some way, as I thought, we can solve the problem, but this is irreversible.

First, for these people, believing in religion is so important in terms of their life. And secondly, how serious are these children after being taken from death.

(1006, 32, 32, 33, 'So, before moving to my point, let me repeat what the government said. The government said that children can change their religion. But this is not true. Because firstly, the dogma is very different from other religions. So, they cannot easily change their religion. And also, these children live in this community when they were born. And they are taking the religious education. So, most of these children believe in this religion. So, concerning this fact, even if these children change their religion, they can\'t feel comfortable and more serious situation.', 98),

(1008, 34, 34, 35, 'So, please let me move to my first point. Why for these people believe in religion and belong to the community, believe in religion is so important in terms of their life? Because the religion is only after to give them mental stability. So, if these people strongly believe that if they obey the dogma, we can save their mental stability even after they die.

But other people who are suffering from the relationship, for example, they are isolated from other friends and are bruised by their classmates. But these people, they betray against the dogma, they feel that if they... forever we cannot be saved. So, no way to help them save. So, in the first case, they kill themselves. But so, we strongly believe this belief is so important.', 98),

So, as my partner said, the community, these children will be isolated from this community because the community member ignores their children because they feel that children betray their dogmas. So, if these children go to the school, other children don\'t talk about with them. And also, the children can\'t go to the church because they are afraid of criticizing themselves. And also, they feel that living is so hard and so pity. And at last, they feel that it is okay that I die in that situation. So, for this reason, we strongly oppose this motion.

So in that situation, so in that situation, parents cannot decide that, parents cannot decide that never reverse the choice. Because it will certainly raise that precious opportunity to re-choose, it means that re-construct our own life for children. ', 100),
(1022, 48, 48, 49, 'However, they explain that parents can decide it. Because, so after children follow their religion, so they will certainly, they will certainly sacrifice. But, but they just focus on the children who follow their, follow their religion. And they completely forget that children who won\'t be following their religion.', 100),
(1023, 49, 49, 50, 'And also, as I said, as long as we are living, we can change the situation. We have the possibility. However, we feel that, no, it\'s very significant. So, on this point that significance is that we can be superior than our opposition in terms of the significance of possibility. ', 100),
(1024, 50, 50, 51, 'Also, they never explain that. In that situation, why, why parents can choose such a severe decision that is related to their children\'s whole life, forever. So there\'s no explanation for why we cannot, we cannot understand this point that what they say is very vague.', 100),
(1025, 51, 51, 52, 'And also, the second point is that, so they merely talk about how important the relationship is. Yes, it\'s so very important. It\'s very important. That\'s why we should choose on our own. Such, such kind of, so very important life map that should be chosen by children themselves. Because, because the children\'s life is not their parent\'s one. We have our own life, our own time. So, we have to protect that, our children\'s future choice, not only life. So, following that, we are happy to be here.', 100),
(1026, 0, 0, 1, 'Thank you judges. What we think is very important during the pandemic time is helping as many people as possible and passing those things. In those circumstances, these kind of patents will slow the enhancement of development of new drugs or vaccine or those kind of things, or the accessibility of those things. So we are very happy to propose this motion. ', 101),
(1027, 1, 1, 2, 'So two things I\'m going to talk about in my speech. Firstly, how patents will bother or slow the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. Secondly, how in our society we will be safe, which is the counter of the status quo. ', 101),
(1028, 2, 2, 3, 'But before moving on, I\'m going to talk about a couple of models or definitions. First, like Western Pharmaceutical Company. I think, as you know, it\'s like Pfizer or Moderna, which has a large pharmaceutical company with large money and those things. And what we mean by the release of patents, first of all, the scope of the patents will be more pandemic related. So it is not like all patents, for example, when it is the COVID time, COVID vaccine or drugs that will be. And also in the world where there are patents, you have to pay fee for using that or maybe those kind of companies have to occupy the knowledge, have a right to knowledge. But what we think from the government side, when there are no patents, it is more open those kind of disclosure of the information of the society or those kind of things. ', 101),
(1029, 3, 3, 4, 'So moving on to the first argument, how patents will bother the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. ', 101),
(1030, 4, 4, 5, 'So at the conclusion, I won\'t say patents will slow and lessen accessibility for three reasons. Firstly, simply, when there are patents, you cannot get the skill or use that skill because the corporation doesn\'t have the incentive to share those knowledge. And secondly, you have to sell tons of money to use that patent. For example, if you want to use the patent of the company A, company B has to pay a lot of money, which is unlikely to happen. And thirdly, if there are less types of medicine and when there are, first of all, when there are patents, it means there are less types of medicine. In those circumstances, the prices of the drug or the vaccine will be high. So the conclusion here is that patents will slow the development of the new drugs and lessen the accessibility of drugs. ', 101),
(1031, 5, 5, 6, 'So why is this problematic? For two reasons. Firstly, when there are pandemics, these kind of poor people cannot access the drug or the vaccine. Maybe in a country like Japan, where there is a lot of money, or a rich country, the government has the budget to distribute the money to the citizens. But in the majority of cases, especially in poor countries, they don\'t have enough money to do that. So that means, in the worst cases, you don\'t have the right to get the vaccine or get the drug, which means you are dead in those kinds of times. ', 101),
(1032, 6, 6, 7, 'And secondly, why it\'s problematic is that it will slow the development of the new drugs. For example, maybe company A has made an original COVID-19 vaccine, and company B are very specific and talk us through at the Delta Cup or another cup, but in that world, you don\'t have the patent, you don\'t have the rights to use the patent, or the patent is not released later, please. And so, company B have to do from the scratch, right? They have to use tons of money, they have to use tons of time to do the clinical trial of those vaccines, right? In those circumstances, it will lessen the development of the new drugs. So why this is important is that when the pandemic comes, you have to get the drugs or the vaccine to help many people. ', 101),
(1033, 7, 7, 8, '<POI> We can see that helping people is quite important, but even if it is not a situation of the worldwide pandemic, still there are a lot of patients who are struggling with diseases. Why you can focus on the situation of those kind of worldwide pandemic? Why you can have the right to still do the property that you recover investigation? ', 101),
(1034, 8, 8, 9, 'My partner will answer this question. ', 101),
(1035, 9, 9, 10, 'So moving on to the second point, how our side is better. What we think is that in the world where the patents will be released, it will fasten the development of the new drugs, because for two reasons. ', 101),
(1036, 10, 10, 11, 'Firstly, when the patent is disclosed, it means that many companies have access, more competition will happen, and when there are no patents, many companies have the opportunity to get that information. That means that company A can use that information, and company B can\'t use it. So in that circumstances, maybe in the world there are patents. This Western first company who has a patent will not feel like making development, but because all the information is disclosed, those companies will be rushed to do another. ', 101),
(1037, 11, 11, 12, 'And the second reason why it will fasten the development, is that each company can use the proficiency skill, or their specialty of that institute. For example, maybe company A is good at designing clinical trials or using digital tools and twins, like using AI things, or maybe company B can use it. In those circumstances, each company can use their own skill, which means that the development gets scaled from those original information. So we think, because of two reasons, we think it will be fastening the development, and the accessibility of the drug will be opened. For this reason, I\'m happy to propose. Thank you.', 101),
(1038, 12, 12, 13, 'Thank you, Chair. Patent right has proven to be a powerful engine of innovation, driving progress and fostering unprecedented technological advancement. On this side of the government, unfortunately, disincentivized pharmaceutical corporations not to innovate this kind of important vaccination or medication during times of economic. That\'s why, unfortunately, from the perspective of practical consequences, the more people will not be able to medicate it, unfortunately. And in the principal consequences, unfortunately, today\'s government is unfortunately invading the important property rights of the patent. ', 102),
(1039, 13, 13, 14, 'I have three things to tell you. Number one, I will explain the counter model as opposition. And number two, I will explain the principle argument and why the patent should work as important property right and why government shouldn\'t invade it. And number three, I will talk about today\'s government, unfortunately, disincentivizing the medical innovation. And the more people is going to die in their power. ', 102),
(1040, 14, 14, 15, 'So let\'s move on to the first issue about the model. So first of all, I\'m going to support that, of course, the status quo situation, right? So pharmaceutical corporation still has a patent. And so the other company wants to use the technology for a patent. Of course, they need to pay to some extent of money for the corporation. ', 102),
(1041, 15, 15, 16, 'So number two, and we are very happy to compromise, to introduce license fee to obligatory that kind of the Western pharmaceutical corporation needs to accept a release to some extent of patent with a significant amount of fee. And even if this fee is unacceptable or the sky-high expensive and other corporations not actually accessible, we can, of course, adjust the amount of fee to the acceptable one. So this is the best compromise I can do. ', 102),
(1042, 16, 16, 17, 'And more than that, we are, of course, very happy to subsidize those medical corporations to actually harsh the development of medical medicine or vaccination. We\'ll be happy to enhancement of the investment or lending. So this is our model. ', 102),
(1043, 17, 17, 18, 'So let\'s move on to the first issue in terms of principle level of the patent, why it has to work as important property, right? So we need to admit Western pharmaceutical company patent as very important as a property, right? So forcing the pharmaceutical corporation to release the patent is invasion of their property, right? So why is that? Because they actually made a lot of effort for many two reasons. ', 102),
(1044, 18, 18, 19, 'Of course, they are the only one spend so much cost, right? So they, of course, invest on the lab. They develop machine or mathematical model. They, of course, invest massive amount of human resources, hiring outstanding scientists or engineering members and so on, which is a unique effort that other corporation is not doing. That\'s why they can reach out to the development and they can get patent. ', 102),
(1045, 19, 19, 20, 'And number two, of course, they spend so much time to develop this kind of patent, right? And this is not a short-term effort. They actually use the technology for a long time and they develop this kind of patent with spending so much long-term perspective, such as 5 to 10 years or not only just a few months, a few days, right? So this kind of consistent effort time and the cost is an important reason. So the result that they develop can actually reach the good innovation, such as effective vaccination, such as mask to eliminate molecule of COVID, such as good medication against the pandemic, like flu, influenza, or so forth, right? ', 102),
(1046, 20, 20, 21, 'So those all medical development, it\'s all attributed from corporation\'s effort, hoping their sustainable profit as a form of patent, right? So government actually ignore this kind of effort and certainly they set the arbitral criteria of emergence and this kind of situation is not acceptable. ', 102),
(1047, 21, 21, 22, 'Before moving on any... Okay, let\'s move on to... So analogy of this, why this is not acceptable is, of course, the first would be, so even if there\'s any scarcity, even if there\'s any shortage of food or on this kind of situation, of course, government cannot certainly say they\'re going to nationalize the food factory or food industry, right? Even if the AI development is actually raising and probably this unlock their many trouble in the world, of course, we cannot force AI corporations such as just GPT or Microsoft to release their patent related to AI industry, right? So we are not saying that because we admit the importance of property, right? ', 102),
(1048, 22, 22, 23, 'So let\'s move on to the second issue about decentralization of innovation. So of course, as I said, to develop this kind of medical products, it costs actually a lot, right? So like I say, they need to invest a lot and they need to develop their unique mathematical model or something like this, right? And also they are not actually certain whether or not this kind of medication is actually going to be needed in the future because it\'s very uncertain whether or not the development of the current medicine is going to be effective in the future or whether or not actually another pandemic will come in the future. They can also assess that.', 102),
(1049, 23, 23, 24, 'But as long as there\'s the patent to create a sustainable money for company, that\'s why they have actually massive motivation to keep innovating and investing these kinds of products. So for example, in the case of pandemic, of course, vaccine and medicines demand increase. That\'s a lot of corporation wants to develop effective products. And if one company developing the outstanding product, of course, other corporation is also wants to use the patent to get the technology and they can also have massive incentive to sophisticate the product with the patent, right? That\'s why this kind of patent is actually important key essence to unlock difficulty of innovating medication. ', 102),
(1050, 24, 24, 25, 'What\'s going to happen in after plan? First of all, of course, there\'s very few profit for pharmaceutical corporation. It\'s not a profitable situation at all, right? So that\'s why the research and development fee is going to be cut for this kind of corporation. That\'s why the important, for example, the medication against the COVID or flu is also going to be cut when they\'re going to probably move to other industry, such as just the investing on generic medication, which can be effective but not critical for the COVID situation. This kind to save more people, to preserve principle importance of patent.', 102),
(1051, 25, 25, 26, 'First, I want to start with the characterization of the large corporations. In order to prove without this policy, malicious utilization of the patent will happen, and they dominate profit by excluding small corporations or venture corporations who have the potential to produce that important medicine or technology as much as possible on their side of the house, which means their counterproposal is too soft to prevent this policy. ', 103),
(1052, 26, 26, 27, 'We see in the status quo, those large corporations strongly exclude venture corporations or startup corporations on their side of the house. We see large corporations try to purchase the patent, which venture corporations or small corporations also have in the status quo. Therefore, those new important technologies or knowledge will be dominated by large corporations on their side of the house. Also, we see, evergreen, once their patent will be expired, large corporations try to introduce similar patents in order to perpetuate this unfair social structure for the small or venture corporations. Therefore, other consequences, those technologies, medicine, will be totally dominated, and malicious utilization of the patent will happen on their side of the house. ', 103),
(1053, 27, 27, 28, 'Why do you see this actually happen? It\'s very simple. Because corporations, large corporations, are inherently short-sighted because they have to cater to the interests of the shareholders. We see in the case of the breach of trust, we look at the case of the British. Shareholders can cause lawsuits against a company as long as corporations don\'t take action to maximize their benefit if they don\'t cater to the profit of the shareholders. That\'s why those malicious utilizations strongly happen without a disposal under the model. ', 103),
(1054, 28, 28, 29, 'Opposition may say, hey, those corporations have a natural incentive to care about reputation, et cetera. That\'s why those malicious utilizations are unlikely to happen, et cetera. But I don\'t think this is likely because, as I already talked to you, corporations are inherently short-sighted and profit-seeking. Therefore, the malicious utilization are likely to happen on their side of the house. ', 103),
(1055, 29, 29, 30, 'And also, what we got from side of the opposition is that under our model, this incentivization to research and development could happen, et cetera, et cetera. But I don\'t think this is likely in the first place. Because when it comes to the pandemic, when it comes to the pharmacy, obviously, large demands strongly exist. In the case of COVID-19, many people try to vaccinate or utilize medicine again and again. For example, in Japan, at least three times, those people have to utilize. Therefore, even if large corporations lose the patent, anyway, those corporations have a natural incentive to enter the industry of the pharmacy, and so they have a natural incentive to commit the research and the development to begin with. ', 103),
(1056, 30, 30, 31, 'And secondly, especially when it comes to the pharmacy, their products directly connecting to the reputation, increasing reputation, because their products directly connecting, like saving life, saving precious life. Therefore, if their knowledge of technology will be compromised because of this policy, still those corporations have a natural incentive to enter their industry to begin with. ', 103),
(1057, 31, 31, 32, 'And also, we tell you, disincentivization rather happens on their side of the house. Because, as I already talked to you, many of the technology or medicine will be taught to be dominated by the large corporations, right? Once a venture corporation or small corporation, even if a small corporation or venture corporation tries to opt into that industry, their knowledge, their technology, are totally dominated by the large corporations. Therefore, those corporations who have less financial capacity lose incentive to enter this industry more and more on their side of the house. But before that, yes. ', 103),
(1058, 32, 32, 33, '<POI> I understand to some extent, there is a huge demand for medication during the pandemic. But by releasing patent and thousands of companies actually started selling the same products, which is not actually profitable, how still your side of the pharmaceutical corporation has a massive incentive for innovation? ', 103),
(1059, 33, 33, 34, 'Obviously, even if the patent will be disclosed to the public, for example, as my partner already talked to you, each corporation has their own strong point, right? For example, like a specific knowledge, like a corporation A has a specific knowledge of A, corporation B has a specific knowledge of B, or et cetera, et cetera. Therefore, yes, we can see an important basis of the medicine or important basis of the technology are shared by every single corporation. However, another corporation can put additional benefit or additional functionality of the technology or medicine or those kind of things. Therefore, by doing so, each corporation easily differentiates each other. Therefore, those corporations still can gain the benefit on our side of the house. And also we think what we got from their side of the house, like the invasion of the right of the corporation. ', 103),
(1060, 34, 34, 35, 'But I think, as I already talked to you, when it comes to the pandemic, especially many dying right now, the right of the corporation should be compromised in order to maximize the potential of the corporation to begin with. Because as I already talked to you, those corporations are strongly blocked by the larger corporation in the status quo. Therefore, in terms of corporate social responsibility, I think their rights should be compromised to begin with. Therefore, we think we have to propose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Thank you. \n', 103),
(1061, 35, 35, 36, 'Existence of the patent is a rarely activated competition, we believe, which can drive businesses to continually improve their products and services. This is actually giving benefits to the consumer and society as a whole. That is what we are happy to hear about this motion. ', 104),
(1062, 36, 36, 37, 'Before moving on to my substantive, let me quickly go back to what the previous speaker said. First of all, he said venture companies do not take action to invest or develop new technology. We don\'t think so, even in current situations. A lot of venture companies can take enough action. For example, let me take the example of the case of COVID-19. Moderna is actually a venture company. This was built after 2010. Of course, we already know that they do not have enough monetary capacity, but if they can invest in beautiful technology, they can invest it by a lot of investors from the whole of society, and they can earn money from the society. We think even in this house, enough technology is actually made by those kinds of companies. ', 104),
(1063, 37, 37, 38, 'Second of all, he said that the companies just take the short-term benefits. We don\'t think so also. Because such companies also invest from a lot of people, at the moment, if they just focus on the short-term benefits from the society, on the other hand, they also have to consider long-term benefits. For example, utilizing their patents or continuously selling new products to the society. That\'s why we think such malicious usage of patents is less likely to happen. Because if they maliciously make so many expensive fees to just use such patents technology, of course, no one would want to use it. That\'s why we don\'t think that kind of situation is actually happening. ', 104),
(1064, 38, 38, 39, 'Okay, next, moving on to my substantive. First of all, while releasing the patent is a completely undermined motivation to develop new technology, and unfortunately, the existence of information itself is obviously declining in that part of this house. Secondly, as a property right, why we should not arbitrarily steal such kind of property from the entire company, even in the case of pandemic cases. So, lastly, let me compare each part. ', 104),
(1065, 39, 39, 40, 'First of all, while releasing the patent is completely undermined motivation to develop new technology. So, in that part, the company has two choices. If you develop new technology, first of all, you can share such kind of information as a patent to the whole society. Actually, we can know how to make it, what kind of substance is actually in such kind of drug or something like that. But if you try to use such kind of technology or information itself, at the moment, they have to pay money or something like that. This is the case of the one. ', 104),
(1066, 40, 40, 41, 'The second of all, they still have the choice to hinder such kind of information itself to the society because they do not want to share information to the society, even if it deals as a patent. Still, in that society, the company tries to hinder such kind of mechanism or something like that. For example, as my partner already mentioned, such kind of algorithm is actually hindered even in the current situation. In their part of the task, there is no patent at all. As a situation, why such kind of company has a motivation to share information, how to make it those kind of drug itself. In that society, there is no mechanism from the entire government side. That is why, in the first place, they cannot recover such kind of investigation, as my partner already mentioned, or more than that. So, rather, we believe they try to hinder those kind of new technology, the methods to make new products. They try to hinder and just maliciously utilize those kind of methods to earn money. So, that\'s why we think this is completely problematic. ', 104),
(1067, 41, 41, 42, 'Okay, let\'s move on to the second substantive. So, why we think that stealing the property shouldn\'t be tolerated even in any circumstances. As my point of information mentioned, even if it is the situation of the worldwide pandemic, even not the situation of the worldwide pandemic, still, we can find a lot of people, a lot of patients, who are actually struggling with any kind of diseases. In that case of urgency, of course, we have to tackle, we have to solve those kind of patients, even if it is not the case of the worldwide pandemic. ', 104),
(1068, 42, 42, 43, 'But, unfortunately, they arbitrarily decide a line to distinguish which person should be helped in the case of the worldwide pandemic. We don\'t think those kinds of situations can be traced. Why is that? Because in our paradigm of this house, existing patterns actually activate new technology or methods in the first place. That is why we think this should be treated as a special thing. ', 104),
(1069, 43, 43, 44, 'So, let me compare the two perspectives. First of all, the motivation. Even in the short term or long term, we think our side is outweighed. Because, as my partner already mentioned, even if this is an existing pattern, still, a lot of companies can utilize those kind of methods. More than that, companies have the motivation to recover a lot of investigations. ', 104),
(1070, 44, 44, 45, 'But in their paradigm of this house, they try to hinder such kind of information, or more than that, they try to replace other kinds of investigations, not related to such kind of pandemic or crucial diseases in the worldwide. So, lastly, we shouldn\'t decide arbitrarily what kind of diseases should be solved. So, that\'s what we have to do.', 104),
(1071, 45, 45, 46, 'Okay. Thank You chair. We think we find the big contraction from this contradiction from the side of the house because they never explained how to adjust in their counter model. They will adjust the patent or something like that, but how they decide the price or something like that? It\'s completely unbiased and unclear and that\'s why we think it\'s out of this space. It\'s very big due to theirs. ', 105),
(1072, 46, 46, 47, 'Their explanation and the meeting if we think of the so we say we think the motivation itself are that this device the same thing? We think we as my father will tell you there are a lot of alternative incentive for that kind of Cooperation and even if the disincentivization to some extent happen winning is still the benefit I said even if we think feel that the incentive of cooperation will remain and that\'s why we think the development of Our paradigm explanation is much better.

(1073, 47, 47, 48, 'Yeah, I\'m gonna talk about two issues. Let me talk about motivation. Secondly, let me talk about the principle model. ', 105),
(1074, 48, 48, 49, 'Before that, let me talk about rebuttal. So they, the DL, will try to say and why? So they ask them why only during the pandemic or something like that. But let me talk about what is the difference between the normal situation and the pandemic is very clear, right? Because that is a very short time and it suddenly happens, right? We think so in normal situation where we can use, for example, the genetic medicine, for example, can be available and it is a better fight. So in several cases and that\'s why we have a lot of all parties. But in emergency cases in pandemic cases, we don\'t have any time to wait to generate, for example. We think because that is especially in the emergency cases, we think we should open a release.', 105),
(1075, 49, 49, 50, 'Yeah, let me talk about motivation. They said I think we can share the pattern. So as I put it out their counterfactual is very big in this process, right? Because they said they have the choice corporation still have the choice to hinder or that kind of thing. ', 105),
(1076, 50, 50, 51, 'But at the same time, they say that they will force the adjuster according to their model. But we think how if we think of the how they adjust the prices of opening the patent, for example. Yeah, probably they\'re gonna be the pressurization by the society. For example, Yeah, you should do that because you are the big corporation you owe it. There is kind of CSR or that kind of thing, right? And also probably they will, also if we think of the incentive of the government who will restrict or who will adjust the prices of patent, etc, etc. Probably they will cater to the population, right? If the population or the situation in the society, we think about we need the vaccination because that is very important It should be open or that kind of thing, probably they will cater to the population. That means that even in their patent, probably Yeah, so their argument is completely not mutually exclusive to some extent.', 105),
(1077, 51, 51, 52, 'And moreover, we think So And notice that they said, how to say, yeah, yes We have to share but the sharing the information itself means that not only means that you have to share your own information But at the same time you can use other corporation information, right? That brings us the very good argument that my partner tell you, right? Then that real position tries to say that this incentive will happen But they\'re gonna be still the benefit, right? For example, the reputation is gonna be improved if they can make the first vaccination to the COVID, right? They talk about the case of the Moderna, for example, right? ', 105),
(1078, 52, 52, 53, 'So if that is true, even if they do not have the patent to some extent, making the vaccination itself The fact itself is enough fact to prove the power of Moderna, for example, the certain corporations. And that means that Investors anyway have the incentive to do that because they have the power to make such kind of wonderful Vaccination, for example, right? In that kind of moment, we think still they\'re gonna be the benefit for the corporation.', 105),
(1079, 53, 53, 54, '<POI> With or without pandemic, every single medical product to some extent save life and somehow critical for some people. Do you also think a multiple corporation should release other type of medical patents such as medical medicine for diabetes or cancer? ', 105),
(1080, 54, 54, 55, 'It depends, right? Because they Firstly, that is not a mutual exclusive because how they try to deal with that kind of problem is a very unclear process But moreover, we think that they also said adjust, right? It is the same thing So we will we have to think about the benefit of the corporation. But also the situation in society We have to balance that kind of thing If we think of that kind of thing, we think in this pandemic case, we should release that kind of patent.', 105),
(1081, 55, 55, 56, 'Then they also try to talk about so that they\'re not gonna develop and it is very unclear that whether they\'re gonna be the necessity to that kind of medicine. That\'s why they\'re gonna refrain from making it. But because for example, as my partner also told you, because they have the connection with government, right? They are very known about the lobbying, for example in America In that kind of movement, that is the reason why the Japanese government is requiring three times the vaccination in Japan. In that kind of movement, we think they can maintain the necessity of their development. For that kind of thing that means that they still have the incentive to do that. ', 105),
(1082, 56, 56, 57, 'And also notice that they are going to be the pressurization by the society, right? Because you dominate a lot of the information, you dominate a lot of the patents, etc, etc. Then they\'re gonna pressurize you. Why don\'t you do that?', 105),
(1083, 57, 57, 58, 'The conclusion here is even if this incentivization is to some extent true. Still they are going to be the benefit for starting kind of their corporation. And once they make new medicine and release the patent, as my partner told you, there are no restrictions from their side of the house, that\'s development advance, right? For example, because of the competition within the corporation, right? For example, they try to make the vaccination with lighters, high-definition, that kind of things can easily happen.', 105),
(1084, 58, 58, 59, 'Then let me talk about the principle. Firstly, their principle is very general to some extent, right? Because they just talk about how the patent is important. But they never ever explain why that is unique to the pandemic case in the first place, right? ', 105),
(1085, 59, 59, 60, 'But moreover, secondly, they\'re based on the exploit. So moreover, we can mitigate the damage of that kind of things that they try to talk about, because not all patents are going to be released in our paradigm As my partner clearly told you in the model, just that it\'s related to the COVID or the pandemic cases, right? In that kind of moment, their case, principle case, is also not unique in the first place and not important in this way. So for these reasons, we think that we can, yeah We can, in the pandemic cases, we can save more people in our paradigm. That\'s why we propose.', 105),
(1086, 60, 60, 61, 'Three things in summation. Firstly, the principal issue, utilitarianism versus the property right, and secondly, the incentive of cooperation in status quo, and thirdly, the incentive of cooperation after plan adoption. ', 106),
(1087, 61, 61, 62, 'So let\'s start. Firstly, in terms of the principle issues, you may agree that the general importance of property rights, which we already explained to you, because the patent right is simply the fruit of investment of research and development of pharmaceutical corporations, and therefore this is guaranteed as a property right. This is nothing different from buying the land or constructing the factory by investing the money. ', 106),
(1088, 62, 62, 63, 'We think that there is no difference between physical property rights and intellectual property rights. And actually, in many countries, the patent law explains discreetly that the patent right is one of the property rights. That\'s why we think this is, in general, this is particularly important. And what we already proven to you in this debate is that this is not acceptable, even in the context of the emergency cases, that this is the deprival of property rights is unacceptable. ', 106),
(1089, 63, 63, 64, 'Their only claim is that in emergent cases, this is acceptable. If this is true, for example, if the factory exists, which can produce the vaccine, we can buy this kind of factory regardless of their consent of cooperation and forcibly produce the vaccine. Or if the land exists, in this case, which is suitable for producing the vaccine, that we can forcibly construct the factory and produce the medicine, or that we can forcibly work the doctors or scientists in order to tackle down COVID-19, for example. We think that as long as they fail to explain to what extent the property rights or the rights of the individual, or the rights of the corporation, can be infringed under the name of the arbitrary criteria of emergency, we think their case must fail. Therefore, the general principle of property rights is particularly important. ', 106),
(1090, 64, 64, 65, 'And more than that, the arbitrariness of this kind of emergency in terms of focusing on the medical patent is particularly unjust. They mention that in the emergent cases, there is no alternative not to this kind of utilizing patent. Firstly, if you look at even just in Japan, Moderna, Pfizer, KMBIO, Novavax, and so on and so forth, there are lots of alternatives to this. In the worldwide cases, for example, the Chinese vaccine corporation is using alternatives doing this. That\'s why there is no strong necessity, as they mention that. ', 106),
(1091, 65, 65, 66, 'And secondly, in the ordinary cases, if one corporation, for example, invests a wonderful anti-cancer drug, in this case, for the cancer patient, there is no alternative for 20 years, but nothing from this kind of wonderful corporation. Therefore, we think the emergency is not so a constitutional component of this kind of established, trikle down the importance of property rights. Therefore, we see utilitarianism cannot trickle down the property rights. That\'s why we are very proud to oppose this motion. ', 106),
(1092, 66, 66, 67, 'So let\'s move on. Based on this kind of principle, let\'s move on to the practical issues in terms of incentive of the corporation in the status quo. There is still a reason why the country, the corporation, have no incentive to spread the vaccine. Firstly, the very simple question is very factual. Actually, in the worldwide, vaccine is spread as a result of the kindness of the corporation. This is very simple proof that their case must fail. ', 106),
(1093, 67, 67, 68, 'And on the more logical and debatable level, they mention that this is short-sighted. We think that vaccination is not only the spread in terms of vaccination, it\'s not only the short-term profit, but also that their KPI includes a reputation risk in terms of their own property, because the ESG is a particularly important criteria in the current investment criteria. Therefore, they are more careful about the reputation risk in the first place. That\'s why not only the just profit by selling the vaccine, but also the prevalence rate in the population is also the important KPI for the management of the pharmaceutical corporation. Therefore, the analysis of short-sightedness is failed. ', 106),
(1094, 68, 68, 69, 'And they also mention that knowledge share will be failed. But if you take a look at the very basic of the patent, because I actually offer the similar patent and I have similar patent after entering chemical corporations. Firstly, after sending the patent to the office, and 1.5 years after, the patent information is opened to all over the world. And after the request of the examination, the patent office examines the newness and technological advancement of the patent, and the patent will be registered. This is the very basic knowledge of the patent. We think that\'s why after, if the corporation decides to open the patent to get the patent right, their knowledge will be shared. That\'s why there are some specific features of the corporation that can be shared as worldwide knowledge in our paradigm. We think this is nothing proven in the first place. ', 106),
(1095, 69, 69, 70, 'They also mentioned Evergreen. Again, we think that Evergreen is difficult, particularly in a more competitive field, because there is necessity in terms of technological advancement, not only newness. That\'s why just a similar patent cannot be guaranteed as right, because they reject it as there is no technological advancement, the gap is not technologically advanced. Therefore, their case must fail. ', 106),
(1096, 70, 70, 71, 'In terms of the incentive of the corporation, we think this is fine. And in terms of if the corporation has the motivation to build a factory, or ODM the factory, and they sell the vaccine, this is fine. And if licensing is necessary, this is also fine. For those, for two ways of their own production and their licensing, we can guarantee, actually in the status quo, we can guarantee the number of vaccines, the number of drugs, we think this is no problem at all. ', 106),
(1097, 71, 71, 72, 'So thirdly, finally, the incentive of the corporation after production. We think the incentive of the corporation ended from two perspectives. Firstly, as the leader of the corporation mentioned, they stopped investing in the research and development, because simply the pharmaceutical corporation\'s R&D ratio is very, very high. That\'s why tremendous profit is necessary. But if they possibly sell the patent, at some point of time of the pandemic, this profit is particularly limited. But if they continue, for example, in the half a year, vaccination is recommended in Japan, in this case their benefit will be skyrocketing compared to the selling at a certain time of the pandemic. That\'s why this kind of incentive comparison is particularly significant for the corporation. ', 106),
(1098, 72, 72, 73, 'And if they still continue investing in the R&D situation, if this kind of precedence of possibly selling or possibly buying of the patent exists, in this particular occasion they stop opening that information, they stop registering the patent. Instead of that, they hinder the process as a know-how of their own corporation. This kind of knowledge sharing, as they mentioned, is never ever achieved. Therefore, even if the Italian benefit outside of this area, we are very proud to oppose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Now on to the reply portion of this debate.', 106),
(1099, 73, 73, 74, 'I\'m going to talk about two issues with my speaker. Number one, I will deeply examine the practical consequences, which can actually save more people by encouragement of the medical innovation. Second of all, I will look at the principal argument. Is that actually patent as property, right? It can be compromised in this specific occasion, as governments say, or still we need to preserve it. ', 107),
(1100, 74, 74, 75, 'So let\'s move on to the first issue about the practical consequences. So actually, let\'s move on the important question. That\'s actually government side of pharmaceutical corporation still have motivation for keep investing the research and development of the medical sphere. So we are saying as an opposition, so patent is critically important to create sustainable money, which can be paid off by their important research development fee. So on this point, government say three things. ', 107),
(1101, 75, 75, 76, 'Number one, so opposition stance also kills medical motivations, right? Because we are also, sometimes it\'s necessary, we also obligatory introduce license system to avoid a dominance and a fee, which is actually adjusted by government side. So what we are saying from position is this stance is the best compromisation to be able to coexist the medical corporation\'s motivations and also property rights over the patent, right? ', 107),
(1102, 76, 76, 77, 'And also, government is actually not decide the unacceptably extremely cheaper price. So government is, of course, to calculate how much is actually acceptable by looking into the cost that pharmaceutical corporation invest on. And of course, they would like to consider the benefit from this patent. That\'s why the price isn\'t extremely low and is going to be adjusted. This is the nuance of adjusted price. That\'s why the still pharmaceutical corporation have massive incentive to keep investing. ', 107),
(1103, 77, 77, 78, 'And also they say, even in the consequences without a patent, still this kind of vaccination is needed and demand is high. That\'s why those corporations still have motivation to keep innovating, right? So, but the price is completely different from just a selling one shot of vaccination or medication, which can be priced as 1,000 yen or something like that, versus the patent, which can be sold 1,000,000 yen to a specific corporation. ', 107),
(1104, 78, 78, 79, 'And we think this 1,000,000 yen is a very important price for this kind of pharmaceutical corporation. So to be able to pay off their cost, which is actually very expensive, human risk in hiring important scientists or engineering team or investing in their machine or mathematical model, right? And of course, this kind of 1,000,000 yen or 2,000% of the very seemingly expensive for public people is still accessible if other pharmaceutical corporation has massive incentive to take advantage of the patent, right? ', 107),
(1105, 79, 79, 80, 'And other point, they say, that many corporation is going to, other thing we like to say, other corporation is, of course, going to take a free ride, this kind of patent. And this kind of market is going to be certainly red ocean, right? That\'s why, usually, the free riding is, of course, cheaper in terms of cost of performance. And no other pharmaceutical corporation has the first winner. So that\'s why, in terms of motivation, unfortunately, their side cannot win. ', 107),
(1106, 80, 80, 81, 'So moving on to the principal case. So first of all, unfortunately, they never, ever cut the principal importance of fundamental patent as property right in the first place. And they\'re just saying this is kind of emergency situation. But things like emergency does not justify every single act to limit the human right and also corporation right, as Takai-san say. That\'s why, in the case of general principal level, we also win. That\'s why we shouldn\'t allow government abusive status. ', 107),
(1107, 81, 81, 82, 'Thank you, Chairperson. They lose this weight for two reasons. ', 108),
(1108, 82, 82, 83, 'First, contradictory stance from their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, like invasion of the property, etc, etc, but on the other hand, they say they are happy to make property be low, to guarantee the accessibility, etc, etc. I don\'t think to what extent property rights should be respected, because of their contradictory stance. ', 108),
(1109, 83, 83, 84, 'Second, they didn\'t explain under their counterfactual how domination and delay of the research and development can be possible on their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, well, some venture corporation like Moderna actually succeeded, etc, etc. But what they try to do is just pick up a useful case, a comfortable case for government opposition. To begin with, they didn\'t explain in any logic how the relatively vulnerable corporation, like the venture corporation, can override the domination by the large corporation, which government side constantly indicated from the very beginning. ', 108),
(1110, 84, 84, 85, 'But let\'s look at their case. What we got from their side of the house is that invasion of the property, right? Like opposition side tried to say, well, government side didn\'t explain to what extent corporation rights should be compromised, even in emergency cases, etc, etc. But that case, that indication can be set for government side as well, because opposition side, in general, tried to say property rights should be protected, etc, etc. ', 108),
(1111, 85, 85, 86, 'But they also didn\'t explain to what extent patent in emergency case, in this motion, particularly important as well. That\'s why this claim is not mutually exclusive. Yes, we can see government side didn\'t do well, but on the other hand, opposition side also didn\'t do well. Therefore, that cannot be the metric to choose which side we win. And also, their argument are completely example-based to begin with, analogy-based to begin with, because maybe opposition will give us logic, but it\'s too late. ', 108),
(1112, 86, 86, 87, 'And also, I think, but we think the main line from government side is that, well, whether or not this motion, this incentive corporation to commit to research and development, etc, etc. But as we already talked to you, there are, as we already talked to you, this incentivization is likely to happen for several reasons. One, this industry have a huge demand to begin with. ', 108),
(1113, 87, 87, 88, 'Second of all, committing this industry will contribute to improving the corporation reputation, because it\'s directly connecting saving precious life. ', 108),

But government side strongly tell you disincentivization are less likely to happen, and because of this motion, competition and research and development will be faster.

We think this motion has the tolerance of the employees\' rights, employers\' rights to maximize the profit of the corporation, and the employees\' right to expand their choice.

For example, if possible, they have to introduce the internet environment, and if possible, they have to make the new chat room in the corporation. But as long as possible, the employer has the right, has the moral obligation to make the new environment to the telework, so that is the stance from our side of the house.', 109),

For example, some people have to care for their parents, and some people have to raise their children. And some other people, they are very difficult to work, to come to this workplace. For example, they are very disabled, and they are very difficult to work, and so they are very difficult to long-distance transfer. So that\'s why many people, right now, have very difficulty to come to the work. Why is it? ', 109),

(1122, 6, 6, 7, 'So why is this new specialty, sorry, why only some people are admitted, and it\'s so difficult in these workplaces? Firstly, the other member feels uncomfortable with the special treatment. Sometimes, this colleague thinks they are very subordinate at home, they are very cheating in this workplace. But also, these targeted people are also uncomfortable, because they also know that other people don\'t have the satisfaction to meet. So that\'s the reason why, in this special treatment, it\'s also harm to these people, they have the difficulty to come to these workplaces. That\'s the reason, I mean, as they\'re abiding to the protection of all of the employees, this, all of the admission is very important. So that\'s the reason why we think the norm, the employee come to workplaces is already normalized. So to break up this norm, we think that to admit all of the members is very necessary in the first place.', 109),
(1123, 7, 7, 8, 'Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, in the after-plan, they can expand the lifestyle choices. For example, in the after-plan, the reason is very simple, the mother and the father who can\'t find this kindergarten, and this is a very small number of the kindergarten, basically in the social program. However, in the after-plan, even if they cannot find this kindergarten, also they can, both of the parents can work at home, and at the same time, they can also care about the children. That\'s the reason why many different and diverse people can equally work at home.

(1131, 15, 15, 16, 'Firstly, they generally talk about the interests of the employees. Firstly, we are not going to oppose a voluntary implementation of work from home by the employer in the first place. If the employer feels it\'s necessary or it fits the current trend, the employer will voluntarily do so.

For example, the companies have to allow the employees to take care of the elderly, or the company has to hire disabled people. So we think in that kind of instances, the companies probably have a voluntary incentive to allow those disabled employees to work from home if there is a dire necessity. But we think that forcing all employees to work from home is damaging for some instances, which I\'ll explain later. ', 110),
(1133, 17, 17, 18, 'Secondly, they talk about, well, this is also beneficial for the employees as well. Once again, we are not going to oppose voluntary allowance of these work from home. So we don\'t think it\'s an issue in today\'s debate.', 110),
(1134, 18, 18, 19, '<POI>Under special treatment, for example, in parental leave, the other employee doesn\'t regard them as the same employee. Also, this norm is also harmful to these people. Why is it so justifiable? ', 110),

(1136, 20, 20, 21, 'So on to the first issue, why forcing all employees to be in office is in certain instances critically important. So we have the three-level analysis as to why being in office is critically important for increasing productivity or efficiency or speed. Firstly, we think that transparency so that employers are able to check whether the employees are effectively working is quite important. Because if an individual works from home, for example, they can be distracted because of their children. Maybe they talk to them, or maybe they have to talk to their families, and so forth. They may not be able to be focused on the work all the time and all the day.', 110),
(1137, 21, 21, 22, 'And also, there are certain communication barriers that are going to increase. Because if, for example, two employees are in the office, they are able to cooperate.', 110),
(1138, 22, 22, 23, 'Thirdly, we think that in terms of security, being in the office is critically important. Because if individuals are allowed to work from home, maybe their information in the personal computer may be seen by their families or their friends. Or maybe, for example, if people are able to work from home, they can work at a cafe or outside their home. In that kind of instances, there\'s a certain possibility those kinds of information may be revealed to the member other than the corporation employees. But we think that for these reasons, the productivity or efficiency or speed may decrease.', 110),
(1139, 23, 23, 24, 'And the government might say, well, this efficiency or productivity is marginal. But we don\'t think it\'s marginal. We think in certain instances, this lack of efficiency or a bit of delay of the work is critically damaging for the corporation. Because oftentimes, these corporations have to conduct their working in a limited time. For example, in case of the insurance industry, usually March or December is the renewal period. And during that limited period, these kind of workers have to do a lot of work. They have a lot of tons of negotiations. They have to prepare for a lot of presentation or paper material so that they are able to negotiate. And one delay or one day delay or one hour delay may lead to a decrease of the profit, decrease of the premium from those kind of companies. Or in case of tech companies, for example, that people have to repair the error or bugs in the system. We see, for example, this is a finance system, that the one day or one hour delay of repairing those kind of bugs lead to the massive loss for the company or massive loss of trust from the customers. We think this is going to be damaging for the company in certain instances. ', 110),
(1140, 24, 24, 25, 'Therefore, that these kind of corporations are more likely to not allow, no thank you, to employees to work from home. And we think that being in the office and doing the work as efficient as possible is extremely necessary. Therefore, we think that corporations have to do so.', 110),
(1141, 25, 25, 26, 'Secondly, the corporation right, right? So, generally, corporations have the right to limit the employees\' choice. In other words, they require employees to act in a certain way. Because the fact that the corporation are imposing the working, meaning that the corporation are already depriving their work, their time in the first place. Or if necessary, for example, the corporation are able to require getting certain qualification in case of the accountants are actually in accordance with the need for the work. Or in case of the teacher, teacher cannot express political opinion during the school, whatever, so forth, because it\'s required as a job, right? So, in accordance with the job, that corporation are able to limit the action of the employee in a certain way, right? ', 110),
(1142, 26, 26, 27, 'And we think this applies to this motion as well. Because, as I said, that being in the office and increasing the efficiency is critically important in some way, right? ', 110),
(1143, 27, 27, 28, 'And we think the only exception we have that the corporation are not able to do so is that there is a dire need in the first place. For example, in case of child care leaving, like requirement of having disabled employees. Or maybe that, for example, the corporation have to, corporation, like, there\'s a certain limit on the working times. We agree to that. ', 110),
(1144, 28, 28, 29, 'But we think that as long as corporation are fulfilling those kind of minimum level of the requirement by the government, we think that it\'s immoral for the government to require even further. Because those kind of efficiency is extremely and critically important for the corporation\'s sustenance, for the stakeholders as well. Therefore, we beg to oppose.', 110),
(1145, 29, 29, 30, 'Because employers are at the top of the company, we believe that their salary is high and their social status is stable. Because of this, we believe that, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. Their salaries are low compared to their employers, and their social status is unstable, and they are easily fired by the company when the company faces depression. And we believe that, at this point, the most vulnerable actor in this debate is that employee. And we believe that that\'s why we have to force all companies to allow their employees to work from home. And that\'s why we have to take this plan.', 111),
(1146, 30, 30, 31, 'So, first of all, let me rebut the first argument. So, they talked about the productivity will decrease because of the work in the home. So, we have three rebuts here. First rebut is about the employees\' benefits. As our first speaker told you, this plan is giving employees more options. And because of this, more employees can work in the company. For example, people who live in Shimane can also work in Tokyo. And not only people in Japan, but also people in a foreign country can also have a large capability of working. The company can also hire these kinds of people if we take this plan. And it will be easier for them to hire these kinds of people. So, first of all, again, there is some benefit for the employers. ', 111),
(1147, 31, 31, 32, 'And the second rebut is about the productivity. So, they said that productivity will decrease. However, in the 21st century, we believe that most of the work is done by facing the PC. So, the desk work is prioritized in the company. So, we believe that these kinds of work can also be done in the home. Although they are in the home. Because they also have enough facility in their home. ', 111),
(1148, 32, 32, 33, 'And the third rebut is that even if it decreases the productivity of the company, we believe that the government has the right to force employers to accept these kinds of damage to some extent. For example, as our first speaker told you about giving example of that company has to hire disabled people to some extent. So, we believe that even if it decreases the productivity, it should be allowed.', 111),
(1149, 33, 33, 34, 'So, let me talk about three things in my speech. ', 111),
(1150, 34, 34, 35, '<POI>So, the world you\'re envisioning is where you\'re going to have teachers. You\'re going to have all these employees working at home. How can you guarantee all these security issues are going to be resolved under your house? ', 111),
(1151, 35, 35, 36, 'So, we believe that the security issue of this debate, security can also be well done in our paradigm. Because we believe that in taking after this plan, we believe that almost all companies will have the environment for providing these kinds of facilities. And we believe that these kinds of home working will be much more done in our paradigm. We believe that much more technique will be developed in our paradigm. So, we believe that these kinds of security problems can be solved in our paradigm.', 111),
(1152, 36, 36, 37, 'So, let me talk about who should we save in this debate. So, who is the most vulnerable actor in this debate? So, this is the employee. First, the point is that employees are more sensitive. Let me talk about the employers. They are top of the company. Their salary is high and their social status is stable. So, they will not be damaged by some minor change. And they only face difficulty when the company has a huge debt. And these kinds of things are much less possibility. ', 111),
(1153, 37, 37, 38, 'And compared to employers, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. So, their salaries are low and their social status is unstable. Because they are easily fired by the company when they face this depression. So, we believe that at this point, employees are more sensitive. And because of this, they are the most vulnerable actor in this debate. ', 111),
(1154, 38, 38, 39, 'The second point is why do we have to protect the most vulnerable actor? Why do the employers have the duty to protect these kinds of things? This is because the employers get benefits from the employees. So, they have the duty to protect all of the employees. And especially have to protect workers, vulnerable workers. For example, like people who have to raise their children. Who have to care of their parents. Who have difficulty in commuting because they are disabled. They have handicaps. And these kinds of people will be most harmed without help. So, we have to save these kinds of people. ', 111),
(1155, 39, 39, 40, 'And for example, like in Japan. As I told you, there is a law that employees should hire some number of disabled employees. And so, we believe that in this reason, we have to protect most vulnerable employees. And that\'s why we have to take this plan.', 111),
(1156, 40, 40, 41, 'And let me talk about why forcing all employees is important. So, first of all, this is because it is difficult for employees to say out when there are some exceptions. So, employees have less power than the employers. So, it\'s difficult for the employees to say that I would like to work in their home because of their childcare. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all of them not to make these kinds of victims. Thank you.', 111),
(1157, 41, 41, 42, 'I will explain our first argument, the importance of variation in the space of people\'s lives. I will explain the merit of employees and how to go to the companies. In the first place, if a lot of employees don\'t go to the company, there is no reason to go to the office. It is a very serious point. As the first speaker told you about communication, if an employee wants to do a meeting, they can\'t do it smoothly because their house is built out of bad reasons. I will explain later. Also, the employee can\'t correspond quickly to work at home. I will explain this reason.', 112),
(1158, 42, 42, 43, 'First of all, I will explain in the case of employees. Why is it important to go to the company? Because they can limit the quality of life of the company. This reason is that employees can separate their time to their life and working time. The company is a very important space to work. ', 112),
(1159, 43, 43, 44, 'However, after taking this motion, bad things will happen. First, some employees will neglect their work for some reason. First reason is that they can\'t concentrate on their work. For example, if there are a lot of young children at home, they will cry. They want to pray for their parents. It is very serious because the father or the parents can\'t do their work or can\'t do the meeting. Also, the case of women is very serious. Of course, women want to take care of their children. However, if working from home is okay, women have to take care of their children. It is impossible to concentrate on their work. ', 112),
(1160, 44, 44, 45, 'The first reason is that the company may take a guarantee. For example, a set of nursery or maternity leave. It is important to concentrate on their work. The company can get profit. ', 112),
(1161, 45, 45, 46, 'The second reason is that the relaxed time will disappear. The company presses their work out of work. It is very serious because employees will be impressed with the amount of work at home. It is very serious because the family time will disappear. They can\'t relax in their home. Variations of people\'s life will disappear. I will explain the second reason.', 112),
(1162, 46, 46, 47, 'The second reason is that the company has to make a profit. Employees can regulate their private time. Go to the company\'s merit. Employees can see the amount of work. They can prevent overwork. However, after taking this plan, employees can\'t see the amount of work. Employees will have a lot of tasks. It is very serious for the situation. ', 112),
(1163, 47, 47, 48, 'The second reason is that productivity will decrease. As I told you, the concentration will decrease. The quality of life will decrease. It is very serious to spend life. It is very serious for not only the employees but also the company and employers. Employees are confused about their private life. If we take this motion. Therefore, I oppose this motion. Thank you.', 112),
(1164, 48, 48, 49, 'The most problematic issue surrounding employees is that the employers just seek for profit and only have a narrow point of vision based on their old-fashioned working experience and aren\'t realizing the true benefits given by the work at home, the telework.

(1166, 50, 50, 51, 'They said that there is some kind of discommunication problem. You cannot tell other people that you want to do some kind of work or other things. But firstly, if it\'s that kind of situation, we think that we should introduce this kind of telework to all people. Because if you are the least person who is only doing telework, it\'s very hard to tell other people that you want to do something at home. For example, I want to take care of our parents at home. It\'s very hard to say. Because of this, it is very harmful for the individuals because individuals cannot choose these kinds of things. ', 113),

So we don\'t think that this kind of thing is good. ', 113),
(1168, 52, 52, 53, 'But rather, we think that these kinds of problems can also be solved by the telework.

That\'s actually why we\'re going to say that all employees should be allowed to do telework. Because we want to liberalize all people by forcing it.

(1171, 55, 55, 56, 'But secondly, we say that even if you are in your company, these things are still leaking. We think that there is no difference between these kind of two.

(1172, 56, 56, 57, 'And fourthly, they say that some people neglect their work because they cannot concentrate on their work. Well, firstly, this is a very stigmatized case, right? We say that even if you are at home, you can have some kind of concentration. ', 113),

Because if you cut Skype or other kinds of working things, you can have your own private time. No, thank you. We think that is very important.

(1184, 68, 68, 69, 'I think that\'s a pretty minor case, but let\'s say that\'s a very prominent issue and that we need to actually look at this. I think the issue is that there was no process. I will stress that the biggest issue is that there\'s probably going to be no central institution because everyone\'s going to be working at home. What this means is that there\'s going to be things like online interviews, online meetings, and the issue is this, is that there\'s no transparency, right? Just because you\'re a graduate from Harvard doesn\'t mean they\'re necessarily capable or that they\'re capable of doing everything without any kind of mystique. ', 114),
(1185, 69, 69, 70, 'I think that there are issues like miscommunication when you work at home, that I think these kind of miscommunication and just an increase of procrastination are a lot of things that are very viable.

(1186, 70, 70, 71, 'But I will argue that even if it was so important, I think it\'s possible on our side because if a multinational company, I think it\'s possible to have a lot of companies in different places.

Therefore, I think this talk about birth lottery is something that\'s rather much better on our side.', 114),
(1187, 71, 71, 72, 'Secondly, let\'s talk about the quality of life. The context they gave was that, hey, have to look after children or hey, that these children have to look after their elderly because they\'re weak. Given that this is a debate about all employers forcing all employees to work at home, I think they also needed to defend the cases where they didn\'t have anything. They didn\'t have any kind of children. They didn\'t have any parents living with them. I still, given this context, I don\'t think there\'s any just reason to forcibly make people stay at home and work there where there could be a lot of security issues, a lot of miscommunication and force these people to stay at home.

(1188, 72, 72, 73, 'But let\'s say, and let\'s look at these contexts of having children and grandpa. There\'s two issues. First is that they say that you could concentrate at home, but I don\'t think you could really concentrate with a crying baby in the background. I think you\'re going to be rather focused. I don\'t think that having your own internal issues at home, but also job issues is necessarily a good thing.', 114),
(1189, 73, 73, 74, 'But we agree that this argument, this rebuttal isn\'t enough to resolve this certain issue of, well, having these elderly or having children. And I think that the biggest thing that I want to stress and the thing that government whip never addressed was that these problems like women\'s issue, like unequal pay, no maternity leave is not a problem of employers not allowing their employees to work from home. I think it is an issue of employers not taking any active and sustainable measures to ensure a sustainable environment. Therefore, I think that what we could do on our side is to make sure that there\'s going to be maternity leave, make sure there\'s going to be a sustainable environment, make sure that people don\'t have to suffer when they go from home and make sure that they have enough opportunities to look after their parents or children.

(1192, 76, 76, 77, 'First, let\'s look at security. I think this is a very important point because these kinds of miscommunications, these kinds of information processing, and the privacy is literally what is able to maintain a company\'s life. That is the information of a new product or consumer data is something that is really important, and I think it wasn\'t simply enough for government whip to say, hey, it wasn\'t so important.', 114),
(1193, 77, 77, 78, 'They said that, hey, it happens on our side, but I think that the biggest issue is that it\'s going to happen more on their side because I think the security breaches and hacking is a very urgent issue that has to be ultimately resulted where people are able to simultaneously work together in a working environment and try to combat that issue.', 114),
(1194, 78, 78, 79, 'The problem is, on their side, you\'re going to have people perhaps sleeping at different times, and if you\'re going to be living in different time zones, you won\'t be able to simultaneously deal with these kinds of things or miscommunications, which could potentially lead to different products and different types of chaos. I think that when you\'re separated, you\'re not going to be able to face these issues much better unless you\'re going to be in this cooperative environment. Therefore, upon security, I think it\'s a big issue, and I think it\'s something that\'s going to be worse on their side. ', 114),
(1195, 79, 79, 80, 'Lastly, let\'s look at productivity very simply. They said that, hey, if people don\'t concentrate, you can fire them. The issue is twofold. First is that it\'s going to be hard to see if they\'re concentrating in the first place. That\'s why it\'s going to be extremely hard to regulate this.', 114),
(1196, 80, 80, 81, 'But second, it\'s not easy for the company to fire people because they\'re literally the companions of a company. I think if every employee is procrastinating, you can\'t fire everyone. Therefore, upon productivity, we see it\'s going to be much worse on their side. ', 114),
(1197, 81, 81, 82, 'We think there\'s going to be security breaches, miscommunication, and a lot of overall breaches of employers\' rights. I think that ultimately, all their benefits can be obtained on our side. Therefore, we think we should win this way. I\'m very happy.', 114),
(1198, 82, 82, 83, 'Two Clarifications. Firstly, we are fine that if it is in the interest of the employers, they are voluntarily going to do so.

(1199, 83, 83, 84, 'Secondly, they talked about what employees generally have the right. That\'s a general idea. We agree that to a certain extent, employees have a right, but employers also have a right to a certain extent. This is a matter of extent; therefore, we have to assess the pragmatic consequences as to why or whether this policy is uniquely beneficial or harmful for each actor.', 115),
(1200, 84, 84, 85, 'Moving on to the first issue - the interest of the employees. The problem with their case is that many of their problem depictions were not uniquely relevant to the motion. They expected the problem of the child raising issue or disabled people or the stress due to the working. We think those kinds of things are already measured by countermeasures such as the mandate of childcare leave or the mandate of hiring disabled people. Also, the annual aggregate working hour is quite limited by the law. ', 115),
(1201, 85, 85, 86, 'We think those kinds of countermeasures are already seen in the status quo, and they didn\'t really explain why a blanket allowance is necessary.', 115),
(1202, 86, 86, 87, 'The deal we already told you, and which was unresponded by the government side, is that it can be worse for the employees, this policy, because there\'s a boundary between working and private life that is going to diminish under their house. We think that if these employees feel pressured by the corporations to work well, as they characterize, probably they\'re always thinking about working during breakfast, for example, during dinnertime or immediately before sleeping. They may be pressured to start to open the computer and start to work. We think that this is a thing that currently many employees are actually claiming in the status quo.', 115),
(1203, 87, 87, 88, 'Therefore, the conclusion here is that the benefit or interest of the employers they describe can be better in certain instances, but it can be worse in other instances.

(1204, 88, 88, 89, 'Also, of course, we already told you that the interest of the employers or the company is quite urgent. They say it\'s marginal, but we think this marginal one day, one hour delay can be critical.', 115),

(1206, 90, 90, 91, 'Also, there\'s a certain security concern, irrespective of the technology, that the risk of the information being seen by other people is going to increase. This is crucially problematic.', 115),
(1207, 91, 91, 92, 'Lastly, the overall comparison. What this is, as I already told you, that got failed to explain or depict in the picture why this policy is uniquely necessary, other than any other measures in the first place.

(1210, 94, 94, 95, 'So and why we have to force all employers to allow employees to do telework two reasons here is that the first reason is that it is difficult for an employee to claim when they are not all allowed. So only one employer has less power, and it\'s difficult for them to say that they want to do telework. Although all other employees are working in a company, they will be feared to be fired by the company, and they cannot say such a thing, and they will have a problem in the care of their parents or care of their children or in the commuting.

(1212, 96, 96, 97, 'What was our proposal? What was our proposition goal? Proposition goal was that giving more opportunities for people to work, for example, like people who have to care parents or children.

(1214, 98, 98, 99, 'And second about the security issue. First of all, we think that these kinds of things are out of the debate because it means that it is technically technically impossible to secure these kinds of security.

So simply, we think the punishment mitigated based on you being drunk, by mitigating this based on being drunk, victims are not inadequately compensated. They feel their damage, and damage isn\'t really fully compensated. And also, the criminal also don\'t really regret the problems that they caused during drunk, and they actually end up causing repetitive crime, and we think this possibility will be higher under their paradigm, right?

So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments, and probably that is your choice also, right?

So even if you have multiple judgments, that doesn\'t mean that you are not responsible for action. You should be punished equally, right? So why is this important at the end of the day? We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the bitter-bitter justice for victims, right? Victims don\'t care why you started drinking or started, you know, you lost your judgment ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which those are the ones who didn\'t choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example.

(1230, 11, 11, 12, 'Before we move to my substantive, I have several presentations about our stance. First of all, we are debating on the existence of the concept about intoxication defense. We are not saying sentences for people who have committed a crime when they are drunk should be always mitigated, regardless of context. It\'s like any other existing defenses, like insanity defense. When perpetrators submit insanity defense as a case to ask for mitigation, there will be careful discussion about whether or not they actually don\'t have responsibility. If the court believes the application of that defense is good, maybe it should be applied. If the court doesn\'t think it is, it should not be applied.

We claim the responsibility to not respect that regulation, but we are saying the consequences of things like being drunk or other substances should be mitigated, compared to other, for example, general murders, general damage to individuals, that\'s the stance from our side of the house.', 118),
(1232, 13, 13, 14, 'So from the legal approach, I want to talk about two things. First of all, why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense principally, and I will, secondly, deep dive on specific cases why it is not reasonable to abolish intoxication defense in their side of the house. ', 118),
(1233, 14, 14, 15, 'Before that, several independent rebuttals to the Prime Minister. First of all, they provided cases about rape repeatedly. I don\'t say it\'s completely irrelevant at all. But problems regarding rape cases are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense but in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of sentences for rape are generally very low. Those kinds of issues are consistently discussed in the current context. We say, they are talking about rape is very lightly treated. It\'s not about this debate. They need to talk about it in other debates.', 118),
(1234, 15, 15, 16, 'And secondly, they are talking about victims. Victims\' rights are unrespected in the status quo. But criminal cases don\'t respect victims\' rights to much extent, unfortunately, as a system. Victims\' voices are heard as one evidence to discuss culpability, but victims\' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be heard already in the status quo. If you want to argue some compensation things for the rape victims, it will be another debate about intoxication defense in civil cases. That will be a completely different debate. Then, also, it\'s the same for insanity defense. Victims don\'t care that people have mental illness or so forth. But still, insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator\'s right and prosecute individual in a fair manner. That\'s the core principle of the criminal justice system.', 118),
(1235, 16, 16, 17, 'So let\'s move on to my first point about the principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the prosecuting individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice system is built on a trust of citizens. Every single individual should feel it\'s a fair jurisdiction under equality of law. That\'s why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law. If people feel it\'s not fair, I don\'t have any responsibility for this particular crime. That way criminal justice system cannot work in the first place.', 118),
(1236, 17, 17, 18, 'And secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of an individual to a great extent which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for consequences caused by the person without any doubt by the individual. That\'s why we assume presumption of innocence. In order to protect the right of individual who committed a crime, that\'s why we put the burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors not on the side of defendants. So that should be consistently working in a status quo. That\'s why using intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house.', 118),
(1237, 18, 18, 19, 'Then let\'s move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained. So for example, Ms. Speaker, taking alcohol and other intoxicant substances are oftentimes inevitable. For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it\'s really inevitable to go out drinking with customers. It\'s not limited to alcohol, Ms. Speaker. For example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things which they can do in other very ordinary situations. For example, you may receive Tamiflu as a drug for influenza. So in those circumstances, patients don\'t have any ways to avoid taking those medicines, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their side of the house.', 118),
(1238, 19, 19, 20, 'But in their circumstances, when they abolish every single intoxication defense, the people who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances and the people who commit a murder when they take Tamiflu are going to be prosecuted in the same way in their side of the house. That is very helpful in terms of fairness for individuals who don\'t feel like I\'m very untreated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons. That\'s why we think that should stand before moving on here.', 118),
(1239, 20, 20, 21, 'Okay. Tamiflu is taken in the case of influenza, right? You choose to go aside the beings that are severely ill, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the case of the complete harm of the influenza. I don\'t understand your point of information. Taking Tamiflu is also the realm of this debate. We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicated circumstances. They need to defend why people who are under the law need to be prosecuted in the same way compared to other people in ordinary circumstances. ', 118),
(1240, 21, 21, 22, 'So why is this analysis important? Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defense from insanity defense in their side of the house was that a person didn\'t choose to be in that situation. But in many circumstances, even about alcohol, about other intoxicated circumstances, a person didn\'t choose to be in that situation. For example, they don\'t choose to be a sales rep. They don\'t choose to be going drinking with customers. That will be the order from, for example, the boss. That is not controllable consequences for individuals. That\'s why they are mainly distinguished that intoxication defense from other defenses are already not standing in their side of the house.', 118),
(1241, 22, 22, 23, 'And also, we told you, so that\'s important. And also, we told you, in those circumstances, victims, for example, when customers are punched by those sales reps, don\'t care whether people are better or not, people are drunk or not. But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for those consequences is severely different from people who are doing the same thing in ordinary circumstances. We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility. There will be sentences anyway in our side of the house. But we say there is a slight difference over that responsibility that individuals can take. That should be affecting the sentences that individuals will receive in our side of the house. For all these reasons, we are very proud to oppose.', 118),

They are sitting in a room where they think they are responsible for the inevitable action ordered by the boss, meaning that it\'s massively contradictory. They have agreed that there are cases, well, I mean, in their cases specifically, in their favorite cases, that even in the inevitable cases, there are rooms where those people are responsible for their actions. What we argue from our proposition is that their case, what they told us, is not inevitable in any way, but even if they are inevitable, they already made a massive concession by their side that they should take responsibility on the inevitable cases. We don\'t really understand why. 20% it was boss\'s fault for me to reduce it, but 80% was, you\'re coerced, but still it\'s responsible by yourself. They have to deserve it.

And I think actually being forgiven a part of it, it was, you know, it was a side effect, right? I couldn\'t do anything about it.

So when a mentally ill person decided that this person is going to go out, that person, already before going out, does not have a full capability of deciding what\'s going to happen when they go outside.

If you\'re going to deny, it\'s not like you\'re going to be killed, right? There are a couple of options you can take. One worst-case scenario, just quit.

We think that very function as well. There are lots of options that a person can take. And moreover, if that\'s necessary, we think that boss should also be coerced, right, into punishment, etcetera.

They have realized, what boss told me to do is I\'m just going to drink a far lot more than the capacity I can have in order to create all the problems, right? We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control on their mind, but they didn\'t choose to, and therefore those people deserve punishment.

So that\'s the state of the government\'s side has to need to decide any cases that\'s why students need not necessarily to consider about the intoxication defense, even if there is a certain possible existence, it\'s obvious that they cannot control themselves this kind of situation. Rather, they can provide proof as to why students, in any case, need to abolish the concept of this type of defense itself. ', 120),
(1255, 36, 36, 37, 'The second point is that we do not rather than have the responsibility to disperse completely any no responsibility about committing a crime. Obviously, we are more than happy to consider the extent, to what extent they cannot control themselves, the understanding of these things, or furthermore, we are more than happy to consider whether or not they can avoid becoming intoxicated or not, to what extent the harassment by the bossy case, or to what extent they can avoid taking medicine, this kind of thing. We are more than happy to also consider this kind of situation. So, that\'s the clarification. So, I have one question. First of all, whether or not we can have the responsibility to disperse properly becoming intoxicated or not. ', 120),
(1256, 37, 37, 38, 'Before moving on, that\'s two points of response. So, they\'re talking about, they\'re consciously talking about that as a student, we cannot make this sense of rape problematic, people are using these defenses, and they\'re committing again and again. It\'s obvious that out of the debate, if this rape is problematic, people are actually intentionally committing crime, again and again, and abusing this type of defense. We are more than happy to also consider this situation. So, obviously, these people are abusing all day, and certain consciousness, we are more than happy to punish them. It\'s obvious that the debate, what the debate is about, we can just allow the people who became intoxicated, the situation, can have the responsibility about their action or not. ', 120),
(1257, 38, 38, 39, 'First of all, they\'re talking about, the first speaker talking about the rape culture, etc. Two responses here. First of all, fundamentally, it\'s also nothing to do with us, this motion based on us, it\'s obviously that defense is at the principle level. Furthermore, we say that the rape culture is obviously related with us, whether or not the court making, particular decision making, or not. So, even if it\'s a significantyl related to these, and also, after this system, people recognizing that the responsibility or the situation in the toxication, it\'s rather counterproductive, I think that. Because in such cases those potential criminals may figure out way how to defend themselves by blaming victims. For example, victimes can be thought to know the culture and created the situation and have some responsibility. So, that\'s rather counterproductive to combtat rape culture. Uh but it\'s not so much relevant to this motion. But after all, it\'s counterproductive.', 120),
(1258, 39, 39, 40, 'Okay, so, um, okay, moving on to the first issue, my issue, whether or not we can, whether or not these people have a responsibility in the intoxication situation. So, we think that, generally, that these people cannot avoid and cannot control themselves, and actually they are committing a crime, because they are in the situation of intoxication. Two layers of analysis. First of all, before they become intoxicated, whether or not they can choose to become intoxicated or not. So, we think that, because as my partner already told you, it\'s obviously that it\'s inevitable to become intoxicated. For example, taking the medicine, or the sudden pressure from the boss\'s existence. They don\'t just quit, or just control themselves, etc. ', 120),
(1259, 40, 40, 41, 'So, first of all, as I already mentioned, we want to also consider that to what extent this pressure is so huge or not. So, that\'s why we still recognize that even the power harassment is recognized as sexual harassment, it\'s problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it, some people are forced to do particular actions. So, on that occasion, we also consider that part. ', 120),
(1260, 41, 41, 42, 'For example, they talk about that they took the preemptive measure, they do not go outside, etc. Two responses here. First of all, it\'s from the perspective of the individual who is gradually becoming intoxicated. It\'s extremely difficult to understand to what extent I am rational, to what extent I am becoming intoxicated, etc. Even taking drugs, or even taking alcohol. So, on that occasion, even still, yes, they believe in that. Maybe I am 30% rational, maybe I do not commit a crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation. So, on that occasion, it\'s easy to understand whether I am rational or not, but still, they need to keep their ordinary life. They need to, for example, take drugs, they go to the supermarket, or some situation. So, on that occasion, someone believes, maybe I am not so much, 30% rational, I do not commit a crime, etc. Are they going to do so? Actually, it\'s obviously not so much easy to take preemptive measures.', 120),

(1262, 43, 43, 44, 'It\'s obviously nothing to do with this debate. Because even if the children commit more crimes, they will still be supporting the child\'s defense over this kind of idea. The obvious thing is that, whether or not people commit a crime or not, it\'s obviously a different debate as to whether or not we can give a punishment to those people, and whether or not we can consider that in this kind of situation. So, okay. And also, still that they have a certain punishment, a huge punishment in existence, obviously that\'s workable, as it turns out.', 120),
(1263, 44, 44, 45, 'Second point, about the other day, becoming the intoxication situation. So, as I already mentioned that, whether or not they are intoxicated or not, it\'s extremely important, that\'s a big metric. Furthermore, if you want to become intoxicated, you cannot consider that so much. What I mean by this, is that if you become intoxicated, you can understand what is the linkage with your action, and what is the consequence of that. So, for example, just people who drink too much, so, punching something, so they do not understand whether or not it\'s a damage to this something, or also how to damage themselves, this kind of thing.', 120),
(1264, 45, 45, 46, 'So, people cannot understand what is the consequence of their action. They can easily imagine that. So, that\'s why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people, because they cannot understand what is their action, and what are the consequences of their action. It\'s very much the same as child defense, or insanity defense, these kinds of things. So, that\'s why they do not intentionally commit crimes. They learn how to accidentally commit crimes. It\'s not easy to think that this is a responsibility of that person. So, what I told you, first of all, this is a debate about to what extent people have a responsibility. First of all, we think that it\'s not easy to avoid becoming intoxicated. Furthermore, after becoming intoxicated, people cannot control themselves. So, that\'s why we propose.', 120),
(1265, 46, 46, 47, 'Chair, what makes this debate apparently difficult for the government is that we must defend a rather sweeping policy of not recognizing any intoxication defense. It might seem that the degree of responsibility differs between intoxicated criminals and non-intoxicated criminals, so it might seem, according to the opposition, that when it comes to deciding on mitigation, this difference of degrees of responsibility should be taken into account, hence intoxication defense, and the opposition might seem to have a very easy debate here. So that\'s why they didn\'t deepen their case beyond self-cultural things.', 121),

The way we as a society view substance intoxication and the way we inform people about it justifies a special case against intoxication defense sweepingly, and that is the point I\'m going to summarize in this speech.', 121),
(1267, 48, 48, 49, 'So, unfortunately, I have only one flashpoint, which is obviously how we should recognize the difference of degrees of responsibility between intoxicated and non-intoxicated criminals. So the main point was clear from the leader of the opposition, saying that responsibility should be carefully calculated in case of criminal cases because public trust in the criminal justice system is important, and because rights restrictions should always be carefully justified on a case-by-case basis. So the first response to this general argument is that, this is shallow, I think, but the second response is that if trust matters, then the leader of the opposition\'s rebuttal to our Prime Minister\'s point about the victims\' interests doesn\'t stand at all because we generally have doubts on the criminal justice system that continually decreases the terms of imprisonment of criminals just because they were intoxicated at the moment, right? So we think if we are carrying all the public trust in the criminal justice system, we think that comes in favor of our case against this kind of defense.', 121),
(1268, 49, 49, 50, 'And the second response is against their point about rights restrictions. Any rights restriction should be justified adequately. And we have no disagreement here. This point is, I think, related to a deeper issue that the opposition side presupposed but not explained. Free will or self-control. We say that the degree of responsibility of one\'s action should be based upon how much reasonable self-control one could have exercised in the process leading to criminal actions, right? So those who lack the ability to act on self-control at any point of that process cannot be punished as harshly as those who are self-controlling. That might be the opposition\'s case.', 121),
(1269, 50, 50, 51, 'And now we have to make some differentiation between substance intoxication and non-intoxication. So how does substance intoxication differ from other cases of diminishing responsibility? So the opposition prefers analogies of mental illness or insanity defense, or more specifically, or characteristically for today\'s opposition, side effects of medicines.', 121),
(1270, 51, 51, 52, 'So firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one\'s own self-controlled choice that one enters the gate to intoxication. So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, begins from one\'s choice in the first place. Not only that, the continual substance addiction or the ongoing process of being addicted can be avoided, could have been avoided, by one\'s own self-controlled choices. For example, going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals. ', 121),
(1271, 52, 52, 53, 'And that choice, or that self-controlled choice, was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions. So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-intoxicated defendant\'s cases. So we think this is the massive difference of substance intoxication from other cases, such as mental illnesses because obviously there is no self-control in the process leading to mental illness and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses.', 121),
(1272, 53, 53, 54, '<POI> If your argument is true, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? Sorry? So if the fact that you knew it and you opt into it is all that matters, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? ', 121),
(1273, 54, 54, 55, 'No, we don\'t have to make that distinction because... Okay, let\'s talk about that later. Okay, let\'s take the preferred cases one by one.', 121),
(1274, 55, 55, 56, 'So this said first, then what about the side effect of medicines? So we think the opposition cannot just throw one possible case of intoxication. They must show that such a case is significantly likely to lead to intoxicated criminal actions that are totally detached from self-control\'s decision-making. So we think that deep explanation was lacking in the opposition\'s case despite the fact that they tried to be specific about each case.', 121),
(1275, 56, 56, 57, 'Secondly, they said, then what about being forced by bosses to drink? Bassai already responded in his rebuttals, but to put the fundamental point from a criminal policy perspective, we have always warned the public or cautioned the public of the dangers of substance intoxication in our daily practices. For example, we campaign against drug violence. Those campaign posters against drug violence appear time and again in train stations, for example. An anti-drug campaign exists everywhere. Also, Tamifu is already known as dangerous enough to distort your calculation, right? So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control. ', 121),
(1276, 57, 57, 58, 'Also, the fact that we abolished intoxication defense will enhance our ability to deal with such problems as forcing and persecution-related problems. The point is that the way society approaches crimes expresses the society\'s view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing to drink is dangerous, Tamifu is dangerous, and all these evaluations of the opposition\'s proposed problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated upon on a daily basis. And we think these kinds of effects don\'t exist for mental illness, right? We can\'t warn people against becoming mentally ill, and we think this is a clear distinction. Enough. We are done.', 121),
(1277, 58, 58, 59, 'So, it\'s like three speakers saying the same thing, but it\'s important once again to note that their verdict is proof that this framework should be abolished. Because we have told you that if there are circumstances in which this could be applied, like in cases where prescribed medicine causes a new side effect because you were not being well that day and you did something terrible. It might be that you have a hard drinking session and you did some terrible thing, but it\'s kind of a cultural thing, you know, cooperation that was unavoidable for you.', 122),

We were telling you that it might be that in some cases they are really responsible, but there are multiple cases where these people do not take the reasonable culpability as compared to where they were rational and not drinking or not being intoxicated by the substances. ', 122),
(1279, 60, 60, 61, 'I\'m telling you that I think the distinction reasonably exists, this framework should exist. Once again, this circumstantial argument from coming from God, we can deal with them specifically. The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were caused into situations because they were telling us that for some minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice. I don\'t think that\'s how justice should work.', 122),
(1280, 61, 61, 62, 'Three questions. Firstly, is this policy beneficial or are those benefits justified in taking this policy? Secondly, should the consent on whether you\'re drunk or not matter in the debate? And thirdly, if I have time, I\'ll talk about what is important in the criminal justice system. So, rebuttals integrated. ', 122),
(1281, 62, 62, 63, 'So, is this policy beneficial or are the benefits justified? So, the main argument is that rape is terrible, we\'ve got to do something, and they\'re willing to say that rape is so important that they\'re willing to abolish it if they don\'t care about the traitor. One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in addressing the situation. We\'re talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice framework. We\'re talking about investigations and assessing of situations that are especially in drunk cases being highlighted as Scandinavian nations taking more hard criminal sanctions on rape cases where people are doing active things and trying to get away with it. These discussions are happening and these things are gradually changing. I don\'t necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute because if you are able to put in specific clauses about drunk cases in rape situations, then they achieve their goal.', 122),
(1282, 63, 63, 64, 'So, the argument is best saying that we should abolish intoxication defense in rape cases and not necessarily supporting the motion. Because if it takes the alternative, you don\'t have to sacrifice all the alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked about, and people intoxicated at the time of one\'s sins and get all their benefits. So, I don\'t know why they\'re willing to get the trade-off. ', 122),
(1283, 64, 64, 65, 'But even if we concede that they can get the benefit, we argue that criminal justice is about inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation. So, ultimately, your attempt to prize one specific case for the case for the sake of sacrificing other considerations or other situations is against the basic framework of criminal justice. You\'re abandoning your attempt to be proportionate and inclusive of a variety of situations that considerations are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was so clear and substantive from leaders of opposition. ', 122),
(1284, 65, 65, 66, 'But another even-edged case is that if criminal justice is so distorted by offenses or rapes or patriarchal judges of things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help because it\'s still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and sins going on there. And you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved. ', 122),
(1285, 66, 66, 67, 'They also said that victims are offended by the attempts to prove that they\'re not really guilty and that kind of victim sentiment is something that should matter. We don\'t think that is important because they have not responded to our leader of opposition to stand up for how victims\' emotions are not considered in criminal justice, which is a factual thing. But also importantly, that argument is invalid. If that argument is true, they\'re saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defense would also be discussing the victim and that the cause of insanity defense ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they have to do this kind of thing, maybe discussing the victim so they\'re willing to abolish that. But that\'s not how they made the principle of distinction. I don\'t think that\'s how, obviously, it should work. So while we think that argument, even if it\'s beneficial, does not justify taking this policy.', 122),
(1286, 67, 67, 68, 'So thank you. The last practical thing they said was that crimes increase, we want deterrence. We think, obviously, it\'s just that a 10-year sentence might become an 8-year sentence with the existence of this defense. You have the social sanctions and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it. I don\'t think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate. But also deterrence is just one part of the clause. So if deterrence is important in that specific case, we might increase the punishment. But that is not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent power clause that exists in the criminal justice system. So I don\'t know why abolishment makes sense. Sure. ', 122),
(1287, 68, 68, 69, '<POI>On to your POI, in your plan and compulsive crimes distinction, the interpretation of crime is willful on the side closer to planned murder, for example. We think the interpretation of crime is akin to willful negligence, if all others are true. ', 122),
(1288, 69, 69, 70, 'OK, let me deal with that. So, second question. Should the choice of you drinking matter that much? The principle argument coming a bit from Gov is that, you know, you\'re drunk, you are aware of it, so you should take the responsibility and just face it. That is not really important, because, firstly, I think they had no response to our argument from the leader of our position and the deputy talking about our culpabilities at the core of the criminal justice system, where to the extent that you are trying to impose sanctions on an individual and to the extent that we consider fairness as important, we need a reasonable accusation and grounds that these people are responsible for their acts to impose any punishment on these individuals and why assumption of innocence exists. Obviously, these individuals, because they were not necessarily themselves when they were drunk, they don\'t remember it, they usually wouldn\'t do that, which means that the extent that they take responsibility for their acts is decreased and to the extent that even if we agree to that, there\'s a different parallel reason to consider that they should be decreased of their punishment and why that doesn\'t really prove any validity in this debate. ', 122),
(1289, 70, 70, 71, 'But also importantly, they say that insanity is okay but drunk is bad. We think that\'s a bad argument. Because, essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally vulnerable and you can\'t think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational, or they\'re not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances. Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take the choice of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware of the risk that they might go kind of mentally unstable and do these acts and they\'re not willing to impose on these individuals and understand the distinction.', 122),
(1290, 71, 71, 72, 'And the last point about planned crime and composite crime, that\'s important because their argument is technically saying that you\'re drunk and you chose that, you should take the full responsibility, distinct from other people that are rational. Meaning that, if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the responsibility. Meaning that, if you opt into it and knew that you\'d opt into a framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that\'s technically saying that a well-planned crime, which you opt into fully, and a composite crime, which you\'re very compulsively opt in, have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that. And I think that doesn\'t matter and it doesn\'t make sense to think it\'s both.', 122),
(1291, 72, 72, 73, 'So, Chair, let\'s make this debate very simple, because there are many trivial disputes which are actually not the core of this debate. For example, sales forces can avoid drinking, they can quit, they can sue bosses for harassment. Actually, that\'s not important, even though that\'s a case coming from our side of the house. What we need to talk about here is that there are some differences of gravity of responsibility between these sales forces punching someone and clearly conscious people punching someone intentionally.', 123),

(1294, 75, 75, 76, 'So, the basic principle coming from their side of the house was that people made a decision to pass the gate that will be connected to crimes, and they are informed of the risk that their action will ultimately lead to some consequences. Okay, let\'s look at non-toxicated criminals. So, they chose to go outside consciously, they chose to buy a knife consciously, they chose to meet a person they hate consciously, they chose to stab someone, that person consciously, they chose not to call ambulances consciously, everything was conscious in that case.', 123),

They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but they chose to drink a lot, that will be a conscious choice of individuals.

(1296, 77, 77, 78, 'So, intoxicated criminals are still very bad people, that\'s also a murder, but they should be sentenced according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be, the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate.

(1297, 78, 78, 79, 'Then, let\'s go back to the bottom group of the outsider house. We are talking about we should maintain the intoxication defense in the outsider house. We are not saying people shouldn\'t be mitigated in every circumstance. What they have to prove is there should be no kind of intoxication defense, people should be sentenced equally in every circumstance, even though they have some tiny responsibility, compare them between individuals who are very conscious and people who are not conscious, even though they chose to be drunk.', 123),

They couldn\'t prove there is no any tiny difference between people who chose to drink and who didn\'t choose to kill someone, and people who are conscious about everything, there will be some differences. That\'s why that difference should be reflected in the sentences that should be given to individuals because that should be more equal treatment for individuals who are differentiating,  and that will be the most trustable system that we can rely on. For those reasons, I\'m very proud to oppose.', 123),
(1299, 80, 80, 81, 'Thank you, Chair. We believe that there are two main theories that lose their case in this debate. First mistake they have made is that the line they draw on intoxication defense is so blurred to an extent that it sounds almost contradictory. At the point in which, Mizogami-san said, when you\'re drunk, you don\'t remember anything, and you are basically a different person. Then why and on what ground you are punishing the person? Because if you think that being drunk is so big of a deal to the extent that you don\'t remember anything, then probably you should not punish this individual at all. But the important point is that you didn\'t provide the reason as to why you can punish and then draw the line as to why that\'s legitimate.', 124),
(1300, 81, 81, 82, 'The second mistake that they have made is that despite the fact that they keep claiming that there are some cases we should consider, they never really prove to us how that case is important to the extent that we should remain this framework. Because the trade-off that they give us is probably like taking Tamifu without guardian, and do you know the consequence of that? And the consequence is what, right? We don\'t see the impact, and you didn\'t really ground the impact as to why taking Tamifu and going out and do something, and your punishment is such a culpable thing, and we think that even if we give the trade-off thing, we think we are actually winning this debate.', 124),
(1301, 82, 82, 83, 'But moving on to my issue, which is about is intoxication defense legitimate based on three criteria, I\'ll talk to you about this in this class, right? But the first reason they have told us is that we should keep this framework itself because citizens\' trust is important, and we should be careful about treating individual rights, which is critically rebutted by Dr. Sun saying society now is becoming a hatred, having a hatred to a drinking culture, and this voice is not really heard under the jurisdiction system, and we think that point is dead, right?', 124),
(1302, 83, 83, 84, 'But secondly, more importantly, the criteria about the consequence of you being drunk, you are not really fully informed about the consequence of drinking, right? So that\'s the point I pointed out in the introduction, where if the result is unexpected, then why the hell you can actually punish this individual at all, right? We think when the point meets you, overgenerous, overly illustrated, the effect of the drinking problem, we think you lose the ground on why you can actually punish this individual.', 124),
(1303, 84, 84, 85, 'But thirdly, more importantly, the point where you are forced by the boss, and therefore you should be mitigated of this crime, right? Then we think it\'s not the point, anything that can influence you taking action should be a mitigating factor, right? Maybe you didn\'t choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early, and you didn\'t choose that, and you kill someone, and you should be mitigated, right? We think anything then should be a mitigating factor, and we think explicitly, we said drinking and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously, therefore you should not be granted the mitigations, right?

(1331, 27, 27, 28, 'And let\'s move on to the second point, which is harm to others. Of course, firstly, we don\'t know how to use them. We don\'t know, of course, it is uncertain that the terrorism, how the terrorism use their money to get from their ransom. ', 126),
(1332, 28, 28, 29, 'Moreover, they commit crime, they commit human crimes, as I say, kidnapping, because they need money, because of lack of money. Or if they have enough money, they don\'t do that. It\'s a risk, it\'s high risk to be arrested. It\'s high risk to be, it\'s organization. So we can say, we can assume that because they don\'t have much money, because they need money, they start good human crimes. After, if we paying ransom, enough ransom to those terrorism groups, totally, when we say totally, because the kidnappers, I mean terrorism, lose the motivation to have a risk. So totally, we can say these cases, inhuman cases will decrease. And that is why we put this point.', 126),
(1333, 29, 29, 30, 'Today\'s opposition side said that we must save the victims of kidnapping, but we want the idea that kidnapping itself will disappear. So in order to achieve this goal, we must take this motion. Only opposition side paradigm will not erase the kidnapping itself. ', 127),
(1334, 30, 30, 31, 'Firstly, let me speak to my previous speaker. Firstly, he said that we can surely save the victims of hostage if we pay the money. But it\'s not certainly because, for example, I guess IS people\'s kidnapping, when the kidnapping occurred, the movie was thought that even if we pay the money, the terrorists will not surely release the hostage because they are malicious people and do not always save the hostage.', 127),
(1335, 31, 31, 32, 'Secondly, he said that terrorist group will try to earn money with other ways like organ transplants and so on. But who will sell the organ? Even if someone sells the organ, the difference is that the money terrorists can earn at one time. We think the target of terrorist kidnap is mainly journalists and they demand money to nations because nations have much money and terrorists can get much money from the nation the most. So the kidnapping and demanding the money to nations is a very unique way for terrorists to earn money easily. ', 127),
(1336, 32, 32, 33, 'So let me move on to my arguments. There are two arguments. Firstly, let me reinforce my partner\'s argument about undertaking this planned program. And second, why we can justify this motion.', 127),
(1337, 33, 33, 34, 'Under the status quo, kidnapping of hostages will never disappear as my partner told you because kidnapping can get much money easily. For example, a bank robbery is very risky for terrorists because a bank is very high security and one person is not so secure. ', 127),
(1338, 34, 34, 35, 'But after taking this motion, kidnapping will disappear or at least will certainly decrease because nations will never give terrorists money and terrorists know even if we kidnap, we can\'t get money. Also, journalists who will go to those areas of terrorism, they will care more about their security. For example, they will hire bodyguards and they will be more careful. So the risk will be lower.', 127),
(1339, 35, 35, 36, 'Second problem, payment will kill more people. Money given to terrorists will be used to achieve the terrorist\'s goal by violent way. For example, as my partner told you, much money will allow terrorists to buy weapons, many latest strong weapons. So terrorists will kill drastically lots of people rather than just the kidnapping of one person. For example, sometimes quite a plane attacked the big building and one thousand or one million people died. ', 127),
(1340, 36, 36, 37, 'So if the terrorist group got the money, they will surely use this money to the crime because they are malicious people and they are willing to use violent way or crime to achieve their goal. So payment surely kills people. So paying money to terrorism means cooperating terrorism. Government cannot cooperate terrorism means crimes and killing people.', 127),
(1341, 37, 37, 38, 'They said that government needs a direct way to save people. But we see indirect murder is also murder. Government must not indirectly kill people. ', 127),
(1342, 38, 38, 39, 'Also, he did not explain about the complete way to save mass people. So please give me the complete way to save mass people. ', 127),
(1343, 39, 39, 40, 'How we can justify? For example, in case of disaster, many people are injured. We, or doctors, prioritize people who have higher possibility to be saved or higher possibility to be cured. They prioritize more people because they cannot save all people. They must prioritize more people because the more people will be saved, the more people will be happy. So it is the same to this notion. ', 127),
(1344, 40, 40, 41, 'Yes, we think that sometimes, even if the death case starts, some individual hostages will die. But if the number, let\'s compare the number of people\'s life. One individual or mass, one thousand or one million people, of course, we must prioritize the number of mass people. So therefore, we can justify.', 127),
(1345, 41, 41, 42, 'Their goal was to save, but potentially kill, the mass citizens. And their policy is to criminalize paying ransom to terrorist group.', 128),
(1346, 42, 42, 43, 'Okay, if you want to save a potentially killed mass citizens, then why not kill the terrorist groups themselves? I mean, destroy the organization itself. If we can\'t directly air bomb or directly attack, or have an economic restriction, then we can comparatively decrease the power of terrorist groups. ', 128),
(1347, 43, 43, 44, 'Then if those kinds of power would be decreased, then those terrorist groups could not kill those potentially killed mass citizens, then their goal is achieved. We believe that their policy is not in this goal. That\'s what I believe.', 128),
(1348, 44, 44, 45, 'So, before going to the argument, let me rebuttal first. Before we go to the rebuttals, I would like to analyze actors in this debate.', 128),
(1349, 45, 45, 46, 'There are two main actors we have to protect. First, it\'s the individual citizens who are being kidnapped. And second, those potentially killed mass citizens. Okay, let\'s go from the first actor. In their paradigm, in the United States, if the individual citizens were kidnapped by the terrorist group, they have only one way to save those citizens, that is, to ransom them. ', 128),
(1350, 46, 46, 47, 'And they told us that if we can actually cooperate with the government, they can achieve this. First of all, there is no case that we can achieve this. They said that we can actually cooperate, but in fact, those hostages were killed. So we believe that kind of government cooperation is unmeaning.', 128),
(1351, 47, 47, 48, 'Why is that meaningless? This is our second reason why we have rebuttals. Why is that impossible? Because the terrorist groups need money. If they need money, and then they have to exclude the government from the hostages, they will desperately kill those potential hostages from the government, and they have those incentives to have it, because they need money. ', 128),
(1352, 48, 48, 49, 'So that\'s why we believe that even if the government cooperates, it\'s impossible to save citizens just by other means than ransom. So we believe that ransom is the only way to save those kidnapped citizens. Then, if we can criminalize those citizens, then those citizens will surely be killed. So we believe that those individual citizens are important. ', 128),
(1353, 49, 49, 50, 'Why are those individual citizens important? Because they are inherent, and they will surely be killed if we don\'t pay ransom.', 128),
(1354, 50, 50, 51, 'Because the second factor is talking about the potentially killed mass citizens, we cannot understand the potentially killed mass citizens. And in fact, there are a lot of victims. We believe that this is not inherent. But in fact, those individual kidnapped citizens are inherent. Those people will surely be killed. That\'s why we believe that it\'s important.', 128),
(1355, 51, 51, 52, 'So, after taking this plan, we believe that after taking their policy, what will happen? They say that the case of kidnapping will decrease, but we think that is not true. Why is that? Because kidnapping is a rather easier way to save those money. If we kidnap those people, then we can use those people from using or selling those people themselves or use the foreign currency. And there are other ways of taking money other than ransom. ', 128),
(1356, 52, 52, 53, 'So that\'s why we believe that even though we criminalize the ransom, those citizens will still be kidnapped. So that\'s why we believe that even if we take this motion, those individual kidnapped citizens will not be rescued. ', 128),
(1357, 53, 53, 54, 'So, if we do not have any other way, then there is a way of ransom. And if we can pay ransom, we can actually help those citizens. That\'s why we believe to help individual citizens, we should not take this motion.', 128),
(1358, 54, 54, 55, 'Let\'s talk about the second factor, the potentially killed mass citizens. Their logic was that if terrorists can gain money, they will buy weapons, and then they will kill mass citizens. Okay, there are two logics. And I would like to go through those two. ', 128),
(1359, 55, 55, 56, 'First logic was that if they gain money, they will buy weapons. Okay, the terrorist group who purposed it is that they have to kill people. So even though the terrorist group do not have money, they have to have an air bombing, they have to kill. So they have to have their attack on the expense of the group member itself. ', 128),
(1360, 56, 56, 57, 'So if they gain money, what will they do is that they will actually use the money for themselves. For example, under the current situation, people in ISIS are poor. So what they do is that they do a raid or they rob something because they don\'t have money. But if they get money, then they can use this money for a living. And those inhumane crimes will actually decrease. In that case, those victims of that crime will actually decrease. Even those kind of zero-life manufacturers will be safe in that potential.', 128),
(1361, 57, 57, 58, 'Second, we believe that in the first place, if we stop ransom, those terrorists will not stop killing people. Why is that? Because their purpose is money and they have other ways to gain money by attacking people. So they will not stop that. But if we cannot destroy the terrorist group itself, those people will not be safe at all. So we believe that potentially killed massivists will be killed on their part in the first place.', 128),
(1362, 58, 58, 59, 'Okay, what happens after taking this plan? Because their action is that we destroy the terrorist group itself, and destroy the group themselves, we believe that if we directly attack and decrease the power of terrorist groups, then we don\'t have enough power to attack the people as a backlash. So we believe that those kind of potentially killed massive citizens will decrease in our part rather than their part. So that\'s why we believe that the criminalization of the ransom terrorist group is not relevant to the disposal of the terrorist group.', 128),
(1363, 59, 59, 60, 'So how about our argument itself? Because we believe that in the first, individuals in the territory can protect them by paying ransom, and this is clear because if you pay ransom, they will lose individuals, and we go back to our case.', 128),
(1364, 60, 60, 61, 'Well, I\'ve finished the analysis of two actors, so I would like to compare the two reports. Okay, so as I told you, individual kidnapped citizens are inherent, and if we don\'t pay ransom, they will be killed.', 128),
(1365, 61, 61, 62, 'On the other hand, potentially killed mass, we cannot expect how many people will be killed in the first place, and furthermore, we cannot even understand whether those citizens would be killed. So, I think, we don\'t think that amount is important. ', 128),
(1366, 62, 62, 63, 'We believe that if someone would be surely killed, and we think that not the potentially killed citizens, but rather the inherent individual kidnapped citizens, saving those people is more important than potentially killed citizens. That\'s why I believe that we have to save the individual citizens inherently, and we don\'t think that all of those will. If we pay ransom, we can surely save those people. We are happy to propose.', 128),
(1367, 63, 63, 64, 'Ladies and gentlemen, the important module used today is to save citizens. And we, both sides, agreed, both sides, the purpose was that. So let\'s compare the government side\'s view and our citizens\' side\'s view, first. And secondly, in which case citizens can save the citizens more and more and less and less.', 129),
(1368, 64, 64, 65, 'So firstly, let\'s look at the government case. The government case was that they should try to take this motion in order to protect mass citizens from terrorism. Citizens mentioned that terrorism demands money for kidnapping. So, for example, they kidnapped a journalist and they demand money from the nation. And they get much money by kidnapping. And if you pay, we call it terrorism, it should be justified. And terrorism is a strong offense. So that is a problem and potentially kill citizens.', 129),
(1369, 65, 65, 66, 'Of course, we can save the mass citizens under the status quo now by directly attacking, airbombing terrorists. That is a more effective and more direct plan. And so that is really superior to the indirect plan and far plan. ', 129),
(1370, 66, 66, 67, 'And secondly, we are consintantly saying that we don\'t neglect its citizens, we save the citizens. And it\'s also important to look at each one\'s citizens and save them by paying ransom in a certain way.', 129),

And also saying that the number of ransoms don\'t decrease. Unfortunately, moreover, when we look at it, it won\'t decrease. That is a problem. And so, of course, that is a problem. That\'s our view of this debate today.', 129),
(1372, 68, 68, 69, 'So let\'s first look at the citizens, in which case the citizens are more saved. And the government side, on the government side\'s base, basically the government side\'s view, that after taking this plan, unfortunate story, ladies and gentlemen, the number of ransoms will increase. Why? ', 129),
(1373, 69, 69, 70, 'They mention that they kidnap and demand money from nations and get much money. So when they kidnap, after taking this plan, the nations, of course, don\'t pay ransom to the terrorists. So what happens? Of course, they need money. ', 129),
(1374, 70, 70, 71, 'So that is the motivation for terrorism, that they throw organ transplants for profits. Of course, they can get money, but the money they get from organ transplantation for profit is less than they get from nations.', 129),
(1375, 71, 71, 72, 'So they need to kidnap more and more people to get certain money. So the case of ransom will surely increase after taking this motion, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen. ', 129),
(1376, 72, 72, 73, 'The story that the victims of kidnap will decrease after taking this motion and attacks on mass citizens will desrease is uncertain and far less direct plan and more uncertain plan.', 129),
(1377, 73, 73, 74, 'And compared to government side\'s view, the opposition side\'s view was that we surely save the citizens who were kidnapped, individuals, we can save them. And of course, we can protect and potentially kill more citizens more by directly bombing, directly killing the terrorists, which is more effective and more direct. ', 129),
(1378, 74, 74, 75, 'And because of these reasons, we can save more citizens by not taking this motion. And that\'s why we proposed it.', 129),
(1379, 75, 75, 76, 'So in this debate, I have no need to explain how important it is to save the nation because it\'s the competition. The issue of competition is that of saving the nation. How we achieve this goal is the issue of competition. So let me summarize today about this problem.', 130),
(1380, 76, 76, 77, 'Their point is that, one, the sacrifice to the payment. So the sacrifice to payment is the first point we\'ll come back to.

(1383, 79, 79, 80, 'The last point is that it\'s my point that it\'s just a cooperative effort until those votes. We can save the individual citizens at that time, but behind that hostage, we expect 100,000.', 130),

(1387, 83, 83, 84, 'On the other hand, our cases, the most important thing is that we can certainly beat terrorism itself. It\'s certainly real. We can solve the root cause of the issue, and they are just giving up the solution over time. We want to solve this motion from the root cause. ', 130),
(1388, 84, 84, 85, 'So first is that we can see no more expected hostages because we stopped paying them.', 130),

(1397, 6, 6, 7, 'First, let\'s look at why politicians have a right to private lives. Two reasons. First, is because we think that this is just a natural reaction of the rights we give. Because if you look at the status quo, politicians are given some certain extent of protection. For instance, they have the right to property, that is that we don\'t allow people to access their bank accounts or invade someone\'s house. Why?

(1399, 8, 8, 9, 'We think it is just in saying that these politicians should be able to live a life where they don\'t have to fear paparazzi escaping around, at the point in which we already give certain rights. We think this is just a natural extension, we see no problem. ', 131),
(1400, 9, 9, 10, 'But B, is because politicians never consented to this in the first place, right? Because we think the private lives are inherently elements of life that these politicians didn\'t give consent to, right? At the point in which we infringe consent, even at the bypass of one instance, we say this is a slippery slope, with at the moment in which the media can infringe upon the consent of an individual, we allow the media, for instance, barge into houses or looking at private documents of a policy, and we think this is never justified, and at the moment in which we should never cross the line of consent.

Because we think that other factors and other variables are included in private lives, who didn\'t consent to this in the equation.

Because we think the media should be news that just shows reliable information and not try to create some fake news in the first place. ', 131),

(1416, 25, 25, 26, 'First of all, we say that politicians can always sue media if they feel that media reported something so terrible, but we say that that decision should not be up to the government; whether media should report that information should be decided by courts, not the government itself because the government can always sue, like personal lives and exploit it to protect politicians who are committing corruptions. So we\'re not completely taking away private privacy rights.', 132),
(1417, 26, 26, 27, 'Second of all, we say that medias have no incentive to disclose personal information of people around politicians because what people are interested in is what politicians do or whether the politicians are morally good or not. So, point you can always like put A or B instead of reporting the real name of my politician\'s friends or family, or like they can always sue. Instead of reporting the real name of my politician\'s friends or family, or like they can always put some mosaics on the face of the families of politicians. ', 132),
(1418, 27, 27, 28, 'We\'re saying that those concerns of the government are not going to be real but even if we take the best case of the government\'s light and say that like media sensationalizes like sexual identity oppositions and like elections are going to be biased, we don\'t think like that\'s the reason to support this motion.  For example, already in elections, women are being discriminated, right? Because they put their names. They put their faces. And that\'s enough for people to know that they\'re women and they\'re being discriminated. We don\'t think this is a unique problem to this reporting personal rights.', 132),
(1419, 28, 28, 29, 'And moreover, we say if that one politician turned out to be LGBTQ like he might. He or she might lose the votes from non-LGBTQ supporters but he will gain votes from LGBTQ supporters and we don\'t think this is better for discourse.', 132),
(1420, 29, 29, 30, 'Moving on to the second argument, how it is good for democracy. So first of all, I\'ll start by capitalizing media. The first thing we say amongst the institutions that are able to disclose influence about politicians, for example, such as government itself or police, etc. Media is the most far from government, which means that media is least likely to be controlled by the government, like we can see that like court is already being controlled by government, and it is easy to say that all the other organizations are going to be controlled by the government.', 132),
(1421, 30, 30, 31, 'Second of all, what media point about politicians? Two things, first of all, they report whether they are moral. For example, they might report that the politician is committing DV to his wife or something. Then the people will know that those politicians are not eligible to talk about women\'s rights in parliament or like in the recent example, we can see that media reported that Mr. Kurokawa went out during quarantine and that can help people know that policymakers don\'t care about the role point they make.', 132),
(1422, 31, 31, 32, 'And second of all, they report connections between politicians. For example, like Mr. A and Miss B went out to a secret dinner party at like the western sea. This is something that is doubtful. Of course, politicians themselves will claim this is personal life and this is what the government side has said. But how like you don\'t know when like those personal dinner parties turn into political like corrupting meeting, right? So it is in so-called personal meetings that all the connections begin. So like after all, no one can plan a scheme in the official government building, right? So it\'s likely that politicians are exploiting world personal lives to actually do corruptions.', 132),
(1423, 32, 32, 33, 'So what is it is like in the opposition side\'s world? So first of all, people can know about politicians\' corruptions or morality and this is critical for like rational judging and voting because this is important because democracy is about receiving enough necessary information and voting. And we say that those morality of politicians is a critical information for that, because politicians are someone who represents people. ', 132),
(1424, 33, 33, 34, 'And if the politician force people some kind of moral obligation or law and but they themselves don\'t conform it, we can say that politicians are just enjoying privilege by being politicians. Meaning they\'re just receiving money and pretending to be helping people and people know that those politicians don\'t care about people they\'re responsible. they don\'t care about what people will suffer or like people will benefit from their policies. If so no one will want to vote for them, right?', 132),
(1425, 34, 34, 35, 'But in the government side as well because no one will disclose the information about morality or corruption people can\'t know about this and if the government\'s if this motion is taken the worst thing more worse things gonna happen because the government can always threaten media saying that hey, this is personal lives. Don\'t report this. So corruption is going to be more income under their world. So therefore we are proud to oppose.\n', 132),
(1426, 35, 35, 36, 'Let\'s be very clear about what this debate is about, because this debate is not about a politician who has raped tens of women, because those are crimes and those are likely to be already prosecuted by the state. We think that the sort of politicians that are likely to be the main context of this debate are the ones who have committed adultery, for instance, or who have hidden the fact that they are homosexual in an extremely conservative area where they have the danger of being beaten up in the street and being the subject to conversion therapy. Those are the people we are protecting in this debate, and those are the people that the opposition, at the start of this debate, have ignored.', 133),
(1427, 36, 36, 37, 'So, I\'m going to introduce our third substantive, which is how we increase the quality of political discussion inside the parliament, but before moving on, I have a number of responses to the side of the opposition.', 133),
(1428, 37, 37, 38, 'Firstly, the leader of the opposition says that this is justified because governments can, like on our side of the house, governments can redefine what the private life is, to effectively protect politicians who are corrupted. That\'s not the case, because this debate is not about state preventing media from doing something, because this is a value judgement debate, and this debate should be based on objectively whether or not media should do X, right? So this is clearly out of this debate.', 133),
(1429, 38, 38, 39, 'But then they say, oh, the corruption is going to happen on our side of the house. But the important thing we need to note here is that we don\'t need to infringe on the privacy of politicians, we don\'t need to know what they\'re doing, whether or not they are committing adultery, in order to check what the money for the governmental subsidy to a political party has been used, right? We think that those are the public lives, which the media can legitimately check on the side of the politician, right? So there\'s always a check and balance system that exists on our side of the house. So clearly, that is out of this debate.', 133),
(1430, 39, 39, 40, 'But then they say, in case of the infringement of privacy for families, we can always have mosaic. First of all, I think we have made this clear from the start of this debate, that media is likely to sensationalize at the point where it is actually beneficial to publish the very private lives of politicians, right? Because this is slippery slope, at the point where media is allowed to report whether or not some individual have committed adultery in the past is the point where they are likely to also publish the picture of them in the prom in high school, for instance. And then this extent goes on and goes on and goes on. So I think that eventually, in the long run, media will no longer have mosaic on your side of the house. But plus, you don\'t have a fear to say that the media is going to do this.', 133),
(1431, 40, 40, 41, 'Secondly, because the fact that people, for instance, in conservative, extremely conservative area, know that this politician is a homosexual, it\'s not just about that they\'re going to lose votes, but it\'s also the question of survival. That is to say that even in the liberal context of the United States, there are 160 cases reported of conversion therapy, which is extremely traumatic for the homosexual individual. ', 133),
(1432, 41, 41, 42, 'Now, the reason why those politicians hide their own identity in the first place is because they think it\'s worse for those individuals. So precisely, precisely by that logic, I think that the vast majority of context in this debate is a homosexual individual in conservative area, not in liberal area, because if those individuals are in liberal area, they would have presumably already come out of the closet as the leader of the opposition say that they can get more LGBT votes, right? So precisely for that logic, I think that it\'s false.', 133),
(1433, 42, 42, 43, 'But then they say, so again, on the weird and coward response that we got from the leader of the opposition about how LGBT candidates can get votes from LGBT individual. This is already responded by two response; conversion therapy plus in conservative area. ', 133),
(1434, 43, 43, 44, 'But then they say, oh, this is a critical information for democracy. But they have never explained to us why an immoral politician can\'t pass a law that criminalizes sexual harassment, if that\'s what people want, right? The ability for politician to fairly represent the view of individual, view of citizen is independent of whether or not they have committed adultery in the past, right? ', 133);

Local community, so for instance, in the United States, politicians approximately spend more than 60% of their working hours going to supporters house and going to community center and interact with the voters, right, in order to get the crucial voter in order to be re-elected in the next election.

(1437, 46, 46, 47, 'But finally, I want to add one thing to our argument about politics, right? One layer of mechanism as to why media is likely to use this tactic, so debunk the private lives of politicians, of opponents of politicians, actually. For instance, conservative media actively marginalizing liberal side of politicians in order to get the politics to be more conservative, right? ', 133),
(1438, 47, 47, 48, 'So why is this a powerful tool for media to effectively marginalize politicians? Because there\'s a confirmation bias. For example, when a media broadcasts a picture of a politician who advocates to support the poor, wearing the thousand dollar suit in their vacation, for instance, even if that picture was photoshopped, for instance, people are going to effectively and immediately tie that politician with the image of being greedy at the point where that image is planted in people\'s mind, subconscious mind, is a point where even if that politician says that it\'s not true, it\'s a photoshopped picture, it seems like a pathetic attempt for that politician because you are a bad guy from the eye of the public.

(1439, 48, 48, 49, 'So I think we can all be clear that there are perverse incentives for media organizations, actually, especially conservative media organizations, to actively disenfranchise the liberal side of politicians and vice versa.

', 133),
(1440, 49, 49, 50, 'So on to first, how it increases the quality of political discussion. I think we made it clear that the premise of this argument is that politicians\' ability and how good a politician is at their job is independent from their personal life and how they act in the private sphere. And with that in mind, I think that the competitiveness of the job of politician is likely to increase on our side of the house for two reasons.', 133),
(1441, 50, 50, 51, 'Firstly, it\'s because being a politician, there are already a lot of hurdles on being a politician. For instance, the responsibility that comes with it or potential backlash that you\'re likely to get. The fact that media actively debunks private lives of politicians means that there will be more disincentive for people not to become politicians. ', 133),
(1442, 51, 51, 52, 'Secondly, it increases the accessibility of people to become politicians because people who have committed something immoral, maybe, can\'t be a political candidate immediately in the first place. ', 133),
(1443, 52, 52, 53, 'So this increase in competitiveness means that we get politicians who better represent the will of the people. That means we get a far better form of democracy on our side of the house. For that reason, we want to protect the privacy of politicians. We want the politics to be better on our side of the house. Very proud to propose.', 133),
(1444, 53, 53, 54, 'We believe that the most important thing in politics is preventing collapse by raising the politician\'s consciousness, and media in itself have rights to report what is related to your public interest and is helpful for citizens to electing politicians.', 134),
(1445, 54, 54, 55, 'So before moving to my argument, I\'m going to refute to the government side. So what the government side said is that there is no legislation to report the politician\'s private life because there is no consent and also includes your family members, but this is not true because under the status quo, media itself does not report your really private life. What the media is doing is, like, because media is not reporting, like, his children go to some surgeon\'s school or something, or he is dating with someone, media is not reporting such kind of thing because this is not related to the citizen\'s interest.', 134),
(1446, 55, 55, 56, 'And what media report is a private thing but relating to the policy to some extent. So, for example, like, some politicians are appealing to certain authority or certain private company members, or like, he or she had a trip in disastrous situations or such kind of thing, but we think people have the right to know because we think that people have the right to know the beginning of corruption, and media have the right to report those kinds of things.', 134),
(1447, 56, 56, 57, 'Second part is that, like, homosexual politicians will be attacked by non-LGBTQ supporters, but we think media will not disclose this kind of really sexual thing because media have never disclosed such kind of thing, and also media will not discriminate those politicians because if media does discriminate because they are LGBTQ, there will be a lot of criticism by citizens, because many people see media and people, there are many people who support LGBTQ, and those people will really criticize those media, and then media lose credit.

(1450, 59, 59, 60, 'So first, we believe politicians should be the good role model, good, good acting model for citizens, because the politicians should, are elected by citizens, and politicians have to keep the rule, so the voting owns your private life, you make them more conscious about their behavior, also private life reflects your personality, so people are easily understood by citizens, or you\'ll easily understand their personality, their candidates, or like, their politics, politics personality, larger than government.

(1455, 64, 64, 65, ' And second of all, people can know about the faction in each party or know about advocation with certain people or private companies. It is significant because on this data pool, many politicians, some politicians giving money illegally, or prioritizing their friend\'s company, but this, without media, people can\'t, people can\'t know about them, and police will not search this kind of thing because what police do is some accident happens, or some people witness some accident, and then they\'re going to research.', 134),

(1460, 69, 69, 70, 'First, let\'s look at whether media has justification. And let me number out what opposition really talked about, but it realized in the first place that opposition never really gave a constructive argument, but most of their talk was basically built upon rebuttals to our constructive. So if we mitigate the rebuttals, we say at the moment in which they don\'t have any constructive impact to fall back on, we say that we should win this debate.', 135),
(1461, 70, 70, 71, 'A is that first the problem with what opposition first told us is the distinction between media and government, because there\'s somehow stance coming from leader of opposition was that, hey, that governments like governments should not be able to report on the private lives of politicians, but media can because media is more reliable than the government. This is an absurd argument to come up with because in terms of authority, governments is the ones that are passing policies that are giving laws that say that these politicians have a right to privacy. So the moment in which opposition is willing to concede that the government doesn\'t have authority to report on the private lives, and we say similarly, just in terms of authority, the media should similarly not be able to report on private lives.', 135),
(1462, 71, 71, 72, 'But B is that they refuted against our argument saying that these other individuals involved aren\'t really related because one, we have a mosaic, and two, that media has no incentive to do so. Realize that in the first place, they never refuted our main premise about politicians themselves not giving consent. Opposition needs to engage with this main crux because this was an argument that was a sub nuance of our main argument. They need to say why even if politicians didn\'t give consent to, why the media is justified in doing so.', 135),
(1463, 72, 72, 73, 'But let\'s take their best of consent to other individuals. Notice that you\'re only able to determine whether a politician is, quote, quote, coming from opposition is good or morally a good person, morally capable person, is through interpersonal relationships. That means that you need to know how they behave through their relationships with other people, how they treat other members of society. And in order to find that out, then inevitably you need to report on the private lives of other members that are in the sphere of the private lives of politicians. Given this, we think that these other individuals didn\'t give consent, and we think the media has no perverse incentive to only look at the politicians themselves.', 135),
(1464, 73, 73, 74, 'But B, notice that when they talk about mosaic, that\'s not really, that\'s a really weird stance to take by. Because if their stance was that, hey, the public and private lives is becoming very unclear, so we should be justified in like breaking that apart, then if they\'re okay with just simply going with mosaic, I don\'t really see why the media won\'t be justified in not reporting on mosaic or hiding up names. And I think, rather, if they\'re saying that security should be maintained to some certain extent, I don\'t know why it cannot go, why it cannot go to the extent where media should not report on the private lives of any instances. The moment in which you draw an unclear line is the moment in which opposition will still be.', 135),
(1465, 74, 74, 75, 'But lastly, most importantly, is that they said that, hey, this is okay in the case of preventing corruption. This argument is the most absurd but most important thing I want you to know in my speech. That is that I think it\'s extremely disrespectful to substitute minor cases and categorize all politicians as potentially being corrupt or someone that commits adultery. Because their logic was that, hey, that if no one is looking, then these politicians are going to be able to do whatever they want to do. Look, people won\'t commit domestic violence just because you have the capability of doing so. We say politicians in general are usually good people who care for society. That\'s literally the reason why they become politicians, because they want to create policies and make people happy. So it\'s important to note that opposition\'s label of all politicians are bad is bad.', 135),
(1466, 75, 75, 76, 'But secondly, this, what they\'re suggesting as a policy is analogous to, for instance, these people might be committing a crime, so let\'s invade their house and check.

What they are suggesting is in sake of a potential crime, then we should be able to infringe upon privacy, their consent. ', 135),

(1469, 78, 78, 79, 'But secondly, let\'s look at the effects on politics. The first thing that opposition suggested was that, hey, that if we expose the identity of politicians, then they might lose some like supporters from non-LGBT, but they\'ll gain support from LGBTQ members.

First is that I don\'t really see the need for politicians becoming role models in the first place, because politicians are not social influencers that determine what kind of people, like the best ideal person that a normal citizen wants to be. Because we think that the inherently job and the point of a politician is to create policies and laws that are good for society.

I think that\'s enough of these politicians to act. And I think that that again, is not a substitute for a constructive argument for opposition.', 135),
(1474, 83, 83, 84, 'And lastly, is the case about corruption. I think it is important to note that we already said in our model that corruption, domestic violence is irrelevant in this debate in the first place, because those are public issues related to criminal law.

First, the goevrnment side said that reporting private life of politivians is not justified, because this information is very private, and to judge this so difficult. But LO defined that the private lives are not like where they live or something. These pieces of information are uncomfortable for us.

We are not saying that politicians\' personal, like principles, personality is corrupt. We think that they are just in the environment that makes politicians\' failure invisible.', 137),

Of course, we are going to allow prisoners to vote if they are qualified to have the right to vote in the real society.

We think that\'s a fundamental principle upon which voting should be based on, and in the case of minors, we think that the reason why we don\'t allow them is that they can\'t uphold the responsibilities of being part of democratic system, but also that they can\'t make a rational judgment because they\'re still young and they haven\'t completed the proper system of education that the state mandated. That\'s why voting isn\'t the fundamental right like PM tried to bring to you.

In the case of moral high ground, and judging by the victim\'s self-reflection upon the fact that they\'re going to have murderers of their daughters voting on gun control, or how to use knives, we think that we cite as the moral high ground.', 140),

Prisoners know best why they committed a crime and what the psychological thinking was behind it. So let me take several cases. For example, the cases of robbing. When prisoners commit robbery, the reason is mostly a social or financial problem. So as we see these cases, prisoners are having a problem that the social structure is not fulfilling their needs.

The impact of this argument is that the government can\'t know even if prisoners\' investigations and psychological investigations are given.

We think that social harm is happening in this case because they\'re going to have fewer deterrents, less retribution, which means that these secondhand crime or other things are going to increase. And this means that something like crime cases or secondhand crime, juvenile crime, or some kind of specific of these kinds of crimes is going to increase. ', 142),
(1552, 49, 49, 50, 'So what is the harm? We say that the stigmatization is going to happen to these prisoners, and it\'s going to harm these prisoners. What is so? We say that no policies move 100% well. There are some failures. And now, for example, if you\'re young, you\'re going to say, because you\'re young, you do some kind of radical thing or like that. And actually, the stigmatization will happen in these cases.What kind of harm is going to happen? We say that the negative campaign is going to harm more to these prisoners. What is so? Because if you\'re going to be in the opposition party and you\'re going to criticize your government.', 142),
(1553, 50, 50, 51, 'We say that the scapegoat that you can use is the prisoners, right? Because the crime is going to increase. You say that, oh, because the government did some kind of these things. We say that there are going to be more and more crimes in the societies or like other things. And the media are going to say these things too. So actually this means that the students are going to be affected and radicalize these things. This is the same case of the Hispanic problem of America or like the refugee problem of EU or like other things. We say that alienized people are going to be affected and stigmatized in these cases. Moreover, because they have something wrong in the past, people have more possibility to be stigmatized. ', 142),
(1554, 51, 51, 52, 'What is the harm? Firstly, we say that there are going to be fewer retributions and rehabilitation because more companies or like other people think that they don\'t want to accept these people. We say that there are going to be less rehabilitation. ', 142),
(1555, 52, 52, 53, 'Secondly, we say that the division in society is going to happen. There are going to be more pressure to the societies by defamation or harassment. ', 142),
(1556, 53, 53, 54, 'Thirdly, we say that people are going to vote for this opposition radical party. And this means that politicians are going to take away more rights of the prisoners because they are going to be radicalized. This is actually why we are going to say these harms will happen. Thank you.', 142),
(1557, 54, 54, 55, 'The world we saw the government draw is a world like this. A world where the murderer of your son can be allowed to shout for gun control, where the rapist of your daughter can vote for abortion, or even someone who stole money from you, which was supposed to be used to treat your mom\'s cancer, is going to get away scot-free because, according to a member of government, it was a failure of the state. I think as opposition, it\'s pretty abhorrent to say that people who have broken the law, or potentially even taken lives, or taken someone else\'s property, and I think it is morally abhorrent to say these kinds of people are knowledgeable and rational, so we can provide them the right to vote, right?I think the moment they decided to not take the side and take the side of victims, we think that we win this debate.', 143),
(1558, 55, 55, 56, 'I\'m going to examine two issues in this speech, and I\'m going to examine the failures of government.First, let\'s look at the principles, because I think it\'s pretty clear that they already dropped the point about voting, but I\'m going to talk about it. I think the government failed in engaging any points about how prisoners shouldn\'t be allowed to vote, especially for the things that sent them to jail, right? We think it\'s pretty weird for them to put prisoners into jails and say, but you can still try to convince us to not do so. We think that\'s a pretty weak stance for the government to take.', 143),
(1559, 56, 56, 57, 'The only response and engagement we heard throughout this whole debate was that, in the vast majority of instances, people are so poor so they can go to jail, so you can vote. Look, I think that this is extremely disrespectful for all the rational and hardworking people who don\'t cross the line of the inhumane act of taking someone else\'s stuff. ', 143),
(1560, 57, 57, 58, 'And even if we take their best-case scenario that these prisoners, like these people who were coerced into committing crimes should vote, then we think they could vote after jail because that\'s the moment their citizenship is returned and that the state makes sure that they have been properly rehabilitated and they have been able to successfully reintegrate into society.', 143),
(1561, 58, 58, 59, 'On a principle level, it is extremely bad and extremely abhorrent and extremely disrespectful for the government to say that prisoners are really capable actors. I don\'t know why they decided to side on the side of murderers, but I\'m going to go with the stance the government brought to you. Given this, I think that voting is clearly a privilege, that all the people who have contributed to the well-being of society, in the terms of perhaps taxation, who don\'t make the inhumane judgment of breaking the law or taking someone else\'s life, those are the people that voting should only be granted to. On a principle level, this is already unjustified, so we say we win this debate.', 143),
(1562, 59, 59, 60, 'But I\'m going to examine this debate further and look at the pragmatics, right?Again, the government side was absolutely unable to engage in our point about how there\'s going to be bribery in private prisons because there\'s no regulation by the government. We told you the politicians are going to cater to the needs of these criminals, and the fact that they didn\'t engage any at all and hasn\'t refuted any of our points is a concession that society is going to be detrimental in the fact that there\'s going to be policies that cater to these pretty radical ideas of potentially no abortion, for instance. We think this is inhumane for the government to try to defend.', 143),
(1563, 60, 60, 61, 'But let\'s take the best-case scenario, that was the whole rhetoric about how you need to find a middle ground, and we have to prioritize prisoners. Again, I\'m not sure why they\'re siding with thieves and burglars and murderers and rapists, but let\'s say that you want to find a middle ground. We think that the way to find a middle ground is not for prisoners to vote on certain policies; it is to literally have a one-on-one talk with them during rehab sessions. So even under the best-best-best-case scenario, it\'s still possible on our side.', 143),
(1564, 61, 61, 62, 'There was no engagement coming whatsoever from my second speaker talking about how there\'s going to be stigmatization, there\'s bad policies. Even if we take the best-case scenario where we prioritize prisoners\' needs, we think that that side is achievable on our side. Don\'t side with murderers.', 143),
(1565, 62, 62, 63, 'Speaker, have you ever heard such a double standard stance coming from the opposition? Although so many freedoms are actually allowed even in the opposition paradigm, under a third title of respecting the fundamental human right, such a right to voice out your opinion by publishing books, such a right to marry in the prisons, such a right to know about society by watching news, by reading a book, right? ', 144),
(1566, 63, 63, 64, 'But why only the right to represent your political opinion should be terminated, should be infringed? I\'ve never heard this exclusive reason from the opposition side. That\'s why under the title of respecting one of the important rights, we should in exactly the same way as other rights, we should allow prisoners to vote. Two conclusions here. First of all, whether or not prisoners are allowed in terms of a justification issue. Second of all, which can create a better society.', 144),
(1567, 64, 64, 65, 'Moving on to the first samples about the justification issue. So I\'ve heard probably some of the reasons why it is not justifiable to give the right to vote for prisoners. So in terms of rationality, right? So they say prisoners are not rational enough because they want to break the law. We should not give the right to vote or something like this. So here are some rebuttals.', 144),
(1568, 65, 65, 66, 'Number one, prisoners actually, my great partner already told you, they already graduated compulsory education here. That\'s why they already know the fundamental rules of society. We should grant them as they are rational, right? We should recognize them as rational, right? So this is the unconditional right to voting system to very much begin with. That\'s why. ', 144),
(1569, 66, 66, 67, 'And they say that, what about children? So the difference between children is that who don\'t really have the right to vote is that, so of course, children have not passed the compulsory education period yet, but those prisoners actually passed the compulsory education period. That\'s why they should be unconditionally know the fundamental rules. That\'s what we should recognize them as rational beings.', 144),
(1570, 67, 67, 68, 'And even if somehow that those people are not rational enough because they are not educated well, that\'s governmental failure to educate people to implant an appropriate amount of common sense and regulation rule, this kind of academic structure to begin with, right? That\'s governmental failure to bear the burden. It\'s unjustifiable to push the entire burden on prisoners to deprive the right to vote to begin with.', 144),
(1571, 68, 68, 69, 'And second of all, second rebuttal is that, so in terms of rationality, so it is the fact they want to break the law in the past, but it doesn\'t mean that they are not reflected that past action, right? They have potentially to fully reflect their past action and they have motivation. They have the ability to bring up reflected will to society, right? They at least should consider this kind of other scenario as well.', 144),
(1572, 69, 69, 70, 'And last of all, so this is the most important argument. So even if somehow they\'re not rational and rational, this argument doesn\'t matter. Why is that so? Because it is justifiable, it is not justifiable to ask rationality for acquisition of voting right to begin with, right? ', 144),
(1573, 70, 70, 71, 'Think about it. For example, in terms of economic policy, who is actually better people who can assess about the economics, future economics? Is it because it\'s probably the people who already graduated at university and who are educated well, right? But we unconditionally grant the right to vote for every single citizen regardless of the academic background and so forth. That\'s why the consequential result does not necessarily matter and rationality is not always, of course, matter to begin with, right? That\'s why fundamentally they should have the right to vote.', 144);
