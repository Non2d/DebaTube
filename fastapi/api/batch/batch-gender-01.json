What we support as a proposition is a healthy mixture of decent female leaders as also male leaders. We think that we want to pursue and promote the idea of females being capable of being a leader as much as males, and we think that this is a brilliant idea in reducing discrimination. Secondly, is that we think this is going to be an effective motion in dealing with gender injustices given that we cannot prove even if we cannot prove that there's going to be certain changes in the real life we think that our side um this debate should be measured on the equity that is the principle of whether we should um like pursue relative equality in the terms of including female characters. Given this, I'm going to give you two arguments. First, why this is a necessary motion for the state to take. Secondly, on our side, why this is going to be the most effective motion in dealing with gender injustices."

              "text": "Let's talk about why this is a necessary motion. Two things. Two things, sorry. First is that we think that the concept of leaders are not something that is dependent on gender. Just like in the real life, how there are many female leaders as well as male leaders, we think that even in the Marvel or any kind of film industry, we think that leaders are like female characters are also capable of being leaders. We think there needs to be a strong image, especially in the media, where everyone is directly influenced by every single day, that there needs to be a strong message that women are also capable, that the fact that they are being leaders and being in control of certain groups does not necessarily mean that um uh we think that if they are being able to be a strong leader in a field we think that is able to promote a bigger message in real life and promoting gender justice and i'll be talking about this later but secondly so we think this is just for the state to take because we think that these kind of medias are going to be like the manifestation of a state's standards. So what I mean by this is that we think that when media influence is very strong, we think that there's a strong and moral obligation for the state to ensure moral equality. And we think this is seen in the cases of a lot of movies where there are certain like female heroes such as Wonder Woman or any those kind of instances and we think that the state should actively promote any kind of gender equality and we think this side is just in including female characters but a simple fact that there are female characters that are excluded from being leaders just on the basis of their gender given this we think this is a necessary motion given the benefits there's going to be female actors and we think this is a necessary motion given the benefits there's going to be female actors. And we think this is completely on my second argument. I'll be talking about this. Point. Taken. What do you think about the difference between the hero program given in man or the, like, particular, like, hero program? What is the difference? Sure sure i'll talk about that later when i give my characterization so i recommend you wait for a couple of minutes um so second argument why this is the effect why this is the most effective motion dealing with gender injustices what the wait what we think um before i begin my substantive i'm going to be explaining"

              "text": "First, is that we think that females are almost never a central character. That is, that women do not currently have basically any kind of female role model to look forward to. We think that sure, there might be some central characters, but the problem is that we think we need more female characters in the pursuit of leadership because we think that these few examples are likely to be sexualized just because of the fact that like producers have to choose always the most sexiest and hottest woman we think that tends to get sexualized we don't think that the sexualization of women leaders is necessarily a good thing we think that on our side when we include more female actors and make sure there are more central characters, we think that you don't really need to rely on this facial benefit, and you could rather pursue the true message of the movie, that is, to pursue females as a leader. But secondly, we think there's a lot of maternal and romantic links. That is that in movies like The Independence Day, there's a lot of women who end up falling in love with the main character, the very hot white guy, right? And we think that this promotes a message of woman being told to be independent We don't think that's necessarily a good thing. But see is that female characters currently have to be rescued This is seen in a lot of princess movies where women are taught and promoting the message that they have That they have to currently be dependent on the main buff hero. And we think this emphasizes the masculinity of males, and we think this isn't necessarily a good thing. So how does this change under our world? Two things. First is that these leaders are going to become a central figure, right? I think that's going to mean you're going to have closer proximity to males and females. And we think that female leaders are capable, similar to male leaders. But B is that these female characters as a leader are going to have more power. We think this is going to promote the message that women are also capable of resolving conflicts, that they are also capable of negotiating certain conflicts to negotiate this in a peaceful manner. Now, to answer the POI of opposition, that is the difference between male leaders and female leaders, we say there is no difference. That is, the females are also as enough capable as males, and we think this is a necessary policy because currently there's a status quo which stigmatizes against female characters as leaders. This is because of the unconceived notion that like just the patriarchal society deems females as more incapable than males. And we think this isn't untrue, right? We think that female characters are also capable. So we see that there's no difference at all, that they are both capable, and we think we should remove that kind of stigmatization. So what happens once we have these kind of powerful central figure characters is that children who are easily influenced by the media just by the fact that they don't have any kind of like preconceived ideas are going to now look at this and we think that female children are now going to have a more active and positive role model of a leader.

If you look at classic hero programs like Marmo movies, Amphamon, and Perikia, it is pretty clear that the characters are using violence in order to solve their problems. However, removing an insane amount of these programs is not realistic because they are some of the biggest industries in the world. This is why instead of including female characters and hero programs, we should keep supporting feminism like we have in the past. Now I'd like to move on to my rebuttals."

And they also, the government also said that women are, not including female character and hero programs can be seen as a message that women are incapable of resolving conflict. But that doesn't't necessarily this motion doesn't necessarily lead to like telling people that women are capable of being independent and resolving conflict and to summarize, women can be seen as, because of the norm that we have right now, this motion can lead to women being portrayed as unsuccessful characters and that children might receive the wrong message and such as they might feel reluctant to become leaders, which is the opposite of the message we're trying to to send out. And supporting hero programs is not something the government should do because in a way it's supporting violence. Thank you."

First of all, about children, as the first speaker has said, they have good effects for children because children always watch hero programs and it will affect to people. Because for example, Kamehameha Day, children watch every Sunday morning, right? And children watch for long term. So I consistently feel that it is general that female will become a leader, right?

Firstly, let me make a rebuttal of what the previous speaker was talking about. So the government's main case was like the myth of solving the discrimination of those people by having a leader, right? But as my first speaker was talking about, my first speaker clearly talked about that these data quo are providing female character in, for example, Marble. Moreover, my first speaker talked about that those female romantic loves won't be sold by those leaders for providing leaders. The reason was a thing that solved by those leaders, for providing leaders, right? The reason was, I think that romantic things are not just because of not having leaders, but this is because of a general narrative, right? Even though, if we take this situation, those romantic scenes won't be like taken right those romantic scenes will be like remaining and we believe this motion is inappropriate right and moreover what they talked about was that they said that that like children are like will change their images, and it will influence better to the society. But our side will completely talk about that this certain image will make females counterproductive, and we believe this is unjustifiable, right? So moving on to my argument,"

So every people have an experience for having dreams that they want to be a hero, and seeing those hero programs, right? And second, it will make a strong message in today's society. But today's debate is like a thing we have to talk about that there's like two messages right there's two messages one it's for like boys messages and two there's a messages for like girls right so mainly like the girl side just talk about messages of girls and boys, but we believe those kind of hero programs are not just particularly for boys and particularly for those girls. We believe there's a lot of hero programs such as Pretty Cura, most of the time those kind of girls are going to be the leader. What we want to say is that if we see hero programs, it's mainly for action for those boys. Boys mainly see hero programs and they'll be attracted. Pretty Cuba is for girls, so that's why leaders are given. So what we want to say is that as if we make female characters as a leader in hero programs, it will hinder boys' dreams, it will hinder boys' narratives, and we can crush those those kind of female uh we can like crush like those kind of children's dream right so like those messages are really strong and as we make female leaders what will happen is that as my first speaker said those kind of female will be like in a like unsuccessful situation or they'll be like in a situation that they'll be like criticized by like those society right so as a conclusion for my first argument when like those kind of female leaders are included they'll be in a bad circumstances and moreover like we believe that those particular differences between like those boys hero program and girls hero program we believe we can't like include like certain gender and push certain gender and as an extent like those kind of gender problem is like"

But opposition side are respecting each character and respecting the dreams of those children, right?

It's an adult problem we have to talk about, and it's not like children to be solving, right?

So the question is whether we don't think that they are fitting the motions or KSP and Hub set on this debate. So basically, we are not going to prohibit those kinds of movies. Like, you know, it's balanced. If you want to see the Kamen Rider, who the main character is the leader, then you can watch.

Already it can be clearly clarified that there is no connection. Just because you are a woman, you are incapable of taking a leadership. So there is no scientific proof or evidence on this matter. So we believe that this artificial and orbital structure is so problematic. So we believe that this kind of the norm or stigmatization makes the woman weaker and weaker and those girls internalize the ideas, I cannot do anything or I am incapable, I am useless, so I just support the someone. So this kind of the thinking is so harmful. So regardless of the fact they have an ability, they can do that, but they cannot do that because society expects the women to not do so. So this is harmful. So as a result, what will happen is that those kinds of stigmatization will become becomes less, and those women still can become as a socialization more equally than fairies.

But even though we take their best case scenario we think that when you try to become adult you gradually realize the male dominant societies and will and will still be brainwashed by the society right because even now even in america if you see like the female ghostbusters because the society is still being the kind of like male dominant society nothing's going to change rather these children are going to be stigmatized again stigmatized as oh women cannot move even at it and their in their cases and you think that oh the people who are saying that the women who are saying that they want to be a leader is just imaginary people, right? Even these people want to say that they want to do it. This is impossible in this body. And you say that if you found some kind of female leaders, you're going to criticize them.

The yellow and the pink person sometimes help like the blue person or the red person or like that kind of things too. And we think that these things, it's very justifiable that these women are actually independent in the first place. But secondly, we say that this is not a social pressure too. Even we say that some, for example, we have some counter examples. for example, Wonder Woman. In these cases, a person is actually going to fall in love with a female leader or like other things, too. So even we say that these kind of things is a social pressure, we don't think that these things are going to change the society, their paradigm, right? We don't think that these things is very effective for it. Okay, and moreover, okay, and surely, they always say that these kind of like, they have the ability, so why don't you include these kind of like female characters in hero programs? Alright, I know that maybe in some cases, you include these kind of like female characters in hero programs? All right. I know that maybe in some cases you have a decent like female people who actually have these kind of like powers. However, we don't think that because you have a power, if you become a leader, not like all things are going to change, but rather we say these people are going to be exploited. What we want to say is that we don't want to make a Jyanudaraku in the society. Don't think that only including females in the hero programs as leaders can change the whole society. Even Ghostbusters and other shows included female leaders, male leaders are still dominant. And since it's still a male-dominant society, even females try to develop in the society, you're going to be exploited as John Nidarugo, who was made as a leader and tried her best, but betrayed and cut off from the other males, just as Japanese scientist, Obokata Haruko. Male exploit the female dreams. And after we see that we don't want to think that we should like produce these, male and like female fatalities in these societies. So we think that it's very harmful. And if you're going to make these kind of like social norms, that females can advance in society, we actually oppose to these things because we say that the females are going to be exploited.

Because we say that boys' dreams, if you're going to show some kind of female leader or other things, some boys are going to think, oh, my dream is going to be like deprived right if you think that the females are going to be in there the boys will have you will discourage their dreams to become a leader we say that this is going to happen in their paradigm and we say that because of this the boys are going to be strengthened the body however what is going to happen to these like females if you're going to have some... Even if you don't have these female characters as a hero, you will still think that these females are still going to develop in the studies if they really want to do it right. For example, if some people... If some kind of person, like, for example, Avengers or other things, if you're going to say that these people are actually having some kind of member of the FEMO, you still know that these FEMOs have the power and have enough ability to be independent, to be or, like, fight as one of the people, as a hero member, or like that.

Secondly, we support regulations that make unions work in the interests of their workers, like those in place in many countries in the status quo.

              "text": "I'll bring you two points in substantive in my speech. Firstly, why our model is required to ensure equal democratic representation, and secondly, why our model is necessary to secure workers' rights. On to the first. Compulsory labour unions are required to ensure equal democratic representation. Democracies are premised on having an equal say in setting the terms of our collective governments. That is a principle that motivates the foundation of one person, one vote. But voting is not the only way that you have your voice heard. An important way to get a voice in the shaking of our government is through civil affiliations. For instance, when owners of corporations pay lobbyists to help them pass certain forms of legislation. Yet, in this status quo, the owners of the means of production have a disproportionately large voice in influencing politics in their civil affiliations. For every $1 spent by unions on lobbying, corporations spend $34. Workers are shackled to the businesses in their immediate area for sustenance with no ability to push against them on an individual level. The corporate fat cat votes once at the polls, twice in donation, and three times in money. By contrast, the labourer votes once every four years in a situation where the power of their vote is going down at a worrying rate. This imbalance in power is reason in and of itself to enact our model of union membership being compulsory, even if it means taking a slight hit on GDP. Why is that? Firstly, because compulsory union membership, by its nature, provides precisely the form of political representation that the status quo deprives workers of. Firstly, it enhances the ability for workers to access political donation. Unions already spend upwards of $110 million on US presidential elections. Secondly, in terms of political advocacy, when large groups of workers are unionised, they're more able to hold the left to account by injecting ideas into discourse which are politically inconvenient. For instance, the Service Employees International Union got discussion on stagnating wages, which hugely empowered their fight to increase the minimum wage to $15. Finally, we tell you in terms of political representation, unions are an incredibly effective channel to connect the minimum wage to $15. Finally, we tell you in terms of political representation, unions are an incredibly effective channel to connect the working class worker to political networks while otherwise they would be locked out. For instance, Ian Lavery probably wouldn't have gone from mining apprentice to chair of the UK Labour Party if it weren't for his access to unions. We represent the worker when for far too long they've been silenced by corporate political hegemony. Secondly, we say our model protects workers' inability to consent to going alone. Why is that? Firstly, because workers don't fully understand or know the likelihood by which they could have extortionate conditions imposed on them or be unfairly dismissed, meaning that unions would be required to defend them. Secondly, even if they knew all the risks of going alone, workers are biased towards being optimistic, that no one thinks they'll specifically be the one to be fired in a recession. And finally, under the status quo, workers are actually coerced away from being in a union, that they can be afraid that they will be discriminated against by employers on the basis of their union membership. That is not real consent. The final claim we make on this principle is that the principle of workers' free riding is abhorrent. Non-unionised workers benefit from the sacrifice of other workers, for instance to establish and protect the minimum wage. But in no way do they contribute to those fights. They don't pay dues, they don't vote, they don't take part in collective action. They steal the fruits of the labour of the union, not happy to support them. Regardless of the economic impact of our principal panel, regardless of any harm opposition pushes, the principle of democratic representation stands above it all. Because like in the status quo, the fact that one-to-one voting may not be the most efficient is not reason to abolish it. We stand by our principles. I'll take you in a second, moving on to the second piece of substantive, which is why compulsory union membership is necessary to secure workers' rights. Why should a Muslim farmer in India be forced to join a union which donates to Hindu ethno-nationalist parties? Well, the thing is, we're not supporting them doing precisely those things, right? We supported democratic representation, we supported a number of unions. In no way would that ever happen. Okay, back to the substandard. First, note the choice this opposition must offend. It's not between compulsory union membership and, well, some unions. It's between compulsory unions and none at all. Because the trend is, without compulsory membership, they are dying. Since the 1950s, there's been a 24% decline in membership, and in the private sector, that number is already below 10. And note, this is an exponential trend, which is to say that when members leave, fees go up, the risk goes up, but bargaining power goes down, meaning remaining members are even less likely to stay. The second claim we make is that unions are essential to protect workers' rights. Firstly, that's through collective bargaining safeguarding those rights. Unionised workers earn 5-10% more on average in wages, they are 28% more likely to have healthcare, and 56% more likely to have a pension. An individual cannot campaign for those things by themselves. They risk being sacked, they risk being fired. But on our side of the house, when we collectivise the entire workforce and they bargain as a block, they eliminate those risks, they safeguard their fundamental rights. Secondly, we say unions are important because they provide crucial services to the worker they otherwise wouldn't be able to access. For instance, a poor worker being able to get a lawyer in an unfair dismissal trial, or them as a group being able to police equal protection. The final claim we make is that unions are so much stronger under Weiss out of the House. That's because scale allows unions to fight more effectively. It means larger strikes and better collective bargaining, but also economies of scale in things like healthcare and insurance, which can be easily bulk-billed. Without a revitalisation of our democracy, by balancing the corporate fat cap with the worker, we jeopardise the legitimacy of our government as a whole. That is something PSY proposition was not happy to stand by, proud to propose."

We would like to know why Australia thinks that these millions of workers are all making the wrong decision, and why the government has the right to make that decision for them. They have two burdens in this round. The first is to prove that their policy benefits all unionized workers and the economy as a whole, but second, they have to prove these benefits are so overwhelmingly important as to justify a massive rights violation inherent on their side of the house.

That said, we tolerate voluntary union membership because we recognize the importance of freedom of association, something their side flouts. But make no mistake, we're not accepting the status quo as it stands. We support alternative means of effecting labor policy, namely three things. First, we think labor law should be created through recommendations by independent commissions of economists, elected officials, and representatives from labor and industry, things like India's National Commission on Labor. Second, we would prosecute multinational corporations for flouting labor standards they adhere to at home when operating in the global south. But finally, we support other means of aligning employer-employee incentives, namely supporting things like favorable tax policy for firms co-owned by their workers. All of these are more appropriate means to achieve the end the proposition aspires to."

              "text": "Now let's rebut their case. Their first argument was on this principle, and they had two things about decreasing the coercion of lobbying and this free-riding principle. So, first on lobbying. First of all, we would just like to point out that the way they promote democracy is to strip people of their right to freely associate. That seems a little bit contradictory. But on the point of lobbying, we have two responses. First, we think that their policy actually distorts the balance of power even further. The left has limited political capital, and by giving overwhelming voices to the employed through unionization, you strip the unemployed of their rights even further. And second, we think that often unions lobby for harmful and protectionist policies, things like anti-immigrant and minority legislation, that harm people even further. Now on this larger principle of free riding. So we have three responses here as well. First, they fail to give us any kind of special justification for why we need this policy, given the massive scale of coercion it entails. Second, it's entirely contingent on the idea that union membership actually benefits workers, and unions are a legitimate cause to contribute to. They have to win the practical to win the principle. But even if you don't buy any of this, they actually undermine their very principle of democracy because unions are fundamentally political actors. In order to achieve this principle of collective responsibility, you have to violate freedom of association, a baseline right for democracy. That's an overriding principle. Now let's talk about their practical argument about protecting workers' rights. Their mechanism for this is strengthening unions. We have four responses. First, unions are ill-suited to advocate for workers in an increasingly globalized economy where firm and nation-specific advocacy is just not adequate. But second, they're structurally unrepresentative because they trapped tenure over the democratic will of the people. Third, we actually make unions worse on their side of the house because they have built-in monopolies on membership, meaning that they have no incentive to approve to draw more members. But take them at their highest ground. Unions accomplish everything they set out to do. Those benefits come at a massive cost that's devastating both to the workers they're trying to protect and to the economy as a whole. We'll explain more on how this is true later, but the harms that accrue from the benefits they claim just dwarf any advantages on their side."

Why do we care about freedom of association? We think that for democracies to be legitimate, people have to freely associate to self-determine, spread ideas, and build coalitions. They violate it in three ways. First, for freedom of association to be meaningful, it has to include your freedom not to associate with certain groups. Second, they're forcing people to contribute 2-5% of their income to these unions. But third, compelling union membership is essentially forcing people to associate with the political groups that they fund. The Labour Party in the United Kingdom, I'll take you in a moment, received 90% of its funding in 2016 from one union. Those groups are inextricably tied. Just as we would never force a Muslim farmer in India to join the BKS union, which is closely tied to the right-wing nationalist Hindu BJP party, we would not force someone to support abortion. That is just fundamentally abhorrent. Many workers feel unable to join a union out of fear that they will be discriminated against by their employers. How do you correct this coercion? Look, we acknowledge that this is a problem, but we think that on your side, coercion is actually much, much worse, because instead of societal suggestions, it's an explicit mandate that you join these unions. The coercion is just inevitably worse."

              "text": "But now on to our second argument about extensive union membership creating economically devastating effects. Remember that this takes their entire practical case on its very highest ground. Unions achieve every single one of their goals. That creates three massive harms. The first one is decreasing labor mobility, and this affects the very stakeholders they think they're winning in today's debate. Unions are tied to one industry, one country, and often one employer, and lose size and influence if labor is too mobile. So they undermine it in three ways. One, they entrench dying industries. Consider unions' contribution to the chokehold that the dying U.S. coal industry has on regions of that country. Second, they make it really difficult to fire people. Teachers unions in the global south, for example, make it so that in places like Brazil, teachers can be fired, are essentially untouchable, and routinely don't show up to work. But finally, they create wage distortion. In the short term, they do increase wages in unionized industries, making them relatively more attractive than non-unionized industries. Even though those industries might be more productive and going towards them might be more sustainable for workers in the long term. What we do through all of these three things is we increase the risk for and consequences of industry-wide unemployment, meaning swaths of people lose their livelihoods, like they did in the English coal industry in the 1980s. Our second layer under this argument is increasing unemployment. What do unions do? They increase wages by threatening strikes and preventing new hires, and they decrease competition by monopolizing the provision of labor and making it hard to hire skilled unemployed workers over less skilled employed workers. This leads to things like in the United States, states with 20% higher union membership have had 16% higher unemployment over the last 30 years. Why is unemployment so much more relatively harmful than low wages? First, the unemployed are the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Second, they're much less likely to get retrained after they lose their job. But finally, there's immense societal stigma surrounding unemployment, meaning that in areas with high unemployment, there are immensely high rates of depression and alcoholism. That's why we are so in opposition to their policy. But our final layer under this argument is on how they decrease overall national productivity. Through a couple of mechanisms. First, they make it impossible for small businesses to enter industries and innovate. This is because labor costs become prohibitively expensive, and because you decrease competition, you decrease the incentive for entrenched industry giants to actually pursue innovation and productivity but beyond that they actually increase cyclical strikes on their side of the house consider the 2014 platinum mining"

Let that sink in, panel, because this side of the house was the very side that wanted the big businesses to represent those people. Pushed for legislation that actively harmed them. They wanted to hide behind the veneer about democratic rights. Say that this was a political organ and therefore in and of itself was democratic unrepresentative.

That was extremely important and something this opposition has to stand behind. But secondly, let's be very, very comparative. Under their side of the house, the people that they wanted to champion, the Muslim voter, aren't heard at all. That is something that this opposition has to live with. We do not have to prove any practical argumentation like this opposition want to seem to burden for us. We just have to show that the current system, whereby the voice of the most disenfranchised was more likely to be heard under our side of the house, so a cookie-cutter argument on the stripping of the rights of workers did not stand. Even if we say the right to affiliation was something that extended to workers, that only extended to the extent that you could express that right to affiliation, we think we did that when people were able to choose things like the union they were part of.

This opposition says that unions are awful for a couple of reasons. First, because they have things like tenure involved and you have corrupt figures at the top and that's really bad. This opposition needs to start engaging with the reality of unions we get. Because tenure only happens to the extent where workers are reluctant to join unions in the first place. When they have the ability to influence those unions directly, that is how you get through to things like corruption in tenure. The next push of this opposition was to say that globalisation is happening, and beyond saying the word globalisation, they didn't really give much analysis there. We tell you that the very things that labour unions deal with, things like the displacement of workers, and things like the emergence of new industries are dealt with by unions in a way that is humane and not just by looking at a spreadsheet like The Economist under the inside of the House. Because when labour unions are able to discuss things like contracts or slowing down particular dismissals of workers, that is something that is particularly good in dealing with globalisation. The next thing this opposition says is labour labour unions lead to bad mobility of the workforce. I'm going to address this more in my substantive, but we said that we didn't care about labour union mobility insofar as under their side of the house, the more worse workers were the ones that were suffocated and crippled under the boots of neoliberalism. The very shallow response to our material was to say that unemployed workers were the ones that were going to be stuffed over by this. The thing to know is that unions help these people the most. Because when they push for things like greater employment or a quota on the number of employees you have, or when they push for things like retraining, if you get let go from a job, you're able to find employment for. Or when they push for things like better wages, those are all things that help the most distant drive times. But in addition to that, let's just note under this point, this is all because we just did not want to engage in the huge benefits we got when hundreds of people assembled and fought for higher wages, fought for better conditions. Let's be very clear. If we can see all of their material, at best they've got a 0.2% increase in GDP growth rate. We're not going to trade that off at the expense of increases in wages and"

              "text": "standards for workers. Two points of substantive depth. Firstly, why compulsory union membership is a necessary organ for a healthy economy. The economy suffocates under the boots of the bourgeoisie as American men in suits desperately pursue already inflated profits. Unions remedy a sick economy in three ways. The first is that they prevent crises of unemployment. Two reasons under this. They slow otherwise rapid rates of dismissal that occur in the coal industry this opposition wants to talk about. Because unions have the ability, no thank you, to negotiate things like contracts that stagger and slow down lay-ups and that allows the government to negotiate things like contracts that stagger and slow down lay-ups. And that allows the government to impose things like policy that allows them to transition out of it. That was extremely important. The very economic material this opposition wanted to stand behind did not stand in the face of that. But secondly, they softened the harms of unemployment. Because they were able to invest in things like retraining or force companies to compensate their workers with high severance packages, for example. This allowed the effects of unemployment to be far less worse and you have things like greater spending under our side of that. The second thing it did is it reduced economic inequality. I'll take a POI if you guys have one. Sure. Would you force a German citizen to join the Christian Democratic Political Party if that Christian Democratic Political Party legislates an increase in say environmental protection? I mean, I guess you guys have to start engaging with our case, which is that we have multiple unions, we have democratisation, you can't run a cookie cutter stop and ask it every time. So this reduces economic inequality through things like minimum wages and protections. Huge inequality is awful under their side of the house when the elites hoard money. Three reasons why. First, because people need money to invest, to innovate, to send their children to school. Second, poverty in and of itself, or inequality, creates bad social problems like time, which in turn has economic harms like property damage. Third, it leads to decreased spending when the rich is to save their money rather than investing it. We thought the middle class working folks were the ones that led to things like cyclical rises in economic growth. But third, and this is responsive to their material, is unions were actually guardians of market competition because unions advocated against things like monopoly policy. They wanted to have more people that they can negotiate with and they had an incentive to do so in parliament. This point in and of itself is debate-winning, because it shows that the economy is far better, and importantly, it proves that their minute economic benefit, at best, is not worth the sacrifice of stripping the poorest of their wealth and their right to democratic representation."

And especially when you have things like collective bargaining, which gets rid of things like pay secrecy. That was particularly beneficial for the fight against the Pay Act. But unions have fought hard for minority communities. When an Islamic worker union is able to negotiate things like Ramadan leave in Gujarat, that is something that's really beneficial. And that's responsive to their material. Under our side of the house, we have huge voting blocks of those minorities that are able to push for more of those legislations. The panel recognises this opposition needs to start dealing with the reality that is a lack of democratic representation.

They say, well, independent commissions are controlled by big business taking over the world. What we tell you in opposition is we think workers should have protections. They say independent commissions are controlled by big business. We think that's factually false. Look to India where their 2002 National Labour Commission, for example, instituted not only worker protections but also capital restrictions so you saw the middle class rising. We think those are the sorts of labour commissions we would like to have. But second, Australia is fundamentally uncomparative when it comes to trade-offs. A policy like this advantages some over the others. We need to hear a compelling account in Government 3 of why these trade-offs are justified. Third, we think they are uncomparative on the sophistication of our case. It is not enough for Australia's two to come up here and say in response to three different mechanisms that take their best case scenario and say you still get economic devastation and just say in response to our practical arguments, we don't care about labour mobility.

But we think they're also behind on the practical at the point where they say they don't care about our own practical argumentation, and they literally spend less than a quarter of their case in Proposition 1 on practical arguments. Let's talk about the one stakeholder that Australia wanted to talk about. They tried to tell you that this was better for workers. We told you no for five different reasons. First, because unions are structurally unsuited to representing workers. We tell you that at the point where unions want workers to stay within the industries, they don't actually retrain the workers for better jobs than Australia somehow thinks they believe they get retraining. But second, unions are unrepresented. I will show this in our third argument, and I'll fly it when we get there, but essentially, because of the lack of accountability and the lack of representation, what you have is structurally unrepresented union leadership making political gains at the expense of the workers. Third, we think there is no actual incentive for unions to make better policy at the point where you have compulsory membership. They would like to tell you that unions are automatically competitive in their roles because people can just choose which unions they join. No, here's why we think that's false. Large unions dominate these kinds of industries. Moreover, we would tell you that in these given large industries, unions have every incentive to collude. So effectively what you have is you have one singular union monopolizing labor. At this point, we don't think that you give them any incentive to actually push for change. But fourth, our second argument takes this increase in wages, this increase in bargaining power that comes out of the first and the third argument as its foundation. And we show you why you create economic devastation for the workers, specifically by increasing sectoral unemployment. Then, the second thing we talk about on this practical benefit to small businesses. Here's what comes out in a second. They tell you that unions are guardians of market competition. They call this argument debate winning. Okay, let's take them at their best and say unions want to guard market competition. Unfortunately, the practical outcomes are that they don't. What do we tell you in opposition 1? We tell you that at the point where unions raise costs for small businesses and increase the threat of litigation, small businesses are shut out of the market and you only entrench large businesses. Why is this so important? Because the lack of competition that they themselves want decreases jobs, decreases wages, increases prices, and moreover we say it magnifies the risk of sexual unemployment at the point where dining industries can't even vitalize under their side of the house. We also tell you about the unemployed. We tell you why it increases harms for the most vulnerable. Why do you need to care about this? Why is this the most strategically important part of our case? We would say at the point where Australia, if the question of practical is even ambiguous, Australia cannot win because their principles are entirely contingent on the practical."

              "text": "Let's talk about a third argument, about harmful political consequences. First, we think unions are structurally unrepresentative. Why? First, because in highly unionized firms that are less competitive, and this is what you see in highly unionized firms, not just firms that elect one or two unions, the minority force bonds with tenure. So what you see in UK teachers' unions is that the old establishment leads, with no incentive to let in minorities, who are often new, young entries into the field, into leadership. But second, even apathetic members forced to be there don't actually devote time to elections, so there's no surge in representation under Proposition's model. But third, we tell you that leaders are coercive and use fear to stay in power. In Britain, their largest union united literally blacklisted workers for speaking out against leadership. So let's say that workers start voting in union elections. It doesn't matter because union leadership coerces them to vote however leadership wants. There is no surge in representation under their model. Second, you could say that unions are unaccountable and as such we can bother sway. First, this happens because there's no member check because it's undemocratic. Second, there's no market check. We tell you that unions collude. And third, there's no institutional check because unions are responsible to anyone else. Given this lack of accountability, there's no institutional check, because unions are responsible to anyone else. Given this lack of accountability, given this lack of representation, why does this create harms, especially in a world where they themselves tell you about increased power? First, because it creates discrimination. We see that unions actively shut out minorities to protect the larger part of their base. Like in the United States, where unions stood against the civil rights, we think incidentally this clashes with the 40 seconds worth of material that they brought you in Proposition 2. Second, we think this creates tacit discrimination at the point where unions still distort policy in favour of the employed over the unemployed. We saw unions in Germany standing against things like rail-car protections, standing against things like inimmigrant emiss laws."

We have to show you that overwhelmingly, when wages went up by 7% in unionised industries, that helped the vast majority of workers.

We just are saying on our side, firstly, that we help the vast majority of workers, but secondly, that we give them a voice in unions and we give them a voice in the workplace that they otherwise would not have had, and that in and of itself is a good that we should value.

              "text": "to do two things in this bit. First, I'm going to prove that our policy is crucial to democratic representation, and second, I'm going to explain why this is best for workers on a practical level. On the first, the principle. First thing I'm going to do here is explain to you again our principle, the same as this team, because it's not contingent. There are two parts to it. First, we told you that democratic representation was foundational to workers' rights and just as your right to vote was absolute regardless of how people voted or the practical impacts of having a democracy and having people vote, we said union membership and your ability to advocate for your own views and represent yourself within the workplace were absolute regardless of practical outcomes. It was not a contingent principle. Secondly, we told you that it amounted to theft when 89% of US workers were able to claim the benefits of the end without paying union dues. They tell us that free ride is a contingent on practical outcomes. No analysis as to why, and it's pretty clear on our side that it is unjust. That's why on those two levels alone, the fact that people need democratic representation because workers' union matter, because workplaces play such a crucial political role in people's lives, in and of itself, wins us the debate. But let's look at their principles. They tell us one thing, which is that people deserve freedom of association and we should protect that above all else. They give you two reasons as to why. First, they tell you that joining a union should itself be a free choice. Two responses to that. Firstly, it is an unfortunate reality for this opposition team and for most workers around the world, because there are so many reasons why the choice not to join a union on their side is not a free one either. We gave you five independent reasons as to why you could not really decide to join a union. That was firstly, you had a lack of information. Secondly, you tended to optimism. Ten years out, you did not predict the fact that you would be laid off. Thirdly, there was social stigmatisation when only very few workers were parts of unions. Fourth, the fact that unions were way more expensive on their side to join because so few people were in them. And fifth, and most importantly, that employers were likely to discriminate against people when not everyone was unionised. Because firstly, they could just not hire unionised workers and cover that up. But secondly, even if they couldn't do that, they would favour groups of workers, like part-time workers, who on their side were disproportionately not unionised. That means on their side too, it is not a free choice not to associate with unions. But the reason why, and this is important, the coercion that is more on our side than on their side too, it is my free choice not to associate with unions. But the reason why, and this is important, the coercion that is more on our side than on their side, is because on our side you have a voice. You can vote within unions, you can represent yourself. So even if, at their best case scenario, as they said, on both sides coercion exists, on our side, when you're coerced into a union, you still have representation, you still can express yourself democratically, something that does not happen when you're just locked out in the first place. The second reason they give you why freedom of political association matters is because freedom of political association matters. Notice that's an argument for our side, and I'm going to use their example here to demonstrate that. They tell us that when an Indian Muslim joins a Hindu union, that is not what that Indian Muslim would want. True responses, and this is crucial because it undermines all of their analysis on freedom of association. Firstly, note that on our side, when there are more Indian Muslims in unions, they have a say and they can shape policies in their favour. That's material we gave you at second. The reason that doesn't happen on their side is because of a collective action problem, whereby any single Muslim person won't join because they themselves can't effect enough change. But secondly, and this is so crucial, notice the dire implication of their position on Indian Muslims and Hindu unions on their side. On their side, Indian Muslims just do not get represented in unions at all. They get paid significantly lower wages, they are more likely to be fired because they don't have legal protection. And for a side who wanted to champion these minority groups, they literally screwed them over at the point at which they never got union representation in the first place, and were never able to derive those benefits. At the end of this principle, two things should be clear. First, our principle is not contingent. Your right to have a say in your workplace and to match that say to your employer is fundamental. But secondly, all of their principal material, A, does not stand up, but second, it's terrible for the groups that they want to support."

              "text": "So, let's look, secondly, at what is best for your workers pragmatically. This is where USA catches most of their bets in this debate. I'm going to deal with five points under this. First thing they tell you is that strikes are destabilising to the economy and bad for producers. Firstly, that's true, that's how you affect change. When you have a bargaining chip such as the fact that you can reduce the amount of money a company can make, you're able to have a say. And it was a fatal strategic error for this company to put so much time into that, only to tell you that it was a waste of political capital for people to expend energy on unions. Because the important point here was that being part of a union created political capital that would to expend energy on unions. Because the important point here was that being part of a union created political capital that would not otherwise exist. You do not have bargaining power over your employer on their side. When you have a union, you do. This does not heat into any other form of bargaining power. Second point they're telling you, it's harder to fire people. Like, absolutely, it is harder to fire people. That's like a really good thing. And all we're saying is that unfairly firing people should be illegal. Obviously, if Brazilian teachers don't show up to work, there is just cause to fire them. Unions won't stop you doing that. But in the vast majority of cases, when people are taken in a moment, are fired unfairly, we think they absolutely should have a right to legal counsel, but they do not have it when they're not part of unions. Go. Let's talk about free writing. If the Democrats in the US legislate environmental protections a non-excludable good, why should any random citizen not be forced to join that party? No, no, like, people pay tax. They absolutely do participate in environmental causes. Like, free-riding is literally the best analogy to tax, right? I might not believe 100% of the Democrats' policies or the Republicans' policies, but I get some benefit and have to pay tax so that I only chop the benefits that's a mistake for our nation. That is absolutely the right comparison to make. Third point I tell you, unpractical. Small businesses will shut down because they're scared of litigation. Firstly, know that that awkward part of the topic that says large industries now actually becomes so meaningful here, because we are only talking about large industries. But secondly, know that beyond some analysis, presumably the way in which businesses will respond to our policy is not to just shut down and capitulate. They're probably more likely to just stop laying off workers unjustly and stop exploiting those labourers. That means you don't get small businesses shutting down, you just get better treatment of workers. Next thing they tell you is that unions are a monopoly and they won't be democratic on our side, they won't reform. First, there are internal accountability mechanisms that work for the most part under the status quo and will continue to work on our side. When the head of a union does not want to be voted out of that position by not representing their members, they will listen to what those union members have to say. Secondly, as we told you down the bench, in most industries there were multiple unions creating the competition. But thirdly, know how unions behave when they aren't guaranteed workers, and this is a point for our side. They're likely to engage in things like unnecessary strides in order to get attention and claim workers. That goes away on our side. A couple of final points on the economy as a whole that they bring you. First, they tell you you get increased unemployment. First, I'm just going to reject that you get less employment. Unions put up barriers to replacing labour with capital. That's the first response. Less automation, more negotiating power means workers are less likely to be fired, there'll be more employment. But secondly, when 100% of workers are unionised, it's unattractive to fire them and you're more likely to just reduce the pay salaries of people at the top of corporations. Finally, on the point about economic growth, it was very nebulous, but I'm going to point out here, as we told you down the bench, that we would rather value basic work protections that matter so much more, like getting higher pay, like getting guaranteed health insurance over a small increase to GDP. At the end of this debate, know that people absolutely deserve representation, and more importantly than"

              "text": "opposition have to do? They have to show why every worker must be forced to join a union in order to gain benefits for workers and wider societies. Why is this reasonable? Because if you're hurting millions or literally billions of people with your policy, it's probably not justifiable. We think when you're affecting the entire globe, it's fair to have a pretty high burden. But second, they have to justify why it's okay to make a massive rights violation in order to do so, especially since we tell you we can still support standards done by independent commissions like you see in India. We just believe in achieving these through cooperation and not coercion. At the end of the day, this is a debate about trade-offs in compulsory union membership, not whether they think we ban unions or why it's a good idea to join them. So, first toy area of clash in today's round is that of the wider economy, which they generously get to in Prof 3 at 7 minutes and 45 seconds. This is important, because even if you grant them literally all of their case about workers, this is why we still win the round because there are billions of people they're ignoring who aren't employed in these sectors. That is the wider economy. How do they do this? First of all, productivity. This happens in two ways. The first is small businesses. Not to shock you, but small businesses can be part of large industries. So why do they shut down? Not only is there fear of retaliation, like the side competition responds to, but they literally cannot afford the higher cost that unions implement. That's not something they engage with. So, the second way you hurt productivity is because when you increase cost of products, people can no longer afford to buy them. That's what decreases economic growth. So, why is productivity important? First of all, it's what creates the tax revenue to provide social services. Second, in the long run, that decreases wages. That's really important because when businesses are making less money and the economy is weaker, people cannot be paid as much. But third, because growth concretely reduces poverty, that's why we've seen global poverty go from 35% in 1990 to only 10% in 2013. Second way is unemployment. We would tell you that, first of all, people are literally fired off to their side of the house. That's like a statistical fact. In places where unionization is 20% higher, employment is 60% lower, they cannot sue their way out of businesses having to fire people because they cannot afford to keep them. But why is that worse than what they say? We tell you that the unemployed are the most vulnerable in this society. They're the most poor, and they're the least likely to be retrained. The longer they're out of employment, the more their skills decay, and the less the economy gets those valuable skills. But finally, because in the long run, social services for these people decrease, and the more the government has to spend on social services for the unemployed, the more they have to cut in other areas, which is crucial because that cuts into funds for retraining as well. But the third way they hurt more people, we tell you, is because unions structurally hurt the vulnerable. Why? Because they want to protect their own and protect wages. They see people like immigrants as a threat to that. That's why unions across the world oppose immigration. They structurally don't represent women either. Even though women are in over half of unions, they're barely 10% of union leaders. But we thank side proposition for trying to explain misogyny to me. But then, what is the next thing they bring to you? They bring to you the idea that overall, they create an aggregate growth. I can tell you that's not true because first of all, all of these harms still apply. Second, because you have more consumption in the economy when there are more people with jobs. But finally, because the contracts they talk about cannot prevent people from firing workers or replacing them when they cannot afford them. There is no way for retraining for contracts to solve that problem. At that level, they hurt way more people when they help. That's why they do this argument. Second key area of clash"

So if we win this argument, we win the round. First question under here, does union power actually increase? We give you a couple of reasons we think this isn't true. First, unions lose an incentive to perform when people are forced to join them. We think, rather, they collude with each other to take away the choice that the proposition creates an illusion of. But second, we tell you unions have huge structural problems that prevent them from being effective. That is, they don't cooperate with labor mobility, they don't understand like the global movement of labor, and they don't understand the fact that most labor is part-time but unions negotiate for full-time workers. But third, we tell you unions are structurally unrepresentative at the level where turnout in union elections is under 20% as is. We don't think it's really realistic that it's going to change under their side of the house. But take them at their highest ground and say, yes, unions are effective. Why is that? First of all, we tell you they destroy labor mobility. That is crucial because what unions want to do is keep the stranglehold they have on dying industries in order to hold their power. Like they did with coal in the United States and the United Kingdom. So what does that do? That creates unemployment across entire sectors. But it also means people cannot be effectively retrained because unions structurally oppose people being retrained and leaving their industry. But second, because unions fight for the privilege. That goes back to the part-time example where they only fight for full-time workers because that's who votes in their union election, so these minimum hours contracts mean people cannot get part-time jobs. But third, because these past economic harms I just mentioned affect union workers, which means when you see rising costs to the global economy, that hurts workers too, meaning their real wages are lower even if they're getting paid more. That's true across the world. But fourth, because they increase these costs, often businesses are afraid to hire people and afraid to fire them. That is why you speed the pace of automation, essentially putting more people out of work, which again, is legal. We help their demographic. If this is at all ambiguous, they lose the round, given that their principal argument is contingent on the practical, which I'll get to in a bit."

They give you a few reasons they think it's structurally acceptable to violate that. The first is political representation. We tell you, that is contingent on the idea that they actually improve political representation. Do put the right to it now. But we also tell you, at the level where unions are very unrepresentative and often just lead based on tenure and don't do what workers want, they undermine this. But second, they tell you people can't consent because they don't have enough information. Yes? Do you think more pensions, more health insurance, higher wages, and guaranteed legal protection or a bit of GDP growth, benefits workers more? We would tell you that when you hurt the global economy and you increase layoffs by up to 60%, you definitely hurt more people than you help. I already said that, I'm not sure why it's so unclear. But here's why workers can consent. First of all, we tell you, yeah, workers probably do know their sectors, pretty well understand the consequences, but second, we don't think that government plutocrats are necessarily in a better place to make decisions for those workers and force them to join unions. But the third thing they bring to you is free riding. We don't think paying taxes is the same thing as forcing someone to join a political party. But furthermore, we tell you again, this does not obligate people to join a union. It's contingent on the benefits that they prove. Choice at the end trumps this. The last thing they bring to you to respond to a principle is the idea of coercion. We say, first of all, we think it's unrealistic that 85% of workers are all joining, not joining because they're afraid of coercion. But second, unions coerce people more when they put people on scab lists and threaten them in their homes for daring to defy the union. But third, at the level where the state is telling you, you literally cannot get a job, you cannot put food on the table, unless you join a political organization. And then, these unions take your hard earned pay, that we find much more coercive. Why is that important? Because when people do not have freedom of association, they lose their right to fully participate in a democratic structure. Right now, we give you choice, they give you reasons, it might be a good idea to join the union, but that's not the debate. We ask them to engage with that and that is why we are proud to oppose.

Their entire principled case is reliant on the assumption that unions are the only way to increase democratic representation, that forcing someone to politically associate with a certain group is the best way to increase their democratic rights, and that these unions actually increase representation for disadvantaged groups when they skew representation for the most advantaged of those disadvantaged groups, and actually force people who don't want to engage in unions into these groups. It's just fundamentally flawed. But what do we hear on our principle of freedom of association? They told you, well, because you can choose which union you're forced to join, that means that you're democratically represented. We would say that these unions are always politically charged, and overwhelmingly collude with one another, and are dominated by individual actors, which means that this is fundamentally not true. What does this mean? It means that an Indian farmer who is Muslim is forced to join a union network that advocates for nationalist Hindu policies. We reject this. It means that immigrants in Europe are forced to endorse anti-immigrant policies. It means that African Americans in the United States are forced to endorse anti-minority policies advocated for by polluting networks of unions.

Unions actually decrease in quality on their side of the house because they don't have to compete. Labour mobility decreases, something they apparently don't care about, leading to massive sectoral unemployment that robs millions of people of their livelihoods. Why does that benefit the workers they champion? But now let's talk about two groups that they really didn't touch at all in this debate. The first one is unemployed workers. We tell you that unions structurally advocate for the employed overwhelmingly more than the unemployed, distorting policy in their favor at the expense of the most vulnerable populations that we should care about in this world. They are the poorest. They are much less likely to get retrained. There is immense societal stigma against them. We think it's demoralizing to constantly be told that you don't contribute and that you're not a valuable member of society. And these groups are often the worst victims of the negative political consequences that unions advocate for, things like anti-immigrant and minority policies. This is the most important demographic in this round. It is the most vulnerable, and we have the largest obligation to protect them."

Because they talked a lot about increases in GDP. They talked a lot about somehow keeping more jobs. But the actual links between the existence of unions and the actual links between their model and those outcomes were completely asserted and under-explained. This opposition talked a lot about unions and corruption and collusion, yet ignored the specifics of our model, which focused on things like democracy, anti-corruption policy, and multiple unions being effective."

On the first, we gave the workers the voice. Opposition never really gave a substantiated response to our principle about representation and the equalising force between fat cats and the worker until second opposition when they tell you that well that's completely contingent on representation. But that's when our model as opposed to the generalised conception of unions they had was so crucial because democracy, multiple unions and anti-corruption law didn't just apply to the Indian Hindus but everyone else. That was a benefit only our side claimed. But let's be comparative on the idea of representation because even if they could show that, well, in their base case scenario, 49% of the people that weren't in the majority weren't represented. Their side didn't give them a voice at all. They stood by appointing boards with no accountability. They stood by using the same government mechanisms that had locked out the worker for so long, we were unhappy to let those workers go on silence. Secondly, they never responded to all our material about consent."

But this is where their assertions were really their undoing. Because they never made the connection between not having unions and having more jobs. We told you in second speaker substantive that the comparative was not more people working, it was things like automation, it was things like offshoring. They never responded to that substantive. That means, at the end of this debate, we stood by slowing down the flow of people being replaced, we stood by reskilling the workers as they slowly got laid off, and protecting industries that weren't suffering from that.

And structurally, the foundations upon these international institutions have been made both by and for men. We now see the UN trying to combat this, trying to counteract this, and yet still today, only about 30% of delegates in the UN are women, and these women are still not in high-ranking positions, overwhelmingly. The UN is literally meant to be this sort of representation of equality, and one of the best international institutions in regards of gender equality, and at the point in which these biases still exist, we believe that it is justified to have this motion in place, but I'll take it now. Would you do this for national and local elections? And if not, why not? No, we would not do this for national and local elections. Well, we believe that large international institutions should only accept female country delegates. And if you don't send a female delegate, basically, you won't be represented. And then every other person underneath these representatives should also be women but first why just international why um just why not just some international institutions right we believe that women's rights are a global issue which has always been prevalent and the reason that we wouldn't have things such as quotas is because there are unique harms with these issues such as issues of tokenism where women are simply seen as sort of this tokenistic representation of quality and are often pushed around and brushed aside by men.

We recognize that this idea of meritocracy ultimately does not uphold in the status quo due to two main reasons. First of all, structural historical inequalities against women, right? Educational access has been historically unjust in respect to women. For example, if you look at places like the UK, right, you literally see these high-ranking private schools such as Eton, Westminster, which is all male up till sixth form, in regards to men. And that's why, because of this increased access to education that men have had at the expense of women, you see things such as Cambridge University having all-female colleges in order to actually combat this and have an all-female cohort. Laws which discriminate women as well are extremely prevalent and therefore we believe that we must counteract this through a motion which unanimously declares that women uphold these positions. But second of all, ladies and gentlemen, perceptions of women which result in biases when it comes to hiring women in these jobs. Women are often perceived as being emotional sensitive and that's why if we look at women in power right if you look at someone like theresa may even though anyone in her position would realistically have struggled with the brexit scenario which she inherited she was perceived as this sort of weak fragile woman who was simply incompetent to do her job because of her states as a woman or if you even look at women who are respected right such as margaret thatcher and her this idea of her being an iron lady the reason that she is upheld at this high position is due"

Statistically, due to implicit biases with women and gender roles, as well as in some cases explicit biases due to misogynistic rhetoric, men are far more likely to hire other men as opposed to women than women are. And that's why we see this sort of male hegemony and this decline and this masculine sense propagated even under the status quo and this means that this culture is extremely hard to break and even when women do get positions of power there are significant complaints of sexual harassment and general mistreatment due to their positions as women right in a world in which even the indian chief economist of the world bank reported sexual harassment we see that the only way to combat this issue is unanimously making these organizations women-dominated. Because as a principle, right, first of all, we owe this to women, because in order to actually have reparative justice, we need to put those who have been wronged in the past in the same position as past circumstances. Therefore, since these were unanimously male-dominated, we need to see a shift. shift and second of all having 50% women or having simple equity doesn't solve the issue of women being pushed around and it doesn't solve the issue of pervasive work culture which still"

We see that other non-gender related issues right can be just as well dealt with with women as men they aren't exclusive to men however even these so-called non-gender related issues are largely intersectional women are far more affected by poverty than men women are far more women in post-colonial societies suffer to a far greater extent than men and therefore women experience greater detriments firsthand even in regards to policies that appear to not be physically related to women under the status quo but second of all and most importantly female issues can exclusively be understood by women and we see two reasons for this right first women actually experience these issues and second of all that women are far more likely to focus on these issues right in a lot of third world countries, for example, in particular, men are often unlikely to even concede that these issues are prevalent under the status quo today. For example, in a lot of third world countries, they won't view the notion that women are seen as housewives or they're meant to be child bearers as necessarily detrimental, because they use rhetoric such as women are still equal, however, they're just different. They don't actually concede that these issues exist in the first place. But second of all, even if they do, right, there's far less focus on them. For example, if you look at cases such as rape in Pakistan, which is extremely prevalent and occurs on an alarming basis. If you look at femicide in Latin American countries, female genital mutilation in sub-Saharan Africa, these never take a prominent hold on the global scale and they're never the focus of a country's agenda which is why we need women in positions such as the UN in these international organizations to represent themselves because we recognize that empathy is completely different from sympathy right like men might be able to be sympathetic but since they've never actually experienced these issues firsthand they will never be able to fully comprehend the extent to which they affect women on a global scale. They will never be able to comprehend that people who are perceived as non-gender related still do affect women at a far greater rate and therefore they just simply aren't as qualified to legislate on issues that concern women and even in issues that don't, women are far more likely to be negatively affected. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure reparative justice for the structural inequalities women have historically faced, we need to ensure that these women, that these institutions and international organizations are entirely comprised of women in order to have better policy on our side of the house which is why we beg you to propose"

It's probably the women who are in the party that are currently in power and probably the enfranchised women that agree with the policies of the party that is most in power. I don't think that's a big issue when we're talking about liberal countries. When we're talking about Jarbal Sinara, that probably looks like him picking a woman who is pro-life. When we're talking about Victor Corban, that's probably, we're probably talking about a woman who doesn't think that lesbians and gay people in general have a right to get married. When we're talking about those people, we're probably picking a woman that agrees with the doctrine of shafting, that is a woman who should stay in the home. And then what all that means realistically for their case is that a minority of women's views are being represented. The women's views that are held by the majority of things, like being able to get an abortion, probably aren't being represented on this international level. But crucially, that's the propaganda mechanism for the enfranchised, for those in power, without actually achieving anything meaningful for women. The rest of our material is entirely independent of that characterisation of women that we just gave you, which means regardless of what kind of response they give to us of that characterisation of women that we just gave you, which means regardless of what kind of response they give to us of that characterisation, everything else mistakes that."

Because when a woman is criticising Saudi Arabia as a liberal country for women's abuses becomes significantly less powerful. Because when a woman is criticising a woman for abuses against women, it probably doesn't look as powerful. It looks like that woman hasn't experienced abuse.

You never get to have a woman from a liberal country criticising a man from an illegal country like Hungary for doing something wrong. We think those men deserve to be lab-maxxed.

We think that is entirely independent of their principle and it disproves their principle also to a large extent. But crucially then, one of the issues that are entirely to do with men, they talk about issues that are gender neutral, but there are also issues that exist for men. We think that looks like things like men's health. We think that looks like crimes committed against soldiers in wars. These are issues that are almost exclusively to do with men. We think on a very principle level, those men have so much representation. Just like we think women have a right to be heard on committees about sexual abuse, men have a right to be heard on committees about men's health. Crucially, panel, though, we think these men should be engaged in the process because they need to understand how they have benefited from the harm that has been done towards women. So what that means then for their case, panel, is that very little actually changes on their side of the house. You can't offer a structural critique because these things are basically just tokenistic. But secondly, the use of a massive amount of political capital, which is actively hard on a national level, that is my second point. They never talk about it. They're behind this debate for that POI. You think that there is no enforcement mechanism per se. How are you so conveniently saying that you've got enforcement mechanism for actual policies in terms of men's related issues? I think that's entirely irrelevant. You can easily enforce a men's related issue because countries are just happy to enforce issues that are related to men. What you need enforcement mechanisms is when you're dealing with policies that might be slightly unpopular in your country. When you're dealing with a policy that the most enfranchised head politician might not want to implement. That's when you need a force of mechanisms. We have them on our side of the house. Why?"

              "text": "On a national level, how are they corrosive? Sure, panel, we think in the majority of illiberal or slightly illiberal countries we're talking about, a lot of the population might not be happy to talk about feminist issues, might not be happy to talk about abortions, might not be happy to talk about services for women. But we think what happens now is you make those people diametrically opposed to those things because of the fact that you're using up so much political capital because of the fact that you're making it look so unpopular. Why is that? You create resentment towards women. As a man, you don't feel represented on an international level. That means you're probably less likely to vote for a woman on a local level. You probably feel anger towards the most disenfranchised people in society, the women that weren't involved in this decision, the women that need your help, need your understanding. Don't get that understanding. Instead, they get resentment. But secondly, Carol, there's a massive confirmation bias in that side of the house. And that is because when something goes wrong, it's no longer seen as a political issue, it's seen as a gender issue. As a man in an illiberal country, when I see a woman messing up on an international level, responding to a question poorly and having economic sanctions placed on my country, I think it's that woman's fault. I view that woman as being too fussy, being too bossy, and it has actively harmed my country. That is the worst thing in the illiberal countries like Hungary, Bahrain or Malaysia. That gets significantly worse in our society. But thirdly, and crucially, women are now drawn away from a national level. That is firstly because you're placing women in positions of power in international institutions, which means you just have less women. But crucially, because of the reasons I just gave you, men probably vote for women less often. Some women probably vote for women less often because they think they've got their fill and they've been told to think those things because they live in these illiberal societies. Which means you don't get those one or two women in the national parliament. Which means you don't get those enforced mechanisms and those focused policies that might lead to a literacy class for women in rural India, that might lead to a sectional health clinic in South America, in Brazil, in the Amazon rainforest, for women that need it the most. What they do is that they use all their political capital to get very tokenistic policies through because they think that tokenism is the way to benefit the most disenfranchised individuals in society. We recognize that this was an intersectional issue and focused resources on the place that needed it the most, never in Prada to oppose."

              "text": "Let me take into account what the first speaker of side opposition said in my rebuttal before moving on to my substantive point, how we get better representation throughout the political and power structures of society for women on our side of the house. But firstly, let's take a look at what side opposition have come up to say. Now, they start off by asking an arbitrary POI about implementing this motion to local and national governments and societies, right? Now, firstly, this isn't within the purview of the debate. So we're happy to talk about this after the debate. But for now, we're talking about international institutions. But even if you want to talk about what they had to bring into perspective, perspective they said it themselves right in these local national governments you have the principle of democracy where people should have the right to vote for who they want to but when you're talking about these international institutions where delegates get indirectly selected those are delegates that can be chosen specifically to be women without having to compromise on a person's right to vote for who they want for because a person doesn't vote for a UN delegate or a World Bank delegate they get selected so that's why we think that this is uniquely the institution that should be implementing this motion. Secondly, another arbitrary question from side opposition, would you take the men's right to vote because they had the right to vote before? Again, it's completely misunderstood my first speaker's argument. The fact that these private gentlemen's clubs like the UN, the World Bank, IMF have been dominated by men and because of that initial hegemony of men that has been propagated throughout history into the present day where, like my first speaker said, men are more likely to pick other men to succeed them Governments are more likely to pick men if men precede them. That is why we have the systemic under-representation of women in these parties of power Right. And so we're talking about things like voting. Women are already represented in terms of voting Equitably because there was no zero-sum game of the amount of people who could vote but over here there is so again side opposition brings up a point that's completely washed but thirdly they speak about how a minority of women's views are represented how things like in developing countries and conservative countries you know leaders are only going to put across women who have anti-abortion views or who have you know somehow misogynistic views despite them being women themselves. Now, firstly, we're fine with conservative women coming about and representing conservative views. But most importantly, on their side of the house, they have a much worse comparative. They have men who are against abortion. They have men who have no idea what it feels like to be put into a sexual harassment situation. They have men who have no idea what it's like to have a sister shipped off to be married as a child. And so even if you have conservative women on our side, you have women who are more empathetic to the gender issues facing females today that they don't have on their side of the house. So in the comparative, we have more empathetic policy for women. Even in their worst case scenario, we have conservative women in some countries. More on. They said, oh, we want women to fill men up with shame, we want them to ask tough questions, call them misogynists on the world stage but clearly like I said, the opposition is living in a fantasy world because today if you're in the United Nations you have a one-third chance of experiencing sexual harassment as a female employee. If you're in the world back, that's higher. And so right now, women in situations where there's immense toxic masculinity, they're subjugated, they're harassed, they're belittled, and they're pushed around and not given the representation that they should be. They're not given the respect they should have. And so you're having women belittled, and now side of opposition comes up and says, oh, but these women are out there challenging men on the basis of their views, that isn't happening in the status quo, because A, these women are in lower positions, positions that are secondaries, that don't actually get to make the big decisions, and secondly, even if they are in these top positions, they're exposed to this culture of toxic masculinity that doesn't give them the ability to assert their views properly, so side opposition's characterization of, oh, let's lambast that of toxic masculinity that doesn't give them the ability to assert their views properly. So side opposition's characterization of, oh, let's lambast that man with shame is absolutely unrealistic. Because the actual characterization we've seen in reality is that men are pushing women around. Men are, you know, off doing their backroom deals and their private jets and stuff, while women are left, you know, feeling second-class delegates, right? Now, next. Your side. And this is also why we do not support quotas because 50-50 quotas will often lead for developing countries like, you know, like conservative countries, putting women who are putting women in lower positions, you know, women, you know, will be junior delegates. They won't actually be the ones making tough decisions, but we have, if we have an all-women body, women will be the ones making tough decisions but we have it if you have an all-woman body woman will be the ones making those important decisions which is why we don't want a 50-50 order where the toxic masculinity will still exist and where woman will be in immense tokenistic positions right if there's an all-woman body women will be making decisions further they spoke about how men's health are a problem and how you know we need to talk about the issues of soldiers we need to talk about issues like homelessness and you know suicide that affect men but ladies and gentlemen on our side you can find women who are soldiers you can find women who are homeless you can find women who have faced depression and suicide but you can't find a man who's experienced women's issues you can't have a man who's experienced sexual harassment as much as a woman has. And so on our side of the house, women can deliberate and legislate on all these issues equally to a man. And on the massive, massive and important issue of women's rights, men do not have the same ability to legislate as a woman does. So on our side of the house, we get better policy because we have better focus and better empathy for women's issues. And for the rest of the issues, we can find women who can deal with that with qualifications. So again, side opposition has failed in that regard as well."

If you're Prime Minister Modi of India, are you going to choose a leading high feminist, or are you going to choose someone from the women's wing of the BJP? All right, all right. Understood, understood. So if you talk about conservative women, again, even if you have conservative women, you have women who are still more likely to be empathetic towards gendered women's issues than a hyper-conservative man. And so on our side of the house, even in a narrow worst-case scenario, we have more empathetic women's legislation, even if it's not ideal. Now, going on to my substandard. Now, like I said, we have better representation of better women on our side. Firstly, countries want the best representation possible for them on their world stage. So if we pass this motion and have all women delegates, these countries, especially developing and conservative countries, are going to be forced to make better education institutions for women, to encourage women to get into local and national politics so they get the experience to be delegates and be in national states. They also are going to be forced to repeal misogynistic policies that prevent women from advancing in their career. And they're also going to have more qualified women after they come out of these international institutions to run for higher office. Why is this? It's because these countries will be to be forced to make educated, qualified, and strong women to represent them on the world stage. And so they're going to, even for these developing countries, if they want proper representation, they have to put qualified women on these fronts. So we get better avenues for women in power. We have women who are now going to come out of the United Nations, come out of the world back in IMF, and now have the qualifications and the international exposure to run for higher office. We have women being encouraged to go into local politics because they are the women who are going to be representing the country on a national stage. And through all these paradigms of power, we have women in better representation. But in terms of perception, developing conservative countries, right? If you see a woman, if you're a conservative man in India, if I see a woman in factly defending my views and my principles on the world stage, I'm going to feel like women are less likely to be subjugated. I'm going to feel like women are more competent and I'm going to feel that women have the right to be in these positions of power. And that's why cyber opposition makes this case. Judges, the speaker spoke for 8 minutes and 21 seconds. Thank you. Okay. Are we ready? Just a thumbs up is enough. Yeah, it seems like we're ready."

We largely think that side proposition have only stood for this working within organisations such as the UN and has largely ignored massive and incredibly meaningful organisations such as the UN and as largely ignored by massive and incredibly meaningful organisations such as the EU or the African Union in which people are voted into the positions that they get in this situation, you have to address the democratic legitimacy in these organisations as well who can't stand for this working in the UN. So on this issue of asking questions of men in this situation and how you don't think it's fair that women have to ask these questions of men in these situations.

And like we largely tell you, their first speech means that these women would be the enfranchised class within these countries and largely support the existing political structures. They tell us in the first speech that there's significant educational barriers and as well as active discrimination within the law that these women face. So what does this mean for the types of women that these will be? We think these will be rich. If they can like attend educational institutions and work so supported, get the high quality education that you tell us colleges in Cambridge that are solely based towards women. If you can afford the $15,000 that it takes to go to Cambridge, then we think this is a really good policy for you. But for the women that are most affected by this, they never get meaningful representation. You tell us these issues are intersectional, but just as you say, just as you say men like just as you say men can't adequately know the experience of women we don't get rich women adequately the experience um that are faced by women of lower socioeconomic classes we don't think you get this adequate representation at all no thank you we also think like if in order for you to overcome these barriers within the law, you necessarily have to be enfranchised, have political connections, have social connections, in order for you to be selected for these delegations. So this country, beyond it, nothing has been responded to, our first point hasn't been responded to, and that country has have been sentenced to select women who have uphold these systems. Like, if they have the political capital for these measures, like for this discrimination in law, then they actually have the political capital for these women to uphold this system. Okay, okay. You've criticized us for putting more women in support of existing political structures, but it's not better than your side of where you support men who no because we are achieving like the face of this issue then it becomes completely whitewashed you never get like the meaningful and engagement like we are saying this just means that women are likely to be seen as like complacent and complicit with their own systemic discrimination. We'd much rather these issues be posed towards men, rather than them simply being able to skirt all their responsibilities and tell us, look, she supports this, she speaks for all women in our country, they largely are okay with the sexist policy we have, we think this is incoherent.

So like any instance of like a liberal country who don't promote women's movements or don't support women, it will send women who hold these same values. Like this looks like silencing the selfie me movement in Iran or silencing the Muslim sisterhood in Malaysia. Like countries already actively silence these movements and try to mitigate their effects. So we think it's easier for other countries to be completely apathetic towards the women's movements and very important women's movements in these countries. When you don't get the international condemnation or international attention which is vital to make these movements successful. You can no longer circumvent the existing political structures within these states. It becomes significantly harder for these women's movements to be successful or to get any level of meaningful representation. And so this just creates another means and another barrier to these movements and never enact meaningful change on the comparative to engage in the point beyond seven minutes like it's worse when women are doing it when women are seen as antipatic towards these issues as well okay second tokenism and so we largely think like we've read it proved that this will likely not change any legislation or any attitude. And we think like this just simply breeds resentment. When you have no need for change in your team, it all becomes tokenistic. No thank you. You don't remove barriers. You don't change the experience that women face daily. So sexism still happens. So you largely just put a smiley face on countries who commit abuses. Okay, this cheapens the achievements of women who got into these situations on their own merits. So like the barriers that women face day to day, particularly in illiberal countries, when women do manage to overcome these things, they are then put on a delegation with those women who just happen to be enfranchised. This cheapens their achievements and it's tied to the actual achievements of women when they're all painted with the same brush."

What were these reasons? Well, we told you the fact that, like, in the status quo, often there's a perception of women in leadership, like, to be weak, as often people that don't stand up and hold your country's interests. Second of all, we told you about the historical culture of negotiation.

The fact that, like, a third of women complain about these kinds of things to these countries means that they're deviating from these policies. We change this uniquely, panel, because we're the side that makes sure that every single woman is given the right kind of culture within these kinds of institutions."

Three reasons why affirmative action doesn't work the same way our policy does. First of all, we ask them, which countries are the ones that have to pick women? Which are the countries that don't have to pick women? How do we make this distinction? If it's based on the developing countries that have to pick these kinds of countries, we kind of resent that they complain about it while we get worse. Second of all, we think that still, people know, thank you, being ill-treated because of this culture that inherently favours misogynistic ideals, the way in which negotiation works, meaning the women are structurally more likely to be excluded, even if it's 50%. We think if 50% of people are the ones that are being excluded, that's very, very problematic. Third of all, notice that still the fact that affirmative action is something that exists on their side is a concession on the principle. It means that they recognize the fact that there is systematic underrepresentation that they have to deal with insofar as we do it better. But then what do they say? They say, aha, we don't have to fight. They say, would you also do this in national elections? Here's the thing, panel. We tell you that in the status quo, the reason we don't do this in national elections is because we allow the chance for women to be voted for but because of the four reasons we gave you every single time the country had a chance to pick between a man and a woman they would always pick the woman they missed this nuance completely and wanted to harp on about this completely irrelevant domain right what then do we tell you what does this mean right it means that basically the systematic under-representation that we've seen for the structural reasons we've spoken about, we're the only side that can actually do something about it. We're the only side that uniquely gets the kind of change that we've had. Before I move on to Sheryl."

They finally conceived it in their second speech that their counterfactual or their alternative was likely to be one where men were the one that were asking men, right? Like, you know, basically their main alternative was, aha, you get to confront men, and then that's going to be like a big solution. First of all, we told you that this was very, very problematic because of two reasons, right? We told you, one, it was unlikely that men would even care about issues of sexism, oftentimes because if they're confronted on matters of sexism, they would often see this as a threat to their culture, a threat to their sovereignty. The reason this is different for women is because they're less likely to actually place a greater emphasis on things like sovereignty and culture. Why is this the case? Because in order to even get where they did, they've had to break ideals of culture. They've had to break ideals of patriarchy and basically escape. That's why it was structurally more likely that women would care. But second of all, we told you, even in their best case scenario, even if men did care and get up there and ask these questions, which we thought was fundamentally unlikely on their side of the house, we think even then, the fact that they don't put on that thank you and care about these other men's issues that they were complaining about, like, you know, that is the point where women's issues get significantly better, which means that we are the side that actually cares about women's issues and do that to, like, a better extent. And this is where they flip-flop on this idea of enforcement mechanism, because at first they said, aha, you get enforcement mechanisms. I mean, you don't have enforcement mechanisms to ensure that women, like women and their issues are dealt with. And then by second, they're like, oh, you know, basically, enforcement mechanisms will exist in the kinds of issues with regards to men, right? Notice, we were very clear on where we stood. We think enforcement mechanisms do exist in the status quo, which is exactly the mechanism by which we can ensure that women get equality, right? We're okay with some men's issues being diluted insofar as the ones that are like structurally the most underrepresented, they're the ones that are brought to the forefront. But also we told you right from first as part of our setup for the second argument that actually other policies are probably a wash because women can do this like in the same kind of way. We don't see a reason why women are like bad at other policies, right? Then what do they tell you? Finally, they're like, aha, you get women that are voting on things like abortion because you know they're the ones that are the most privileged in the status quo first of all notice this wasn't unique to our side on their side we have affirmative action as well okay like at best but also in their worst case all the men they're talking about will probably do this from much worse extent right but no we tell you the fact that women have had like lived experiences and empathize with the fact that women actually see the kinds of issues in fact they know other people they face these kinds of issues and relate to it themselves means that they're structurally more likely to care because even privileged women women like face subjugation but most importantly in our worst case scenario at least we help a big chunk of women get more representation they just support sexism and classism. We think on balance, like some classism which might be problematic would still exist. Like it might exist in the status quo, but that's our very worst case. Finally, on like perceptions. What do they tell you? They say, aha, like second speak argument, international lack of engagement on female issues because you're cheapening, right? Notice that this is like because you're cheapening like women's issues. Notice there's a bit of contradiction with their own policy on affirmative action. But secondly, it was weird that their singular mechanism was literally ensuring that more men come in"

That means you actually have a better creation of role models. It means you have better perceptions.

              "text": "Let's talk about international politics here. They make a big deal out of their principle in their third speech by just basically listing it out again and not really expanding it and repeating it and saying we didn't respond. No panel, the thrust of this principle, right, is that women are represented. To the point to which that representation is a false, of which I'll be proving, or it's actively damaging to more meaningful representation on a national level, which will be talked about in my second question, we have adequately responded to their principle and we fulfilled that burden better than they ever could. But no, the principle is just bizarre, right? Their only response to say that we want them in totality is to say we want meaningful representation. But note that if you're elected to the European Parliament, if you're elected to ASEAN or the African Union, you're just a member of parliament. There is a difference still within those institutions that are greatly important. So affirmative action would be actually more principally sound on their side of the axe. But let's talk about the crux of this question. There are three reasons why this representation of the Thank You Act is likely to be adequate. Firstly, we tell you about legitimacy and how these countries would be incentivised by the most conservative women, the women who are going to put a smiley face on the misogyny that exists within these countries. They gave a very glib response to this by basically saying women by nature being women are going to be actively more empathetic to each other. Firstly, this takes this argument at its absolute worst. We tell you the reason why this is important isn't just because we want empathy, it's because these women reactively corrosive to the image of the human rights abuses in that country on an international stage. They see women representing women and everything's fine with Saudi Saudi Arabia guys, please don't ask too many questions. But second of all, on comparison, there are absolutely issues that those women won't care about that impact the vast majority within that society. They say, oh classism exists on your southern house, but the point at which, right, if I'm an Indian woman that Modi has selected to represent the Hindu nationalist party at an international level and I say, oh there isn isn't a problem with caste system and gender. There isn't a problem like that with my country. Or I literally never mention it, it never comes out of my mind. I leave it to whitewash the issues that exist at an international level. That point, Roy, is actively damaging. It's not mitigatory. They're causing more harm than they are good. But secondly, it's structurally critique, which gets another very clear response. They simply say, oh, they're living in a fantasy world where men are going to bring up these issues. Know that there's a competitive spectrum of countries in this debate, right? You're not either Sweden or Saudi Arabia. There are plenty of liberal countries with women in those parliaments who would ask those tough questions in our worst case scenario. But at our very worst, right, when we're talking about men, those men are also elected by women. They probably do care about those issues that they belong to in liberal society. The crux of this, right, wasn't about who's asking the questions. It was the fact that the questions were being asked of those in working power. The fact that you're not putting the burden of sexism and institutional misogyny on people who have a chilling effect about asking those tough questions. Never really contended with from Team UAE. But lastly, right, we'll tell you about democracy. Note that this is really important, right? The point at which we delegitimize the democratic validity of these institutions we're talking about in the European Union. If you literally have no representation on a legislative level across a continent because of an asymmetric characteristic because of your gender, that's likely where this parliament becomes tokenistic, where you don't devolve power to it, and these women literally have no capacity to have influence. Note that that is comparative, right? Because there are some women in these institutions, there are women who have power. The point at which you delegitimize them, right, is actively damaging, because even if you have 100 women, and they have no power, it's actually damaging when you have 10 who did. But let's weigh it. Do I? Note that even if they have this tokenistic symbolism, let's weigh this against our hearts. I would say, right, even if you have slightly more empathetic people in the top parliament, it is actually damaging to the point at which they can set up these systems. It's actually damaging at the point at which they have chilling effect on what questions you can ask. And it's actually damaging when they're not representative. In the only area of the debate they want to contend with, we beat them outright."

              "text": "Let's talk about the second question, which was national politics before I do, sure. You talk about how women in these positions of power are going to have a corrosive effect on women's issues because they're going to be conservative women. Doesn't that happen in your side of the house too, where you have affirmative action, where Modi can still pick an Indian woman to talk about abortion? We never said that you should have forces in parliament. We said you probably should have equal candidates from going to the European Union so you can actually make a decision. And the women who get elected by vote veto, then being on a ballot and people have a choice, they're likely to not be, they're going to be far less optimistic than when you just plot them in that parliament, which is the central policy of the United States. We're not being consistently inconsistent. Let's talk about national politics. Note that the only way they engage with this, they largely ignore us, they just talk about the international level, the entire debate, is to say, oh, you can educate some of these women. Nope Mike, rebuttal on the first speech Harry deals with this. We don't care, acknowledge his wife, women in the women's wing of the BJP get educated, they probably already are. But look, let's weigh this, because they don't engage with this area of the debate. The reason why it matters more with the international level is because we're dealing with the most amount of women. We're talking about four billion women here who live in liberal societies. We have a moral duty to them because you have more impact on them on a legislative level than you ever could in the UN or in the African Union. And lastly, note that this is reliant on the first. The point of which, right, we say these positions aren't that important, but the reason why they are important is because you trust those people to represent you on an international stage. You want to see that they're competent and they're a good representation of your country. The point at which they're not, right, that affects national and local politics and the attitudes of men in a much more meaningful way and damages those women. We tell you three reasons that don't really get responded to, right. Firstly, right, they respond to the resentful thing in the last ten seconds of their speech. Not just saying women are good at their job. I agree, but the point of which, it isn't just about them being good, it's also the fact that I literally cannot be representative of the United Nations. I will actively resent women for that. I will actively associate all women with that barrier to governmental information. I'm far less likely to vote for them in a local or national election at that point. That has to be harmful. Secondly, when it comes to confirmation bias, it's the same thing, right? The issue is not that women were more likely to make mistakes. It's when they do, it will become an issue of gender in the way that when a man does it, it never is. I will always be looking for that woman to mess up on the financial committee. And the point at which they do it justifies them to never be on a committee or a national body for an local election. Thirdly and lastly, right, they just never respond to the fact that if this political capital exists, it has to be meaningful in any significant way, not only do we not want to be actively damaging the way that we're talking about it, we want our political capital to be pushed towards local and national elections, where it's far more meaningful, right? This isn't a watch. This comes at a direct opportunity to ask for something that's more meaningful for the reasons I gave in weighing at the front of this question."

We told you three reasons why this is important. Firstly, right, we tell you at the point at which women's rights movements are locked out from these institutions, when they're not getting credit, when you pick out a token of the BJP, a token of Jair Bolsonaro, you're not able to get the kind of grassroots change when you empower those women and use that political platform when it matters most. There's a huge opportunity cost for the feminist movement in a liberal society. Secondly, right, which I also listen to and respond to, it is tokenistic to the point at which you do have women in that parliament. Their achievements become delegitimised, they become belittled, they become associated with that woman who got there by virtue of being of their gender rather than being of their confidence. We think that is actively damaging for the women who have meaningful representation in those women's movements. But lastly and finally, right, we told you that we do not want to place the burden on women to justify their existence in these societies. We do not want to place the burden on women to be constantly making up for the failings of men. Just put men in the hot seat because they are the ones at fault, never been happier to oppose. Okay."

What we told your panel was that on the international level, this is a largely symbolic gesture. Why? Firstly, there is no enforcing mechanisms. This wasn't really contested until their third speaker said something, like kind of tried to pull us into the weeds, but ultimately it's very true because these were voluntary institutions, so there's absolutely no enforcement mechanisms on their side of the house. But secondly, it will be co-opted by the BJP, by the parties in power in places like Hungary, in places like Bahrain. That means it's a symbolic gesture. And what that meant was that when something goes wrong, you as a woman probably get blamed, but blamed as a woman, not as a political figure. But crucially, it came at a massive opportunity cost to the national level of politics, even though nothing really changes on an international level, because ultimately, it is something symbolic. Their best response to this was really that the United Nations is a gentleman's club, women are often sexually harassed, and are probably in lower positions of power and that means that our harms don't accrue. Panel, even if it was true, which we think possibly is the case, that we have less positions in these women's of power, we still have the man or woman elected in the Liberal country lambasting the man from an illiberal country on our side of the house and that means that that man is filled with shame for his actions that never happened on their side of the house. But secondly, what's really crucial is that it really, realistically, was the most enfranchised women from these illiberal countries getting into those positions of power. What we told you was these women benefit from the same things that men in those positions previously benefited from. They benefited from women in poverty. They benefited from the status quo because it allowed them to be wealthy, it allowed them to be in franchise. And ultimately what that meant was that at their very best there might have been some more instances of sexual harassment within the walls of the United Nations. And we think that that is regrettable. But that pales in comparison to the millions of women living in illiberal societies that are ultimately failed on their side of the house and what that mattered for then was that you probably never have that illiberal man question his views but crucially they lost a massive amount of political capital on what ultimately was a very symbolic gesture so i think we won that clash because at least we have that a liberal man question his views but even if you don't it fails in comparison just on the numbers on the national level."

That was the only part they addressed. And we think that that wasn't true to the extent they said it was, because firstly, based on the nature of these societies, men probably vote significantly more in those societies. Even if you have women forgiving women, it is ultimately the men that are voting in those societies, ultimately the men voting men on the national level into power because of the opportunity cost. But secondly then, men just resent women a lot more on their side of the house, because women are in the international symbolic positions of power which means you've got less women on a local level. And what that meant for the debate was, like sure they might have more women in the United Nations, but we had women that were not as enfranchised the same way their women were, but were just popular in their community, getting elected to a council, getting elected to a parliament. And that meant that you probably had more literacy classes on our side of the house, but a better, more constructive debate on the gender pay gap. You had some laws reducing the impacts of sexual harassment on the most disenfranchised individuals in this debate. That was something they never achieved. Sure, they might have helped the people in the United Nations. They might have given an enfranchised woman a better job. They might even have some kind of resolution be passed within the law of New York. They just didn't get the benefits that we got for women in India, for women in Hungary.

On their side of the house, they make the assumption that the reason women don't get voted into the office is because every voter is sexist. No, it's because we don't have enough qualified women, we don't have enough qualified women. We don't have enough, you know, representation of women in these positions of power. And that"

Again, responded to throughout all three of our speeches, but I'll do so again. The bodies that we're talking about, the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, these bodies bring about actual change. The World Bank gives billions of loans, billions of dollars of loans to developing countries. The UN has emancipated millions of women in India and Africa and so side opposition gave us no substantiation about how these women will bring about no change. On our"

Notice how this contradicts the resentment point because men are going to think that women are only here because of the affirmative action. And so the fact of resentment isn't even an exclusive harm on their side of the house."

Tokenism is a problem on their side of the house because on their side of the house, you have 50% of men and 50% of women coming from developing countries and these developing countries can very easily put these 50% of women in junior positions in positions where actual power isn't allocated to them and so these places actually get a smiley face and the 50% of men run the shots while women are there making no actual decisions. So tokenism is actually exclusive harm on their side of the house because on our side of the house we have women making actual decisions right now next let's talk about their entire point about how you put a smiley face for countries of misogyny again this happens on their side of the house with affirmative action something they failed to respond to throughout this book about how Modi can put in an anti-abortion woman and argue that on the floor of the UN. That can happen on their side of the house as well. And so again, no exclusive harm on their side. And finally, like I said, these women are going to have tokenistic positions. On our side of the house, we have women making decisions about these important issues that affect them and have women who can still legislate on a vast breadth of other issues.

We're talking about institutions that are generally global in their scope, i.e. in the countries that are represented within them and in the scope of their decisions. Institutions like the United Nations, like the World Trade Organizations, like the World Health Organization, World Bank, IMF, and so on and so forth. Two, what does it mean for you to be a country delegate? We have to understand, first thing first, that a country delegate is oftentimes just one individual. In most international institutions, there is one individual that plays this role of representation. Two, they are generally appointed by governments at the discretion of those governments, meaning that they can choose generally whomever they want and whomever they think aligns with their own political position the best. Three, generally, they follow a mandate from the government. They generally have to follow some guidelines that are provided by political leaders. Fourthly, they do have negotiating power. This looks like country delegates within the United Nations negotiating on the specific wording of different resolutions in order to establish a formula that best fits their country's interests. So they are indeed bound to follow some guidelines from national governments,"

We would think that the executive leadership of many of these organizations would impose that they would only receive female country delegates. This looks like the United Nations Secretariat telling countries that they will have to only bring female country delegates. We think that this is likely to be accepted by all nations in the world since they care more about being represented in one of the most important fora of international debate, international decision making, one second, rather than just giving up on a man that they wanted to put in that position. Before I go into my first substantive, if there are any POIs. When nations care deeply about their sovereignty and the ability to have individual choice, do you really think they're going to buy into you forcing them to make a particular decision? Yeah, ma'am, sure. Some of them might not be super happy at first about it, but even countries like Saudi Arabia currently have female diplomats within their ranks. We think that it's not as big of a change for them to give in to this sort of decision"

The legitimacy of decisions coming from these bodies at a global level rests on procedural ground, meaning that no... Thank you. Because of all religions, of all ethnicities have a say, that means that they are all bound by the decisions that these international institutions make, at least at the principal level. However, there is one glaring exception in today's world, and that is women. At all levels of political decision-making, women are being crowded out. In parliaments, at the level of who is an MP, in most countries, vastly dominated by men. At the level of heads of state, most of them in the world are men. So there is a systematic under-representation of women within most countries. Therefore, we think that in this current setup of these international institutions, no thank you, the decisions of these institutions are not international in scope. They're not global in scope because they leave out half of the world's population. In order for these decisions to be truly global and to hold legitimacy in front of all the people in this world, we have to fix the issue of representation."

They're the only ones that have enough power and international clout and prestige to induce this form of representation. In the case of individual countries that may have sexist national governments, it is unlikely that they will take that position themselves and to appoint, for example, a female head of state. So we think that the only way to induce some form of representation is to force this thing at the level of national country delegates. We think that since countries desperately want a seat at the table in the most important fora, they're just going to accept it. Why national delegates though? Because they're the only real stakeholders in the decision-making process at level of most international institutions. If we talk, for example, about the staff of the United Nations Secretariat, although they do support the works of the United Nations, they're not the ones actively taking the political decisions. If we really want women to have, no thank you, active political decision-making power, they have to be part of the political decision-making process. That means to be a delegate who's the one voting on resolutions, voting on decisions of various fora. Why all countries? Because we think that these international institutions have equal obligations towards all of their member states. We acknowledge that there are many power disparities within these institutions, but we think that we should always err on the side of treating all states as equally as possibly, as equitably as possible. This is why on our side of the house, we think that this is an obligation that should be imposed on every single state, not on half of them, not on a couple of them. No, thank you. That's not enough. Note at the end of the house, we think that this is an obligation that should be imposed on every single state, not on half of them, not on a couple of them."

We think that although many of these institutions may not have effective decision-making power, they have a lot of symbolic clout. When the United Nations General Assembly convenes, all eyes in the international media are on them. Speeches inside of that forum are broadcasted around the world. In times of an international pandemic, the World Health Organization is no thank you looked at as being authoritative, as being a trendsetter. They're at the top of the global decision-making hierarchy, even if just at an image level. We think that this offers them enormous symbolic power. So we think that there would be an enormous impact if all of these national delegates would be women. Just imagine how Jacinda Ardern coming into the United Nations General Assembly with her baby made so many headlines around the world. Our policy would make even more. This would be the top of the town. What are the concrete impacts? First, at a broader level, we think that this is sending a signal that women are indeed competent and that they ought to take an active role in the decision making process. We think that this leads to more role models for young girls, more empowerment. But secondly, at a national level, we think that in the cases of systematically sexist countries, one powerful role model is enough to deeply shape perceptions. Benazir Bhutto, becoming the prime minister of Pakistan, made huge progress for the perception of women inside of Pakistan because it showed a powerful woman that was able to take decisions on her own. Even in the case of less sexist countries, we think that representatives like Nikki Haley, that ended up becoming the darling of the Republican Party, can still make huge progress for women's representation. So because we want to have women have at least one seat at the table, please vote proposition. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

There are plenty of representation of women delegates within these nations. We also tell you that generally the trend is continuing as social attitudes progress. The proposition team actually brings those attitudes backwards. But we also think they can broadly encourage that the women become, that there are more female delegates. What do we stand for in this debate then? Three main points that I'm going to bring you. Firstly, what principally delegate selection should look like. Secondly, why this massively weakens and delegitimizes these multilateral institutions. and thirdly, how this reflects poorly on women and the feminist movement as a whole. Note that most of my rebuttal will be integrated, but firstly, let's just quickly respond to their principal material about the obligation of these nations to offer them an active state. We have three key responses to this. Firstly, as we already flagged, we think it's untrue that women are always unrepresented in these organizations. In a lot of cases, they are represented. They do have a stake in the decision-making policy as delegates and also as like supporters to those delegates in like diplomatic decisions. They told us about people like Jacinda Ardern. They told us about like general social progressiveness. We think that that continues to exist. Secondly, we think this is contingent on women actually being represented where they wouldn't have otherwise. We think at the point where a majority of nations pull out rather than having a female delegate or don't like only"

              "text": "resentfully create that female delegate, they don't actually have any discretionary power because nations don't actually give them any of that power. Thirdly, we think all of this is predicated on the importance of women in politics. If we prove we get massive backlash towards women in politics and overall decrease their power, that obligation actually becomes more harmful. The comparison to suffrage here was completely crazy. We think that instead of just bringing women to an equal perspective platform, you're actually making them higher than men. That is a greatly different principle obligation. Onto that then, what's our principle obligation in this debate? We tell you what delegate selection should actually look like, two principle frameworks. Firstly, we think importantly multilateral institutions like the United nations are crucial world organizations which broker peace and help countries be able to cooperate just literally decide whether people starve or are saved from famines cooperate in those ways it is fundamentally not a place for virtue signaling because the massive role it plays in people's lives we think the fundamental obligation of these institutions should choose the best possible delegates because they told us that delegates have a role in how those decisions go successfully they told us they do things like negotiation they have discretion we think that at the point they need a wide range of skills when you rule out half of the potential pool that could be chosen you're necessarily locking out the people who could have been good candidates for an arbitrary characteristic they cannot control. At that point, you are not creating, the obligation is not there because you're actually necessarily choosing worse candidates in some cases when you limit that poor general arbitrary characteristic. Second principle framework, though, if you take a purely feminist framework to view this debate, we think this directly contradicts the core values of feminism because it's about raising the status of women to be equal with men. The goal is to open open doors to women not close doors to people who are not women when you do this we think firstly you make one appear less capable of receiving those jobs but secondly if you believe in the tenets of feminism you cannot stand for locking those who aren't men out of these particular positions it is never what feminism stands for and the end of the sin what are the practical harms we see second first secondly"

              "text": "why this massively weakens and delegitimizes these multilateral institutions because as we already told you we think these institutions are incredibly important they uplift people out of poverty they broker peace but they're all in the piece of context that was a failed to be engaged with by the proposition team is that their power only derived from the buy-in of other nations because contrary to what they try to tell you, when the UN comes to a decision, the decision only is followed because of the buy-in of those nations. Additionally, though, we tell you that they're also incredibly unstable. If nations back out, they are likely to collapse. The League of Nations collapsed because it didn't have enough buy-in because of other nations. We think that that is incredibly important. How, then, are these institutions weakened? Firstly, we just think the quality of decisions and the resolutions that they pass will be decreases. Because at the status quo, you have delegates who are both male and female who have years of experience and understanding of nuance, the ability to understand how their country's foreign policy works on a really deep intrinsic level. At the point where you take those people out, and as we already told you, you're not choosing the best possible delegates, that's incredibly harmful because it means the decisions they make are going to be worse. It means that they are less able to respond quickly in a crisis like COVID because they don't have the best possible delegates who have that particular experience because they've completely cut them. Secondly, though, and really importantly, we think they lose all legitimacy. This is something they framed as really important, right? They need to respond to this material. We tell you nations don't buy into multilateral organizations. The only material here was effectively to say, we think they buy in because they really care about the benefits that organizations give them. Why does that not happen? Firstly, we think they probably feel like the policy is worse quality because of the principal material I already gave you. Even if the policy isn't worse quality, they still think it's worse because they have been not able to give delegates that they really cared about and really wanted. Secondly though, we think countries are massively affronted by what they see as an affront to their sovereignty, right? There are two key facets here. Firstly, nations that already contain sexist beliefs additionally aren't creating delegates for women in the first place. We think that they feel like the West is imposing cultural norms on them and are massively angry about this decision. We think this means that they are incredibly angry by the fact that they can't the West is imposing cultural norms on them and are massively angry about this decision. We think this means that they are incredibly angry by the fact that they can't send someone who they agree, especially because these are often religious or cultural practices that the public care about a lot within those nations. That's incredibly important. But secondly, we think even in more progressive nations, they hate an interference in their own policy because we're necessarily telling them that they have to send a particular person when they want to send someone else. Especially, especially we think this plays into the narratives of conservative groups within those nations who often already have some kind of like resentment towards multilateral institutions want to turn away from them are sick of them like meddling in their affairs at the point where you tell them they cannot choose the kind of people they want this is a front of people's basic sense of equality or the ability for anyone to be involved in a decision. We think that means they are far really unlikely to buy into those decisions. There's going to be public outrage that's really harmful. Yes, I'll take you. So you talk about how the UN makes these incredibly important decisions, but then you tell us how nations are just going to pull out because they are forced to place a woman in the national delegation. Which is it? So yeah, so they're incredibly incredibly important right often nations don't recognize the importance of those decisions particularly the public don't recognize the importance of those decisions because they are so affronted by this like massive sense of their"

So where women need the most help, there is no monitoring and influence because they pull out. We also think that nations like the US, which already have animosity towards multilateral overreach, now completely do that, completely do no longer buy into that. It's massively important because as I already told you, these institutions now collapse and can no longer help people, even if they don't do that, right? We think that what happens is they no longer participate in those institutions to the same degree. They no longer fund them to the same degree because there's no public capital behind doing that. Finally, how this really poorly impacts women as a whole. They told us that it's suddenly seen as a role model. We tell you this isn't the case. Firstly, because we think it creates a wider outrage against the feminism movement as a whole. It goes against the tenets of feminism, but affronts people's personal sense of fairness. It also feeds into anti-feminist narratives that they want to shut out men and are man-haters. At that point, you have far less social capital behind those feminist reforms. Women are far less likely to be in other political spheres because they are seen as lesser, as weaker, and not able to deal with men on their own playing field only by shutting men out. At the end of the speech, then, what you have is multilateral institutions that are far less powerful, far less able to do the good work they do but you also have women being perceived as weak and is not capable that's not the kind of world we can stand for on this side of the house"

First of all, they talked about how social attitudes progress and how you have more and more women into the United Nations, into international bodies. First of all, we already explained in our setup, these women exist, but they are far and in between. And mostly, they come from very progressive states, because these states already accept that women should be equal to men, and they do have women delegates. But for most other countries, countries like Africa, Eastern Europe, for Latin America, these women aren't delegates. And even if there are some women delegates, they aren't important. They are used there as tokens. My colleague on the first speaker already explained how there are some women delegates, but they're usually low level. They don't have any decisional power. Side opposition actually agreed. They told us that they assist the actual delegate. This is the role of the women on their side of the house. So please, judges, don't buy their entire rhetoric about the social attitudes that progress. This is an ongoing battle that we have to help in because this is not going to change itself. We won't let side opposition run away with this."

Moreover than that, the second thing they claimed is that institutions lose buy-in because states end up not believing that these institutions are qualitative anymore. The first reason is that they're weakened because there's less quality from the women delegates. I think this is contingent on these women delegates being worse than their male counterparts, which is already a bit shaky. But we're also telling you that because they want to have the best delegates possible, what states are going to do is they're going to train these women in diplomacy. They're going to try to have the best delegates possible. So we're telling you that there's not going to be a loss in quality. So this means that their entire mechanism just falls flat on the ground. Now, the second mechanism they have provided here is that I won't go to the United Nations because I can't put a man there. So my sovereignty as a state is attacked. Let's go back to our setup, guys. We explained how these delegates usually have to play on what their governments want them to do. They don't have full decisional power. They still respect some governmental guidelines. No, thank you. But they do have decisional power when it comes to decision-making. So we believe that the sovereignty of a state is not attacked. The policy that they're going to try to implement is the same. Moreover, I as a government can put whatever woman I want. If I'm the Republican Party, I might want to put a woman like Sarah Palin, that already was the candidate for vice president, but telling you that even the conservatives can have some women that they agree with. So I think that already addressed this entire point about institutions don't lose buy-in, if the response is that my colleague on first didn't convince you.

No, just by having those women in a position of power, we believe we increase representativity. So this is the comparative you have to make. Most governments are controlled by men. Most secretaries are men. Most people in power are men.

When women like Jacinda Ardern are so successful and seen as such good role models because they've been able to rise above the adversity that faces their gender, how does your side of the house still get strong role barriers that most women aren't able to get over that adversity. Moreover, we believe that they still have to face adversity. You're not going to take a random woman off the street and put her at the highest level of international politics. It's going to be a very qualified woman. It's going to be somebody that is an expert in their field. We still believe they face a lot of adversity. We still believe they have a great story if that's what side opposition wants to talk about. Now, my own argument regarding how you have a launching pad for a national political career. And here there are two main things you have to take into account. First, that women generally can't convince political parties to endorse them. Why? Because when political parties look at them and look at their chances, they usually can't see them in a leadership role. First of all, because they might have some intrinsic biases. But secondly, because they generally don't have the CV necessary because of all the adversities that even side opposition wants to admit. What does this do? You have women that were delegates in the most important international bodies that now have the CV to convince the political party, look, I am more than capable. I have the CV necessary. I was already in a leadership position. You can endorse me, which means that it's easier for them. There's less friction inside the political party for them to actually become a political candidate. But secondly, they have to convince the electorate. And here you have three main categories they have to convince. First of all, the progressive have three main categories they have to convince. First of all, the progressive voters that are not going to vote automatically for you just because you're a woman. You have to prove yourself, which means they're going to vote on merit. They're going to vote on your CV. And we believe that representing your country in the biggest international body possible, it's a great CV to have. So you are more likely to win these votes. About the sexist voters, we believe that you won't convince them on either side of the house, but it's easier to silence them the moment that you have this CV. But moreover than that, the moderate voters, which are the majority of voters, the fact that you have a United Nations or World Bank CV is going to be massive for them. This is one of the biggest diplomats inside their own country. What this means is that after these women come back to their country after being a delegate, it's easier for them to start a political career and it's easier for them to change politics inside their own nations. This is why we propose. Okay judges, are we ready?"

This means that you have places like UN Women actively fighting for more women and more minorities to be represented as a seat on the table. This means that we've seen an increased push from the institution itself to gradually shift on the bounds of their own things. This is why countries like China, hardly the progressive beacon that they wanted to point to, now has a woman delegate in the General Assembly.

              "text": "in a world where institutionalized sexism is still a problem, where the men that are going to be selecting these women are still necessarily sexist and still necessarily operate in sexist governments. Even if these institutions don't fall, which I'm going to move on to later in this pledge, why are these people not necessarily going to be the worst? First of all, in countries where men see women as lesser, they're probably going to strip their specific delegates of opportunities to have far more discretion in what they do. This means that you're going to install women from particularly privileged backgrounds who can be controlled by their male staffers to negotiate in ways that they think are specific. Secondarily, we think that these women are going to be removed from negotiating responsibilities and you're going to implement junior delegates in order to do these things. Third of all, we think it's probably quite likely that countries will begin to engage in more bilateral or multilateral negotiations which don't specifically engage with the UN mandates. This means things like, for instance, the US going and negotiating with the African Union unilaterally rather than going through United Nations. This means that even if the UN continues to sustain, at the point you still have systemic sexism, which means that these countries are going to disempower these female delegates, who they necessarily see as less qualified. I'll take a POI right now. Ma'am, there's a huge contradiction in your case. Do we have like a massive progressive trend or do we have this entrenched sexism where even a try to put in more female delegates will make every country lose it and pull back from these institutions? Here's the thing with transition. Transition doesn't happen right away. We think over the next 20, 30 years, it's probably quite likely that the United Nations is going to be far more equal than it is today. What's critical is if you do it right now in this moment where you have people who have unseen feelings of sexism to do something they think is against their morals, you're going to have a massive backlash from them. We think if they begin to learn, begin to become more progressive on their own merits, this does occur. Second of all, why people pull out. They told us it was an intention in our case. They told you that if we said that these bodies are important, then people are necessarily going to stay in them. Why is this not the case? A few reasons. First of all, the United Nations is really important to this world, but it's not particularly important to the most powerful nations, and it's in season particularly important for those individuals who operate under those systems. We're telling these are highly technocratic organizations with relatively opaque operations. Your average worker doesn't really understand what happens in the WTO. Second of all, people really care about sovereignty. They've noticed this wasn't important because people can still decide what things they sign. We tell you it's really key because we're removing half the people who people can operate with. We tell you this is analogous, for instance, for the UN saying that you can't operate in unilateral negotiations between, for instance, Canada and the US US who are just stripping away a bunch of their faculty to engage foreign land. We tell them what this means is that people that don't understand the UN are likely to instead prioritize social issues which they see as really key in their environments. This means more conservative individuals in places like the US caring far more about what happens within their own social system than they do abroad. Finally onto this point about to just point about women, because they don't have points about feminism, but it's parroting the idea that they don't really care about backlash. We brought these three really clear mechanisms that were really important. First of all, it entrenches the position that women in powerful positions are necessarily weaker than men, and therefore must be given a separate pool to sit in rather than being able to compete with the male on their own terms. Second of all, you're going to have wider backlash against feminism, they see it as an overreach as to what's to strictly control international institutions rather than engaging with men. Thirdly, we told you that you're going to have wider backlash and things like multilateral organizations at the point that countries like Saudi Arabia necessarily do not engage with them. This was really crucial because backlash was really important here, Madhav here. Backlash is really important at the point that feminism and feminist alliances are really crucial at pushing things like legislation in the third term. We tell you it's things like backlash that stopped things like the ERA from passing in the United States. It's backlash that stopped women from having access to adequate contraception and adequate birth control. That's really key. And they brought these two bits of analysis. First of all, you would have better role models. As the second speaker acknowledges, no one knows who the people represent. No one knows their names. You're not going to have role models in these opaque organizations which seven-year-olds don't particularly follow. But second of all, this isn't going to be a launching pad because people are just going to see it as a second-rate job. They're not going to see it as an equal thing in a CV as you would, for instance, a normal diplomatic position. Why does this then lead on to the global decision-making system? Because this is mostly covered in my points of clash, but very briefly, it's really key that we represent these opinions. Why are you going to get less opinion represented here? First of all, we tell you that countries are going to prioritize diversity and necessarily going to deprioritize these kinds of issues more broadly. They're going to deprioritize, for instance, having refugee representation. They're going to deprioritize having feminist legislation going through their parliaments. That's really critical in today's debate because we want that representation internally. Second of all, we tell you that men have critical perspectives. Thirdly, we tell you that replacement organizations that are going to spring up in places like Hearts of the Middle East are going to be places where women are systematically excluded as to provide a stark contrast with other countries. And finally, we tell you that you're significantly going to bar women from policy decisions like scholarships because countries are going to backlash against those scholarships, backlash against positions and not offer them in the first place. They systematically fail to prove to you why institutions we see as valid, they systematically fail to win the state ofto-the-side."

Unless you create a full women body, then they won't have the voice that we want them to have. Because other whale delegates will just disregard them, just won't listen to them because they think that, oh my God, a woman cannot be telling us what we as humanity should be doing. All that analysis proves why we need only women to be part of this negotiation process. But note that this also proves that it's very unlikely for a country to change, and all the progressive trend that they're speaking about is very unlikely to happen, precisely because of this point. Because if one country decides to push women as their delegates, the results that they will be having because she was disregarded, because their country's guidelines were unlisted to, and they didn't manage to achieve the purposes that the country has because she was discriminated, A, it's very unlikely for them to continue on doing that, and B, it's very unlikely for other countries to pick up on that trend.

It means that they already are the main voice when it comes to those guidelines that the delegates have. They already get representation on a big level there. However, we have a very specific place in which we could possibly be breaking that. Because we think that you don't have any jurisdiction to impose on a national level, you as an international body, you have no jurisdiction to impose them, to use women in their national consensus and create those guidelines by women. However, you have the power to force everyone to delegate women because it's part of the process of your international body. You are in a very specific place which allows you to break that sexist circle precisely when it comes to the representatives that are presenting those guidelines and that are the ones that are negotiating, right? What does this actually mean? Precisely because we're speaking about, don't panic, I'll take you later. Precisely because we are speaking about representatives, it means two things. A, it's not a meritocratic basis. So it's only like a political appointed person that is the representative. It's not somebody who wins a contest.

It's the head of the state, the person that has all the power of a state. This is literally just patriarchy of a family as the male always takes the decisions and talks for the family just on the biggest level possible. Right. So we think that we've proved that on our second speaker, we've proved that this is also very likely to spread out into the national level and help women in their national politics. So we think that we have a very specific gap that we could be changing to give only women the chance to be the voice of those male-dominated guidelines, that we have the power to be the voice of those male-dominated guidelines, then we have the power to change. We should be taking that opportunity that we're having to be helping women. So at the end of the day, we're thinking that we are the only ones that give a specific opportunity to women to be represented. We don't have any other chance on the comparative on their side of the house."

So it's just a purely political decision. So it has nothing to do with them being. It has nothing to do with our motion. Second of all, speaking of why these countries won't be affected by this, won't be affecting the body. Two reasons. A, it's simply not worth it. So we are facing immense international community backlash because you're no longer part of the UN, which is supposed to be bringing peace to humanity just because women are now your delegates. Second of all, precisely because they need that body in order to have decision-making power and to get the say in the international consensus, It's a huge part of their international power. So they won't be just giving it up just because they will need women. And precisely because they still give guidelines, right? It's not women just going there and taking decisions of what they want. They're still representing the national interest. First of all, because women will be delegates for all countries. So it's not like we're only forcing some of them. And third of all, because you would look like the biggest sexist country if you just withdraw from an international body just because women were your delegates. It would literally look like you are the most extreme sexist country just because you have done that. We think that even Saudi Arabia has women as diplomats, even though they don't give them much power, they keep them as diplomats just to have that international view as they are not so sexist and they want to hide the truth behind them. So it's very, very, very unlikely for a change to exist in the international body. We think that on the level of perception of women, I'll add three things. First of all, just note how important and powerful the message that we send is, because precisely because the normal population won't understand all the legislature behind it, the simple fact that they are seeing that a woman has achieved peace for their country, a woman has settled a huge important loan for the restarting of their economy. Just the fact that they're seeing women having an influence on their daily lives is a huge difference that is going to be happening in their view. Second of all, the comparative is that on their side of the house, women finally have a chance to be seen as capable because on their side of the house, they're already seen as not because on their side of the house they're already seen as not capable of doing stuff in the politics on our side of the house when they have a good result they finally have a chance to show their power you I thank the speaker for that speech and providing the judges are ready."

Two clashes to bring to the house in this debate, oh sorry, three clashes to bring to the house in this debate. Firstly, on the principal obligation which acts in this debate. Secondly, why the multilateral organizations are massively undermined if you implement propositions model and finally the impacts on women in particular feminist narratives and to this principle obligation note this is where side proposition has tried to win this debate down their line by simply arguing as they told you at first they don't care about the practical outcomes at the point where they have better like role models for women under the status quo. No, thank you. So what did they tell you? They told you that these institutions have an obligation to give women an active role here. The analysis was that women are locked out of these institutions, and therefore they're not actually legitimate because they don't represent half of the global population. The second thing they told you, it's the only place where they can actively induce proper representation. In response to the first level of analysis, we think that women aren't locked out of government and bureaucracy in the way that they told you. It's not just 95% men in the UN if you actually look at a picture of what the demographics look like. We think there are general progressive trends, particularly in Western nations, which are pushing for more woman representation. We think, yes, some countries still have relatively conservative beliefs, but there is a general trend, which means we are getting more woman representation. But furthermore, onto this analysis, we think, right, so under the status quo, maybe women face more adversity than men than getting into bureaucracy, and like, therefore, these states aren't, these institutions aren't legitimate. When you are actively locking out men or people who aren't women and saying, you cannot join these institutions, we think they're no longer legitimate"

It's not about locking men out, it's about making women as valuable and as equal as men in society. We think women should be given the opportunity to succeed with men, not just by locking them out of the race. They don't win on role models here, on just this principle analysis, and four, they can't win this debate. Before I move to my second clash, I'll take a POI. Women are all already basically locked out, but even if they wouldn't be, if you don't do it, only women, precisely because these institutions are sexist, you won't have any success and they will be still discriminated. Okay, I completely reject the idea that women are just locked out completely. We just don't think that's true. We've already explained to you about the progressive trends which exist in society. They never told you why these institutions were all just incredibly bad. But furthermore, I think we're happy to stand for changes allowing more women in these institutions. We don't think the pendulum is able to swing to such an extreme and you're going to get any of the benefits"

Furthermore they don't like overreach and where their sovereignty is being imposed. This is particularly in countries which don't follow western norms and values, they're not going to enjoy like a western value of feminism being imposed upon them, and probably going to not be excited for this proposition. Thirdly, we expand on this, and I tell you that some places and people are frankly just sexist, and just don't think women should be given the same opportunities. This is in progressive countries like the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, but also in more conservative countries like Muslim majority countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or the Congo, Somalia. And we tell you the UK pulled out of the EU because of the way they had to label their product, but just because there was less public buy-in into the system. We tell you people are going to be incredibly un-incentivized to engage with this model. What does this mean mean it means that there's way less political capital for states to remain engaged in these institutions even at the point no thank you where they don't pull out of them all together it just means there's less public impetus to like have a massive budget to give to them this means like decreasing your funding in the who not being inclined to send peacekeeping troops to like a particular aid like efforts we think all of this means that you lose the legitimacy of these institutions and you lose their ability to enact actual change in policy we tell you that that's all incredibly important analysis that exists in our side house that they never properly wanted to engage with except just asserting that like oh it's going to look super bad at the point where you pull out we tell you it looks really bad when yemen is the worst country in the world for like how women are likely to be treated but they're not going to change that simply because of the objects which exist in that country countries do things which look bad all the time just for the sake of what their society wants so finally on, onto women.

But on international organizations, again, I've just explained how it simply does not make sense for any country in the world to pull out of the World Bank because they have to place a woman as a delegate in there. It's just a cost-benefit analysis goes against the opposition's own content, right? And last but not least on perception."

But this is a real way in which to show young girls that women can't be part of decision-making processes, to show sexist or rather misogynistic countries that sometimes women can do a good job if you just give them the power to do so. For all these reasons, because we were the most realistic and more reasonable portion of today's debate, we're going gonna win it. Okay, thank you very much for that speech, and I'd like to offer congratulations"

We think that there are structural barriers that prevent women from accessing the same opportunities as males do. Firstly, we think that men have a benefit of the doubt, right? Because when it comes to a prestigious institution, which will represent your country's interests, where you want to have influence as a state, it seems like a rational choice for a state to choose a male delegate over female because sending a male delegate means that you will have an interest get through. You don't want to risk to send a woman because she might get off as hysterical, uncredible. We think that states are thinking that they make a credible choice, a rational choice when they put a male through. Secondly, states want to send delegates who are perceived to have enough experience, knowledge, familiar with high profile political institutions. Just a second. That is why they usually send people who have been experienced with having been ministers in the past, prime ministers. Because women have a hard time accessing those positions locally, they're unable to get the right experience to get the push to be delegates. That's why UN General Secretaries have only been male and never female. Before I go on, the second reason why we think there's a principle of duty to injustices for women, I'll take the POI. So why don't you support just having all politicians be women? We think that it is very hard to solve each state locally different because they have different barriers with which women face. However, I will talk about in my second argument about how thing that it is very hard to solve each state locally different because they have different barriers with which women face. However, I will talk about in my second argument about how we're able to solve those issues locally as well. So secondly, within it, there's a normalized misogyny in the international society, and it's actually highly present in the Western societies, right? Females in power are often seen as bossy and hysterical as opposed to just being the boss. That's why even when you have an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman, a senator is able to call her an F word, B word, and get away with it even though it's highly inappropriate. But in the dismay, even if women are able to get through those obstacles, through those structural barriers which prevent"

But yet on a comparative, as long as men have those positions and as long as there are male-dominated positions, these issues are going to be perpetuated. These issues are going to be very hard to tackle, that's why radical change is necessary. Because status quo is unjust, because it structurally prevents women from accessing the same positions as men do, divorces should be heard, especially at the point at which you have an international level, which impacts women as equally as it does men, we think that we have a duty to give women the access, give them the thing that they need to get representation.

That's why female CEOs, female in local governments are very rare. And as long as this is male dominated, the issues will stay and the misogyny is going to be perpetuated. That's why women are deterred from trying to pursue their careers as CEOs and getting black political institutions, because they know they'll face discrimination, they know they'll face double standards. And this is like give them emotional labor, like constantly worrying about whether when a woman speaks out, if she thinks that she will be seen credible, if she'll get the same credit as her male counterparts do. But even that's why at the point at which we have all female delegates in international institutions, we help to shift those issues in these areas as well. Why? Firstly, we think this directly changes the perception that women cannot be in charge, that they cannot be credibly and cannot do their job in a position of power well. We think this directly challenges that perception in the status quo. But secondly, we think that now less women are going to be deterred from trying to have political careers in the first place because they know they'll be able to get no thank you um that they will be able to get a high position in the uh down the road thirdly within women now we give direct incentives to political elites and parties to give women opportunities because they know that women are going to be their delegates are going to be their delegates, they're going to be someone who represents their interests and their interests. And that is why it is now in their incentive to give women the experience they otherwise wouldn't because they know that these women are going to represent them in an international level. But it's all not comparative. And we have political parties which are never going to, which are very sexist and are never going to accept women amongst themselves. They will now have the representatives to do that, to enforce them. Fourthly, we actually give more experience to women at the point at which they're able to get those positions. Why? At the point at which their mandate as a delegate ends and they go back and try to pursue their political careers locally, they now have more credibility, they are more respectable in their governments, in their societies, thus they're better at like reaching careers and reaching success at home at the point of which they actually already get the experience but they're only able to do that at the point of which we have positive discrimination which gives them those accesses in the first place. We think that on our side of the house, we give direct change of incentives that otherwise wouldn't be present because we give women opportunities on different levels because we give people who otherwise wouldn't, who are otherwise perceived women as incapable, we don't directly give them selfish incentives to give them the opportunities in the first place, but then if we were able to get positive trends, we're directly challenging the narrative that they're unable to be good and credible at those situations. Why do we want to set up a proposition today? Firstly, because we believe the status quo has been unable to change any of the issues women still face today, even though they have equal rights. Secondly, because we think that it's unjust that women have faced structural barriers, that we need something to challenge them. And thirdly, because we're able to give unjust that women have faced structural barriers, that we need something to challenge them. And thirdly, because we're able to give them opportunities that otherwise wouldn't, we're so happy to be on the side of proposition."

The first thing I would note is that there is no real link between the long rant about why sexism exists and that is bad, which is conceivable, and why this demands this particular form of policy. The second thing I would note is that this principle is a wash, right? Because we agree that sexism is bad. We think that's generally because men and women are morally equal and they shouldn't be treated any differently. Therefore, this principle is a wash because they're just replacing one form of sexism with another form of sexism and equally discriminating against men to a massively large degree.

The logic of this is that generally you can improve the perceptions of women because now they're seen as good leaders, which inspires things in the future. Obviously, this isn't the case because these are people who you forced to put in power because you didn't have an alternative. So now these are likely to be seen as tokenistic appointments that are bad, but the government could do nothing better than to put these bad women in place. So it's not likely to be inspiring. It's not like women as people who are meritocratic.

The thesis of this argument is that because these institutions require voluntary buy-in from countries, the backlash to this policy is going to be such that it makes it much harder for them to fulfill their mandates of improving international cooperation, of doing things like getting more economic development. This is important in and of itself because it demonstrates to you that countries are likely to get poorer, that there's going to be more international conflict and strife on their side of the house. But furthermore, it affects every other debate, including women and men, so therefore it outweighs the benefits of feminism. No. Why is this the case?"

              "text": "So the first thing I want to establish is why this policy is likely to have massive backlash, and it's likely to make these international institutions far less popular and legitimate on the ground. First, I think it's likely to be seen as an unfair policy by the vast majority of voters. The vast majority of cases in this debate is either states which are relatively progressive, where they have oppositions to discrimination, and this policy is likely to be seen as massively sexist, or it is the case that these are regressive developing countries where their impacts apply the most. And these impacts are, and this policy is likely to be seen as one which is deeply sexist and likely to be seen as one which is promoting women in a way which is completely unreasonable. Why is this the case? I think it's likely to be the case, therefore, that it's going to be seen as a sexist and male-hating policy, which furthers a brand of feminism that says that we should care far more about men than we should care about men. But furthermore, this is likely to be seen as a wildly unnecessary policy by many people on the ground, because it's probably true that the average male voter who isn't particularly educated isn't aware of all these barriers of sexism. So they just see this as a strange and unreasonable policy to implement. And the fact that most politicians are male is clearly going to play into how they're going to demonize this policy, how they're going to cast it as unpopular, especially because many male politicians probably wanted to serve in these slots and are going to resent these international institutions for imposing this condition on them. This is likely to be seen as a sexist and male-hating policy that's deeply unpopular with voters on the ground, and it's going to be associated with these international institutions as being just ridiculous. But second, it's seen as an imposition on their sovereignty."

At the point at which you impose the narrative that you have to do this to women and that you can only select the females, this is seen as an imposition on the sovereignty of these countries because it's seen as trying to impose feminist goals on them or carry out feminist policies that they otherwise wouldn't have voted for had they been able to implement the delegates they wanted. But furthermore, I would note that in many not developing countries, this is likely to be seen as a cultural imposition by the West, given that feminism itself is oftentimes seen as a Western, a colonial imposition that's foreign to the cultures of these countries. Like, for example, many Islamic countries tend to reject Western brands of feminism. This is likely to be seen as imposing that on these countries, and it's likely to see these institutions as elitist, as not being in touch with the needs of the people. Why is this devastating for the ability of these institutions to carry out their goals? The first thing to note is that in liberal developed states, which fund, stop badgering, which fund the majority of these things, this is likely to be seen as something which is like derives these institutions of legitimacy, right? So people in developed states like the US are probably not explicitly sexist, but because they probably don't think that there's such a problem with sexism because there's laws, for example, that prohibit discrimination in these states. Again, they're likely to see this policy as a ridiculous male-hating and unnecessary feminist extension. I think this is likely to embolden socially conservative movements and movements which fight and argue that these international institutions are not representing our interests or something which is not likely to be effective at forwarding the national interest. So it's likely that you're going to see things like less funding for these institutions or less funding for these institutions because it's going to be seen as funding a radical feminist agenda or institutions or these institutions generally being less popular or less engagement and cooperation with these institutions."

So even if the poor countries want to stay in these institutions this is likely to be devastating for the institutions ability to fill their mandates like lend money. I'll take a point. At a point where countries benefit from those institutions more than the benefit from leaving them, we think they are still willing to take this image of sexism against men and take and accept the very thing. No, because developed countries are the ones which fund these institutions. They don't benefit from them that much. Voters on the ground are going to be asking, why should I be giving the money to the World Bank if it's this radical feminist organization, which hurts developing countries? Finally, I think that progressive states are just likely to pull out. I think it's likely to be the case because it is the case that probably these, it probably is a case that, for example, men are not likely to trust the women in these positions of power, or it's probably likely to be the case that there's going to be massive sexist backlash, or also many of these states just are looking for excuses to be able to pull out anyway. Like, for example, they don't want to be part of the Human Rights Council because of the fact that it holds them to account. And this gives them a perfect excuse and an ability to justify to their voters why that is a legitimate thing for them to do. So it makes these institutions far less effective, far less impactful on the ground. Why is this terrible? It means that you hurt the ability of things like the World Bank to be able to pursue things like, for example, giving loans to countries because they have less money, which means more poverty and less of an ability to implement feminist policies on the ground. It means less accountability for autocratic governments that have an ability and a way to justify perfectly now to their population why it is the case that we shouldn't be part of these"

They cannot say that positive discrimination would actually harm it because there is no fairness in the status quo.

If you are, I don't know, USA, China, Germany, I know Germany, not France, Britain, anyway, anyone who is the security council, you have a very great incentive to be in un because being in security council means that you have a vast legislative power over all other countries secondly if you are germany and you earn a lot of money from the loans that you give to the countries through the world bank you have a great incentive to be in the world bank because you need the money in order for no thank you for your um for your market actually to work which means i have given you two structural reasons why very very likely to get in because you have incentive to be so. But secondly, we see no reason why you actually would have such a backlash from the people when you have such a model imposed. Why? Because especially in the West... Point of information. No, thank you. We are seeing the rise of the MeToo movements, of the movements for the women's rights. We believe that women in general, I mean, people, voters in general, support the female rights and thus they will not get any backlash from that. But all the racist politicians, sexist politicians that there are, are very much going to set aside just as the way this one man calling Cortez fucking bitch will have to sooner or later. So before I move on to my constructive, I would like to have the PR. Like clearly Germany and the US are not the developing countries who are likely to pull out. Please engage in the argument instead of strong out. Okay, so please, half of your argument was talking about how we are having developed countries pulled out, which was your greatest impact on those whole UN institutions, because otherwise you have no impact as to the amount of money being there at the point of which USA is the one giving the most money into the UN or stuff like that.

              "text": "clarifications that have to be taken into account. Firstly, why women there are unlikely to get into these positions. Very same reasons that have already been pointed out in our first argument, but still. Firstly, because they really cannot apply for these positions. They are simply because they are female and their sometimes characteristic to apply for a delegate is to be male. Secondly, because you cannot never be a minister there, because no one will vote you in because there is such a sexist state, right? So if you want to be a delegate and you have to have some sort of prerequisite of being a minister in that country, you cannot apply for that because you wasn't a minister. But thirdly, because even if none of the practices were actually structurally sexist, no one who is actually deciding who is to be a delegate will approve of a woman at the point to which he A, is sexist, or B, fears the public backlash because he made a woman a part of the delegation despite the fact that the whole country is sexist. So this first thing has to be clear. But secondly, why do we believe that countries will, despite the fact that they are so misogynistic, going to comply and give the female delegates, despite the fact that they are so misogynistic? Three reasons. One, because they get a lot of international recognition through being a part, for example, of the United Nations. Because you now, if you are India, and you are afraid of losing some shred of border because China is attacking you, you have to have some sort of international recognition. You have to have some diplomats, some ties with other countries to protect you. Secondly, because you get money, for example, from the IMF, which is a part of the World Bank. You cannot get the funds that Afghanistan dearly needs in order not to have people starving all over the world, to have hospitals and education built if you do not be a part of World Bank. But thirdly, you cannot get foreign aid from the WHO organization at the point of which you're not a part of it. So in the end of the day, what we have is that they have clear very great incentives to stay in. That's why they will give that female delegate to at least not have anarchy in their countries. So with that in mind, three major benefits that we have, why it's good to have female delegates in these countries. Firstly, you have to realize that simply the appointment of the female delegate sends a message of empowerment to the world. A, because simply the position of a delegate is a powerful position. It's just the title itself gives the power to the women. But secondly, when the government has to portray, when a government makes a woman a delegate, it has to portray it as powerful. Why? Because if you are Saudi Arabia king and you want to have domestic legitimization of your own rule, you have to make clear to all of your people that the representatives you are sending to the world are strong and powerful, are the lines that are going to get the Saudi Arabian, I don't know, legislation through. That is why you will now have to portray this woman as strong, rational, and not as fragile and submissive as it is supposed to be according to your rule. Why is that beneficial? Why? Because you now cannot say and justify not letting women into football games in Saudi Arabia at the point to which you are letting them to sit in the councils. This also looks like Afghanistan girls actually getting some sort of powerful message that they can do things and not only follow the instructions and be submissive. But thirdly, because also males change their perspective because they're not seeing their wife that they were previously beating only as submissive, but as some rational creature that they have to follow. So the takeaway of this argument is that we are actually changing the perception of females there. That is why we are getting some sort of benefit that they are in no way. Thank you very much. Thank you. And the Philippines to continue their case."

It isn't just having policies that benefit women, although that's something you were able to get on both sides of the house. But second, where you're actually able to get more representation and get more feminism and get more buy-in for the feminist movement. Because on their side, note how their one policy is representation by force. But what they have to prove to you is why this representation is actually going to result in more buy-in from governments on the ground and from people on the ground."

              "text": "I'm going to start with my responses to Team Slovenia before moving on to my contribution in this debate. First issue, note how the one thing that their first speaker talked about was that all of a sudden, governments are going to start funneling all this new resources in order to have more women that are educated or have more things for women. But this was completely asserted. Never did they give you a reason as to why this is in the interest or incentive of states, especially states who probably aren't happy that now they have to replace all of these men who perhaps had better degrees or something, no, with women. And what they had to do was prove to you, one, that there's an incentive for states to do this, but second, that most states have a capacity to do this. Because note how the most vulnerable states are states that actually don't have the capacity to now have schools that allow women or that allow more women to access education or all of these other things. Note how most countries do not have the capital to significantly increase the money going towards policies that are specifically for women. And the problem is that they did not engage with the analysis coming from my first speaker. Because what did he tell you? He told you that even if these states do, it takes a significant time lag. And here's why this is important. Because at the end of the day, international organizations have an obligation not just to women, but other vulnerable groups on the ground, people that are going through poverty, people that are caught in the crossfires of war. And the reason this is important is because if your representative in the United Nations, in the World Bank, in the IMF, is not the person that is the most qualified, but rather the person that you had to put there because of this policy, what happens is that there's a significant time lag until poor countries or less developed countries are able to have women that are able to fulfill this role to the same capacity. And no, that is not to say that women are less capable than men, but in countries where women haven't had education right now, there's a significant time lag until you get women that have access or have capital to equal amounts of education. No. Next, will states or will they not opt out of these organizations at the point at which you implement these policies? Note how all their examples are states that are developed. They said Germany, France, and the USA. These aren't the countries that are the most vulnerable. These aren't the countries that we're talking about. We are very clear. We said countries that are historically patriarchal, that have significant cultural and religious beliefs, countries like the UAE, countries like Saudi Arabia, are unlikely to succumb at the point at which they literally have to put all the political decisions of their state in the hands of women, regardless of if that women is just or not. Note that there are states that are going to be completely unwilling to do this. And here's why this was really, really important in this debate, because these are probably the countries that need the most intervention of the UN, that need the most intervention of international bodies in the long run. But at the point at which people are not as receptive, I will let you know when I'll take a point, are not as receptive, I will let you know when I'll take a point, are not as receptive of these organizations, that's where you do not have the ability of these organizations to actually be successful in the long run. I just want to call out the disgusting lack of response coming from team proposition. Two things. We were very clear. We said that feminist institutions are seen as male hating. So at the point at which you have major institutions that are the backbone of starting small grassroots movements in the long run are associated with things like radical feminism, that's when the perception of these organizations becomes illegitimate. And the reason this was important is because my first speaker explained to you that that's when you have people on the ground that are less receptive to the UN. I said I will let you know when I'll take a point. That are less receptive to the UN coming in and starting initiatives. That's when you have people that are less receptive to the idea of the state building girls-only schools or having schemes that only benefit women. I think what Proposition had to engage with, that all international organizations have some sort of failure. And this was completely unresponded to coming from second proposition. The idea that these institutions will have failure, but at the point at which you have states that did not want women leading them in the first place, what's likely to happen on their side of the house is you have them pinning this failure on these women. And the reason this is important in this debate is because note how all of their mechanisms are dependent that all of a sudden magically the perception of women will change. But at the point at which these institutions pin their failures on women, that's where you double down on existing perceptions, even if they're not true, because failures happen on both sides of the house. But what these institutions are likely to do is say now this is a failure, not of the institution, but of the women leading it. I'm going to have one contribution in this debate. I'll take a point before that. If there's no point, I'll move on. Okay."

              "text": "My contribution is very important. It's about how you increase male capture of powerful positions within nations. The thesis of this is simple. Panel, recognize that making all delegates of these organizations women does necessitate that you then remove all the men that were in these positions in the first place. Because note that they don't just like disappear into the ether. What they do is then go down and occupy powerful positions within states. The reason this is really, really important is because their entire case is contingent on one thing, the ability to change perceptions. But we think that perceptional changes are more likely to happen at the point at which you have women in local positions. And the reason this is important is note that most little girls and little guys don't know which person is representing them in the UN or in the World Bank. But what they do know is who their mayor is. What they do know is who their congresswoman is. What they do know is the person leading local institutions that they're aware of. This is where you're able to make changes at the point at which you do not have men capturing, no, you do not have men capturing the existing political positions right now because they are angry that they were pushed out of the positions they held in these institutions. Why is this likely to happen? We think that this policy does two things. Firstly, it creates perceptional pressure on state governments that have these men that are now kicked out of their jobs that are probably equally as qualified or that are probably very, very qualified. So what they do is they have these men in now positions of mayors, of governors, of political advisors or heads. The very CEOs that Proposition was so concerned about is now more likely to be male dominated at the point at which there's a perception that women are taking away these jobs. But second, that there's a political pressure to increase the availability of jobs to these men. What are the impacts of this? Twofold. It's that even if you have women in international organizations, you are still dependent on local governments to implement these policies. So given the state and individuals on the ground perceive these institutions as radically Western or radically feminist, states are less likely to be willing to implement these policies. But second, it means that men have more power over policies that implement women. This is really, really important because you have less support for things like affirmative action policies, you have things like men making decisions that women are probably more capable or more effective in making decisions on. When you have more women and more men in the cabinet, more men in the presidential administration, more men in political positions, you have more men deciding things like sanitary health things that impact women. You have more men deciding policies about abortion that impact women and more men that are deciding policies that they probably do not have as much knowledge about. Why is this important? We think this is important because we win on the two metrics we set in this debate. Firstly, the extent to which institutions are effective in fulfilling their role, but the extent to which you get the perceptional benefits that proposition cares so much about. We think equality is not zero sum, oppose."

First of all, note that their impact is contingent on the fact that local positions actually determine how the resources from the UN and IMF are distributed. This is a blatant lie because IMF and the UN are the ones who tell you how to spend this money. They are the ones who have literally mechanisms of enforcement, but they send inspectors to their country. And if you're not spending it well, they take your money away. So even if we buy into their analysis about how we get less women in local positions of power, we still have a greater impact at a point where those institutions are able to provide more things for women, which they are more likely to, because when you have more women in positions of power, they are likely to care about female education, or even if not about female education, they are likely to care about femicides like they happen in Mexico. However, secondly, why we don't buy their analysis on why we get less women. Firstly, because we don't see why necessarily you're picking out mayors in order to send them to UN Security Council or any other body, because you probably want to pick people like ministers, like other politicians. So even if we buy into their local analysis, we still have a substantial amount of local politicians that are able to do those things and are able to do things thirdly even if we don't buy into this analysis we still think we are winning at the point where we change and their response here is because you know we don't know who your un general assembly member is women won't care that much when it comes to this empowerment point but we think this is simply"

So now, with this in mind, let's talk about institutions and where are those international institutions are. First of all, as I have already mentioned, we don't see the impacts they are talking about in status quo. States don't leave UN Council because they disagree with certain policies. Why is this so? Because states are certainly more likely to have the UN Security Council seat or UN General Assembly seat where they can vote on any resolution possible than to take these harmful policies that they don't like in the first place. Secondly, Iana tells you that countries like Germany actually make lots of money when they lend money to Greeks who need this money in order to recover their economy. Those two incentives were never engaged by the side of opposition, apart of some accusations how we never explained them. We think they should do it in third up. Or secondly, we tell you that we are willing to, that we think that in general, autocracy, sexist or democracy, democracy, sexist or progressive care more about the money and benefits they get from those institutions than any gender empowerment policies. Lastly, we tell you that we don't see why the backlash would be so big that it would be unable to promote any of those policies in the first place.

With this, we already engage with their metric of the debate, where they want to talk about general benefits, even though this is not a debate. We think at this point it's a wash, because on both sides of the house, the thing is the same, and it's a wash if we take them at their best. However, why do we still win the debate?"

Look, they never really care enough to engage with our principle, where EMA tells you that there are structural reasons why women are not represented in those positions. Why is this so? Because women do not get jobs in the first place. They don't get prime minister positions, or there are very few women who were prime ministers in the status quo. This is why they are less likely to get into those jobs, because it's a higher barrier of entry for them. Because when you have less female prime ministers, it means that you can send less female prime ministers to be UN General Secretary. At the end of the day when you give more... No, I... I'll take it in a second. We believe that this is something that they never engage with and this is the discrepancy we're fixing and then they come here and say just different form sexism. No, it's called positive discrimination that we want to put women in those positions of power in order to allow them the benefit on the long run, the obvious reason. Okay, if you're talking about countries where women aren't even in positions of politics, then you're just feeding into the idea that you're going to increase the perception of tokenism, that the women are to blame for failures of these institutions. You're just biting into our impacts. Okay, first of all, this is a practical impact. I will talk more about this later. However, this doesn't take out our principle. We think in general more women in those positions is already better because there's actually disadvantage to get into those positions in the status quo. This is not a practically contingent argument.

We tell you, yes, it's not going to happen immediately, but it's going to happen on the long run because those parties will want to capture those important positions, meaning they're more likely to invest into female education, more likely to invest into things like women actually getting important positions in order for them to fill those positions. We think this is a benefit at the point when you show little girls they're capable of more than just cooking at home and making their husband sandwiches. We think that this is already a benefit on our side. But secondly, it's even more impactful when it comes to misogynist states, something that Yana talked about and they never really engaged with. Because in states like, I don't know, Saudi Arabia, it's really hard for the regime to justify why women should not travel alone at the point where they have a female UN representative in the first place. When you have those women in positions of power, you cannot justify micro levels of aggression and oppression that happen in those countries. This is something the OPC has failed to engage with in their two speeches. And this is the main thing in this debate, ladies and gentlemen. Because yes, we might both care about the general effectivity of those institutions, but ultimately it's more important to care about the most oppressed actor in this debate. And those are the women. Even in Saudi Arabia, women are more oppressed than men. They have less agency. We care about them more. So we are willing to bite the bullet and take the trade off if we take them at their best. We win this debate because, one, we show that it's better for women in Western society because perception improves.

These just get dropped in favor of some mitigation. We told you that what happens to the institutions is that firstly, you embolden xenophobic movements. That means that you get less funding. And secondly, that some countries are likely to pull up. How do they then respond? In second prop, what they say is that they're likely to comply for three reasons. Because like argued through example, because there's some international recognition, because money from the IMF and because foreign aid. Guys, these are just examples. These are not structural reasons why they're unlikely. But moreover, notice that these are different organizations. So fine, the US won't cut funding to the UN Security Council, but if it is an institution that it doesn't benefit from, so for example, if it doesn't need the World Bank or if it doesn't need the Red Cross to the same extent, it reduces funding for them. So what happens then is that the rest of the countries who rely on these institutions are screwed. But secondly, notice that this doesn't respond to the analysis that we gave you from second off about time lag, the fact that you won't have representation for a specific point in time and at the point at which there are countries that need to erect institutions in order to get these women educated enough to go in. So what that means is that lots of developing countries, even if we accepted their best case that they would stay in these institutions, just would not have a representative for a long amount of time. And that means that that lots of developing countries, even if we accepted their best case that they would stay in these institutions, just would not have a representative for a long amount of time. And that means that they don't get a say in allowing the UN to enter into their country. They don't get a say in allowing the World Bank to give them loans and all of these kinds of things. That is terrible for their case. But finally, from third point, strawman this and decide to say that it's contingent on them leaving. No, it's not contingent on them leaving, guys. Please stop strawmanning and actually engage with the case. What we told you is that it not contingent on them leaving, guys. Please stop strawmanning and actually engage with the case. What we told you is that it's contingent on the backlash existing, which can take place in many forms. So it might consist of leaving in some instances, which is terrible, and they still haven't engaged with that brisk case. But the second thing is that in other instances, it might look like simply cutting funding. So what that means is that even if the largest countries don't leave, what happens is that these international institutions significantly lose a large portion of the money that they need to be able to provide medical equipment and supplies or military aid to the most vulnerable countries. But next, notice that even if we accept that countries have an incentive to stay within these institutions, that doesn't necessarily mean that they will. Brexit, ladies and gentlemen, the UK largely benefited from the EU's existence. It still left anyway because it acknowledged the xenophobic rise of things like the refugee crisis that meant they had to take in more refugees. That goes to show you the power of the individuals within these countries, which was the mechanism that we relied on on the ground level facing backlash against these refugees. On their side, it's just going to be women, which means that they are likely to pull out at that point in time. So even if we took them at their best case and conceded that there were incentives to stay in, it was just far more likely that these institutions, that these countries weighed the incentives to appeal to the people and to appeal to the backlash, which meant they were still more likely to pull out at that point in time. So notice that our harm is still standing, and it's incredibly harmful in this debate. But next So notice that our harm is still standing and it's incredibly harmful in this debate. But next, notice that they dropped the completely developing countries"

So what this means is that on the other side of the house, it is far more likely then that the UN and the other institutions lose the ability, and like the ICC, lose the ability to hold these countries to account. But even in these instances at our very worst, where they don't, it is far more likely then that you've still caught funding for institutions like the World Health Organization, which means they're less likely to be able to provide things like medical equipment for developing countries.

What we told you is simply that it was far more important to save the lives of lots and lots of individuals, even if it came at the cost of some individual's quality of life. Because notice that in the vast majority of cases, the women who probably were likely to get into power were already significantly privileged at that point in time. What we told you is that you hurt the most vulnerable individuals who have no recourse to these international institutions at the end of the day. So we don't. At worst, we've proven that we've proven that you significantly cut funding, people die because the international institutions cannot fulfill their function to the same extent. At best, we've proven to you that these countries pull out and even if they have funding, they lose the ability to significantly manifest back. So the argument stands, even if it's mitigated, it's still a winning impact. Second issue then. So notice that even if we concede unique benefits to women and feminism, we already win this debate. But I will engage with that in my second issue and prove why we win that. I'll take a point first. Look, why are those policies on our side of the house so structurally different than policies in the status quo that don't cause cuts in funding from the states they're talking about? Wait, sorry, could you repeat that? Yeah. So in status quo, we have UNICEF funding things like menstrual cups for women in Algeria. Why is this structurally different than our policies that states don't pull out in status quo, that they don't cut funding in status quo, but they will on our side of the house? Because the difference is that men still get a say. That was the analysis we gave you from first off that did not get a response. That was the analysis we gave you from first off that did not get a response."

Notice that their quote-unquote principle, just that women are oppressed, therefore we owe them reparations, did not prove why this was the necessary form of reparations.

So what did they tell you? They gave you four things about why you lessen sexism. They told you about perception. They told you it encourages other women. They told you there's an incentive to give women power. And finally, they told you about credibility. One, notice none of these incentives are actually exclusive to their side of the house. At the point where they concede in second prop that you have things like the MeToo movement on the rise, that means that we probably have and other movements within a lot of countries that probably means that you get these same incentives anyway.

That is the analysis we gave you from second off that did not get response. They say that at the point where women are in power, they're going to care and therefore implement policy. But notice with opposition too, that women not being in local positions means that even if the women who are in power in these international institutions impose policy, it's unlikely that you're going to get any follow-through from the local governments who are misogynistic and opposed to these women. But finally they say that we have local politicians on their side in order to mitigate this. One, I thought your frame was that there were no local politicians and therefore that was the extent of your harms. But two, there's a spectrum of countries that clearly we win. What we've proven to you in this debate is that we win the issue of feminism, and that means that we win their metric. But even if we don't, we win the more important issue of having women, of not having war crimes, and of not having the WHO fail. I'm very proud of us. Thank you. you Sorry, one second."

Firstly, you protect the ability of institutions to fulfill their mandates. Two pieces of analysis under this and weighing. First, Prop makes a deadly concession. They say, ah, but not all countries have women that are capable, have women in political positions. And this is where they absolutely demolish their own case in this debate. So what they concede then is they concede that the women in these countries that perhaps don't have as many qualified women in politics right now are going to be the very women representing them in the UN, which buys into our biggest impact that you do not get the perceptional benefits on their side. At the point at which these institutions and states are willing to blame women for these institutions failing, at the point at which they blame women not being good enough, not being experienced enough, not having the capacity in the same way that men do, you do not get any of the benefits that their entire case is contingent on. But second, at the point at which the most patriarchal states pull out, it is the most vulnerable women that you leave behind. So even if we accept that these institutions have a significant obligation to women, it is these very women that you leave behind. Because states that we, and. Both sides conceded this by the end of this debate. This is crucial because it means that the very women in the worst, the most patriarchal, the most misogynistic countries are the countries that are likely to pull out because they do not want to have their policies dictated by women. So it means in countries where there's oppression, in countries where there's not enough education, in countries where it's men deciding the laws that impact women, you do not have the ability of the United Nations or the World Bank or other institutions to intervene. But the fact that you maximize, secondly, the ability of movements for equality to be viewed as legitimate. This was the very metric that propositions set up for this debate. The only response they had to our extension was, oh, no, that's not true. There's no women in politics. They had to engage. Because if they want to talk about representation, oh no, that's not true, there's no women in politics. They had to engage because if they want to talk about representation, that only happens when you have women in local politics. That does not happen on their side where men capture local organizations and local politics. We are very clear. We said equality is not zero sum, oppose."

Two things. Firstly, we think we actually gave you, in first proposition, mind you, structural reasons why these countries now have selfish incentives, rational decisions, why they are likely to pull women in positions of power. Because it means that at the point of which you just educate your women and you give them better representation and you give them the experience at the cost of losing your seat in the Security Council, losing the loans that you need to boost your economy, we think that this is a trade-off they're likely to make at the point to which it caused some international representation influence on the global scale. But secondly, we think that they also talk about how the status quo is a lot more liberal and how there's need to and how there already are positive changes, that this model is unlikely to be effective. It's unclear to me then why is there this backlash likely to happen? Why are people likely to think this is going to be a man-hating principle? Secondly, about how we improve female opportunities, right? Because again, it's absurd to me how they talk about how women will now have better local representation because now the male delegates are able to play in the big game. But the status quo doesn't tell you this, right? Women don't get those representation in the patriarchal societies. Why? Because if you want a delegate that has knowledge, expertise, which is familiar with how political institutions work, they need to have experience. That is why they take most of the positions of mayor and local representatives. That's why I gave you in the first argument the structural reasons why this is exactly the reason why females are likely to get more experience locally as well, because countries realize that they are going to be the ones who are going to represent them in the international scale. Does they want to be able for them to have those experiences to be able and efficient in doing that, right? We think that this is like in order to have a justifiable delegate, you need to give them experience."

Because Ayanna tells to you, in order for patriarchal societies to have women representatives, they have to change the inherent perception that women aren't able to be in position of power. That is exactly why, even when third opposition talks about how only privileged women are at best going to be able to get those positions, in order to get those women in the position where they're unable to get those opportunities in the first place because society deems them as less capable in having those positions in the first place. But secondly, we talk about how when we give them the opportunity, the push to go to the international world, they're able to push for legislation that is going to benefit women in the long term. We think that this is largely the benefit as a whole, the side of opposition never engaged with. Why do we take this out of the debate at the end of the day? Firstly because we are actually addressing the real problems in the status quo. Women are unable to get any representation because of the inherent sexism that is facing their issues because we're actually giving practical impact, because we're actually getting to the status quo.

You do, you have institutions which sometimes end end up having female leaders but this cannot be solved by a bottom-down approach where you simply hope that countries are going to be sending female representatives so we acknowledge that there are a few women but they're too little and not enough to solve the issues structured so that means that any kind of policy i'm going to talk about depends on the goodwill of oppressors you need the men in power in institutions like the un to dictate policy, to frame issues in the perspective of women that is not good enough. But second, what do the information look like? They're characterized by wielding significant power. They dictate policy both globally and regionally, and they often are characterized by a large bind across the region. Organizations like the World Bank, the IMF, and the UN. Third, female country delegates would look like representatives that portray the interests of their own country. We think there's a surplus of qualified individuals that end up pencil-pushing that would otherwise now have a seat as delegates. They would then have an autonomy over voting of issues. They're able to lobby individually or collectively. They're able to bring up issues within these institutions. Finally, this wouldn't be for all time. This representation would only exist until we're able to get a modicum of redress. That is that within states, you have the issues of women being catered to both globally and regionally. Two burdens then. One, that this policy is in the obligation of international institutions. Two, that this helps women across the world. You're going to hear two arguments in my speech."

Shanti will give you a third argument as to how this helps women in your central figures of power. Before I move into my first argument, I'll take the point. Your point, sir? Yes. How likely is Saudi Arabia to let a woman speak for their country? That is irrelevant in the scope of this debate. If they don't want to send a representative, we'd simply be fine with that. In the majority of instances, we think that fine exists. First argument then as to why there's an obligation by international institutions. And here, notice the nature of these associations and the way women are specifically shut out and the reason it can't be solved. That is because there's a stereotype conception of what these organizations need to look like, that you need to be authoritative, that you need to be strong. Things that are fed off the patriarchy that was allowed to exist, that are pushed by men, that are unable to be broken by individuals. That means in that way, the comparative they need to defend is a structural exclusion in terms of women that are simply unable to get into the majority of instances and even when they are, they're unable to unable to make change first why does this obligation exist what's the information really way these international institutions were structured and created institutions like the un and the world bank were created with the precedent that you wanted to make the work if there is that you didn't want the inequality that perpetrated across the world to exist to prevent that kind of conflict in that instance the severe inequality that exists in terms of women not getting policy that serves their interests, not being pandered to as a structured form of failure. But second, women have been failed in other ways as well. They've been actively excluded in every single country from these structures of power. They've been denied the vote, so they were unable to be a part"

              "text": "that made their lives better in the aftermath. But third, institutionally, they were failed as well. In terms of institutions like the UN, they were actively negligent in ensuring that there was policy that served the interests of women. They enabled the oppression to continue with the negligence is just as culpable. What does that mean? It means that in this instance, you are predicated to do information to redress the harms you exactly the fact that they've been excluded the fact that their interests have not been catered to that your women literally being raped in india because you as an institution fail because we can see that they cannot go into these countries and force them to change their policy that means the next best thing is to ensure that structurally they change their policy because they want to buy in to is to ensure that structurally they change their policy because they want to buy into the UN. But second, there's a vicarious responsibility that attaches from the fact that these institutions have significant power and power. That means it's not good enough to stand on the sidelines and depend on the goodwill of the oppressor in individual states to fix the system, to give women that kind of redress. But finally, why is this information this is a global issue every single woman in every single state has been collectively feared by the world as a whole but second female disenfranchisement is disenfranchisement of a majority it's literally like 51 percent of the population across the world that is inexcusable in any instance so therefore categorically what they require as recompense is being re-included within the system, being given that say they can only be achieved when you have 100% of women within these systems. And that means that in Dehava, the comparative they need to defend is that continued exclusion. But second argument then as to how this helps women on the ground. But I just want you to know that buy-in is likened to these institutions, irrespective of what goes on. That is because buying into organizations like the UN, the EU and the World Bank have a significant amount of benefits that accrue because of it. An inclusion in trade deals, the access to a nuclear umbrella, the veto power, the fact that you have a seat at the table as to when policy is dictated. So countries are going to have to buy in regardless. What does that mean first in terms of policy? Because we can see that you might have some men who claim to speak for men. But even in those instances, these structures are inherently patriarchal, so there's very little benefit for them to actively continue to lobby for women. But second, even if that were true, that they cared about women and knew about their issues, even in those instances, women are a secondary priority. But there are other issues that take precedence. So catering to women is often at the bottom of the list when you're figuring out what kind of intervention you want to do in sub-saharan africa but second even if they say that there are some women in politics currently they are blocked out because they're unable to gain traction because they don't consolidate enough mass but because there's also a normative perception that they're unable to make this kind of change that means uniquely in our world the comparative you get is one where women dictate what kind of policy gets passed, where they have the pulpit to decide which issues get discussed, where you're able to send funding to women and highlight their oppression. But second, you normalize having women in power. That is when you see women representing your country, the normative message you then send is that women are capable of succeeding, that they can lead. But notice that this ties into national pride. So even in countries like Saudi or Sri Lanka, that might be sexist. The fact that you have a nationalist pride built up on your representative means you are proud of your representative when they succeed, if they give a good speech in the UN, for instance. That internal policy shift means you're likely to get more support from men, more buy-in from men as well. But what is the impact of this? The impact is you have a massive consciousness raising. More women on the street are likely to rally around figures of power. We are likely to see this change as being able to happen. There is more buying in the part of men as well. Ultimately then locally you engineer better policy, globally you engineer better policy that caters to their needs for all these reasons proposed. Propose."

Because I think there is a litany of things that we can support and we can say we would rather happen than this motion, right? We think that can look like affirmative action to get more women into the United Nations. We think that can look like more affirmative action to get women higher up, both in domestic politics and international politics. We're really happy for that to happen. It might look like funding and schemes, as already exist, to improve women's education and financial support worldwide, whether that's politically through the UN or financially through the World Bank, through various different things that exist there. It might also look like more diplomatic pressure on countries that currently have unequal rights for women in order to get them more on board with women's rights. We prefer these for two reasons, no thank you. Firstly, we tell you that this actually solves the root issues that tend to drive sexism, that tend to drive institutionalised patriarchy, because it starts to deal with the fact that so often women are seen as less qualified because they're not given opportunities or because they're not given the capital to be able to succeed, right? We think that is far preferable to lift up all women, to use these kinds of schemes, this kind of action, this kind of pressure, in order to lift all women up rather than just uplifting those women who are already at the top of the political sphere, who have already been able to navigate that patriarchy, right? We far prefer that as a mechanism. But secondly, we just tell you on a very basic level, these other alternatives don't provide the active harms of completely locking all men out of these organisations.

              "text": "quite self-evident when we look at how massively draconic and radical a move this is, something which really hasn't been sufficiently justified by the Prime Minister and something that we're going to talk a lot about throughout my speech. So onto this substantive case of why the motion is catastrophic for both global politics and for feminism. So we ask like, what is the current position of global feminism? We think it's not great, but it's also really varied, right? Because there are some countries, particularly in places like Western liberal democracies, where feminism is generally more accepted. There tends to be more female leaders, but institutionalized patriarchy still massively exists, right? There is still a massive extra level of scrutiny for female politicians and public figures. There is still a massively institutionalized lack of opportunities for women. We think in far worst case scenarios, there might be political systems where women don't have the same rights still, and like are much more like directly and harmfully discriminated against and not given opportunities and like just given really bad like opportunities, right? But then let's look at the contemporary political outlook on NGOs, because we don't think it's great, right? We don't think people at the moment are becoming more and more aware of how brilliant and wonderful NGOs are, right? We are living since the post-war consensus in an unprecedented time of skepticism of the international order, right? This looks like Trump wanting to pull out of loads of different international organizations when America has previously been one of the biggest supporters. This looks like the UK leaving the European Union. This looks like massive skepticism of internationalism and growing nationalism and belief in the corruption of the institutions and their inherent flaws, right? That is the point at which we take issue with the proposition line of why countries just have to buy into these institutions no matter what they say, because they're very important. Even before these institutions have taken such controversial political views as they propose, there is still massive skepticism and massive desire within these countries to pull out of them, to withdraw funding, to just not buy into them as much. That's the point at which we see they are already on a really, really shaky footing, one that proposition completely removes, right? Yeah, I'll take PY. The other solutions that you've talked about in the beginning of your speech have existed for decades, but yet we see a vast disproportionate amount of women in the UN. Why is that the case? Okay, right. Like, we'd be really happy to step those up and like put more funding into them, right? We think we are able to propose under our side that doing that is just a better solution than the massive one that you propose. We would prefer to do that, right? So how might countries therefore react to this motion, given that like there are so many different like barriers to their buy-in and to their buy-in to feminism, right? We think that they just likely see this as like a final straw of these global institutions, given that patriarchy and sexism are so baked into these countries. We think it is so unlikely that they take well to the idea that now they have to send women to these institutions and there's this really radical move to completely eliminate men from the process, right? There's a sliding scale of reactions to that, but it might just look like total withdrawal, right? Especially in countries that we want to be really involved in the international process, especially countries like Saudi Arabia, like Iran, that are going to be so, so unhappy and reluctant to allow a woman to speak for the whole country and be the representative of that country in the international community. That is just not something they're going to tolerate. It is really likely they pull out of these institutions. It might just look like even less funding, further scuppering the institutions and allowing them so much less ability to actually change things, ability to actually fund more women's projects and that sort of thing. It looks like less buy-in. It looks like the fact that Iran is now just less happy to negotiate nuclear deals and is probably just going to walk away from the table and not see these as viable institutions because its political capital has been so undermined. Because we give you a global order that is massively undermined by the propositions"

Because the vast majority of their harms about countries pulling out are based on the fact that you will not have buying to this policy. Why do we think buying will exist? One, because of the immense benefits that exist when you are part of an international organization, because you have access to economic ties and trade with other countries, because you have access to diplomatic pressure in order to insulate your own country, for example, from things like military interventions. I think the opportunity cost associated with not being a part of this organization doesn't really match up to just having to have like one female delegate. I mean, come on panel, it's not that hard to just have one woman in power for once. But secondly, this is just an argument against having any change at all, because to the point at which you try to have any reform in these international forums, there's going to be some amount of of backlash that's something that we need to learn to deal with and this has happened in the past when you set referendums like they very rightly pointed out there probably was backlash from these countries but that didn't stop us from having these kinds of reforms but thirdly I would argue that even the most conservative countries and especially conservative and sort of like these controversial countries have it in their best interest to remain a part of these organizations because when Saudi Arabia is not a part of the UN then the rivals of Saudi Arabia those individuals who want to see Saudi Arabia delegitimized in the international community can uniquely bank on the fact of this international organization that's an opportunity cost that they won't take but the second thing about how like euro skepticism is like a really big deal that's for purely economic reasons look Look at Brexit for example, they didn't want to have like Brexit and the Britainers didn't want to have Brexit just because they wanted like more women in power, that was because the EU was failing them as an international organization.

When Saudi Arabia is a member of the United Nations, it allows funding to go towards women's empowerment in the country. Why are your side so happy to risk that? And they will likely continue to demand members of this organization. I've already directed this. But the thing that they tell us as to how this is going to get worse for women is that it will create a confirmation bias. One, I would argue that the fact that you want qualified delegates to represent you in an international forum actually means that the women who used to be pencil pushing and research teams for the actual male delegates are now likely to get the prominent position of power, but they're also going to get assets in terms of the training and research necessary in order to improve these kinds of things but even if confirmation bias does exist to some degree panel sexism exists on both sides of the house so even if organically a woman gets into power on their side of the house backlash would still exist is that a reason not to have any of these women in power i don't know but finally i think what we allow women to do is put them in a position of power where they can disprove the bigots, where they can say, despite the fact that I'm a woman and you think I'm incompetent, I have the ability to succeed."

The final argument then as to how you create strong female leaders. Two areas of analysis here. Firstly, the immediate tangible trickle-down effects of having a woman in power. Because these delegates are immensely powerful individuals, even in their own home states. They have the ability to delegate their own research teams, for example. They have the ability to decide who works in their offices. What do you think a world in which a woman occupies this position would look like? One, we think that she would be able to hire more women in places where they have structurally and a glass ceiling placed against them. So the research teams that are responsible for compiling research, for example, are more likely to be representative."

I think that's just a good in and of itself. But finally, on the the power of the office because i think when you are a national delegate that gives you immense political clout it gives you a stage on which you can speak about women's issues and we've already seen this happening to some degree with individuals like emma watson for example who is a youth delegate for the ul we think that all of the benefits then of having media support for these kinds of things across the world, given that this happens in every country, is far, far greater than what you likely see with limited representation on their side of the house.

We think firstly a benefit that's provided is trade, but then they say actually the UK only withdrew from the EU for economic reasons. We don't think first first of all, that this is even true. We think that there's been a simmering global sentiment that is anti-globalisation, anti-global organisations. This is why the UK withdrew from the EU for reasons beyond just economic, including democracy, including immigration. No, thank you. But we think also that the US is also itching to leave these organisations. We think secondly, many countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran are incredibly sexist to the point where they'll outright withdraw from these organisations because they don't want to be humiliated because they're sending a woman to these organisations. We don't think that these countries see enough benefit of these organisations to send a representative. No, thank you. Thirdly, to add nuance, we think that there's a certain level of sexism that won't exist in the most radical of these countries, but still relatively sexist countries like India, like China, like the US, like Brazil, where they'll massively withdraw funding from these organizations to the point where their"

We think their proposition is unbelievably radical, and there's a massive problem-solution gap. We think if anything first proved by establishing that patriarchy exists, why we should use our alternatives. We don't think that every man should lose power, two additional reasons for why this exclusion is extra bad. Firstly, on the efficiency of our countermeasures, we think the trajectory of these countermeasures over the past several decades has been unbelievably positive. We've had massive gains for women's rights as a result of these countermeasures as they exist. No, thank you. But secondly, they're not being done to the extent that they could be done. And we think they can only be done to the extent they can be done to when there's funding available for it. You only get this funding when states buy in. Secondly, on their failure to identify this obligation principally correctly. We disagree that there's a distinction between these two sides. We think the difference is between picking a banana from a tree and 3D printing something that looks like a banana and calling it the same thing. We think that there's a necessary distinction between how you come to something. We think Latin was able to prove that. No, thank you. Next rebuttal. What does it take to get policy which helps women? We think that proposition of use a chainsaw for what required scissors. We don't think that you necessarily need you make every single person in a parliament an ethnic minority, there will also be more global ethnic minority voices. This isn't a justification for why they should do that. We think this is a tautology and contingent on their first speaker's material. Yes, please. Up one makes the argument that feminism is diverse and therefore 200 countries have varying needs and interests for their women. How then would a quota system, which only gets a certain percentage of women from some countries, pander to all those unique interests? This POI demonstrates that Proposition haven't actually listened to our countermeasures. At no point did we say quota. We said affirmative action, we said funding, we said diplomatic pressure."

We say most of the women that will be selected for these international bodies will be wealthy, they'll be straight, they'll be university educated, they'll come from the most powerful ethnic group in their country. We want proposition to justify why white women in Brazil, the USA, and South Africa can replace black men, and we see those black men's interests no longer represented in these bodies. No, thank you. We acknowledge that there's already an under representation of these other marginalized groups under the status quo, but five reasons why these groups lose power in these institutions under the motion. Firstly, on the level of social hurdles that people have to leap through. We think the more oppressed your background is, the more hurdles you have to overcome. This is why the ratio between white to black men in a parliament is generally more equitable than the ratio between white to black women in a parliament is generally more equitable than the ratio between white to black women in parliaments. There have only ever been two female black senators. Second reason, we say the leaders of many grassroots movements tend to be men. It's easier to be a male leader of a civil rights or a class struggle organisation. These are really important movements. Having these leaders is really valuable as representatives. No, thank you. Thirdly, the pool of representatives to draw from is quite small for female candidates to the point where there aren't many ethnic minorities to begin with. This motion selects women who have already conquered the rigmarole of life. They meet all of society's expectations. It excludes women that didn't fourthly we say that there is a no thank you there's an acceptance a woman must must like meet to achieve power in society to be a woman who like who has power you can't be rough around the edges you're not allowed to be society has a much higher expectation for you than they have for a man you must be university educated you must be well spoken you must be successful no thank. We say there's much more leeway for men to have, for example, a working class accent than a woman, because there's lower expectations for them. At this point, women who are accepted in the national discourse are much more privileged. Fifthly, we say that there's a level of lip service and box checking that exists under proposition. We say world leaders who appoint representatives have got a box to check and they feel it's already been checked. Because we're already appointing women, why would we need to appoint a minority? We say furthermore, our countermeasures aim to break this privilege pipeline at an earlier stage. Affirmative action, funding and schemes for women and financial support, and diplomatic pressure in countries with unequal rights for women allow this pipeline to be broken before people have already got to the end of it. What that means is the people who are at the end of it are immensely privileged. What we get to do is we destroy the foundation and we get people to break this privilege in the first place."

First, we think that these other mechanisms are unlikely to manifest fast enough. Why is this the case? Because it is a bottom-down approach as opposed to the top-down approach that we talked about. That is to say, it is down to the micro nuances of individual policies in individual countries that have not worked for decades and decades, panel, where women's liberation of the vote, for example, started in 1918 or something, but the fact is that there are still less voter turnout for women right now. That these policies have existed for so long, but we have not seen the kind of redress that we require. But secondly, in the answer to their POI, they said, we're happy to do much more than we already do for women. This is a concession that the current mechanisms don't work, not because we don't give it enough funding, but because structurally it just takes too long and does not actually cater to the structural biases that exist in these countries. The structural biases that exist is the perception of women, the idea of what women should be, the idea that women cannot be forceful, that they cannot be assertive.

For example, Biden looks like he's going to become president, then he will be involved in the UN. The fact that Brexit was a bad idea has been acknowledged by a majority of individuals right now. This is very much down to the socio-political climate of the time, whether you can shift either way. But certainly, the specific examples that they gave, like the Paris Agreement, is pulling out of individual policies, specific policies. They have never just removed themselves from the un because then they lose every single other benefit that the un has so sure even women in the like a american woman would pull out of the paris agreement even if we agree to that the fact is that they should stay in the un to do everything else no thank you but thirdly we think it's likely that saudi and iran are still going to send women because it is pr right it's a signaling effect that they are willing to go to the other side because they want to get better trade deals, because they want to be seen as a good person. But the flip of that is something they haven't responded to, that you're likely to be stigmatized by your rivals, that you're likely to be called out by the rest of the international community.

We don't think that this stands on their side. But even if some countries pull out, we think that's fine. Because of the fact that every single other country now has an ability to cater for women, has an ability to actually at the point which they can see that there is sexism in every single part of the world. In fact, we should not care about that minority of instances because then every single other country around the world which exists incede that there is sexism in every single part of the world.

If there's a black man in the UN right now, it's going to change into a black woman. There's still intersectionality between men and women and other marginalized groups. But secondly, even if it's only the most privileged women who get into power right now, that's symmetric for one, that's on their side as well.

We don't care fundamentally even if it is the most privileged of women because we care about women as a global group. The fact that they are otherwise excluded.

              "text": "The premise of that case here, and I thank you, is that UN representation deconstructs mindsets. Three responses. Firstly, we told you in the very first minute of our case today that these actors are unlikely to stay in the UN in many countries, like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Thailand. Men in these countries feel threatened at the point at which they see that the leadership of that country is threatened, right? This is strategically, these are often the most strategically important countries and also important to feminism, right? Proposition doesn't even care. Proposition cares more about like more female billionaires in this situation than like tackling sex-based oppression. OK, it's also important to note that um we also we told you that this misogyny is not based on rationality it's even the case where their economic responses are true we tell you this has very little impact on the leadership who are much more concerned with saving their own skins and jobs than like economic benefits to their people secondly ambassadors are probably more stigmatized within these countries right note that they are given no stake by the elite as as this is against the tradition, and they have no incentives to properly engage with these ambassadors or World Bank representatives. They are demonised by the population themselves. Like, even in America, probably the best environment for props case. Look at the reaction to, like, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, where she's been harassed and abused by people themselves. We tell you that this reaction is likely to be drastically amplified when there is such misogyny and such anti-feminist figures. Now, thank you. The impacts of this rebuttal are we get less feminism within these countries as it becomes popular to voice dissent against these figures and contributes to a herd mentality and witch hunt against feminists, right? Secondly, less liberalism as ambassadors import values from the UN into these countries, right, which leads to more progressivism that looks like Jordan, Vietnam, all positive case studies in this case, which makes, because these ambassadors want to import this progressivism in order to make their life in the UN easier and to improve this reputation. But when it's women, we still think they'll largely try to do this, but they have no relationships with the government or the elite who are reticent to engage because of the kinds of structural misogyny that both sides agree exists within these environments right we think this the end impact of this is at least to slower progress and more misogyny within these countries"

              "text": "thirdly backlash we think this covers the more moderate cases countries like the uk where there are still structural misogyny but it tends to be much more widely called out right so men within these countries yeah excluded by the motion no thank you ambassadors like um know that they never actually engaged or never actually proved how more female delegates leads to less sexism on the ground but we'll engage as if they did right we think i'm back when ambassadors are no longer men you do as a man when you think ambassadors are no longer men you don't't think of national pride or like, oh, I should probably be a feminist now. You think that your job will be the next one, right? We think this isn't helped by reactionary media institutions within these countries who demonise it, who try and spread an impression that feminism is threatened, specifically, right? like feminism specifically right we think that also feminism needs these men right they they can reduce they uh they reduce misogyny and increase political capital of the movement as a whole we think these men go from largely sympathetic to threatened and aggressive but even if this doesn't increase misogyny against the most vulnerable women within these countries because we've agreed that the women who do become ambassadors are privileged and experience less sexism we think it halts progress and acceptance of feminist narratives. The impact. Props case prolongs misogyny in most of the world. It cements rather than deconstructs prejudice. I'll take a Piyawana. So on your side of the house, there was an in-crash against women asking for the vote to the point where women actually killed about it. Would you have not then campaigned for the vote, given that there's a massive misogyny that would have presumably existed existed? We think it's very different from like women asking for the vote. Women asking for the vote was equality, right? We get far less backlash against equality when women have exclusive rights to like become ambassadors or walk to positions. We think this isn't equality and therefore men feel much more threatened by it, right? Because they are now being discriminated against. And secondly, rebuttal to the conclusion of by it, right? Because they are now being discriminated against. Secondly, rebuttal to the conclusion of their case, right? That is less misogyny. Firstly, we think it relates to a mission-accomplished mindset, which leads to less drive for female enfranchisement because they already have supposed representation. Secondly, are these women even feminists, right? We think they failed to prove this. Not all women are feminists, right? And the ones picked by the misogynistic elites like outside Western liberal democracy to be ambassadors are unlikely to be. They are products of their environment. They have incentives to cooperate with the agenda of the government. So Proposition's case falls apart when you imagine a world where these women argue against feminism in the United Nations, against feminism in the World Bank. Even in countries like the US, given that these women are likely to be the richest and most privileged, as Freddie's barriers analysis conclusively proved, they are least likely to have been impacted by sexism. They don't get cat-hauled, they travel in a limousine. They won't prioritise sexism within these organisations because they don't have the lived experience. The impact of this is it tackles the assumptions that bound Sri Lanka's entire case. We think they lose on this ground. Thirdly, on weaker feminism, we think when you make feminism about the richest and whitest, richest and whitest who are acceptable to the elite, it isolates people who don't look like them out of feminism. We think this leads to a worse movement. So the comparative, right? LACAN gives you very clear alternatives for progress, like affirmative action, funding girls' education, international pride. We think this is very exclusive with emotion because like when libya no longer lets you into the country to fund girls schools we think this leads to much worse harms on the ground their burden is to explain uh why it's better than the state of why their emotion is better than everything we do in these status quo the response is if it's so good why do we not get more representatives what there's no reason as to why this is a good metric to measure the progress of feminism. We think this is symbolic in name only. We give you the status quo. Hundreds of millions of women lifted out of poverty, growing acceptance of third wave intersectional feminism, fundamental and material change. Prop under our motion gives a marginal feminism that works only in the interest of the most privileged."

Firstly, they're already happening to a really great extent, right? We already have quite significant affirmative action, funding for like women's programs and diplomatic pressure against countries with bad rights for women. And guess what? Saudi Arabia is still in the United Nations. So is Iran. So is Russia. So is Brazil, right? We still have that engagement. We still have that level of buy-in. We don't think you get that when you specifically look at the way in which their motion looks, because they want to change. This is what we tell you right from the outset they want to change the face of a country in the international community to having to be a woman that is so unbelievably unpalatable for vladimir putin that is something that jereb al-sanaro just will never want to do that is something that like the the saudi arabian government just really does not want to do.

Think about where diplomatic pressure comes from. It comes from international organizations like the World Bank and the UN. They can't just be at that.

Not a single one of our fathers made the same sacrifice. The overwhelming belief that having and raising a child is universally rewarding, particularly for women, has led to a culture that shuts women out of some of the most critical opportunities in society. This culture of coercion is why we are so proud to propose. Before I introduce our first two substantive arguments with my partner, Shreyoshi DeLeverin III, I'd like to clarify some things in this round. First, that motherhood is the process of giving birth to and raising a child. Second, what exactly does it mean to regret something? We regret how this widespread belief has actually looked in history and how it has impacted society. This isn't a debate about whether motherhood is good or bad. But for them, what exactly has this expectation looked like?"

It looks like things like painting pregnancy as this glowing, beautiful experience. And, importantly, as the motion suggests, this is the overwhelming idea that parenthood is positive, focused on mothers, meaning that this expectation and this idea that parenthood is positive focused on mothers, meaning that this expectation and this idea that parenthood is super rewarding has disproportionately not at all focused on fathers, meaning the expectation to have children, an idea that this is universally rewarding, has uniquely been a burden upon women."

We prefer one where it's viewed more objectively, recognizing that there are extreme challenges, and we prefer a world with a more balanced view of fatherhood and motherhood. And we actually think there are cases where this is increasingly happening, and it is particularly in those cases where doors are being opened for women when we recognize some of the drawbacks of motherhood."

              "text": "With that, let's introduce our first argument about how this exacerbates the oppression of women. Two ideas under this. The first is exacerbating institutional coercion. The belief that motherhood is overwhelmingly good has led to three things. The first is that characterizations and qualities associated with being a mother are exclusively for women. Second, they create policies to encourage women to be mothers, often at the expense of other opportunities. And third and finally, just the general expectation that women ought to be mothers above all else. And that's a responsibility uniquely for women. What has this led to institutionally? It has led to women being denied an education for much of history because they're viewed as more suited for raising children. And you don't need to know math or science or calculus or history in order to raise a child. This expectation still exists in many places where you're literally, or some women are literally shot in the head for pursuing an education in places like Afghanistan. It looks like women being shut out of politics, both institutionally, where in much of history they're just denied places in politics, but also because women see, because people see women as more suited for the home, they don't view them as being in positions of power. But finally, women are often shut out of jobs because if you're going to be a mother, and if that is such a rewarding thing for you to pursue, why would you sacrifice that experience in the name of getting a job? And even when, notably, women are allowed to get jobs, note that the first jobs that women were able to get were those that had characteristics associated with motherhood. The first jobs that women were able to get were things like being teachers or seamstresses that involved more domestic responsibilities like, I don't know, taking care of children. And this shuts out women from being able to pursue things like being a lawyer or a doctorate if they want that. The second reason this happens is through social coercion, both for young girls and for older women who are becoming mothering age. For young girls, we are told that motherhood is super rewarding and something that we should pursue from a really young age, both directly and when we're handed bride dolls and told to play house instead of doing things like playing with G.I. Joes or action figures or, you know, police action figures like boys are. And further, for older women who are approaching the age where they could be mothers, we're constantly asked, oh, when are you going to start a family? When you graduate from college, how many children do you want? These questions are almost never asked of men because society views motherhood as a rewarding experience, particularly for women. This experience is never, this expectation is never placed on men. In contrast, Barbara, if we recognize that there are a lot of costs to becoming a mother and it weren't just an exclusive expectation on women, women would be able to evaluate all of these positive and negative things and actually make this choice for themselves instead of being coercive against it. We think in a world where this belief exists, that belief takes this choice away. This is incredibly coercive and it's shut women out of a lot of society."

However, they do evaluate whether or not they're placing the child ahead of their career, and that's when they do have a child. No, no, no. Yes. We think that women are making this evaluation, but the information that they're given when they're making this evaluation is fundamentally distorted to tell them that motherhood is overwhelmingly good and that they should pursue that above all else. If they were given more balanced information, it would be a real choice.

It is absolutely a legitimate choice for me, after I graduate from college, to be able to pursue a career and not a family, and not be shamed for doing so. Our second idea under this other argument is that it actually shames women who do in fact choose to become mothers, often coercively. We think motherhood is a really, really hard experience. Often it leads to people sacrificing their career, sacrificing time to raise their children, sacrificing sleep, particularly in early stages, having to literally clean up poop and throw up when you're raising a baby. That's really hard, when women issue these very legitimate grievances, they're seen as corrupt, bad mothers because motherhood is supposed to be this overwhelmingly positive thing."

We think these are things that need legitimized in the world of the opposition. But second, we think that women are ashamed if they don't exhibit characteristics of love and compassion. And the widespread belief shows that it's only through motherhood that women are ever able to learn these things. Women can learn things like love and compassion through friendship, through other types of relationships. Motherhood is not the only way to accomplish this. The second thing they told you was that many women choose to keep their children. We think women are free to make that choice, but oftentimes it's not a true choice because society is coercing them to always picking their child over other things in their society. Women are always forced to put themselves last into family. This is very real harm that society does not recognize, because they say, oh, motherhood is rewarding, you should not be complaining, you're supposed to be enjoying this. Because it is the failure to actually recognize what women are going through that leads to these kinds of harms."

We think that is why when children feel like they are a burden to their mother, when they feel like their mother has been pressured, that has brought real harms on the child. They're the ones that feel like they're a burden. They're unable to be successful. They're unable to feel like they're of use and that they're loved by their parents. We think that gets worse on the opposition's side of the house. What was the matter that we told you on our side of the house? We got very little engagement with the idea. There are institutional barriers that have hurt women because of this widespread belief. We told you women have been shut out from education, they've been shut out from political representation, they've been shut out from economic participation with jobs. It is because women are always seen to be delegated to the household, to the cult of domesticity, because they're always supposed to be with the children, raising the children, not pursuing other things that would benefit their lives. That is what has shut them out, and that has been the justification for why people have justified the suppression of women. With the insulation of your argument, I'm asking the question, are you suggesting that women see having a career as a greater responsibility than taking care of their child? We think women should be free to make the choice of whether they want to prioritize their career over their child. We think in your world, society has made the choice for them that they should choose life over the career. We're fundamentally opposed to that. The next thing we told you under our case was that women from their very raising, from their upbringing, are groomed essentially to become mothers. And old women do this too. When younger women are always given dolls or just like house or things that are more domestic. And older women are questioned as to why they don't have a family at the age of 45. Why are they choosing their career? They're seen as backwards. And as a failure of a woman if they are not able to have a child. That societal expectation is something we fundamentally oppose. But in the next 20-year argument about shaming women, we think that the belief that makes people choose motherhood over their children"

This is what you wanted, now you deal with the consequences.

              "text": "So our first two arguments largely dealt with the societal impact of pursuing motherhood or not pursuing motherhood. Our third argument is specific to the act of becoming a mother and analyzes the cost to every individual mother. This argument is that the belief creates pressures that harms women's health. Our first point under this is that women's health issues are discounted in relation to pregnancy, for example. We think the widespread belief of motherhood, that it's rewarding, has created the idea that pregnancy is this glowing and beautiful thing that women are in their prime during pregnancy. I will mention this at the top of her case. We think that this notion ignores the fact that the vast majority of women are often in a lot of pain during pregnancy. You have things like morning sickness, bloating, cravings, and dietary restrictions. You can't eat shellfish, you can't have alcohol, you can't have dairy, but then there's also medical things you can't take, you can't do things like be on antidepressants because that is seen to hurt the baby. There are very real health issues that are not legitimized by men that are not taken seriously because women are seen as always thriving during pregnancy. We think that when women struggle, society doesn't take their pregnancies into account because the mom is supposed to enjoy it. Second point under this argument is that it's delegitimizing the importance of women's reproductive rights. What this means is that access to contraception is already very limited in the status quo because women are expected to have children and be happy with it so why would they ever want to have things like birth control or family planning or things of that nature. Within the justification that that is rewarding, that has been used to essentially perpetuate limitations to reproductive rights. Within policies to increase access to birth control and family planning have failed because of this. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s Gloria Steinem and Betty Burdan, who were feminist icons at the time, spoke up about getting access to contraception. What happened was massive backlash from the public, and it literally gave rise to conservatism against contraception. Why? It's because people said, why would you need contraception when the woman's role is to be a mother? This was the justification for the oppression of women. These are arguments that opposition has not been responding to. Ultimately, we prioritize the mother's ability to choose in this round. We are fundamentally opposed to society's coercion of women themselves because first it leads to institutional harms that have very real and concrete roles that have already hurt them. It leads to subtle coercion and a frothy very up-bringing of women themselves. They are the ones that are groomed more into motherhood. And third, it shuts out other people's experiences, and they're not taken seriously by society. We think that it's pert to women's ability to move up in society and to choose their own life for themselves. So proud to be a two-year-old."

I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that there have been massive social media movements that have come to normalize... No. That have come to normalize the realities of pregnancies and by acknowledging how difficult and sometimes emotionally exhausting it can be for a woman. Yes, there is awareness being raised about the difficulties of pregnancy, so we cannot continue living in this notion that all these tip-moisture types are still being lived up to. seems to be making a direct link and a direct reason of causation for women being underrepresented in politics, in economics, in the government, and generally in jobs because of motherhood.

According to the ancient Greeks, there are eight types of love, such as philos, eros, agape, and mania. One of these types of love is the love that a child and a parent feel for each other. Now the point of this is that each type of love is unique, and what's rewarding in a parent Now the point of this is that each type of love is unique. And what's rewarding in a parent-child type of love is that it's a type of love, affection, and bonding that you cannot experience everywhere else. And there is nothing or very few things that are as beautiful, in our opinion, as the love that a parent, being a mother or a father, can feel for their child. And we believe that this is the kind of love that must be celebrated and which must be spread as being rewarding. This isn't to say that nothing else can be thought of as rewarding. But just because there are so many other things that are rewarding doesn't mean that we should exclude motherhood. Not only that, but a mother's love is crucial in establishing a child's identity. Why are there so many cases of orphaned children feeling emotionally distraught or emotionally unstable? A lot of reasons suggest it is because of the lack of a parent's love"

The first response that we'd like to make is that we don't think in a world where motherhood is seen as not necessarily this glorified, rewarding experience, suddenly a mother's love for her child goes away. We think that's a little bit absurd. They didn't give you enough analysis or warning as to why this is the case. I think on our side of the house, that bond still exists. However, that bond is even strengthened further. This is their second response. Because when the mother is actually able to prioritize things in their life that bring them quality of life and enhance their life, such as focusing on a career, such as ultimately making decisions for themselves that do not sway within societal perspectives of what they ought to do, that's where you're actually able to encourage a very independent lifestyle for your own child. That's where you're actually able to show to your child that these things are very beneficial to them and that they ought to follow the exact same path. We don't necessarily think that we got enough engagement with the points that we presented to you down the bench as to why women ought to have this priority over their own child in the first place.

              "text": "that comes from that is not necessarily true. But on to the first question in today's debate, which is, what does this ultimate widespread belief do to the decision-making process for women? What we heard from side opposition here was that while the belief for women to want to quit their job, to be able to take care of their children, to want to have children in the first place, is a choice that they made independently on their own. Here's the thing, that woefully unengaged with our analysis that we gave you in our first and second arguments based off of the coercive nature that comes from valuing mothers like a motherhood in a rewarding aspect, and the shame that comes from women whenever they choose not to engage within the certain motherhood that is pushed forward in society. How does this happen? Let's dig really deeper here, because we don't think that we got a sufficient response, but let's really tie up all the loose ends. First, we told you that there's a lot of explicit coercion that comes with this. This looks like things where in a lot of South Eastern Asian countries, that's where we're actually able to see early teens being like herded off to marriage. They're prioritizing having as many children as possible because that's the thing that they obtain their worth from, right? The ultimate idea of being a young woman in those societies is because ultimately if you don't have a child you're not necessarily garnering as much benefits as you could be within your lifestyle. We think that this leads to multitude of harms. It leads to women being held into the cold of domesticity that has been happening for years upon years. It's about withholding back women from garnering positions of power because they ought to stay in the household to take care of their kids. That's why we see when women do get positions of power, they're shamed because they're not at home taking care of their children. They're shamed if they bring their child to work because it's ultimately showing that they're unprofessional. There's no win-win situation for women within the world of motherhood being valued as the utmost priority for women. But furthermore, this rewarding experience is enhanced when years of religion center around it, when every single piece of media centers around this idea that you have to be a mother. The second thing which we're willing to engage with, and this is ultimately where most decision-making processes are swayed by, is subtle coercion. I think that there's an intense pressure for almost all women to ultimately find a relationship, to engage and set up a family unit. This looks like ultimately women choosing to find a certain relationship regardless of what harms may come from it. That's why a lot of women, when they're in abusive or toxic relationships, choose to stay because they know that the utmost thing that they need to be prioritizing is their own children. That means that when they choose to ultimately prioritize themselves, they're shamed because they're not taking care of their children, they're not preserving the union. We're the only side that is giving you an incentive and analysis as to what this widespread belief does. But furthermore, why does this win us this debate? Even if side opposition stands up in their next speech and tells you a bunch of things as to why motherhood may be good, we still think that all of these harms that are unique to valuing it as a rewarding experience does not outweigh just the small things that may be seen as rewarding. Furthermore, we still think that motherhood and some of the benefits that you may get from it can still happen on our side of the house. That's a unique way that you should debate and stand on our side."

              "text": "But let's go a little bit further and look to the second question of today's debate, which is, what does this widespread belief affect on women's lives? I haven't heard a POS, so I'll take one if you guys have any. No? Okay. So let's go on to the second question in today's debate. What does this widespread belief affect on women's lives? Side composition gave you a very clear picture of what the life of a woman looks like from the time that they are born to the time that they retire and ultimately receive from society. We think they're born to instantly play with dolls that are emulating the life that a mother ought to have. They are handed aprons, they're handed baby dolls, they're handed easy-bake ovens to ultimately fulfill the things that they think women ought to do. Then, if they go to college, even though they probably shouldn't because they should just focus on finding a family unit, they go to college to find a man. That's why, in my country, the most common phrase is getting an MRS degree because it's most likely that you're going to college to be able to find a man, to find a suitable husband. We think that that culture is further under the narrative where it's rewarding to get a child, you have to prioritize finding that. But thirdly, in adulthood, say you're a woman that hasn't found that family unit, say you're a woman that hasn't had that family unit. Say you're a woman that hasn't had a child yet. Ultimately, there's an immense pressure to assemble that family unit now. You're asked, when are you going to have children? How many children do you want to have? Those are all things that play into this. But furthermore, let's expand upon the third substantive that we gave you that got absolutely no response. We told you that within the pregnancy process and the motherhood process, there's a lot of physical harms that can come to women that are when they're pressured to ultimately emulate this perfect woman within motherhood. Pregnancy is extreme. You have multiple dietary restrictions. In birth, you're prized if you don't use an epidural. You're prized if you ultimately give birth to a child as quickly as possible. After birth, you suffer for postpartum because all of your worth has been put into raising this child, to giving birth to this child, because it's such a rewarding experience and now it's over. We think that they're ultimately told that they're not legitimate to cry or to complain about giving birth because it's such a rewarding experience, it ought to be more quite more. When we tell you that you can have these restrictions, all the movements inviting back against these kinds of norms are what happens on our side of the house, because we destroy the notion that motherhood is such a rewarding experience. We destroy the idea that you cannot have work in your life if you are not a mother, which is why we are so proud to propose. Thank you."

And they've basically responded with assertions that they're not true. That was not nearly enough. What did we tell you? We told you analysis very similar to the stuff that their third speaker gave us about how this culture leads to people literally institutionally shutting out women from places of power, from education, because they don't need that to be mothers, which is most rewarding for death. We told you that it looks like being told, even in, yes, Western societies, oh, when are you going to have children? Oh, here's a Barbie doll to play with because you're going to be a mother when you grow up. Being a mother is super rewarding and not talking about all the costs of this. I've literally been asked if I'm going to have children since I was probably nine years old. My brother has never been asked those questions. We think at this point, there's a huge asymmetry of information and pressure between men and women, something that they, again, responded to with literally just the assertion that this is the same for men and women."

But another interesting idea that they bring up in this round is that children having mothers is great, and the love between a mother and child is wonderful. And there is no engagement with our analysis about how children are actually better off on our side of the house when women are given more equal, balanced information and legitimately make the choice to become mothers and actually want to become mothers when they do, instead of being literally forced down that path because they don't have economic, political, or educational opportunities or because they're misled into thinking motherhood is something that it is not. We win the debate on this question. This basically takes out all of their material on their side of the house and we win automatically."

              "text": "But second, let's talk about how this does impact women. Even if women do legitimately make the decision to have children, we think there is no engagement on a point about what happens after that. We tell you that even if they choose for legitimate reasons, when they're struggling under the legitimate burdens of motherhood, we tell you down the bench, when they're struggling with a pregnancy, they are told that those concerns aren't legitimate because you're supposed to be enjoying motherhood. Women who choose to engage in careers or shame for not having children are pitied and delegitimized and looked down upon by society. We told you that the only value of a mother in this society is in her children. There is also no engagement on our third argument about the health of women and how pressuring women, because this is viewed as so rewarding, into having a lot of pregnancies can be really draining on a woman's health, especially in places where natal care is not good. Their only arguments in this round were about their certain positive elements of motherhood and their benefits for children with no engagement on all of our material about how all of this gets worse on their side of the house. We are so proud to help those. the House. We are so proud of her."

Otherwise, it can happen through an individual transaction between a man and a woman, through something like an instant messaging service. This can happen throughout a variety of regions, right? From Thailand to Mexico, from Russia to the USA, from Nigeria to South Africa, no thank you. But we think it's generally as moving to a more developed country. What is this not? We don't think this is the individual sponsoring of a migrant for any reason that is not contingent on marriage. That is a requisite for this existence. We do support things like the reform of immigration to make migrant processes easier, simply because they eliminate the need that this industry is vulnerable."

Fundamental rights of individuals aren't being protected. Let's look at the best case scenario, in which there is consent between a bride and a buyer, where the bride sells herself in exchange for easier access and immigration. We think this is not OK. In principle, setting your liberty means setting every single second of your life. You belong to someone else. The bride herself is the product of your satisfaction. The point is, your entire future is contingent on the satisfaction of another individual. You no longer live your life for yourself. You exist as a tool of somebody else. We think this is equivalent to slavery, where you have no agency over your future path. Notice how this is independent of whether or not love exists in this relationship. Why don't we think that a person can just give up their right to liberty if they consent to it? We think autonomy of an individual is the only difference between a human and an object. We think that their ability to exert this freedom is what allows them to make every single choice in the future that they ever will. Yes? If marriage is such a ripping away of autonomy, can you, as literally slavery as you say, would you then ban poor people from trying to marry rich people? Marriage is absolutely not taking away the autonomy of an individual because it's a consensual agreement between two consenting persons. We think that's completely different. And the fact is the power dynamics in a relationship such as this one, where your existence, your very purpose, and every second of your waking life"

Because you constrain the individual to a one-dimensional object. The moment that the government allows these kinds of practices, it is explicitly condoning the violation of people's most fundamental rights. We think that individuals simply can't consent in this situation, not because it's just ugly, but because it means that they give up their entire humanity. Their entire existence and their ability to ever exert consent again is sacrificed in the interest of migration. In principle, the government can't allow this independent of its practical impacts."

Secondly, the people that come into these countries are legally disadvantaged in the cases where they wish to escape from their toxic, abusive situations. We think that there's fundamentally unequal power dynamics in contrast to a regular marriage. Because there's two situations that we outline in this debate. When a man orders a male to order a bride, she is 100% submissive, correct? They have to put on a pretty face and work from there. Think of the emotional toll that this has on the individual. They often sink into massively crippling depression, having no one to talk to with genuinity. We think that this is especially clear in the example of the Russian Mexican community, because we see that these are people who exist and who bond together because of the very fact that they have no other alternative. They exist as a service of the Mexicans. The Mexicans who have imported and sacrificed their humanity for their physical pleasure. The fact that this is nothing but a transaction means that it is extremely likely to become abusive. It means that these people are far more likely to fall into cycles of defensive and offensive relationships between these two individuals. What happens when there is love? And when a man asks a woman that he previously met and buys her love? We think that firstly these power dynamics are still extremely evident."

Simply going to migration offices, supporting your bride and getting her visa is not only more romantic, but we think that it takes away the fundamental transactive part of this relationship. This is mutual support. This is a situation in which both individuals agree to take care of the other and agree to support them in pursuit of their individual happiness. In most cases, we say that this will result in profoundly inhuman marriages and you're extremely likely to turn abusive. Second, why are the solutions simply ineffective? Solutions like divorce, like running away from your abusive husband, are ways to move up the social ladder, sure. But notice how the only human outcome of these relationships is ending them. We think that's firstly not okay. We think their status as immigrants makes it extremely difficult to carry out self-sustaining legal processes. What do we mean? Things like the fact that they often have difficulty speaking English, that they are ethnically discriminated against on their appearance, the fact that they have no access to local family and other support networks means that they are deeply alone. Systematic issues against these people, in particular against women in a patriarchal society, have to be taken into account. What do we mean by this? We think that the single women that are left behind by these relationships suffer profoundly in their status in society. Two reasons why this happens. First, and most importantly, we think that these women have no access to recover their traditional resources and their traditional ways to move up the social ladder. We are talking about things like work. We're talking about things like joining the workforce. The fact is, oftentimes these people have spent their entire lives waiting in search for someone to pick them up as a bride. We don't think that this is necessarily capacitating them to join the workforce and that's what is harmful. These people aren't going to have the skills required to be able to sustain themselves in society because of the way that the industry is structured. Second, these women will not have access to traditional resources like child support. We think that an outcome in which a woman bears a child is extremely harmful because of the fact that firstly, this woman isn't going to be emotionally and physically capable of sustaining such a feat. But secondly, we think it's extremely harmful in as much as the child isn't able to have access to traditional resources. We think the moment in which the only solution for this woman to not feel so profoundly, deeply afflicted is to bear another being that will have to suffer through their life is extremely hard. We are very proud to propose for the society that stands for the rights of women, that sides against slavery and that sides in favor of open immigration and a system that doesn't abuse the individual. Thank you. I think this is a good idea. So Marcus and I invite the first speaker from South Park. This is a good idea. Let's hear it. Thank you. Thank you."

You can't just simply fiat that you're going to reform the immigration system. Even if you could, we think that we could also claim that, so that way, if they prove it so pernicious, that those women wouldn't have to enter into these relationships, but we think it should still be an option. Let's respond to case material. The first thing that they tell you is about the idea that women are incapable of consent. This argument is super problematic. They tell you that every time you enter into a marriage, you are someone else's property. Note this narrative is simply untrue. If I want to marry a rich guy just because I want to marry someone wealthy, that doesn't mean I'm his property, right? That makes absolutely no sense. To be clear, their argument is about protecting autonomy. Then why do they literally take away the autonomy of women to decide whether or not they want to enter into these relationships? In response to a POI that Ishan asked them, they say, oh no, no, autonomy is promoted whenever you have consent. Note that their PM literally told you that this argument was in the instances that consent occurs. At that level, they've conceded the principle of this debate, meaning that we should allow these women to make these things."

              "text": "The second thing they tell you is that there are unequal power dynamics in these relationships. That's super harmful. They tell you that women in these relationships are inherently submissive. We have a lot of problems with this. First of all, we do not think that these structures are inherently unequal. These same justifications exist in other relationships too. So sometimes there is an unequal balance of power. If I come from a poor background and I marry someone that is wealthier, they have more power relative to me in society. That doesn't mean that the relationship can't be consensual or is automatically abusive. Second, we told you that in extreme minority cases in which abuse occurs, we would support women seeking help for that abuse. But note, we do not ban it entirely. The next thing that they tell you is that women can't move up the social ladder because they don't have the skills or ability to do things like work because they just wait around and wait to be married in their own country. We think that this is absolutely ridiculous, right? Women have lives before they get married. And in this instance, we think that they have the skills in order to promote themselves in these communities, but also the benefit is that you are able to move to a country where you have financial stability. In that case, we think that there are those harms that they talk to you about in their substantive argument. That being said, let's examine our first substantive argument on the women's right to choose before I go on. Go ahead. Would you allow the people to sell their organs?

              "text": "Sometimes. We see this with arranged marriages in places like East Asia and India all the time. But second, even if we assume that these relationships will never be loving and are not romantic, why is this still okay? Because people make decisions for marriages all the time based off who they want their life partner to be or what they want their life to look like. It's not a bad thing for me to sacrifice wanting love if I want to marry someone in an economic position when you think that this is the woman's choice. This is why some people get married for tax rates or purely social nominability. Even if this is unsavory, people make these trade-offs all the time, and choosing to marry someone for money is not completely illegitimate. But first, we should analyse the question of when it is justified for a government to ban a practice of individuals. Only whenever there is an active significant harm that is intrinsic to that action and infringes on an individual's ability to interact with others, or second, they cannot legitimately consent or make rational choices in that case. Note that A, our regulations address a significant amount of the harms that they bring you about, and they implicitly conceive that consent is possible through their second, first, and standing argument. But what is the intrinsic action of being an imported bride? Note it's not that I'm a submissive woman who's just waiting to be married off. Rather, it's I, as a woman, am choosing to move to another country because I want that life for myself. And because this is a choice that as rational women should be allowed to make it. Also, we would just reject this characterization that women are incapable of making decisions when calculating their future, right? Give people more credit. Women, especially in cases of economic desperation, do not have the most rosy view of the world where they see their white knight riding off into the sunset ready to save them. We need that these women have realistic conceptions of what these relationships would look like and why they would not intrinsically be coercive."

First, we bring you to the idea of guaranteeing stability, because there are immediate needs that individuals require access to that cannot access in the country that these women may be originally from. Whenever they move to the generally wealthier country of their new husband, we think they get access to immediate needs. Like, for example, just moving to a more secure environment, being less exposed to things like unemployment, no jobs, or crimes, and things of that nature. Second, oftentimes it looks like a thing of a guarantee to shelter, so now you know that you have a house to live in, because that was probably required whenever you were discussing whether or not you wanted to move in with this man, especially if it's not out of love, as proposition characterizes it to you. Third, you may have things like an access to healthcare where you didn't before, that is covered probably under your spouse's plan. The second benefit that we get from this is that women can access their wants. They can live more economically comfortable lives. If the proposition's characterization is true, that these men have the money to be able to provide for these women and bring them over, we think they also probably have the money to be able to support both of them because those men wouldn't want to live lives of economic desperation just so that way they could have a wife. We think that they're very capable of writing for both of them. Note that this also engages with their material about children because we think these children's lives will also be materially better. The third benefit is the idea of exterior benefits. You're able to send things like remittances back to your home country. We think this necessarily benefits the lives of people who were not there in the first place. At the end of the day, this debate is extremely clear. Do know I promise you, for you, women are not toys, they can make their own choices."

Because when you go through these processes, you're likely not to give the best quality of life to these women in the first place. They don't engage with the majority of our principle. Because they do say these individuals do not have, do not have consent in many cases, but they don't really engage with the point of autonomy. It is not the same thing, right? On one set of the powers, we tell you that in the majority of cases, the fact that to a certain extent, you will no longer have control of your body and your life, meaning that the reason for why you did it is because you were contingent on something, was the principle that still stands. But what they answered was that these individuals might have consent upon it, right? Meaning that you do, like, legally say that you want to do this. But let's go into the mechanism before, right? Because they say, we will first of all check that these individuals were not criminals and check that, like, you're ensuring that this is informed consent. If this was the case, we would not have abusive relationships in the first place, right? This is ridiculous. If you could just ensure that people have not been abusive in the past, then individuals would not just, in developing countries, continue to have marriages after marriages, even when women have run from them, right? In the majority of cases, we don't think they even tell you how they are going to do this. But specifically when they talk about things such as, we are going to ensure informed consent, the next speaker has a very big degree of thinking, a second of telling us what does that look like, right? Because when you have no choice, you signing a document in which you say that you do consent to this is not really consent to the extent that you have to do this in many scenarios. But parts of the House, we have things and we incentivize for things such as the government and individuals subsidizing people to go to the country not contingent on the fact that they're going to get married and the government is more likely to support things like that. Just to clarify, we don't have a mechanism or like we don't have open borders or something like that. The only thing we're saying is as a stance we do support border control. We do things like lessening certain processes. They can have it on their side too, we just think this is something on the ideology over here. Before I go into your point on stability, yes. So you talked to us about how a bank industry typically goes underground, insofar as you say that the marriage industry is so bad, how is it whenever a guy exclusively has to operate on black people? I think that in your side of the house it's more likely for things such as human trafficking to occur in the moment in which you don't have checks and balances of understanding what things are happening or not. Because as long as we can prove to you that through this ban, it is less likely for these things to happen, we think that people that are clearly doing things such as human trafficking"

In the majority of cases, these people can't, because they have the possibility of exploiting these businesses and situations, just not provide for this shelter, not provide for this food, or just not allow for these women to go work and do these types of things, right? So to that extent we don't think you can ensure these types of things. On our side of the house we think the fact that there's little to no regulation is more likely for these abuses to happen, right? Usually talk about things such as they might have money to maintain them, but the fact that they're is that they might just have the incentive of not spending as much on that person and to the extent that we do things that you are not meaning to do that thing, you cannot ensure that this happens but the most of what we hear in the last speech comes to the verification of our case where they face the whole thing that women can make these choices I think this is extremely easy to answer into saying if you want to give the characterization that these women do not have any choice, you cannot simultaneously say that they made it on your, like, give the assumption that they made it entirely conscious of, like, what you're doing, right?"

The response that we hear from women who have lives before neglects the premise of the majority of migrants that in the status quo are not having the possibilities of reinserting in the first place into the systems, right? To the response in which they say women are a submissive and they give this example, we would say yes to the extent that this person was the one who took you to this country, to the extent that these are the people that took you through this process. We don't think that consent really exists in those scenarios. But let's really engage with that with a third argument, in which we tell you that this harms women, this harms women that are already in vulnerable positions because of their context. First of all, this is prone to abuse because of the sacrificing of women and families because of certain cultures. That is to say that in countries like Lebanon, where women are convinced by families to go to other countries through these processes so that they can send money back, even in the best case where like the man does care about them, you are legitimizing certain cultures in the first place in which these women are sacrificed. But recognize that in the majority of cases, these women will not even use this money to sustain themselves, as they have a duty to in many cases their families, in Lebanon. The majority of people that go through these processes send their money back home, and to the extent that they live in marginal conditions in this country, is extremely bad. This allows for exploitative systems, where they don't have the benefits that they think. But second of all, where you are burdening these individuals into existing in positions in which they cannot enjoy the the benefits that they claim. But second of all, where you are burdening these individuals into existing in positions in which they cannot enjoy the best cases of the opposition. But by this not being banned, the system takes advantages of legal structures of other countries. We think the moment that, for example, developed countries show these types of things, it is less likely for things such as the blurry lights on human trafficking to occur. It is more likely for things like human trafficking to occur because they don't have clear lights on what's happening. As long as we can reduce these types of situations in our side of the house, you cannot just take someone to the border through extreme coercion on your side of the house and saying that it was consensual because we still don't hear how is that this happens. But furthermore, people start becoming dependent on other methods that are offered. Meaning that in many cases, people might not just go through the legal systems and they can also go on their thirst out of the house because this is a stable and a band-aid solution. Autonomy relies on the idea that in the majority of cases the fact that in the long term you do not have the possibility of protecting yourself, that is bad. They have to engage with the bad case scenarios, which by the way is the most likely ones in which these people can just exploit these types of things. As long as we can prove to you that in the majority of cases where this happens, it's developing countries from Lebanon to Iran, or in cases from South Africa, from Nigeria to South Africa, we think that the exploitation and the characteristics that these people have will continue to occur."

Human trafficking does not go away on either side of the house. Secondly, we would say legality actually makes it easier to regulate the industry because it allows for a legitimate version of that industry to exist. Only malicious versions exist on their side of the house.

Three responses here. First, we would ask women once they arrived at the border, arrived at TSA, hey, is this legitimate consent? If not, they could then apply for asylum. We told you that in our model. Secondly, we would say it's irresponsible and privileged to assume that they're forced to do so. We would say in many cases, women actively take on this choice to benefit their family and send back remittances. And thirdly, we would say the comparative is far worse on their side of the house, because if it's true you have abusive family structures, why then would you make it more difficult for women to get there? At best, they find ways to abuse them in more abusive ways. What else does opposition give you? They basically say these marriages will lead to abuse because they're legally disadvantaged and are 100% submissive. We have five responses. First, this literally applies to all marriages, which have some degree of risk of having a badive. We have five responses. First, this literally applies to all marriages which have some degree of risk of having a bad spouse. We say they're focusing this debate in the most extreme cases. Secondly, we say women can make the active choice, meaning they're likely to know how they're going to help themselves. They can do things like seek help shelters. They have a better path to citizenship on our side of the house, or they can just seek asylum, like we told you, in opposition one. Thirdly, we would say the comparative is worse on their side of the house, because people still arrive and still people go through the spousal visa means, but at that point they're doing it illegally, at which point they are too afraid to go to the police because of the fact that they might have gone there through illegal means. Fourthly, we would say our model largely mitigates most of these scenarios because of the point in which we're requiring immigration enforcement to take background checks of these husbands. It is likely that the vast majority of malicious husbands will be flagged before the wife ever gets there. And fifth and finally, even in the worst case scenario, where the woman literally doesn't have access to the language, literally is isolated and locked at the house and has no access to friends or other people, their worst case scenario, we would still likely that that woman can Google in her own language on her phone and get access to a domestic violence helpline. In which case there are things like translation services, like literally the domestic violence helpline has different languages at the top. In which case, even in their worst case scenario, we think it is more than likely these people will find access to help. Because their scenario is so unlikely, we don't think you should refer it. Rather, a comparable material is that in the majority of cases, people can materially better their lives. Because it guarantees them stability, it gives them access to the economic privileges they want."

First, don't let the counterintuitiveness of this argument pass you by. Their argument is uphold people's autonomy. How do they do that? Restrict people's autonomy to make the choice to do something. Moreover, they literally say give up autonomy is giving up your humanity. We would say this justifies banning the poor from marrying the rich, but it's problematic because it feeds all of Unn's principled analysis because even if you think something is unsavory, it doesn't justify the government banning it. For example, we think many people might prefer the religion over their sexuality, or vice versa, meaning we think that is a very legitimate and intimate decision that people are allowed to make. Thirdly, look at the other things that we don't ban, things like marrying or pretending to be in love for someone for immigration. Their answer is practical, but at best, it undercuts their own principle. And fourth and finally, it's contingent on actually proving that it's harmful in the majority of cases. So even if you buy this principle about illegitimate contracts, they need to prove this is true in the vast majority of cases. And all of our practical analysis goes to show that even in their best cases contingent on the practical and that practical is not likely."

Transacting a person in exchange for a part of their service is literally human trafficking. Why is human trafficking wrong? Unlike human trafficking, where neither party consents, unlike slavery, where neither party consents, one of the two parties is literally consenting to that transaction. Moreover, unlike human trafficking or slavery where you would receive nothing in benefit of that transaction, the motion literally guarantees us that the woman is getting paid the immigration fees.

The second scenario is a debt strangle. We think even if that's not the case, people will find a way to immigrate through other, more these means. The second scenario is a debt strangle. We think even if that's not the case, people will find a way to immigrate through other, more traditional means. We didn't get out to spend, but this is less likely, but in that case, they have to spend even more capital on exorbitant legal fees. So when they arrive, they're saddled with debt, and that's true even if they're relatively well off, but it's particularly problematic when they arrive with bad credit. Employers don't want to give them a job, and there's general anti-immigrant sentiment. But the third scenario is they arrive through illegal means. These are the people who still want to immigrate, but these are the people already in a scenario of no alternatives, already in a scenario of domestic partner violence, in which case they try so hard they are more likely to subject themselves to things like human trafficking or crossing the border illegally.

What is happening is a woman has been deeply coerced by the situation of her country and by the concept of money that a man has that she is forced to essentially sell herself here.

If they are not submissive, if they do not fulfill the condition that these men set out for them, they are treated horribly."

And here's where we've got to touch upon the regulations, the ideas, we can magically figure out what type of men is abusive on their side of the house, right? We, first of all, think this is extremely unrealistic because, for a couple of reasons. We think, first of all, who are the type of men who actually undergo these transactions? These are generally men who have difficulty in romance or have some type of foreign fetish, right? We think at that point, you have men who are not likely to have a lot of romantic experience and who are therefore very difficult to regulate to see if they're abusive, right? We think these types of conditions that they set out on their side are completely unrealistic, right? Beyond that, we think a lot of abusers are extremely charismatic, are extremely good at lying, are extremely good at convincing people that they're doing nothing wrong, that have all the best intentions in the world. This is literally the baseline of an abusive relationship. It's super, super common. And we think that the point at which you can say, oh, you can just regulate this away, all the men are going to be wonderful people, is the point at which you don't understand how it is that these processes actually look like. Because what actually ends up happening? All of their second arguments about benefits of stability and healthcare fall flat. Because abuse is so, so, so common, specifically because of the lack of choice and autonomy that exists on our side, which is impossible to regulate, right? But let's look at the best case scenario, right? People might watch marriages, people who, you know, maybe the marriage gets a little bit okay, and maybe, you know, there's some healthcare here and there. We still think that the impacts on the environment are far worse on our side of the house. Why is this? First of which, they say that the minority situations are those where women can't speak the language and are completely isolated. Ladies and gentlemen, how many countries speak English? How many countries in these circumstances speak the same languages? The majority of situations are those where extremely vulnerable women are pushed into situations where they are deeply isolated, deeply confused, and have nowhere to go. We think at this point abuse is super, super common because the power dynamic here is one that is fundamentally different from a poor person marrying a rich person. It is one where the conditions of the trade-off, the conditions of the person getting here are those where I have more power than you, I understand this country, I fill up your visa, and therefore I control your environment because you don't understand where you are, you don't understand your community. This has impact on mental health, that words and dress that we think in and of themselves are awful, but beyond mental health, when you also end up doing it, keeping women in a cycle where they're perpetually alone and cannot find resources. The fact that you expect women to be able to Google things takes away the fact that A, a lot of men are going to take away these tools from these women because they see them as objects that they bought off, or B, they're going to run away and divorce themselves, right? We think that's a point where the best case scenario for a side opposition is one where women literally escape. It's a point where we much rather have a government that is actually incentivized to improve immigration, right? Because let's look at this point and go, oh, well, that doesn't matter, right? Because what actually happens at this point of, oh, well, that doesn't matter, right? Because what actually happens at our state of the house, we understand that a government that legalizes this thing is a government that has no incentive to improve immigration laws because now they have a really profitable business to keep women entering these areas and way, way easier for a way to actually not have these women undergo all of these processes."

Then, let's go on to our third argument, that of the ambiguity of the law. This is where the U.S. case becomes super U.S. centered. Because there's a couple of problems here. We told you in our third argument that in the military situations, what ends up happening in developing countries is that people who go from a developing country to a developed country uses the way to masquerade human trafficking. We therefore said that it is the responsibility of a developed country to say that these things should be banned, because if they don't do this, they it is the responsibility of a developed country to say that these things should be banned, because if they don't do this, they are increasing the harms of these developing countries to a point where this thing becomes extremely dangerous. To this, they said that, you know, we don't have to defend this, and also the black market becomes really bad on our side. We have a variety of responses to this. First, we think in the best-case scenario, this is a wash. The black market exists on both sides of the house as human trafficking. But we think the far more likely scenario is that if you don't ban this, what you are doing is you are legitimizing this. You are legitimizing this as a developed country. You are saying these developing countries with a lack of infrastructure, lack of government control, can maintain these practices and you as a developed country that can actually impose checks by banning this altogether and not having to wage flimsier regulations that clearly don't work, is one that is principally more just and principally helps more women actually escape these things. On our side, rather, you make the law far more clear. You say this is not allowed because this is clearly abusing exploitative immigration laws that we are going to try to resolve and improve, right? Because the inconsistency a team opposite us takes is that a government that both supports immigration laws and would not ban it is an inconsistent government. Because you have a far more consistent view of what a government should be doing in order to commit a violation, because you most help women, and because you understand the reality of the situation regarding autonomy and choice, we have definitively taken this debate.

              "text": "On the principled analysis, the framing issue here is that you should not buy side propositions Puritan 18th century view of marriage, where it's literally like some woman shackling themselves to a man. Women are not being sold. They are tricking rich people into paying their immigration fees. That is the characterization that we've given you on side opposition. The passive voice that their Proposition 3 continues to use when describing the situation is exactly what side opposition is critiquing. Because we're saying that the women on these mail-order bride sites make that active choice in a lot of instances. Proposition 3's argument about selling yourself to a man or selling yourself, their mechanisms apply to regular situations of immigration as well, as Uncorrectly points out in a POI. When they say that people are trying to make this desperate decision, that they're in these desperate situations, that would apply to literally almost any single decision someone can make. In fact, so many of their mechanisms just apply to regular marriages,, which is something that we push throughout the side of the space. It is likely that opposition is correctly on the principle. But what is the implication of this principle? This means that if they've proven the most extreme hypotheticals where they keep adding conditions upon conditions upon conditions to resolve every single scenario that we bring up, then they're only proving in a minority of cases that it's not legitimate consent. But from off one, we told you the burden on them is to prove an intrinsic harm to this industry, which justifies a government ban. Given that they've not done that, they're not going to win the principal analysis, and they're not going to justify a ban, which incidentally is the first burden the Proposition 3rd speaker placed on themselves, which means that they've lost this debate. The third thing that I want to touch on is the direct benefits of engaging in this practice. The Proposition 3 3 dismissed these benefits as like a little health care, as if we were like sprinkling salt on a dish. It's not like a little health care. It's a lot of things that people choose to directly engage in to better their lives, to send remittances back to their families, to economically engage in mobility, and to have some shot that they think that they have. But Proposition's main argument here is touching on domestic abuse and the abusiveness of the relationship, which is why I'm going to spend the last two whole minutes of my speech talking about this argument. The first thing I want to touch on here is that the three's characterization of this argument applies to all marriages. Think about the power structure the three is talking about. Just having a different language or not having friends. The state does not ban all marriages because some marriages have some conditions on them that would result in a power dynamic because then we would literally not have marriages whatsoever. Rather, the solution is to target by intimate partner violence as itself, but not in ban of practice that may apply to other things. When the two tells you a characterization, like having a child creates a power dynamic where you may not want to leave your family, know that this is a decision, unfortunately, that so many women have to make regardless of what type of marriage that they're in because they may want to make the decision between preserving their family or tearing their family apart. That's why these discussions matter so much because the decisions women have to make are so, so complicated in every side of the House. But the difference between our sides of the House is that we recognize that these are women's decisions, not the government's. The second thing I want to touch on here is that we support a lot of measures to mitigate this. We've told you from our Opposition 1 that we support background checks. No, this will not solve weird, fetishy men that they're talking about on their side of the house. Obviously not. No government policy would ever solve that nonsense. But the whole point is we're able to mitigate all of these things. The thing that we also support on our side of the house is things like asylum measures. There are so many measures that you can use. You can attempt to find a friend. You can attempt to call a domestic violence hotline. All of these things exist. But the comparative is always worse, given the first argument I've made in this speech. But the last thing I want to say is if you find yourself finding the proposition's mechanisms applying to all marriages, consider whether you would consider banning all of those marriages to resolve this problem."

We told you they know how to seek help shelters, seek asylum from the government, use their new path of citizenship to escape their husband, or literally, get this, use Google.

But autonomy is the main part of this argument where we say you are selling yourself, you're selling your liberty to a long extent. That is to say they do have to engage with what happens if like a man just doesn't allow for you to do certain things, right? If they start being abusive. To the extent that they only answer, ah, but they'll give you a home, right? To the extent that we said in our second speech they can can just not do that, and we still fulfill the fact that in many cases they can just disengage at the point at which they want, and these people are left alone, there is an issue, right? Autonomy does rely on the fact that having a trade-off in the first place was an issue, right? We talk about the fact that the government"

In the moment in which we are just using these speech, people, as an influence, we do think that the point of autonomy and of this trade-off does still stand, right? We told you about that the reason why the principle stands is because we are capable of proving to you that the places that we are talking about is individuals that, in the best cases, are doing something that is wrong because there is a conditional to it, right? No matter where you come from, no matter what the purpose is, this principle is still contingent. When our second speech, we say, maybe that's not the majority of cases, right? Let's also talk about people that are coming from backgrounds. They just say that's a contradiction, which we move to our second point of question. Because we talk about, they talk about the fact that the motion just assumes that they paid a treat. But when we ask what happens when they just disengage with these women who receive no answer, they talk about the fact that in the worst cases they can just go to the asylum or to call services. We said, A, that is US-centric, and if that was true, we think people would just do it in the first place, right? If your systems were as effective, people should not go through these systems. They would just apply to asylum in the first place. They are not telling you why this is wrong in the first place. For them to tell you that other things are wrong doesn't mean that we should not ban this one specifically, right? Because what we are capable of telling you is that if these countries were so good, then you would not have these types of changes in the first place, and these women should not have to make this trade-off on like, tricking men, this would not happen, right? We told you, and this is the most important thing that you should vote on, that you have a disincentive to better the system. We hear no response in our first speeches, right? And even if you don't buy that, the fact that we received no answer does win us over the debate. Because as far as the second and third speech we told you, less people are likely to just subsidize a migrant to go if they can just make them marry them is a very important thing, right? There is a disincentive for governments to have better policy, to have better engagement with these individuals. As far as we are capable of telling you that this regulation is going against men that cannot be regulated because they come as for things such as petitions and other interests and they say this cannot be regulated, but we are capable of proving to you that that is the majority of cases, they don't have a case in which to stand for those reasons we are opposed. Okay, teams. First of all, I want to congratulate you. When I saw this motion I thought, what is it? What is happening?"

But the outcome is different, Mr. Speaker. Because they target these women are vulnerable, they target these children are so vulnerable that they are weak, they are nonviolent, that leads to propose. I'm going to talk about mainly three things. First, see how this dominant narrative badly influenced post-conflict zone sexism. Secondly, how this dominant narrative is badly affecting these women and children regarding these kind of terrorist attacks. Thirdly and lastly, how this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexisms. So first thing first, about this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexisms.

What happens is that peacekeeping operation and humanitarian aid enters conflict zones and prioritize women and children than the men.

They need some kind of class, they need some kind of money, they need some kind of reward that they have done in conflict zones. Therefore, they cannot give away their money or their tax revenues to women because they think that they were already saved by the Western society, they were already prioritized, then our lives in the conflict zones. We believe in that kind of scenario that leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker, that those males are getting reward and women not getting nothing in return because they have already got those kind of rewards or the treatments during those kind of conflict zones. We believe, rather, like saving those kind of women and males equally leads to the betterment of these kind of situations because those kind of male victims cannot to the betterment of these kind of situations.

Therefore, what those kind of Western media is doing is the opposite of their aim, Mr. Speaker.

We believe that is important as well. So by picturizing women as weak and nonviolent actors, that is going to make people unconsciously sexist toward women.

              "text": "Before that, I'll present the response to the Prime Minister. Firstly, they say that this dominant narrative incentivizes terrorists to exclusively target women in the conflict areas. Firstly, we do consider that status quo is not perfect, but we think that due to this narrative, the situation is currently going to be changed. For example, the criminal court actually introduced rape or sexual assault as crimes against humanity. And the international recognition that sexual assault kind of requires special recognition. And also, international criminal court bashing towards the ignorance of the government who has the inability to deal with those sexual assaults. But furthermore, when it comes to the media's emphasis on gaining attention, we think terrorist groups are also already relying on the other kind of thing. For example, they are relying on the suicide attack or they are relying on the indiscriminate killing. This is even more attractive when it comes to getting attention through the media. So I don't think this is the core motive for the terrorist groups to exclusively target women on the ground. They say that male protection is going to be on the mind, compared to the females. But as I explained earlier, we think that given that women are likely to need special protection, we think it's proportionate and we think it's good. Lastly, they say that this is a dominant narrative is linked to the post-context system. But we think that if those leaders or men in the society have the intention to discriminate women, we think that they are going to anyway find any excuse to discriminate women or let's reward women on the ground. Maybe for example, they may say that due to their pregnancy, women cannot unfortunately work exactly the same as the men or so forth. Those kind of excuses, anyway, sexists are going to find that kind of excuse and discriminate women. But furthermore, even in that case, we have to be confident. Why it's also a very kind of social position of the aspect of post-conflict study, it's kind of more important than the immediate help of the women and the conflict. We think it's the other way around."

So in general, women are fortunately likely to be comparatively more vulnerable than men for several reasons. Firstly, physically, women are likely to be weaker or less physically capable to fight back at exactly the same level as men. It's just that women are likely to be the target of the bombings. But furthermore, women are exclusively likely to be the target of sexual assault on the ground. We do recognize that men also can be the victim of sexual assault, but we think the rate is disproportionately higher on the men, female, right? We look at the reality, for example, we come to the abduction by the terrorist group like O'Hara, that almost all, most of the victims of the abduction are like the teenage girls in the school, and they're abducted by the terrorist group on the fourth of March, right? So we think in the reality context, that those who are individual women are more likely to be targeted, and we think they need special protection. But furthermore, maybe certain need sanitary protection due to biological features. Maybe for example, pregnant mothers who need much more protection, who are more vulnerable, etc. So we think that women are likely to be relatively more vulnerable, than they need special protection and support."

So we think that firstly, that those dominant narratives allow the peacekeeper operation, intervening military or any other individual etc. to provide more support to the women on the ground. Maybe for example, when we come to this shelter which has a lot of women, maybe we can deploy more soldiers so that we are able to protect them more. Or for example, we are giving them extra support, medical support, sanitary support for pregnant women, etc. And also, support is going to be available on the other side of the house. And also, as I already told you, the ICC's recognition of rape or sexual assault as a crime against humanity are also introduced due to this dominant narrative that recognizes women as more vulnerable and more violent. And we think it's beneficial. But secondly, this dominant narrative allows the... I'd like to say. Okay, sure.

It's kind of hard for individuals to imagine what kind of support they are going to need. We think the dominant narrative allows those kind of resistant individuals who are carrying the potential donors to the energy or support towards the women on the ground. They are going to think that women may need, for example, special sanitary protection, or maybe want to need extra protection, extra deployment for the military due to the heightened of the sexual assault. And we think that's also the recognition of the world. Understanding of the exact necessity of the sport is very important, right? Because in order to maximize the utility of the benefit from the sport and the donation, we think that this is critically important. So overall we think that given that unfortunately that women are more likely to be vulnerable and target as a special crime, we think that it's beneficial and reasonable to use the dominant narrative to support and help them."

But we think that in places where in conflict zone, we think that not only, like, women are suffering of getting raped. For example, think that in places where in conflict zone, we think that not only women are suffering of getting raped. For example, in places like in Congo, there are many children and many also men getting killed brutally. Maybe they cut their limbs because they think that cutting limbs would actually make their opponents weaker. And we think that those kind of brutal images can be shown even in our side of the house. And we think that if media can find other images that are very shocking, they have incentive to do it. So we think that even if women is not being raped, and they don't show a dominant narrative that women being raped, we think that it can also attract the media's attention if some people are actually suffering. And we think that because there's an overt dominant narrative that women are getting, for example, suffering, we think that the amount of resources used to save the men or other people are not going to be used. And we think, at the end of the day, we think that the amount of people that can be saved are going to be the same. We think on our side, maybe less women are saved, we can see to that.

And we don't understand why they want to prioritize women over men. We think all lives are equal and if men are more protected, we think that in itself is not really a bad thing. We think there are a lot of men who are suffering and we think at the end of the day the number of people who are with us is the same."

So second, I want to talk about which is better for the female at the end of the day. So firstly, about during the conflicts. So we think that because we actually internalize those, because NGOs or the West actually prioritize protecting women, we think women have less capacity to actually protect themselves. What do I mean by this? Because there is no necessity for capacity to actually protect themselves. What do I mean by this? Because there is no necessity for women to actually maybe arm themselves because the West is there to protect them. And because the West thinks that you have to be protected. We think that is why women themselves do not arm themselves. They said that women are vulnerable, so that is why women are not able to protect themselves. But we think this narrative in itself actually makes women vulnerable. We think women in themselves can to protect themselves. But we think this narrative in itself actually makes women vulnerable. We think women in themselves can actually protect themselves. So if you have a gun, even if your man is much more masculine and have much more physical strength, you can kill that another person. So we think that physical stress in itself is not a matter in this debate. So we think that those women can arm themselves. And when they feel that they are capable to arm themselves, they won't be able to do it. But because they have this dominant narrative, they're so strong, they're not able to arm themselves, and when women feel that they are capable to arm themselves, they won't be able to do it. But because they have this dominant narrative so strong, they're not able to arm themselves. They think that they are vulnerable, they lose hope and protect themselves. And that actually leads the women to being targets of, for example, a lot of terrorist groups, or they are getting targeted of getting raped. We think this narrative in itself makes women weak. Are you saying if this narrative doesn't exist, can you make women suddenly take guns and fight against men and protect themselves? I'm talking about being comparative. I don't think this is an absolute solution, but we have to be comparative. That at least women will feel that, oh, I have to protect myself on my own. And we think that, and that means that men will fear that, oh, if I actually attack this woman, maybe I might get like killed. We think, we think that like kind of like, we think that the people's like thinking is going to change. And we think that women is going to be less target. And we also think that they're going to be less target of like, for example, like Boko Haram or ISIS. And we think they never actually refused to do that."

The woman is less contributing, so let's get them less friends.

They told us what sort of sexism and action it actually leads to, and I think the logic is very blurred. And also, we have to recognise that, you know, in these areas, or universally, helping women and children first as a man is a pride of a man, it's seen as a responsibility of a man. Also in any form of conservative religion, it's seen that it's the responsibility of the man to protect women and children first. That also adds to the fact that they won't see that they are deprioritised or they are being abandoned, they see it as a pride that women are actually given more support. They will facilitate to let women go on with it. So it's wrong for them to say that men are so greedy and go on with it. We think that those men do exist but are a minor part of society. And we think that's a bizarre characterization. But also, even if we can see that sexism might happen to a certain scenario, we think that it's far less important that people being saved by the fact that they were given sanitary goods. They're saved by the fact that they were given food and clothing or protection from mosquitoes and things like that. That was only possible because they had a substantial amount of aid provided to these people. And we think that's far, talking about the lives of the individuals in that vulnerable situation, this bit of blood sex is far less important than that. Then, they also talk about from FPM and BPM that, you know, they are seen vulnerable, so terrorists are likely to more attack them. Or men are like to say that they are weak, so you should obey us or use it as a rhetoric for sexism and things like that.

There are reasons to say that, you know, for terrorists, they are intuitively weak in the physical sense. They are intuitively, like, they may have greed for sexual desire, so there are other reasons to attack women first, unfortunately, as men, male soldiers. Or they simply think that they have an extremist view, so for example, Islamic beliefs that say that they should subordinate women, so they should attack first instead of men, or they might have this strategic interest in attacking women groups, this historical know-how, as tribes and things like that. And given the fact that terrorists often don't really care about it, it's that this additional one reason of a narrative doesn't really change their calculus, because they already have tens of other reasons to do that. If the tens of other reasons don't change their calculus, I don't understand why this bit of a narrative that these terrorist people haven't been exposed to maybe has any influence to it. And even if not, because even if you add it, because there's not much of a difference, the substantial difference is really unclear. Even to make male, trying to make it obedient, this sexist belief or preferences of men to go on with it already exist. This bit of narrative that exists in the context also has no clear method. Sorry. It amplifies that narrative, but it's not clear to what extent that's important. No, thank you. But also importantly, this narrative, as they set up, is a broadcasting of Western media. It's not about how the narrative formates in the conflict zone, but rather about people around the area. Not in the area, but around the world. And we also think that also proves the fact that influence, as they once suggested, is not that huge. Sure. So, when have you found that these conservative sexisms are quite minor, limited to not minor people? Now, as you're saying that a lot of conservative sexism does exist, so women will be able to get up with it. Which is it? There are a lot more conservative or less conservative? I'm saying that if they do exist, it's that it's not going to be really a big issue. So we're not saying that they're a majority. I don't really get it.

It's the same thing that it was necessary for the discussion and investigation of female issues, even of course, that we needed social pressure to have women being protected. Because in the past, the PKO's reporting didn't even have a section for gender or women. We didn't really investigate the rape. It was all just about protecting against guerrillas and things like that. The only reason why this section was created was because this vulnerability showed more social pressure on what's going on with women. Are women really okay looking at the vulnerability of it? That led to United Nations moving, various other nations moving and forming this sort of section and that revealed the necessity of the recognition of rape and things like that. So yes, there's no connection, but visceral vulnerability is what leads to investigation and check and balances that often leads to better consequences like ICC, why it's so important. So, it's substantive. Why the use of vivid image is so important. Importantly, the support to these areas are vital to survival of people on the ground. It might be aid, it might be intervention, it might be sanctions, but all of this is contingent on the fact that you have a necessary critical mass of people who care about the area, who are angered by the situation and want to support these areas. The more support and attention you have, you have more people saved, or quickly saved because of interventions that were done a bit more quicker. Obviously, the sympathy that is created by the image of the media is enhanced when you use more, unfortunately, more vulnerable-looking actors. The use of the image of a woman is far more vulnerable looking than a man. Also religious narratives and social narratives about how men should be obliged to protect women also enhance the fact that when women are put in vulnerable positions compared to men, it provokes some emotional feelings that they should protect them compared to men. They do have the two of children in their satellite house too, but the mixed use of women would also lead to accelerated power for to have more attention in these areas and that increased amount of power means that we are able to save these people on the ground more and that means that more aids come around the satellite house. So they say that men are going to receive less aid but if the power is increased they don't receive less. But also even if we can see that men don't receive sufficient aid, it's that men have more energy and vitality compared to women, so they've been deprivatised in the situation of aid. It's far less important that women are being provided of their actual needs on the ground. Shortly on why dominant narrative. Unfortunately, people, when they want to actually help a certain area, they just donate the things that they actually think they need. But the clothing or the food that they actually provide might not be a necessary thing. It might be a burden to the actual area. To prevent that, it's important that people expose the image of what actually women need. The image that women are suffering in this particular way through the Western media provides them the understanding that the issues are rare, issues are sanitary conditions. You need napkins instead of actual, these random foods or clothing and things like that. That's only possible when the dominant narrative is also public and people are preemptively aware of the possible situation. Inexperienced NGOs also will be able to be aware of the situation and not provide random unnecessary things, but actual needy things for women. That's only possible when we can have a narrative and not an alternative, systematic approach. Thank you."

              "text": "Are we talking about two things? One, is dominance necessary? Second, what is the effect of this narrative to society, especially in a conflict zone? Firstly, so what we heard from opposition, small number of materials, we won't dispute it because we also have small number of materials. One, they told us dominance is necessary because, one, it incentivized ICC to regard sexual rape as a crime. So we should have a discussion that we should also care about it. Because people have further discussion and people have thought deeply about this woman's non-violence or vulnerability, we should include rape as a crime, so forth. Firstly, we think that's wrong. Still, we don't understand this idea of this non-violence or vulnerability leads to rape being regarded as crime itself, right? I think the Western male already knew in the 1980s and 1990s that women tend to be non-violent as a political position. Women tend to be vulnerable compared to men. The reason I think, the more plausible reason is, they have been dismissing this idea of rape is because they have been quite male-centric, right? They don't care about this female agenda in these developing countries right now. I think they have been criticized a lot by the NGOs, or female movement, that even though you're saying that as an NGO or ICC that you're going to protect the vulnerable, you're not really protecting those females who have been brutalized in the underground, right? And we think that's the criticism that has worked, and that's why ICC become more gender neutral, right? I think that is more plausible explanation. I don't think this idea of saying that non-violence or vulnerability are the dominant narrative was necessary for the ICC to incentivize the current rate. That's like, obviously out of debate. Second, they told us from the opposition, the dominance is necessary because you can get more aid, so PKO can get more support. Firstly, we already have told you that if the Red Cross needs a picture to incentivize people to donate, they still can have children. What we heard from BLO is that no, having one children is less better than having children and wives. I don't get it. I think having three children for brutalized booking is tantamount to showing children are mothers. People don't make value judgment a difference on that point. If there are lots of people who are brutalized and seem so horrible, they are going to donate anyway on our side of the house. There is no exclusivity on this. But more than that, we have to realize that the amount of donations that opposition is so half-ed about is not really important that much because the number of donations they can get from the individual donor is going to be far, far more smaller compared to this huge chunk of donation that is given by the state powers from the United States, Japan, and Britain. We also have to have this in consideration. People and the entire society of citizens don't care how much money I've been giving to those developing countries in terms of donations in terms of ODAs. That's why we don't even remember how much we've been paid to those developing countries in terms of donation in terms of early aids right that's why we don't even remember how much we've been paid to China for example last year as our citizens right so we think out of political decisions they can fund a lot based on the necessities right so we don't think it's a comparative marginal benefit of aid even if that does exist it's not that much of a dis-significance right we think we can give the same amount of aid on both sides. Second, they told us dominance is necessary because people can understand this problem about sanity, right? So that's why people look at it as videos, NGOs, and so forth. Firstly, that again does not necessitate a dominant narrative itself, right? We're happy for NGOs to say there are specific problems for women, that there's problems happening about sanity. Even if that's necessary, we'm happy for those people to do it. But move it. I don't get it, right? Because people are just going to make a donation, and as they said, they told us, it's going to be easier for people to see that women's are being brutalized, and that image is far easier for people to donate, right? And if the NGO receives a huge amount of chunk of money from the donors, then they can just allocate it to the special needs, right? If the NGO at the local places in Afghanistan thinks that their certain sanitary program does exist, we have to give a special treatment to women, they can do it by themselves, right? Why is it necessary for the population in the United States to understand that this specific technological problem, all this is happening in Afghanistan, they can just receive lots of aid, NGO can adjust it, we think that's fine, right? So there are a lot of specificity on this point. And second, so let's talk about the impact for the entire population by second class."

We want to fix this conservative and modern conservative, but as a Western country, to show the sense that we want to treat those people equally, and you should treat the female and male equally, and forget about this conservative value in ourded society and that we think more likely the developing countries follow our stance. Yes. So here it looks like you regret the broadcasting, you totally change the stance and regret the theoretical dominant situation. What do you support, you need to compare how broadcasting has happened, what sort of narrative should exist? We want a society where broadcasts kind of become, I guess. We just want to oppose domination itself. So what we're saying is, maybe if the ones, for example, CNN broadcasts the way women have been brutalized, we're not opposing itself. What we're saying is, the BBC, CNN, Russia Today, whatever, all sorts of media broadcasts are keep repeating the word, it is always the women and children who have been brutalized. We want to avoid the dominance itself."

              "text": "With that being said, I'll talk about two things in my speech. First of all, during conflict, the pet side can better protect people in it, including men. And also, I want to secondly talk about post-conflict sexism and post-conflict female rights that is also talked about by the government side. So firstly, we told you from Dikti earlier about the position that pilot aids can be changed in our cyber-halls. They are talking about the pilot aid of the necessary AIDS for male victims are suddenly deprived in our cyber house and it's very unfortunate. But we told you, right, because it is a very shocking image, it is attracting many people in Western media and Western countries to pay attention to those kind of situations and actually they are shocked and surprised. They are incentivized to to those kind of situations, actually they are shocked and surprised. They are incentivized to help those kind of nations. We think that is a unique mechanism how people are going to help those kind of situations in their side of the house. Only what was coming from government today was that detection of children is enough. But firstly, it's inconsistent with Prime Minister because they are saying that rape, women, or those kind of detection is very effective for Western media to attract audiences in the outside of the house. And also pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate children and women, because in a complex situation, in many cases, children and women are running together towards safe spaces, and they are detected together in the outside of the house. That's why we think, pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate women and children as vulnerable outside the asylum house. That's why, Mr. Speaker, we think our side is even better for men because total PI of AIDS will increase in the asylum house. And also it is going to increase more accessibility for men because TKO and people in TKO don't say, because you are men, you shouldn't receive this kind of medicine, this kind of support. That's why fire spray is increased. It also increases the necessary care for men in outside the house. Also, we talked about special care for women. And they say, NGOs can say, there is special care necessary for women. That's enough. But it's consistent with our case, Mr. Speaker. We told you there is special care necessary for women. That means women are particularly vulnerable in their health. They are on the side of government, and they are on our narrative, Mr. Speaker. They also told you that there is an international effort to protect women by this narrative. Like, it wasn't by the Silk Road as they cast, like, crime against humanity. Then they said, like, government is not due to this narrative, and it's rather because we became sensitive to female rights and human rights in general. But it's true to some extent, but intuitive recognition that women should be helped, women need help from those kind of humanitarian clients. We think that is also the pushing power and driving forces for international community to pay attention to the situation of women itself. It's not a logical connection between human rights or those kind of things. We intuitively think they need help, that's why we help them. That's the unique mechanism we told you from the earlier about opposition. And also we told you that big narrative is not so important for militants there. Anyway, terrorists kill many people. Anyway, those kind of conservative people will kill women. But we told you at least militant and legitimate entity are carrying it because they're the human, crime against humanity, or those things. That's why in a comparative manner, we think that we're trying to, we are successfully helping more women in outside of the house. So, above all, their case might be standing in a logical level, but after we explain the context and characterization of the situation of the people there, their argument wasn't realistic in most chaotic situations in the world. They don't care about those kinds of human rights. Then also, they are like, they will be, um, okay, okay, so moving on to my second point. So, from their side of the house, they said the reason why women are less treated in a post-conflict society was that male victims weren't safe while women are already safe. And also that men feel they deserve reward or higher rights because they contribute to the ends of conflicts than women. But Mr. Stieker, regardless of the existence of this narrative, women have relatively more difficulty in contributing to the conflict of humanitarian crisis in this military purpose of physical contribution. Because just because we remove those kind of narratives, women are not suddenly going to participate in military, so not trying to solve the humanitarian crisis in their side at all. So which is better? In their side, women are not recognized as non-vulnerable, and maybe sometimes violent, but they are not contributing to the conflict. But in our side of the house, women have justification not to contribute to the conflict, because they are vulnerable, they're physically, comparatively weaker. That's why they systematically couldn't contribute to the conflicts. That's why, even though they didn't contribute to the, like, conflicts, they don't they are not recognized as so irresponsible after the dot-com thing. We told you how, right? And also they are saying that in post-conflict society we were targeted on the 3D, we were told not to wear slatty clothes, this dot-com thing. But we are not talking about those kinds of narratives. Because we are talking about narratives like conflict, right? Maybe things come through rural societies, come to more safer places, it is different, dominant morality, women can do anything that they want. We see we are talking about narrative in conflict, post-narrative, during the conflict situation, totalitarianism, we see, even though, logically, there are some arguments standing, we see even though post-compact female rights we are seeing outside the house."

So children might be sufficient, but they miss out on the important individuals and conflicts, like feminists or other individuals. But also, see, it also lacks a nuance when we tell you that, you know, it's too much of a particular role because they're associated with sexual bullying like rape or gruesome attacks and things like that. That sort of narrative is impossible when you only use children. That is the most tragic and constant detrimental situation that people don't even imagine it.

We see that movement should make a strategy based on the context or situation that that movement is in, and they should not stick to unrealistic or too idealistic goal, although it actually sounds nice. To talk this point, let's first examine what kind of context are we talking about? We're talking about that country which, of course, have not legalized gay marriage yet, for example in the country like India or Malaysia, but those countries are liberal to some extent that they at least do not criminalize being LGBT in the first place, but yet they are less supporters to achieve gay marriage and there are still some several people who are actually being discriminatory towards those people. And secondly, we also see that it's almost impossible for those countries to legalize in short term. It almost seems like it takes forever to actually legalize gay marriage. Why is that so? Because the concept of marriage, which is actually rooted in those communities, is really difficult to change. Because marriage actually has a deep cultural meaning for those countries. People somehow stick to the concept of marriage because that is something that they have been having for, and there is something that is used to them. And that's why we say some people are really afraid of that change and sometimes because they see that accepting gay marriage is actually those system as a marriage is falling apart. Because we say that and this is especially true since some people are still like really a discriminatory for those LGBT people right those discriminatory people do not want them to be in the same system. And that's why we say they have the huge incentive to pressure the government not to legalize those kind of marriage at first. And that's why we say it really takes longer time."

              "text": "So what kind of strategy we should take is that we have to make a partial compromise. And we have to seek, Even if it's not complete we should seek for like more like more like really viable options for example we should make and Why is it so because? Movement is not necessarily standing for the movement itself. The movement is standing for the individuals who are actually believing in the movement is not necessarily standing for the movement itself. The movement is standing for the individuals who are actually believing in the movement. That's why we say we should maximize the benefits that most individuals can get. And that's why we say that movement should not stick to the short-term benefit because by doing so, they have to put down, for example, those LGBT people who want to get married and totally suffering that because they can never have marriage or they can never have those kind of system to the hope of marriage for next 30 or 40 years, right? And also secondary, it has to be realistic to some extent because we see, as I'm going to talk in my second point this kind of short-term compromise actually leads to success in the future and that's why we see the example in the past for example those countries who once criminalized LGBTQ what those countries did in the first is to decriminalize LGBT individuals not to achieve the complete equality. And that's why we say we also see that the feminist movement in the first place is to legalize the right, not to achieve the full equality which actually comes later, right? And we have to say that by making those kind of partial compromise, those momentaries actually succeeded. And that's why as a conclusion, we should, even to seek for the long-term benefit, and we... Civil unions allow you to become, for example, together parents of a child, or you can adopt the same last name. These probably go against the cultures of the communities you're talking about. How is civil unions a viable option that gets you this idealistic world? Even if we recognize what he says, we say still the civil unions is actually better because we don't really have to do something with the courage which is really rooted in people's mind. So going back to my point, the conclusion of this point is that in opposition to the status of paradigm, what they can do in the next 30 or 40 years to achieve nothing. So you can have an individual actually suffering from the system, but what we can do is to achieve 70% of what they want in 4 or 5 years. And then we can actually move to the system, but what we can do is to achieve 70 percent of what they want in four or five years, and then we can actually move to the next step. So, secondary, why we can achieve the better outcome even if you look at the long-term?"

              "text": "That the internal conflict within the supporter and within the organization will highly likely to happen because the LG the momentum of the LGBTQ and membership of also the LGBTQ is not so the one way rather have the merit much more spectrum normally the moderate individual have that they can satisfy with the legalization of civil union rather also the people on the radical have the massive incentive to require the complete equality by requiring the gay marriage within that movement itself. Those people on the radical have a loser incentive to cooperate with the mainstream LGBTQ movement itself. Why is that? Because those people on the radical will see that the mainstream LGBTQ movement is a moderate or the loser of that competition of the negotiation table itself. That's why they would rather lose the incentive to cooperate, rather leave from the organization and establish the new movement itself. Why is it helpful? Because it causes a decrease of the structural power of that one single unified movement itself. For example, the case of the social status of the LGBTQ movement, or the negotiation power with the other opponent of the regional district, or the state institution, etc. To achieve, to negotiate with others, financial status or the social status or the reputation from society is absolutely important. That's why when people see the conflict those people also have losing incentive to cooperate or sympathize that conflicted organization what kind of the people will lose incentive also on their side of the house to characterization number one particularly the people in the middle not the liberal not the conservative also that we lose the incentive to cooperate that rather than hesitate to provoke by seeing that conflicted organization discussion, by seeing the Facebook, by seeing the Twitter discussion, etc. And more importantly, gay people in the Christian community will also lose the sympathy to the corporation or the hegemonic organization itself, because for those people, the LGBTQ movement requirement for gay marriage is the last resort to voice out their open sexuality itself But that's why the legalization of the civil union team tend to be the Compromisation or the lose the competition itself. How it is so harmful comparatively speaking the time frame on our side of the house We can achieve the better consequences. How do we achieve that? Four levels analysis First of all gay marriage is to some extent the catchy phrases that's why the people who middle can also recognize it is a spiritual bond with a specific lover their own their own fundamental but the sounds of the sounds of legal civil union is to some extent unpopular because the people or middle have no uh have this knowledge of knowing about what is the civil union what is in detail in explanation but etc etc and also the media doesn't have any we lose incentive to pick up the moment of the requirement and opinion of LGBTQ movement itself why is it because the gay marriage for example the case of the Japan Supreme Court trial the hanging of the gay marriage that is so catchy and sensational that's why the media have an incentive but change shift the stars to the legalization of the gay marriage is so catchy and sensational, that's why the media have an incentive, but shift the stance to the legalization of the civil union is to some extent comprecy, or difficult to understand in detail, that's why the media also lose the incentive. And also, secondly, vast majority of individuals, heterosexuals, see marriage as a fundamental right for all individuals. That's why those individuals will lose and will not understand what exactly we mean by the civil union on the side of government itself. That's why it is also directly harmful. And sadly, even if they can achieve their personal civil union on their side of the house, supporters and people who are moderating will get the satisfaction by only achieving the civil union itself. For example, the case of the feminist movement. The momentum of the feminist movement is still so decreased after the women's suffrage has been achieved in 1920 in the United States of America. Why is it? Because once the feminist movement gets satisfaction by achieving the suffrage and voting right for women, other issues are connected by the society and by the supporter itself. That kind of scenario is highly likely to happen on the side of the parliament. And fourthly, step by step can never be achieved on their side of the house, because the negotiation table and also the negative side will lose an incentive to rather cooperate and negotiate with others, because they will see that those LGBTQ movement is very sneaky movement because they will shift the stance legalization of civil union to the gay marriage, etc. etc. That kind of scenario will highly likely happen on the side of anti-paradise. That's why it does not happen. But in comparison, to achieve the civil union also on our side of the house is better, because the conservative and also the state institution will start to compromise by getting the requirement from the gay marriage and radical requirement from the LGBTQ movement itself. That's why, for example, in Shibuya or in Setagaya, the regional district of Japan starts to introduce the civil union as one of the trigger to make up the platform for the LGBTQ movement itself. That's why to achieve the goal from the side of bounty, catchy phrases or radical phrases absolutely necessary to get attention from society and also to unite the movement in one single unification, we are very proud to oppose. of our two hosts."

They somehow believed that moderate people would pay attention to the gay movements, they would go to sport. But notice, at the same time, by using the catchy phrases, you attract attention came from the conservative people, homophobes, and Christian movements and stuff like that. They're more innocent gentlemen, attraction will be, there is at least a not mutually exclusive, because when the liberal pay attention, at the same time conservative pay attention. We also see on this comparison, we think in the conservative contest, the attention came from the conservative people, we more like, is more, because we're talking about the conservative contest, we think therefore the catching phrases is rather counterproductive? Then they said, media will pay attention, we will sensationalize these kind of things. Yes, we agree. But we agree, what we say here is media is sensationalized in a bad way, ladies and gentlemen. Because we are not necessarily talking about the countries not only like Japan, we are also talking about the countries like Russia, like India, countries like that.

First thing they said is there is a people, first there will be a conflict because of liberal supporters, radical supporters, don't like the LGBTQ movement shifting the stance. Three responses. Firstly, there is also a people who want to be realistic, who want to be moderate as well. These people on their side of the house get mad at these kind of movements, stick into the unrealistic stance. Therefore, on this class, there is a comparison. Whether the backlash from extreme supporters or the backlash from these realistic supporters, moderate supporters. We think in terms of number, moderate supporters are much more than these kind of radical supporters. That's the reason why, even though feminists are being moderate right now, there is a kind of criticism of the backlash from radical groups like FEMIN. However, feminists still maintain their united movement, because the moderate supporter in this feminist movement supports this kind of moderate stance. Secondly, we say even these kind of radical people at least not necessarily go back to a civil union. Why? Because they will be happy with a civil union, because 80% of the marriage is the same in a civil union. They are somehow content with a realistic option. Certainly, more importantly, it anyway happens from the backlash from extreme people. Why? Given the fact that this kind of unrealistic agenda is not viable, these extreme people will get mad at the movement who are consistently failing to achieve the policy that these extreme supporters want. They will think regardless movements are incompetent, not successful, failing. They will get mad at this kind of failing movement therefore on their side of house given the fact this marriage in this context are so culturally fetishized and any kind of option to legalize gay marriage itself is not viable therefore these kind of people extreme supporters will get one anyway rather on their side of house therefore is the country intuitively it's gonna worsen off their side of house the reason why you said it is, you said that 80% is same. Why the people who are watching the concert think that it's realistic? Because you're using the different word for marriage which is unfamiliar for people and majority of society. Perfect, perfect."

Yes, in terms of culture, there is a huge difference between the civil union and the gay marsh. However, when it comes to the legal differences, there is not that much difference. Maybe it depends on jurisdiction. You cannot have legal rights to do a certain kind of things, like sharing property or stuff like that. However, except the cultural differences, almost 70% of it is almost the same, with gay marriage, in terms of legal rights. Therefore, yes, when it comes to culture, there is a difference, however, there is much having a civilian is a kind of help because you cannot share the property, you cannot rent a house, you cannot meet your partner if that partner gets hospitalized. There are numbers of people who are suffering right now to not get enough of any sort of legal rights in terms of the relationship they have. We think at least we can immediately save these people. We think this is important because we immediately save these people because we push the viable gender.

              "text": "anti-LGBTQ matters that go off when you hear the word gay marriage, how exactly can we change society? Several levels of analysis. Number one, as Yoshihide-san told you, media can play an important part in this. And Atsushi talked about media being conservatively funded, but we don't really think that's the entire case. We think that there's probably an equal amount of liberal and conservative outlets because, you know, if it's full of conservative outlets, a new outlet will come out and say, maybe we can get the liberal demographic and then we can get a larger share of the market as opposed to companies competing only in the conservative market. So you're always going to have a balance of liberal and conservative. So bye bye, achieve argument. But one of those really happened, right? We think that, for example, in Japan we have the drama Osanzanaburu, or many other ways to try to normalize the fact of two people of the same gender being in love with each other, right? Or we have, for example, the normalization of the concept of gays wanting to marry. And that's only possible when you have, when you can put that in, for example, a drama, or you can put that in a way that is accessible and consumable to the average audience. That's what gets the viewer ratings, right? What does that mean? You can't spend 15 or 20 minutes talking about the legality of civil unions or you can't even spend 5 minutes explaining what a civil union and partnership is and how it's different from a marriage and obviously these companies are not trying to, not going to want to, for example focus specifically on these sort of things right? Now bottom line is, for the media it's easier to report it and it's easier to put into dramas and normalize into society. Simple concepts like marriage. Marriage is a simple concept because it's internalized by society as well, and the concept of marriage is important. So you're obviously going to have more media take that up. And this is specifically important because when the LGBTQ movement tries to push for civil unions instead, you're not going to have the media person say, oh, I have an idea. Let's go beyond what the LGBTQ movement says and put gay marriage in. It's only when the LGBTQ raises the potential prospect of putting gay marriage in one of the dramas that the bosses at these sort of media conversions go, okay, we can probably make a drama about two guys being in love and getting married at the end. Yeah. So I'm going to go analysis. Let's look at politicians, right? Because the politicians, because they told us that you're going to have have a conservative backlash, but as they probably understand, conservatives aren't going to vote for anything that pleases the LGBTQ community anyway. So what does it mean? We have to go back to what would be the Kokumi Minshito in Japan, or some moderate Komeito in Japan, or some moderately, or spiritually called moderate parties, which are, they don't have a strong sort of anti-LGBTQ base. What happens then? It's even for them, they know that 30-second stump speeches or they know that soundbites only come in short sentences when they know that the audience understands what it means. If there's a soundbite about civil unions, that's probably not going to be taken up on the night news because the night news has to spend 10 minutes talking about what a civil union is. You get that soundbite into the air on the 7 o'clock in the evening only when you use the words like gay marriage. And it's specifically even better on our side of the house because in order to, because the LGBTQ community, while they may not be visible, they're still a significant part, for example, let's say one-seventh of the community, the voter community, right? At that point, conservative politicians are going to say, we don't want to fully support the LGBTQ, but we're risking having all the voters go to the middle-round politicians. So we'll put civil unions into our manifesto so that we can avoid that fate. Yes? It's easy to be hard, but it's easy to get criticized. It's going to be harder for you to make people understand or support this agenda. Oh, it's easy! It's called marriage. People already know what a marriage is. It's easy. We don't really see why that's hard. Because we called marriage. People already know what a marriage is. It's easy. We don't really see life as hard. Because we're not talking about people who directly and always associate marriage with culture. Because we in the liberal community, we still understand what marriage is, but we don't necessarily relate it to some sort of Judeo-Christian culture or some Shinto culture. Marriage is marriage to most people. And those are the people we're talking about. The people who are ignorant or apathetic towards the issue. Moving on to my second point. What the government side here is trying to do is cut off the closeted Christian LGBTQ member from society. Because basically what they're saying is, we can cut off culture and try to change culture from our agenda. We have given up on trying to change the Christian community. That sends out a message to the Christian community, gay people, that says, we don't care about you any longer. All we want is to make sure that you guys don't get in the way and we only focus on the legal stuff. This is especially hard because for these positive LGBTQ members in Christian communities, there is no media support around them. For example, the faith, as long as it doesn't change, won't help them. Their neighbors probably won't help them because the LGBTQ community is not trying to convince the neighbors that being LGBTQ is not a sin, right? So basically, the most vulnerable LGBTQ member of society has lost any hope for society changing and him or her being accepted by the immediate community. We think that's the worst part about this because both sides are trying to improve the state of the LGBTQ as quickly as possible."

What is the exclusive difference between government program and politician program? Simply, it's a matter of extent. I'd like to tell more deeply in the first crash point, but the difference between this side of the house and our side of the house is the pre-existing image attached to the marriage.

As I already clarified in the introduction, we can see that this message is very simple and appealing. But what the government side has been talking about is that simplicity is rather toxic to achieve the goal that we have been talking about. Because that simplicity strengthens the narrative coming from the most conservative people, which has a larger number than liberal people. And also that simplicity makes the discourse something very emotional or religious, and that enables people to make a logical comparison of the benefit and harm of the equalization of civil union. No thank you. For example, because people have pre-existing image that is attached to the marriage, for example, marriage is social recognition that contains somehow religious meanings, for example, many religious-conservative people jump into the discourse and say that it's simply never acceptable because it's just against the religious doctrine, or just against intuition, or something like that, without considering whether that relationship really poses any harm to the society, or any harm to their own real experience. But in that sense, we think this simplicity is rather toxic to achieve the goal. But second of all, we also believe that there are other simple narratives"

What we heard from that side of the house is most radical supporters leave the movement on our side of the house. But what they have fundamentally ignored from their side of the house is the failure to consistently change the situation in the better way also loses the moderate supporters of the movement. If the participants of the LGBT community think that even if we support the LGBT movement anyway, they will fail, and then it's better to stop donations to the movement or participate in the gay pride event, then it further undermines the unity of the community or unity of the movement. For example, more and more people, LGBT people, become apathetic or giving up achieving their goal. Some people might continue to choose to stay in closeness or they might engage with lavender marriage and they continue to hide their identity. We think that kind of damage to the unity of the movement is rather worse off, because the number of the moderate supporters within the movement is larger than the number of radical supporters within the movement. Because given the possibility of the backlash, we think that in those kinds of contexts that we are talking about, there are a very small number of very active and radical supporters within that movement, and actually the LGBT movement is a very loosely connected community. On that occasion, we think that continuation of achieving something is very important. Compared to that, we have told you that the equalization of civil union creates a momentum within society and within social movements and it further promotes gay rights, including gay marriage, and for these reasons we make it."

              "text": "Because the reason why they're standing in this debate is that people will backlash, that really radical people will backlash, come into the community, and it destroys people, right? Firstly, I think your side of the house happens the same thing, because you have to actually explain the content it destroys people, right? Firstly, I think your cyber house happens the same thing because you have to actually explain the content of what is civil union to the people, to society, right? Which means that probably, probably, because those radical people will probably jump into the community and say the same thing that, oh, it's a bad thing, right? Which means that if you're standing on the same logic, you're just destroying yourself at the very beginning, right, but secondly is that we think the target you have to sway is pretty different, right? You don't have to sway the person who is already radical. But probably those people will never change, right? But the person we have to sway in this debate is the person who is actually in the government, right? Because the government actually adopts the policy and changes society more, right? So we think that a very important analysis is that which side of the house can actually sway those people who has much power just set aside those radicalists who doesn't do shit in the society. So moving on to the first thing about strategy, right? They basically expand about that all step-by-step thing is good. One, we didn't hear any, just they use the jargon of all is realistic and they actually, the prime Minister use the mechanism as oil 80% So it is same like firstly they never explained why that actually like can convince people because actually in our society We don't actually see the content But we actually see the label of the thing to recognize first right for example Even if they have for example if you use if you use for example Toyota And if you label a different name of Toyota, probably nobody will buy the car, probably. Because we actually can see the content, not what is inside the content, but actually the label of the content, right? So they never explain that. But secondly, but more importantly, is that, well, let's imagine a thing, right? Like you want to actually borrow money from your opposition to, for example, 20,000 yen. What they do is basically this. I want 100 yen. And you get 100 yen. Another thing, you said, oh, I want 100 yen. Mr. Speaker, do you think you will be suspicious of that? Because firstly, you don't see what kind of goal you want, right? Basically, what they're doing is that it's like making a debate speech. You're actually making a speech without making a goal. You probably, if you judge this, you will see that, oh, where do you want to go, right? But especially, but more importantly, is that in the, especially in the scenario of discussion, you have to recognize what kind of mindset has the recognize what kind of mindset that the opposing has. Probably, firstly, in discussion, it's contingent upon, probably you think that, oh, your counterpart might try to deceive you, right? That's why the leader opposition analysis are pretty important. If you don't sell a goal, and just step by step, people will be suspicious because you can't see the goal, what your opponents were trying to say, right? We think that they cannot achieve it step by step, but rather it's counterproductive, right? But secondly is that, like, as in general discussion, in discussion it's not about 0-1, right? It doesn't happen like, oh, I want this I'll give you 100%. Usually it's contingent on compromise, which means that because both side has different merits, which means that if we say first, give me 20,000 yen, even if you get the maximum of 20,000 yen, probably you can get 10,000 yen or 8,000 yen, right? So what will happen in a paradigm is that if you lower the bar more and more and more, what will happen is that you will get the half and the half of the right, right? For example, if you say, give me 10,000, probably they'll get only 5,000 or 4,000 or whatsoever. It's about in general discussion. But more importantly is that inside the house, what will happen is that it looks so inconsistent, right? That's inconsistent, right? Because firstly, most of the people probably like say firstly any unity in the community, what will happen is that those radicalist people who think that making marriage is important will say that, oh you're wrong thing. And what will happen is that basically, Uchi gave up was the T-private and the T-private. The T-private opposition is paying this debate, right? But secondly, it's that the people actually seeing those actions will think that, oh, what kind of stance you're taking, right? That's why in the status quo, what will happen, what's going on, is basically, it's like, in general, in debate. Okay. So, in terms of fast-wading politicians, don't you think that politicians are rather afraid of losing against supporters by making radical compromisations, and that compromisition is easier to make when the request is comparatively moderate? I think the POI you just made applies to the same thing, because you're also doing the same thing as you already said, that radicalist argument, you destroy yourself. But, okay, anyways, I'll explain to you why our science house is better, right? Firstly, we say that showing the goal is much easier to actually convince people, right? As I already told you in my debate, in my speech, that firstly, like, it's consistent. But secondly, but more importantly, is that marriage is actually good, right? The word marriage. Because firstly, we recognize actually marriage is one of the important rights, right? For example, like, ill-comment in this state of school is actually a bad thing to do but we think actually could we get convinced that because we think that like you can you can be with a person which you want to be it's actually a right which we think is important right that's why it is important using the label of marriage as actually we can be a power to convince hundreds of thousands of people and citizens around Mr. Speaker. As a community, we think that in general, using the strategy of step-by-step, I think that's false, but secondly is that using the label of marriage is much better to achieve the goal which we have in the consensus. That's why you don't propose. Thank you. I'd like to thank the opposition whip for the speech."

Because what government has said is about difference is extent of requirement, but that does not matter in today's debate. Because the reason why conservatives oppose the LGBTQ movement is about the concept of LGBT is unfamiliar, and also the concept of existence of LGBTQ against the religious doctrine, etc. That's why regardless of consideration of any demand or requirement from the LGBTQ, conservative mindset will never change under their side of the house. And secondly, in terms of the media, the deputy leader of opposition clearly refuted media is not one liner. What the DPM has said is about the conservative funding the media. That's why the media will be conservative. But why the media is so one liner that there are multiple media do exist and also the international media have a massive incentive to criticize that one layer or the conventional media's depiction about the LGBTQ movement. And so that's why the exclusive difference from government benches and opposition benches is about, under government benches, even the liberal media's coverage about the LGBTQ and the gay marriage will be lost because the one LO and DLO has clearly lacerated about the incentive of the media about the utilization of the media, about the utilisation of the drama, utilisation of the documentary, or the interview, etc, etc, one of the gay marriage is too catchy for the individual in the public.

But in comparison, LOND clearly talked about preemptive requirement of the civil union by abandoning the requirement of the gay marriages caused a cheering effect to the compromise negotiation, because Opposition Web has claimed to today that the negotiation table starts the compromisation with the proposition and the negative itself. That's why on our side of the house, even if we like to achieve the civil union, on our side of the house government also has an absolute incentive to start the negotiation and compromisation for the requirement for LGBTQ.

And secondly, about how the conflicts within the movement would be? So, before that, let's clarify the bottleneck in this respect. Here's the parallel in the bottom line of the root cause of the difficulties to push the LGBT agenda. They talk about apathy, we talk about backlash. The answer is maybe the same, but being comparative on two levels. First of all, it's rough. We think our root cause is more relevant to the context. We live in a world in which conservative context, like there is many conservative political groups who fund political party or many voters and constituents are actually conservative and do not like the idea of marriage is by nature defined by the male and female. However, they talk about the politicians and people in government do not care about this kind of people. However, as I pointed out in the POI to the option week, politicians generally care about this kind of people. However, as I pointed out, the point you made to the opposition week, politicians generally care about how the general public's opinion is, therefore even the people in the government cater to this kind of people in this particular context, therefore the backlash and hatred and fear against the LGBTQ community by fetishizing the concept of marriage is more relevant in this space. More in terms of impact, our bottleneck or root cause is far more institutionalized compared to apathy. Because, yes, due to apathy, you may lose thousands of boats, thousands of boats, thousands of potential boats. However, by causing the backlash, you will get the boat against you, the millions and millions of boats against your agenda."

We think there is a bottleneck in this debate that the root cause in this difficulty is the backlash of the conservative, therefore, this kind of sound-light argument is not necessarily, by this particular framing, is not important in this debate. But anyway, let's engage with that. On my first splash, about simplicity. We think, firstly, but due to this simplicity, discourse will be rather toxic. Because conservative backlash will be rather toxic, because conservative backlash will be amplified because they are more likely to get attracted. Because it is simple, discourse will be more emotionalized, therefore it is very easy to demonize emotionally the opponent, precisely because it's not logic, it's emotion, it's very easy. Moreover, it's very to deny for the conservative, due to this simplicity, because it's very easy to make a criticism like marriage is male and female according to my religion, according to my culture. However, it's going to be harder for the conservative on their side of the house to make a legal argument, very complicated legal argument against the civil union. That's a crucial difference on their side of the house. And certainly more importantly, simplicity is not necessarily unique to the phrase of gamers in the first place. Legal recognition does not exist by the states or the LGBT community. It's very simple, it's very easy to understand. I don't think that the word gamers is so uniquely necessary. They talk about the goal must be clarified, but anyway they want to compromise in the negotiation, therefore their goal is also to get glory. And secondly, they talk about suspicion from the general public. However, suspicion is comparatively better than fear and hatred the general public will have. We think on this comparison, we can mean this debate."

Second of all, why the discourse that you produce is inherently counterproductive through recasting, and why we're better on our side. Before I move into that, some basic definitions. We define art and pop culture as generally entertainment that's created for either self-expression or sending a message. We think this oftentimes means mass media. We're talking about things all the way from movies to plays sorts of viewed art, because we're talking purely about actors. Second of all, we're talking about creating new lead characters, we're talking about those characters that have more screen time, have more agency, that are protagonists, that forward the plot. When we're referring to minorities, we're talking about all sorts of minorities, ethnic, ethnic, essential, or religious minorities, even women, et cetera, those are the kinds of minorities that we're willing to talk about in this debate. What are the differences between creation and recasting, to make this extremely clear? Creation is when you have a new storyline, when you have no existing, sometimes no existing, families that are a hype for your directors or your writers. When you're fundamentally centered around, oftentimes, the identity of your character, you're constructing them from scratch, recasting fundamentally one that comes with emotional baggage, something that comes with emotional ties, expectations, where oftentimes they are played originally by a majority character, and now you're simply changing the actors behind them. That is the difference between both of those. We don't—sorry. So, onto our first argument. Why do we think art itself—Lemore exempted? Before I conclude with that, yes. Why should the majority of famous characters so far stay dominant majority? We think that staying the dominant majority is fine. We think introducing a new host and diversity and diaspora for everybody to have somebody to look up to is a better role than the one they suggested. Before that, two yardsticks for this debate. Firstly, we think that the main goal is also to have minorities feel that they're exempted and feel that they're empowered. Secondly, that majorities are also changing their minds and optics."

                  "text": "First argument, why do we think we achieve that better on our side of the house. First argument, why do we think they're able, why do we think the art will be better on our side? We need to find the issue with recasting comes in three lenses because it's constantly an onslaught of pressure to make sure you balance the representation on either side. I mean, keep the studio producers aren't great at deciding how we're going to write a character. So we need three major ideas of how the character turns out. One, they either come out as hollow and superficial stereotypes, and the kinds of that are just simply grafted upon, and just change the actor, and the character fundamentally remains the same. Why do we think this is the case? Because it only is very easy and expedient for students to use virtue signaling as a feature of attracting more audiences. They think in their minds of the corporate boards and law. As long as you have a black actor in a white role, it's fine. We can mix and match the best of both markets. This is the kind of lazy advertising we see in certain kinds of movies, right? If we're going to look at, for example, Ghostbusters, they try to engage the feminist agenda, but the most they get through touching this is by inverting stereotypes and having Chris Hemsworth just act more feminine. Meaning that in and of itself isn't sufficient as a representative of feminist movement as large, what it is is simply just changing one or two characteristics and calling it a day, that's the kind of thing we don't support because the real messages are lost. Second of all, right, the kinds of production that try to balance identities and why this is an issue. Because fundamentally some characters just cannot be changed. Some characters have characteristics that are just simply attached to the previous identity of the majority that they hold. What does this mean? It means, for example, if you try to make Superman, for example, just be black, and just change that entirely, it doesn't function. Why? Because the character's experience of, for example, black people about police brutality, etc., are directly antithetical to the rest of the things that a policeman can do to the rest of the things that Superman is. He's fundamentally impervious and damaged. He doesn't have to care about what other people think about him. He's fundamentally working with police all the time. He don't have to stand up against any more repression. The fact that these characters intrinsically exist in a way that empowers them directly because they came from majority classes, sometimes means they're just unable to be connected or changed in terms of racial characteristics, right? That's the kind of thing that you don't have. Or another example still, for example, imposing an LGBT character, or one that was originally straight, adding in new scenes that don't actually apply, or adding in plans of dialogue that sometimes might be, for example, offensive, and don't actually have any, might make you offensive, that's the kind of harm that you have. Thirdly, the kinds of studios that become super sensitive, that try to basically, essentially rewrite the character by adding too many characteristics. Within these cases, what you basically do is have a caricature. What you do is reduce the original character into one that's just very close to ethnic minority. As a result, what you essentially have is one that just accentuates all their stereotypes to best make it possible and show that we have actually considered it so much. What does it mean to you who is the actual character? What does it mean to you who is the active element that they have? What do we have on the counter-fanzhou? We have a better role because fundamentally, we have one where you create new characters. Where their identity and their expression can be integrated as one. Where they no longer have to deal with this balancing act of which character fits what role. What does this mean? we have one where you create new characters, where their identity and their expression can be integrated as one. Where they no longer have to deal with this balancing act of which character fits what role. What does this mean? It means that we have characters that explore nuance, people that actually source stories about individual experiences. And we like to show that empirically these things are more resonant within the minority communities. Look at the popularity of films like Moonlight, fundamentally you create new characters of Black Panther, fundamentally you create new characters that resonate with people's own struggles, rather than try to integrate struggles into a storyline that doesn't match, meaning that's the one that reaches out to more people and is better about. Second of all, you create a structural incentive, where producers are forced to, for example, create new characters that just simply think about it more, right?"

That's what we have. And let's just do some simple weighing, right? The probability we have to balance is if we see a world where more producers try to balance the act versus more producers trying to create new characters, what do we have? You have a probability that you mess up and mess up badly all three scenarios. Or you have our world where you try, and sometimes your movies don't take off. But when they do, they're so much more empowering. They're so much more meaningful. That's the weighing we have today in this debate. That's why we think we're so much stronger. What are the impacts if their movies got wrong? It means you have stereotypes. It means you disempower social justice movements because you picture these minorities in positions of power. It makes it seem like their struggles are no longer relevant because look, they're already powerful. Meaning you don't have any sort of benefit in that way. Second argument, why do you worsen discourse, and why is it counterproductive? Understand the basic message that you're sending, when you basically have a minority put into the role of a majority, right? It means that they always have to live in the shadow. It means that this person could be James Bond. He could be just like him. It means you can constantly live in the shadow, perceptually, instead of being an individual, you're just one of them. You could be like them. I mean, that's the kind of harm that you have, is, you're just one of them, you could be like them. I mean, that's the kind of harm that you have, is that you're not trying to show that you can be them, that you can be yourself, and that your individual traits do matter. We think when you're trying to force somebody into a mold, you only reduce their individual characteristics into something that's palatable. I mean, that is disgusting. Second of all, right, we think you also create preemptive firestorms, right? When you have issues of reverse incentives, when you have voices that are prejudiced because of their emotional ties to the original character, meaning that they say things like, I'm not racist, but I disagree with this character being portrayed in this way. Why is this an issue? Because then studios make compromises, either they do the character, make them blind, which is worse. Second of all, when the minorities themselves speak out against the representation, and they want more, it means that producers can sometimes give cheap responses, right? Take the example of Iron Fist, where there was a minor Asian committee, strived to try and change a character to an Asian, the producers couldn't, what they did was just quickly say, oh, we'll add this random Asian character and create him, and try to model all the three characters as one. I think that's worse off for your side of the house, because what you have, therefore, is perverse incentives for these kinds of producers, right? Because they're reactionary and rushed. Fundamentally, what you have is a situation where you disempower the minority, where they don't have the capacity to actually express themselves, where they constantly view in the shadows. For all those reasons, we are so proud to propose. Thank you. Please come forward."

                  "text": "The next thing I'd just like to note on framing is that this motion supervising contacts comes out of the trend of remakes happening all the time. Things like IT, Ghostbusters, literally all of the Disney movies are currently being remade, showing you that there is a constant demand for these remakes, and minorities in this instance are very likely to fill these roles. That being said, looks like an opposition to material. Now, if there's first and second argument, we're going to answer together because they're basically two sides of the same coin. It's telling you that they don't want minorities to be overshadowed and that minorities shouldn't have to exist within roles that are in remaking. A couple of really big problems with this. First, listen to the language that they bring you about the characterization of these roles. They tell you that you lose the active characters whenever black people are put in white people roles. They tell you things like scenes of gayness do not apply to the character in a remake film. We fundamentally reject this characterization. We tell you that whenever minorities are recasting these roles, they actually bring something to the table. That it is not bad for a minority to be in these roles, and that it does not violate the intrinsic aspects of this death. We reject their language and characterization to begin with. The second thing that we would tell you is that you can use their own words against them as to why you're more likely to get tokenization. They tell you that studio directors cannot write for people of color. Note that on the comparative level, their side is so much worse. Why is this the case? Because studios are about cash. That means that insofar as the hegemonic majority already maintains a stranglehold on what people want to consume in media, it's more likely that you're just going to get white characters from rom-com than you ever will people of color if that's all it is. That means the only way to make cash is if your movie is about the minority experiences of that individual. That's so harmful because they themselves tell you that studio directors cannot direct for people of color. We would tell you on our side of the house that those characters already have been dead because they were made so in the first place with things like in their original ones. The next thing that we would just like to say is combating their characterization that you know it's important that people have representation in these things and that whenever you're recasting or remake that you don't actually have representation for your people. I would tell you that me as an Asian American I'm more than simply the fact that I'm Asian. I can do normal things, right? We don't think it's bad for there to be minorities in movies doing normal things. With that being said, let's look at our first substantive argument about improving industries. Two ways that you increase the number of people of color under our side of the house. First, movie studios have internal implicit quotas for who they're willing to create movies about. Note this clashes directly with their first substantive argument because it shows you why. Even if tokenization is less bad on their side of the house, you're not going to get as many movies about people of color. Movie studios like Paramount, Pixar, A24, all of them have to have internal implicit quotas about what they're going to support, what they want to show people. We need to just mean things crucially, like there will never going to be two Mulans in the same year because hey, one is enough, right? We already got this tale out about Asian representation. No need to have more stories about the same minority experience. We would tell you on the outside of the house, you could have two movies with two black female leads that are different in storyline and capabilities and things of that nature because they fundamentally tell different tales. On their side of the house, because they want it to be about this single story of one person living throughout their minority experience, they have to have that same story told twice because they themselves tell you it has to be more similar. The second way that you improve industries is by decreasing the barrier to entry for making these films. Note that the creation of a new movie is easier on our side of the house, because movie studios still want to make remakes right now. They know that they're probably running out of ideas, which is why you see this huge trend towards making remakes in the status quo. In that instance, we think it's entirely likely that because they do not want it to be the exact same as the original, that they're going to cast people of color in their main roles. Additionally, because they know that they have to appeal to a wide audience, so it's better to have people cast in this. Why does this argument matter in this round? Because we show you that we increase the number of movies being made. So even if the type of representation you get on both sides of the house is qualitatively equal, you have to default to our side because we show you that you get more representation for these individuals. Our second substantive argument is going to be about approving the audience internalization. Note that the most important thing is telling the narrative that not all ethnic majority or heteronormative stereotypes about whether or not you're male should be what's considered as regular. We do not believe that movies that are telling stories about everyday life, like rom-coms and things of that nature, should only tell the stories of white individuals. And we think that the most famous films, the ones that are the most iconic, are always reflective of this majority. For example, The Sound of Music is one of the most famous films of all times, and it is completely indicative of this. We think that with the idea of remakes, these new characters already have three-dimensional development embedded within their storyline. That's why they were so famous to be remade in the beginning because they already have that depth of analysis and character. We think that beyond their minority status it's going to be beneficial because one, before I move on to this, I'll take your point. The point on which I character that doesn't reflect the actual experiences minority people have in real life, what used to give to those people? That's completely a lie, right? I as a minority experience some of the same things that white people also experience. I also experience love and loss. These things are communicated in movies. I do not as a minority only have to be in movies about how I'm oppressed. That's ridiculous. Moving on. We would tell you that being a minority in a free cast in a film makes your life beyond minority status. This directly responds to the POI we just get. Because you don't always have to have representation in your culture because you have that as an individual growing up in a minority culture. For example, Indian kids grew up to the tales of Krishna."

But additionally, we think that you're going to benefit the audience perception whenever you have things like people of colour recast in these roles. Why is this the case? Because remakes happen on two fronts. Either first, it's people who are growing up and seeing these remakes for the first time. We think it's better for that because they see the normalization and internalization that these people can just be regular people. The second thing is that older people are going to want to see the new movie. So even if you look at some backlash on their side of the house, which they say is going to happen, we say it's a good thing. It's good to force yourself to confront the racism that you endure. Why do you think it's okay for Ariel just to only be white? We think these are good things to confront because it increases the amount of discourse.

They explore, they contain depth within them that was wider popular in the popular in prospects and this still helps minorities because minorities feel things like love as well, like they feel common experiences. Here's the issue, they never told us why those sort of experiences were exclusive, right? That's to say, Black Panther, our original black character also experiences things that are universal, like struggles with loyalty. The one thing that we achieve exclusively is the unique nuances of this identity that you get from having a character that's explicitly surrounded around that identity and those traits.

That is to say, when companies have to engage in virtue signaling, the fact that there's a character already implicit, that you're grafting an external appearance onto a character means that you weren't considering the way in which an actual individual of that minority identity would have acted within those circumstances in the first place. Because there's an existing character that we're trying to graft characteristics onto. At a point where you make that characterization more of that identity experience, that means because you weren't even considering that in the first place, you resort to tired stereotypes, you resort to tropes. Like, compare that with our counter-model, in which we suggested that producers probably have more of an active need to think about the way minority characters exist within these roles, the ways that they're paid, the kinds of experiences that a character like this would have if they were of a minority identity, and they had to start from scratch. That means that you can't resort to the sort of things they talk on you, make no state panel. It's probably true that stereotypes happen a lot more on their side of the house.

That's where you get in power people to say, I'm not racist, but they're encroaching upon our cultural stereotypes.

But two, even if you don't believe that, I don't think it's as much of a dichotomy that you're talking about. This isn't just about movies, right? It's the fact that original characters can also be introduced to things like TV shows that have a unique identity, instead of relying on tarot cards and existing characters. That's something that I have contended with.

Look at what happened, right? That's to say, you've got like things, a sense of collective ownership around these people, because these are things that are unique to that identity and unique to that community in the first place. That's why you've got things like students of famous black, like historically black universities in the United States engaging in traditional summer gospel before they watch the movie for the first time. Because it's such an uplifting experience, right? Was it something that they actually owned? Instead of something being provided to them, CEOs trying to capitalize on the existing character that was owned by the majority in the first place.

Notice this about the kinds of movies and kinds of art that we're willing to support. That one, the story result revolves around the individual character and far more uniquely reflects their traits. That is to say, given that this character was created with the explicit intention of representing a minority and the actual experiences that they face, actors simply have more material to work with, right? The kind of unique experiences that you're never going to get of Ariel. And so you think on the first level, that thing's just going to be a lot better and a lot more nuanced. The same idea. The plot is centered around the kinds of experiences these average members of these communities actually face. Things like Moonlight, right? When you have black people, like there's an entire movie surrounding about the trials that black LGBT teenagers face within the United States. That's a unique kind of plot line that you don't get with characters that are retrofitted for a minority majority inherently, right? So the characters uniquely designed around them. What does it mean? We think that it means that you get the sense of collective ownership surrounding these actors that we talked about. And this means that they're able to do things, like they're far more able to talk out about their minority experiences, right? They're able to integrate unique plot lines that are specifically focused around these minority identities and bring in their own personal experience when they go out on things like talk shows. But the second thing, that you're far more likely to be successful in this capacity and find other roles. What is the commandment that they have to deal with? That the story isn't centred around the actors that they choose in order to fill these majority roles. That they're always going to get drowned out by the ritual that we talked about. That it's never going to be about the artwork and ability of the actor itself but whether the act of recasting was just in and of itself. We think that distraction from the actor and the ability to engage in artistic success is so harmful. But even when it is successful, we think you get things like relying on a handful of existing actors. Like it's always going to be Will Smith for instance, and self-focusing on other actors that are struggling right now but could potentially fill the role better. We think that's a unique part.

First, I'll directly respond to their third substantive argument before asking the two nexus questions of this debate. What's better for minority representation and what's better for the discourse to promote minority representation before our third substantive argument on the benefits to actors directly clashing with their third. So their third substantive argument is basically that now it is easier for minority actors to gain prominence. Three responses here. First, we think this has created internal noise. They say here that starting from scratch is good, but prior, in the proposition one, they said that starting from scratch is bad because you have racist executive leaders. Secondly, in terms of prominence, we think it is far better for a minority actor to be in an iconic movie where there's a broader appeal base because it is obviously more prominent. It is literally iconic. Point. Thirdly, this argument is contingent on the fact that it creates more nuance. I'll deal with that more later. First question, then, is which side is better for minority representation? is contingent on the fact that it creates more nuance? I'll deal with that more later. First question then, is which side is better for minority representation? In Proposition 2, they give you this one-off argument about how it creates more role models. We don't understand why a black Ariel can't be a sufficient role model for a little black girl either. We think that doesn't stand. Then they say it creates hollow and superficial stereotypes. This is their first warrant. We have two responses. First, the arms are parallel. What about a minority-led movie isn't also virtue signaling? Secondly, use their example against them. Strong female leads in Ghostbusters with a feminine man is good for exposure. It shatters the notion that everyone expects things to be male. Sure, it didn't explain dense feminist theory, but we don't think that's going to happen on your side of the house either. Rather, it exposes people to the fact that big buff Chris Hemsworth might be able to be a little bit feminine. Secondly, they said that some characters just can't be changed. Three responses. First, that seems a little problematic to me to say that it's too hard to make Superman black. Secondly, take them on their best ground and take the Superman example. Okay, maybe now the Superman movie has Superman fighting against the police to protect black people. We think that you can change the narrative to actively make Superman good. Thirdly, the reason that they say Superman is invincible is what little black boys want to see. They want to know that they too can be invincible. They want to be Superman. They don't want their own segregated version of the movie. Black boys want to be Superman too. Why can't they be Superman?"

Like, Moonlight still exists on our side of the house. The best iteration of this argument is more that people want to see their culture promoted. So we'll respond to that argument. We say people see their own community culture all the time within their communities. The question of the debate then is where does the whole in representation lie? We say the whole in representation lies on seeing yourself in average people, in average roles. The fact that a gay boy and a lesbian girl want to be a mermaid and a merman too. That just isn't linked to race. The last argument they give you is that the balancing act is bad. But that's remarkably uncomparative. They have a balancing act on their side of the house too. Like, I don't understand why Paramount doesn't also have to appeal to their white viewer base for Black Panther 2. That feeds onto argumentation about tokenization because they still have to appeal to the white voter base, meaning their best case scenario of Black Panther, if anything, gets whitewashed in order to make it profitable for everyone. Or in their worst case scenario, they don't tokenize it and only black people see it, so they don't actually advance any forms of representation because white people do not go see it. On that point, what was their response to our material? They just said their mechanisms were never fully explained. I mean, come on, give us some more credit. She gave you two mechanisms. She said, first, there are internal quotas, meaning there are just frankly fewer movies. She said, secondly, that there's a decreased period of entry because right now there are lots of remakes.

They're only on the side where the remake does this happen. Secondly, we tell you this backlash is good. Why? Because instead of a racist person just seeing Black Panther and saying, oh, that's the black movie, I'm not going to see it, the racist person now sees they want to go see Little Mermaid, but it's a black Little Mermaid, you at the very least expose the fact that they're racist, and at best, you force people to have a conversation with them to talk about why it's good to have a black Ariel. What did we hear in response to our material that minorities should be doing things more regular? They said identity influences the way you live your life. Exactly. The way identity influences your life is that you never see yourself as normal when you never see those roles. Moreover, we think remaking iconic movies is the most important impact in this debate. Because they are in themselves iconic. They are part of the social fabric. Meaning, even if they get things like Moonlight, we think it's better to have black people in iconic movies because then people feel that they are part of the social fabric and not separated in niche movies like Moonlight. Before I move on to my third sub, I'll take a break. At the point where your only benefits are role models, subversion, and prominence, you achieve nothing that is unique to recasting. What makes that actively and specifically better than the prominent original movies we were talking about? That's a funny question. You said our only benefits and then listed three for me, but I can give you some more if you want them. We would say at the point in which now minorities see themselves in regular roles as opposed to only having movies about the fact that they are a minority, about the fact that it's about their minority culture, at that point, we'll add a fourth thing to your list of three for me."

The only way to fix this is to remake movies and cast them with minorities in those new roles.

Proposition never fills the vast moral void left behind by these movies, which is primarily made up of both black and gay actors. Proposition never fills the vast moral void left behind by these movies, which extracted value from minorities. At best, they just create new value. The second layer is decreasing tokenization and stereotypes. In a world of minority-specific movies, tokenization always occurs, because the people who own these big production companies are white and powerful, meaning it's more offensive, it leads to typecasting. In order to appeal to the wider and whiter audience, they have to create more less, more shallow cultural descriptions.

We think it's not true that these positive influences can only come from iconic remake movies. We think that's only worse. Four main ideas for the house today. First of all, on exposure and whether it actually matters. Second of all, on the quality of portrayal of the movies.

We think that they only get more aggressive and angry because they see it not only as an addition but rather as an invasion of something that they call to be very dear to their hearts.

First of all because they tell us that there will be quantitatively more storylines because we have enough two black female leads. And first of all, debate math aside, we just don't think that many movie studios will have an incentive to take a major iconic movie, take out the two main characters, and replace them with black women. We think that there is a far bigger incentive on these movie studios who are putting these minorities into the positions because they want the money that comes with virtue signalling to put them in as side characters or as supporting characters, replace the cheaper and more expendable characters that people don't have such a strong emotional attachment to. But second of all, they told us that, well, people, you can't get more money from like making remakes and therefore there are going to be more of it, right? Well, I told you already quite clearly that the trend of remakes is really secondary to the trend of people developing famous movies such as Crazy Rich Asians, such as Love, Simon. We think that that's the trend that we want to support instead. But crucially, we think that their entire article exposure is just less important than what we brought to support instead. But crucially, we think that their entire argument of exposure is just less important than what we brought to the table, right? Because they didn't really give us a reason why there's intrinsic benefits to seeing quantitatively more people of your ethnicity on the screen. We think that it's counterproductive when the representation is worse, when it propagates stereotypes or cheap misrepresentations, and we think it's also worse when the discourse surrounding the movie is also more toxic and more poisonous. We think that we're going to prove that going by our art sense of improving lives of minorities and changing the lives of majorities, we win. So what was their idea on majorities? They said, and this is on our side, you force these people to go to the theatre, watch the movie, and then talk about it, and then their lives will be changed. No, this is just not true, right? Because the first reason is we think that they have just got this key stakeholder here completely wrong. The abhorrent racists here are going to say, oh there's a black character in Black Panther, I'm going to show up and watch that movie, this is certainly not going to go to a black rip aerial remake and go, ah this is something that I want to watch in my spare time. And they're far less likely to say, having watched this movie in my life has changed. But second of all, we just don't think that a remake of a beloved movie, of a beloved movie, which is, and you already have an original, right? So if you really want to watch it, you stay at home, you watch the original, and you stay clear about what Rotten Tomatoes and other people on Reddit are telling you are a bastardization of a film that you really like. You often instead boycott the movie because you're so vitriolically against it."

                  "text": "So having one idea on exposure, let me go into the idea on portrayal and the quality of this. So Byrne spent six thick minutes on this in his P1 about how he gets worse stereotypes about worse misrepresentation when you have all the baggage of an original movie attached to a remake. They try to swim us into saying that, well, actually, movies aren't all about your experience of oppression, and rhetoric about how she's an Asian American, right? But three things. First of all, you're a minority. You have plenty of different experiences, but you're not an alien on a different planet. Rather, the difference is, there are categorically elements of your life which are different from that of a minority. You might be more careful when you're out on the street at night, you might be more wary of the police person, you might just frequent different areas of town or face more barriers when applying for certain job or educational positions. All of these are important things to convey about a minority experience, because to gloss over them would be to give the majority a false sense of security, a false sense of idealisation, but we think that you can't achieve this when you're remaking a movie without sacrificing big parts of the plot and therefore alienating viewers. So the second response to this was, they tried to co-opt all of our analysis by saying, well these same studios are just the same, but they just have bad incentives, and it's going to be worse if you're trying to produce a fully original movie, right? We just don't think that's very nuanced at all, because it's not the exact same studio, right? We think often Marvel Studios is categorically different from another smaller studio, which is producing a movie focused on the minority experience and therefore it's going to have incentive to bring in character design experts or bring in actors who have a very close connection to that character as opposed to just grabbing a big name famous actor and they're okay you're black people know your name here quite as if it's a remake it will get us more views but then second of all the approach to the movie is completely different when you have baggage as opposed to when you don't because when you're trying to balance this new movie with the legacy of the previous one, you're struggling to stay true to the previous movie and therefore not alienate all of that base. But you also want to still get some brownie points for the minority character in your film, right? But then what does this mean? They just get a far messier, far worse movie. You either misrepresent the minority or you alienate the majority and make them frustrated and angry. Because all of these are bad outcomes. On ours in the House of Watchers, you have the incentive most of the time to have nuance because you want to picture a movie as being profound, as being interesting. You want those good reviews, right? Like, hence we have these deep movies such as Moonlight being pumped out. But second of all, at the briskest hour, at least we have a genuine and sensical, like, smoothly flowing plotline that doesn't make people go, ah, this is a movie with a black person in it and it happens to be terrible, therefore social justice is corrupting pop culture, therefore I'm against this movement in general. So we think that one of these reasons that we get worse, that we got two more responses to the third, right? They told us we can dramatically shift the plotline, but these movie studios often don't have the incentive to do so because it's unnecessary, because they think they just want to go on their existential path and second of all they gave us the idea of whitewashing. Like surely whitewashing is something that you do more when you're featuring a group that's iconic and aimed at the general population as opposed to when you're trying to keep your minority families. For these reasons, go to your proposition next. Thank you. ."

It's not necessary to invest in little, small, original movies, or even big picture original movies. They're about heavy issues. What people want to see on the big screen is not the racial reality of their daily lives, the example that their Prop 3 brings you, of knowing that you have to walk a little more carefully on the street. I don't want to see that on the big screen, though. I just want to see people look like me, that act normal, that act regularly. The plot line has this direct incentive on their side of the house to make it about being a minority, to be the worst form of shallow representation. Because do not forget their first substantive argument. It was all about the mechanisms by which making these original news stories would allow for the culture of minorities to be represented. The story I told you at the top proves that race doesn't automatically equal culture. My culture is not homogeneous to the most recent Indian new original character that they had in The Jungle Book. My culture is homogeneous to what I saw as a kid. That's what I like. I'm just a normal American, and normal Americans on the big screen should be brand.

Before I go on to the crucial impact of this argument, I'll take your point. As a studio like Marvel who crafts the representation of the future icons of children, do you repeat past heroes and change their skin color, or do you create new ones for the children to adore? Okay, so this is interesting because this gets into more of the practical mechanism we're now about to go over. What is Marvel most likely to do? Marvel is about to remake a bunch of films.

Then, look at who they're trusting to write the stories for their new minority characters. Those same studio executives, those same writers, are they really going to give you an excellent story about minority representation? But let's say you have original black writers, original brown writers, original female writers. Those writers are significantly less likely to get the same impact that cultural icons already have on society, because they're already entrenched. It's significantly less likely for them to make the new blockbuster, to make the new icon that kids look up to, which is why remakes are just much, much more better. They have also not answered our entire third substantive argument about how this return to normalcy is a necessary reparative purpose, because for so long, these characters were kept white. For so long, being a detective, being a superhero, was kept white, was kept the dominant majority. That is the point. When they tell you that people will react to this because they're attached to their old characters and they don't want to see them change, they don't want to see them be not white, that is opposition's point.

Given that's the case, we've given you lots of mechanisms including profit incentive and just what's more likely for movie studios to do, that should remake, those remakes would have the biggest cultural impact on society.

They never answered three crucial things. One, why if the white executive board exists on both sides of the house, is it likely to be any more nuanced on their side? If anything, in a predominantly minority movie, in order to appeal to the predominantly white executive board, they have to do things like tokenization that wouldn't exist on our side of the house. Secondly, nuanced culture isn't what people want to see on a movie. What they want is normalcy. People in their own communities are always exposed to their own stories, exposed to their"

We told you why this was worse because you enabled trolling and so much other vitriol.

Look, even if the majority have conversations started and sparked with the majority. Look, even if the majority does not change their mind, the question remains, who helps minority communities feel more represented, therefore?

That is to say, where the narrative will evoke some sense of sacrifice for either the individual or the collective. And there are a few illustrations of this that we'll give. That is to say, a public defense of controversial feminist issues like opposing the matchmaking industry in India, for example, which would be good for female solidarity, but might jeopardize your own political or your business career or your status within your family or your social life. Where the feminist movement and opposition might push you to work to dispel narratives that female domesticity exists even though you want to be a traditional stay-at-home mother. Or even when you are working, opposition pushing you to advocate for more affirmative action and diverse hiring policies regardless of if you're a low-level employee and that might jeopardize your own career or that you're in a male-dominated industry that would make you quite uncomfortable."

                  "text": "The second part of this model, it is also important to note on proposition, but won't change on this motion. We say when your personal incentives firstly aligns with the feminist movement and comes at no cost to you, you are still likely in order to try and promote equality. That is to say, if you are a CEO or a top-level manager in a company, you can probably implement maternity leave, given that it would probably be good for you as well. You can access to vote, likely, in either side of the house. If there's a municipal protest that is near you, that you have the time and money in order to advocate for, and issues that you care strongly about, that don't sacrifice anything else to you, you will continue to do that. The second reason why we think this happens is that we do have a basic empathy that extends to other women, especially if they've been in the same positions as us. We just believe that when the trade-off exists, you should always choose yourself. The last thing that I want to mention in frame is that solidarity is not all-encompassing. That most of the time, it is majoritarian and privileged views on what solidarity actually means that ends up existing. The reason why is because the people that oftentimes produce feminist media have the wealth and oftentimes the capital that can reflect this. That is to say, the books that sell out the most are ones that are written by rich white women. Secondly, the concept of solidarity can easily be manipulated to what best actually reflects the agenda. That is the reason why in a lot of the parts of the world women who are trans are not mentioned within solidarity exists. And the people who do oftentimes discuss and define solidarity are celebrity feminists or the west and the privileged world. And lastly the reason why you can't get any change is because oftentimes they're irreconcilable. That is to say religious evangelicals I can't say the word. Wow, my God. Sorry. They're irreconcilable. That is to say, religious evangelicals that oftentimes cannot exist along with a sex-dominated industry because of the ideology that obviously opposes them. That means solidarity drowns out political will for the most important issues, and oftentimes it means that the values are oftentimes different. That is to say, the family that you might care about as a black Caribbean woman that oftentimes are emphasized in a lot of African households is very different from the kinds of no family at all, don't listen to your husband, don't have kids kind of mindset that a lot of western feminists include. First argument then on the movement obligation. Because of the sacrifice of equality by the patriarchy, opposition now chooses a solution that forces women to sacrifice even more. We think this will never be just. Why is this not just? The first, because we have obligations not to harm women and this will always harm women directly. It will rip them of their dignity when we force them to confront their bosses, force them to confront the family members that they fear having uncomfortable conversations with that likely mean they're going to be humiliated and embarrassed. It rips them of financial autonomy when we force them out of jobs that they work or force them to spend resources on others that they probably don't have any kind of direct obligation or care about. And it rips them of choice. They're probably always going to be burdened by the thought of whether or not they're being a good feminist when they're opening an OnlyFans account, for example, when they're going into a certain kind of work, when they're spending money on consumers' obligations because they want to buy pretty clothes for themselves. Opposition has promoted a solution that solves oppression by oppressing women themselves, and we think that will never be just. Firstly, because there's equality in membership, that every single woman should have their own kind of equality and dignity that shouldn't be undermined. But secondly, that the most contradictory principle that is to say the feminist movement should protect people so if we care about acting and violence against women and a mission in terms of not protecting women in the best ways that we can by taking money away from other women and taking value and labor from other women we should care more about direct violence but secondly we see we are oftentimes forcing women towards some goal that is really just tenuous at best. And genuinely on proposition, we're agnostic to the idea of what kind of solidarity is good. Is it solidarity for wearing religious dress as choice, or is it solidarity for removing any kind of restrictive religious clothing that oftentimes exists in different parts of the world? Is it the kind of solidarity that means you should be for or against sex work as a viable way to make money as a woman? In these cases we think there will always be some kind of women that are excluded from the movement, some kind of women that do genuinely have their dignity and their choice and their autonomy oppressed when the feminist movement tells them that their choices are not good. Women are not social battering rams. This will always be wrong devoid of practical outcome. Second argument I want to talk about in terms of reviewing buy-in, but I'll take a POI before that. I don't know how this debate is exclusively about cases where people have to be heard in order for someone else to gain that."

                  "text": "I just want to point out that this goes back on literally the last two or three decades that has been choice feminism at the active forefront of a lot of the feminist movement, especially in the West, where it is to say that women have been able broadly to choose any of the kinds of career options that they want, that they can choose to, for example, work in a corporate industry that they don't need to give large amounts of money and participate in the feminist movement as much as they do. And therefore, this goes back on a lot of the rhetoric that has been included within the feminist movement that will probably be bad for a lot of the individuals that are within it. But secondly, we already talked about why it must exclude some people, why it must exclude some people, why it must include a lot of some women, and particularly probably the ones that are minorities, that don't fit into a majoritarian and elitist view of what it actually means to buy solidarity, and what it means to have solidarity to the best forms of feminism. But lastly, we think that some women will probably always choose themselves. They care about gaining capital, for example, they care about ensuring that they aren't going to have horrible relationships with their family, and now they're going to be called selfish. Opposition also has to prove that the manifestation of this narrative is going to be positive, but in many cases it is not. We oftentimes shame influencers who want to model online in their comment section because we say they are bad feminists. We shame people for their choices that they make as a woman because we say it is not feminist and it's not solidarity within the feminist movement. And the change here is that you probably won't have the support for the normal kinds of feminist policies and the movement that does exist. You probably won't align yourselves with female politicians, with movements, with like workshops or development careers that exist within your workplace, for example, because you don't believe that the feminist movement is actually representing you. You might even actively call out the feminist movement and undermine their credibility when it exists. In all cases, this will always be bad for the feminist movement who loses a lot of the support that they would otherwise have. The third argument is also very simple. The women should be allowed to develop unfettered in terms of their career choices. They should be able to use male mannerisms if that is what allows them to survive, to make more money, which means that they can institute policy when they are at the very top, when there's far less pushback. That is the best way to ensure their survival for all women, not just the ones the opposition says they want to protect. Incred's going to be best if we hold the first opposition speaker. Thank you. Okay. Can I speak this volume? Right. Okay. So."

What we say in response is that solidarity is also not global. Solidarity just like the feminist movement depends on who exactly it's about. Feminist movement is not a unified block. Solidarity within it is also dependent on who exactly creates the movement in a given country, in a given community, in a given minority as well. We believe that thus solidarity is also flexible enough to allow most people to actually relate to it, even if that means that it's going to happen in the higher up groups, or for example in the lower down, less privileged communities as well. Panel, what we also hear about from this side is that there is a principle right of choice. Of choice to actually hurt others, of choice to actually exploit other people. Note who this debate is about. This debate is about women. About women who have been inherently exploited and hurt by patriarchy, by a system that actually gave those people that right, that actually made those people able to make that choice. We believe that that choice was never actually given to those people in a principally right manner. Why? Because it was given by an inherently faulty and non-equal system of patriarchy, of a system that essentially exploits some social groups. We believe that this choice is never actually right to have, it's never given to those people inherently. We believe that it's okay to actually make the feminist movement criticize it. Secondly, people inside of the government have called us out for calling women on the higher stages, basically calling them selfish by the feminist movement. Note how the definition of selfishness is essentially what they defend.

We believe that it's putting the well-being of other women equally or above your own needs, as the trade-offs that have been mentioned by the side of the government. Also note how in the status quo we experience both sides of this house in some cases. We believe that right now in this debate we are standing on a crossroads where we need to choose one of those two practices. Note how this messaging actually happens. Basically, most of it happens through real-life examples of such acts of, for example, solidarity or acts of selfishness, of women, for example, choosing their own good over somebody else's, but also through social media, through using. And why is this narrative exactly so attractive? Because, first of all, it is all-encompassing. It touches every single woman on the planet. Every single woman on the planet deserves solidarity by this narrative. It's extremely attractive for a woman to actually believe it because it guarantees them support. It also touches women in all social causes and situations because as I've mentioned before it actually is flexible enough to do that. Panel, moving on to our cases. First of all, principally panel. The feminist movement ought to simply support the ones with the least agency in society and prioritize solidarity with mutual support between women. Now, the feminist movement is simply an exclusive space that is giving every single woman support. An exclusive space in many countries and many societies where they simply had no other choice than to find the feminist movement to support them. Now, this is simply the largest foundation of the very existence of the movement in this debate. It is about being universal and about being universally united in the troubles of women. Now note how pushing for growth, what the side of the government essentially does, assumes that you have the agency to actually reach out for it, to actually reach out for the top of the social ladder, to actually reach out for the better position in your workplace. Now this is the very same reason for the existence of the Hellenist Movement, because not everyone has that agency, not everyone has that possibility, and this is based on historical and also present stripping of agency from those women. Now, note how the rights of women have been historically stripped collectively, and we believe that it's principally wrong to try to take those rights individually, like the women on the side of the government would try to do. If by your admission the idea of solidarity can be manipulated, why is it good that exclusionary and privileged women can now define solidarity in career paths and take away agency from"

It never actually goes back to you from other parts of society, from the most privileged people, from the patriarchal men that have been oppressing you historically, it only means that the balance of power changes within women, within feminism, within the group that needs support from the most, not exactly giving them support as a whole. Note how maximization in the motion on the side of debate means that you should take a chance, even if it takes agency away from other women, even if that means that other women have to lose a job, for example, so that you can have a better salary, they have to defend it. This is principally wrong on simply the whole scale of why feminism was created, of why feminism still exists, of why feminism is effective in any way, and also how it supports women. But moving on to our second argument panel, and how our policy simply better impacts everyday life. Note how women hear, women, but not only women, Moving on to our second argument panel and how our policy simply better impacts everyday life. Note how women hear, women but not only women, hear this message in radio, in feminist magazines, from their favourite politicians or from their favourite celebrities. What you get in that case is that you should, is basically the narrative that you should show solidarity to other women but also that other women could and should show solidarity to you. Note how this simply increases the amount of accountability in your everyday life, in your school, in your workplace, in your country as well, which also reaches other social groups than only women. We believe that this message also reaches men. It also makes sure that those people know that women deserve solidarity, that they deserve, for example, to be cared of, that basically their oppressors deserve to, for example, be called out, even if that means that you have to risk something on your side. Notice how only on our side this message actually reaches all of those people. Now, this narrative makes you simply do a couple of things. First of all, it increases your will to actually observe social treatment. What it means is that there is simply much greater shared responsibility in society. What is also much more likely is that you are, for example, going to support other women, for example, in your workplace, you're going to take a stand in harm's way, making sure that, for example, the workplace does not become as toxic as possible, or, for example, you will tell your friend to not go, not, for example, take a position in the workplace that you know is going to be harmful for them, even though you, for example, risk being fired from that job because you have just basically made sure that no one else will be hired from them. Note how on our side, this essentially is not only accepted by a much wider group, but it actually affects every single woman, regardless of their own possibility at the agency to actually reach out for greater good. Note how on Wayne, this is simply much more important. Why is that? Because it simply affects every single feminist deviation possible. On every single level of agency, whether that is the feminism, for example, in Poland, or whether that is the feminism in Bangladesh, or whether that is the feminism in India, we believe that solidarity can exist in every single place like that. This is exactly why we believe that it's extremely important.

I think what is true, and what we characterize in our case, is that the vast, vast majority of women are oppressed in at least one significant way. So over 90% of women, even in the most privileged urban places in the world, experience sexual harassment on an annual basis. Things like domestic violence, like catcalling, like workplace exclusion, cut across borders of race and income. We agree that women experience different levels of privilege. Our argument was that all of these women are sufficiently oppressed that the feminist movement has obligations towards them as individuals. The woman in New York has financial privilege, we agree. But when she is harassed and stalked at work, she experiences a real visceral harm that we think we ought to care about too. What is the consequence then of this, oh dear, I forgot a page, of this morally speaking? I think the first thing to say is that we have an individual obligation towards this person that cannot be justified in broad utilitarian terms. So for instance, if we take a situation like criminal justice, if one person is deprived of a thousand dollars, that is bad and that person ought to be compensated for the damage that happens towards them. But that does not justify us taking another person who has also been robbed of like $80 and redirecting their money towards this person. And the reason for that is that we treat individual victims as individual agents whom we ought to repair their damages individually. So I think even if they can prove that on net, women in general are benefited, they need to explain why it's justified a direct cost upon individual women."

That for instance, if you are a medium level employee that has to advocate for more equal hiring policies for everyone, even in the case where this will cause other men in your workplace to exclude you, to not give you promotions, that this is a sacrifice that they were willing to make. That is a direct material sacrifice that we think is unjust. But secondly, we thought this cost was paid in things like shame and a general feeling of inadequacy. That you, if you are a conservative feminist female politician, for instance, who is constantly harassed on Twitter about not making sufficiently liberal policy in their world that supports solidarity, that is a cost upon you when you are wracked by guilt by not being able to adequately help other women in the movement, even if in many cases you didn't actually have the ability to properly help these other people. So we think that is an unjust moral cost as well. That is why I think independent of outcomes in terms of the feminist movement, they do need to justify this cost"

                  "text": "upon individuals. Secondly then, let's talk about what solidarity looks like. What I think Poland gives us here is a series of general claims about historical inequality and globalism. It is astonishingly unclear what they are specifically advocating for and what solidarity looks like in the real world. So it is unclear to us, for instance, why progression in your career would require you to unemployed other women, as I suggest illustratively. And I think we needed a lot more specifics in order for them to be able to claim benefits to a wide variety of women. And I think the reason why they are ambiguous in this case is because there is legitimately ambiguity in the world over what is good for women. So we gave you numerous examples of it. The issue of religious headwear, for instance, is widely contested across the world. Many women in the West believe it is oppressive towards women in the developing world in regressive strands of religion, whereas lots of people around the world and in Muslim countries, for instance, genuinely believe they are more comfortable and feel empowered by this headwear. We think it is wrong for the West to impose a narrative of solidarity upon them and to decide what is universally good for women and then try to build a narrative of solidarity around them. Even issues like abortion, which I think are the most probably sympathetic to their case. Many of us happen to be pro-choice in this room because debate is a liberal situation. I think billions of women in the world are pro-life due to things like religious reasons and actively oppose a narrative of solidarity that aims to convert every country in the world to the most leftist strand of feminism that exists in the left. We think it is wrong to stake our movement upon the specific interests of people in this area. And I want to note that these illustrations take opposition at their best, where women in privileged contexts do in fact have an underlying level of concern for the needs of others. Because what it proves is that even if you are broadly concerned about them, the way that you rectify that concern is through imposing your agenda upon them in a way that is unjust. So I think the consequence of this is one of two things. Either A, they have an incoherent movement that is incoherent insofar as people have differing interests over what is good. They disagree upon that. And so there are competing narratives of solidarity from different groups. So one narrative of solidarity from like more religious women for instance who want more conservative versions of feminism one narrative of solidarity from women in the in like more urban western context one incredibly leftist version you aren't able to rile people up around a common goal or secondly they have to make alternatively they make a decision on which version of feminism they prefer but this is likely to be slanted towards the interests of the privileged. And we gave you two reasons for this, which I think go unresponded to. The first thing we suggest is that privileged people are the ones who are able to manufacture feminist media and the agenda to begin with. So for instance, prominent female politicians in areas like Western Europe are the ones who get a lot of airtime on television, and so they get to set the agenda for what issues are the most important to discuss. So if they think that the wage gap, which is more approximate to their lives, is more important than something like gender-based violence, they will build a narrative of solidarity around that. Social media advocacy, in many cases, I'll take you in a second, centers around things like microaggressions rather than real material issues that women in the developing world experience, because rich people are the ones with the highest ability to be able to spend time on social media creating this content. Before I move on, I'll take the point. Not how the side of the government overwhelmingly focuses on social norms and issues, totally forgetting that equality and solidarity can also function in social situations, within their own groups, within people, within families, within workplaces, not only in politics, not only in social norms and religion. Yeah, so I think, A, we have given you reasons to suggest that it will be overwhelmingly centered towards trivial social issues because it is controlled by people who care disproportionately about this. If the argument is people who are collectively in a materially oppressed situation will band together and have solidarity, I think that is unlikely to be successful because these are people with the most limited amount of political resources. So even if every incredibly poor woman in America decides to band together, these are still people who don't have the financial resources to for instance build a strong movement and can't lobby to the same degree. The second reason why this is unequal is because the idea of solidarity requires reciprocity, which is to say if I am a privileged person, the movement of solidarity means I want other people to also contribute towards me. It can't be one way. So if I, for instance, have a lot of feminist protests around something like sexual harassment, and I don't see poor women from other areas showing up to my sides of the issues or seeing them as important, then by extension of that, I don't feel a similar level of obligation towards them because I don't feel as though they have sufficiently contributed towards my issues. So this explains why the movement is likely to be fractured along these lines as well."

And lastly, that individuals are more able in our world to rise to the top to capture things like important positions in politics and business when they are not forced to make sacrifices that are actively damaging to their career. That is when they are able to rise up and create change that is beneficial for women through things like role modeling, through more policies that are helpful, through using their capital to donate towards feminist causes.

First of all, we believe that this is an extremely unlikely way of this narrative to function. Pano will believe this simply won't apply to contentious issues in most cases. And this is what our leader of opposition has already told you. Pano will believe that there are a lot of issues that the feminist movement can focus on without alienating anyone. There is no reason for them to focus on contentious political issues. This is talking about things like sexual abuse being bad. We believe that there generally aren't women who will disagree with that. Then secondly, Pano, we tell you that the solidarity narrative very likely doesn't tell you what exactly to stand for. And so we believe that if you don't believe that very likely doesn't tell you what exactly to stand for. And so we believe that if you don't believe that something actually harms women, you're extremely unlikely to oppose it at the point at which you stand for the solidarity narrative. The point at which the movement simply tells you, well, you have to support other women, you have to sometimes lose your own comfort in order to, for example, call out problematic behaviours, we believe that it is in most most cases, up to you to decide which exact behaviours are problematic. At this point, your point about alienating women who are against those mainstream feminist narratives simply kind of falls out of this round. Falls out of this round. Lastly, we believe that in most cases, simply they once again disregard our point about these being very likely localised. This means that at the point at which we live in a highly religious society, like for example India, we are firstly extremely unlikely to buy into this mainstream feminist movement in the first place, meaning that those narratives never will actually reach you, but then secondly you're likely to have your very own support groups that don't actually tell you to oppose those things, believe that this interpretation of this framing is really, really uncharitable on their side of the house.

First of all, we believe that their impact on this case is absolutely absurd. Panal will believe that these women are extremely unlikely to publicly denounce the feminist movement because it looks extremely bad to denounce a movement that talks about issues you've obviously managed to avoid. At the point at which you manage to actually get yourself into this privileged situation, into this situation, after you, for example, are able to have this high income, we believe that you're really, really extremely unlikely to talk negatively about the movement that simply talks about you being the privileged one. At this income, we believe that you're really, really extremely unlikely to talk negatively about the movement that simply talks about you being the privileged one. At this point, we believe that those women are extremely unlikely to do this. So what are they actually likely to do? Panel, we believe that the much more likely response on their side is those women actually wanting to make up for it, because at the point at which the movement simply calls out their privilege and calls out the fact that they have managed to avoid all this discrimination, we believe that in order to simply look good, but also in order to not feel guilty about themselves, they're extremely likely to, for example, give out resources to actually help those vulnerable groups. We believe this is a much more likely response. Not only this already flips your case, this means that even if those women are guilty on our side of the house, this simply leads to even more benefits to those most vulnerable groups on our side of the house. But panel, lastly, even in their best case, even in the case at which they actually manage to get way more women in those higher up positions that are then able to, for example, change the systems, we believe in their best, those women have no incentive to do this because at the point at which they actually buy into a narrative telling them that the only thing they need to do for other women is succeeding themselves, even at the point at which they reach those high positions, they're extremely unlikely, for example, push for some political change or actually support other women is succeeding themselves, even at the point at which they reach those high positions, they're extremely unlikely, for example, to push for some political change or actually support other women, simply because the narrative of the feminist movement tells them they have already done their part."

For your concession, the feminist movement tells women that they shouldn't model, they shouldn't be a stay-at-home mom, they shouldn't do the things that they are doing. So why will these women want to participate in a movement that they are not represented by? First of all, we literally don't tell you this. We tell you about why this narrative is likely to be about non-contentious issues. But then secondly, if there are some women who are literally in the status quo already against the mainstream feminist narratives, we believe that they're extremely unlikely to actually buy into the feminist narratives. They're extremely unlikely to actually listen to what the feminist movement tells them to do, they're extremely unlikely to somehow oppose the feminist movement, because already they don't even hear the narrative, they don't even follow feminist channels on YouTube or Instagram, who believe this is a group they have chosen really, really unstrategically."

What we tell you from the first of our speech is that most women can't really identify with the narrative pushed on side proposition. Because this narrative simply looks like, for example, Sheryl Sandberg which is a literal millionaire telling women that opportunities are around them they just have to simply lean into them. This narrative looks like feminist movement telling you to be a strong independent woman in full control of your life. We believe that for two major reasons. Most women simply can't identify with that narrative and think that such opportunities simply aren't attainable to them. So A, we tell you, we believe that this narrative is very often pushed by extremely privileged women, which are the ones who have achieved the success. This is the thing that their proposition has already conceded in their speeches. And this means that for most women in those lower social standing, this simply causes distance.

We tell you that the actual women who are likely to look out for support from the feminist movement are the ones who feel the discrimination in everyday life, are the ones who feel that they cannot improve their own situations by their own, are the ones that feel that they are unable to buy into the site proposition narrative. This means that once again they feel that it isn't even possible to develop and empower individually on site proposition. Panel, note how this already mitigates the impact from site proposition because we believe that the ones excluded from the feminist movement on our side likely don't buy into it in the first place. But panel, this also brings us to the second impact. We believe that on their side of the house those women simply feel like either blame because the feminist movement tells them that they have autonomy over their situation and yet it is their fault that they're not succeeding in such a huge way as the feminist role models do. But then secondly what they're also likely to feel is simply feel that the feminist movement isn't for them but is only supporting women that already are in positions of power simply once again denying the existence of patriarchy and of their everyday struggle. This means that on their side of the house those women who need the support from the feminist movement the most are extremely unlikely to buy into this, are extremely unlikely to for example like get help from the feminist movement because they feel extremely unlikely to buy into this, are extremely unlikely to, for example, get help from the feminist movement because they feel the movement doesn't target their needs. And so they're unlikely to, for example, go into a feminist support group. They're unlikely to, for example, go into a course that is like many of the feminist movement, believe that this is an extremely tangible change on their lives on our side of the house. Importantly, this argument is crucial because it happens even if no one actually acts differently under the narrative on their side. We believe that even if no one actually changes their behaviour, what's important is that those vulnerable groups feel exclusively on our side, that the feminist movement is there for them and is there to support them. This means on our side exclusively, they can actually get the support. And for this, please vote opposition. Thank you. Ready?"

Because the only way opposition can get any of their benefits on forcing people, for example, to help others, to give back to their communities, to make sure that other women are well off, is to do the prescriptive things. The only way they get past the self-interest is to shame people, to tell them that if they do not support, they are not enough, they don't care about women, and that is what we thought was bad."

One, because the channels of the feminist movement are controlled by the powerful. The people who are up there doing the speeches and giving the talks are Sheryl Sandbergs, for example, who care only about lean and feminism and the wealthy parts of the movement. It is media conglomerate executives, for example, who pick the most privileged, the most fit for media, those who are the most representative, for example, within them. It is not those who are poor. It is not those who are minorities, who have historically been disadvantaged by these movements, who control these narratives. And therefore, disproportionately, this is going to be about benefiting solidarity on wealthy issues for wealthy people. Secondly, because minorities are cut out by the expectation that solidarity is reciprocal. And I think this has to do with the way in which the narrative is internalized. When as a little girl, you see in the media that helping another woman out eventually benefits you when she comes back and helps you in need. And implicit in that, I think, is a self-interested bias, a self-interested incentive, and that is what you link with solidarity. The problem is that minorities often cannot give back in the self-interested way that side opposition talks about. That when you as a white feminist show up to your protest about microaggressions, you do not see black women marching alongside you because they are, for example, working for their families since that is something that they need to do. And therefore, the solidarity does not instead apply to minority issues, but it only applies to the privileged. The third thing we told you about is people see themselves with those who they have in common. It is difficult for a white woman from Toronto to connect with an indigenous feminist from South Africa. They cannot understand, for example, what years of apartheid can do in terms of the feminist movement. And I think in this way, when you imagine yourself marching alongside in solidarity with other people, you imagine yourself with people similar to you. So the forms of solidarity that they're talking about, where it is those who are privileged who are helping the disprivileged, are in fact the least compelling form of solidarity. I think the"

It is the sex workers, for example, who are the nail that get hammered down by the steel mallet of solidarity under their side and that is when you get all of their harms. So it flips their argument. But secondly, it mitigates their claim on social change. The issues that they talk about are the ones that have lots of capital to already be independently addressed from our side. Even if you do not have the minority feminists, for example, going out to protest about these issues, the fact that there are large majorities who will still care about them either side means they get addressed regardless. So this outframes the entirety of the opposition case, and it is so damning that they still have not chosen to engage"

                  "text": "with us by second. Theme number two on the unfair instrumentalization of women. Even if the framing is not correct, I still think we are winning here. What we told you was this. Women are not a means to an end for a social good, and it is both morally unjust but also bad for women to instrumentalize them under their side. Sex workers under their side are shamed for the way they present their bodies because that is not seeming in solidarity with other women. Conservative women are told they are not good feminists because of the way that they think. Their response is a principle about how women have obligations to one another, especially to the disprivileged. Aside from the fact that this is contingent on the practical, I have three other things to say. One, the women that they are harming are not those who are culpable for the harms that opposition tells you about. And this could talk to you in second about how the vast majority of these social structures were ones that were constructed by the patriarchy, and therefore harming more women to solve the problem is counterproductive to their policy. Secondly, because to the extent that women may have been complicit in the suffering of other women, it was a coerced form of complicity. To the extent that, for example, white women maybe were in fact told, or those who were privileged were told, and internalized within the patriarchy that other women were bad and therefore did not have incentives to support them. That is not their choice, and therefore it is still wrong to punish them for doing so. But thirdly, because I think what we gave you was a more compelling and better principle, that people have different conceptions of a good life and therefore the feminist movement should empower them to do so. That you should be able to be a conservative and a feminist at the same time that's something that you believe in. That you should be able to, for example, pursue sex work even if that doesn't seem in solidarity with other people. The response from their side is that this is illegitimate. That is an absurd claim. We told you that many women have many reasons to pursue incentives. They're not simply tools to be used by the feminist movement and I think the fact that under their side they use them as tools as such is something that is morally reprehensible. The last thing they say is our side denies support for the vulnerable because they cannot identify themselves with the movement. One, I out-framed this in theme one, but two, why? It's completely unclear as to why the vulnerable woman cannot find support under our side of the house as well, that our narrative is about individual development and success, and that can be different for every single individual person. So you can still get support from other women under our side of the house, albeit slightly less so, I'm willing to concede, but that is still less important than many of the other things that we talked to you in this debate. The last thing is on social change, but before that, PY. Final piece of note, how women of privilege have only the possibility to actually be made aware of their privilege and be aware of how they can actually impact other women negatively on our side of the house. The problem with women not being responsible for their own privilege only exists when they have no narrative that tells them how their privilege wags. On our side, this narrative is given by the feminist movement. That is when they can actually change. No, I think this education already exists. I gave you three reasons for why it is not very plausible that the solidarity under your side of the House is likely to be that, because of the way in which people think. I still think you need to engage with that."

Firstly, that there were individual incentives to produce change under either side that converge even without solidarity. The rights of abortion, for example, which all women tend to support, or rights against gender-based violence. You do not need solidarity in these cases, you just need people to turn out to vote, which will happen under either side. Secondly, because there is a growing social consciousness among allies, which was our third argument, that their side stamps out. I think this is an alienating narrative to men, when for example it feels threatening and therefore there's a rise of anti-feminist movements that we've seen recently because women are collectivizing in a way that men do not see themselves being included in, because how do you include yourself in feminism and in solidarity that only is about women helping each other? But thirdly, because when women succeed, they will help others. And I think this is crucial. You knew what it was like to be doubted every step of the way, to be laughed at in board meetings, to be told to go away because you didn't belong to be there. And you do not need the feminist movement to tell you that other women are deserving of respect and empathy. Of course, it will not be perfect. We concede that you will not completely understand the issues of minorities under either side. But their movement alienates people from this narrative in harmful and pernicious way. It locks people out of movements that were supposed to help them. And on side proposition, we could not support that. I think it's best to speak"

Comparatively the individual support for women exists on both sides of the house given that people have other individual sources of support but they do not have this one support this one collective support from the feminist movement which is extremely important especially to the most disenfranchised people in society."

These will be women who are already privileged in the first place. Why? Because they are in a position where the fact that they are giving something up has impacts. So for instance, a CEO of a company calling her co-workers out for sexist behaviour, potentially risking her position. And the fact that this woman managed to become a CEO in the status quo means that she was probably came from a privileged background, able to go to university, able to carry the double burden by, for instance, hiring a babysitter, likely from the majority ethnicity or religion. And so this means that the group that is making sacrifices on our side is the most privileged group in society, and they are making the sacrifices in favor of those minority groups. And so panel, that is why we are winning this debate, because we are showing you how the most vulnerable actor is the one that is better off on our side of the house. Okay, a note that comparatively, on your side, these underprivileged women have no support system at all, because they do not have the awareness that there's a big movement fighting for them. They do not have the awareness that, and also the issues that they are facing are often extremely difficult to overcome because they are structural discrimination at work, biased during job interviews, etc. And therefore they need this huge source of support that they only, this collective support that they only get on our side of the house.

Firstly, on the framing of narrative and buying. Secondly, on the situation of individual women. Lastly, on the best-case way. So firstly, on the framing of narrative. Panel, note how most of the points that site proposition tries to push throughout this debate is that, well, this narrative is only for privileged people because it is only pushed by such, because feminist movement is only about privileged people. Panel, even if we assume this was entirely true, we believe that it also applies to their side. Panel, if the narrative needs to be so narrow and so specific in order to convince anyone to buy into it, we believe that this also happens on their side. What this means is that this entirely undercuts most of their impact because at the point at which they tell us, well, exclusively on our side of the house, those people who are underprivileged are simply cut out of the narrative. We tell you no, if the narrative only talks about specific issues, about solidarity within specific issues, but also about specific ways of actually advancing yourself and actually like improving your very own personal situation, we believe on their side this issue is entirely symmetric. Once again, we believe that this is simply really unstrategic to try to out frame us on symmetric frameworks. And panel, we believe that at this point, the impacts on their side are simply way worse. Because we believe that on our side, you can still feel the support even from your very own social group. Panel, even if you believe that well, this support only happens within social groups, the people who are more privileged help the people who are more privileged, the people who are less privileged also help people who are less privileged, we believe that in the end, you can still feel the comforting narrative that there is someone in there who will actually help you because you probably do have some social group around you. What actually happens on their side is that you can feel the benefits of individual development once it actually isn't attainable to you in any way. We believe at this point, people are way, way more likely to actually buy into a narrative that's comforting and that actually acknowledges their struggle. That's something that exclusively happens on our side of the house."

Yes, we acknowledge this throughout this debate. We tell you, yes, some women will have to harm them, but this will be for the greater benefit. Not how we tell you that for every such woman that loses out on, for example, her promotion by calling out an abusive boss, there are several more that can, for example, avoid the abuse whatsoever by simply not coming into this workplace or actually knowing what is in for them. Panel, we believe that at the point at which they never engage into the comparative weighing and into us telling you how we are actually the ones that protect more victims from being created and protect the more vulnerable groups within this debate, who believe that they simply lose out on the trade-off of ours because yes, like some women, we'll surely be harmed on our side, but we believe that there are way more that will be harmed on theirs."

And what we tell you throughout this debate is that we're trading off the more privileged women for whom individual growth is only attainable for the less privileged ones who can, yes, feel the comforting support, but can never actually feel that those millionaires and those celebrities talking about individual growth are actually talking to them. And panel, at this point at which we acknowledge this trade-off between those two groups, we believe that we can win on firstly the vulnerability of the groups, secondly the scalability of the impact, because we believe that the belief and support network is actually able to benefit everyone, even though both the least and the most privileged ones. But lastly, panel, we believe we can also win on the likelihood, because at the point at which they never actually tell us who does the narrative, like they never actually engage in the fact that the narrative doesn't reach everyone equally, that there are some people who buy into the feminist movement way more, and there are some people who need its support even more, we believe that at this point at which we prove to you that the only ones actually buying into the narrative are the ones actually needing help from the feminist movement and are the most vulnerable groups. We believe even if they manage to prove all their impacts, they're simply once again in a vacuum and they simply don't apply to the only groups that actually listen to the narratives. We believe for those reasons, vote opposition."

In response to the moral wrong of the oppression of autonomy of the people the feminist movement swore to protect, and in response to the alienation of women and men in a narrow definition of solidarity that would trample on the voiceless, opposition gave us silence. When we asked first opposition in the very first minutes of our constructive why the feminist movement's protection of minorities ought to come at a sacrifice of other women, we heard silence. When we asked second opposition why it was going to be a safe space when the resentment of women and men shut out of an exclusionary movement would cause people to leave, we heard silence. And when third opposition ends up telling us that the sacrifices of women would quote-unquote pay off, they were silent to the actual desires of women who clearly know when maternity leave or gender-based violence is necessary and clearly can vote into policies or do the kinds of actions that they want when it comes at no cost to themselves, who are not babies that need to be paternalistically coddled, but should be able to make their own decisions about their lives, about their empowerment that the feminist movement should never have infringed upon."

The first on the principle that opposition seriously just has very little response to. Regardless of practical consideration on Canada, we told you that we ought not hurt the other individuals that existed within the movement. And I just wanted to point out how the vast majority of the responses that we got from opposition was not principally or normatively based at all. That they told us that this was practically contingent such that if we helped other women in the long term, this would be justified. Where they told us that the women who were forced to sacrifice would have some kind of practical benefit in the end but that's not what the principle is about the principle is saying that it is unfathomable for a social movement to hurt its own to ever support any kind of alternative or model that went against all of its ideals to protect its individuals, that if its very core was to protect individuals, then it ought not directly hurt them because of the most controversial way that it would exist as a social movement that would obviously cause more harm unto people. We think that would always going to be the most, most unjust."

                  "text": "But the second thing on change, and honestly, I think we systematically questioned the opposition bench for solvency, and in many places they were incredibly vague. We pointed out why knowledge and education for when it was the case that privileged individuals should know about disprivileged individuals were probably available on either side of the house, more so on ours, when we didn't have the fundamental question about solidarity and the privilege of solidarity actually existed. We told you that for non-contentious issues, which they tried to frame the debate around, that they would be supported either way, straight from the beginning of our first. If it was at zero personal cost to you and you were in a workplace and sexual harassment was happening and everyone was against sexual harassment, then you would obviously all be against sexual harassment. If you were in a male-dominated workspace where you had no solvency, where nothing could possibly happen, where you didn't have other women who could support you, it was bad to force women into a position where they probably wouldn't get anything done, where the only thing that would happen is they would jeopardize their own career. Opposition told us solidarity was likely, but they never proved what it was to happen. They concede in their reply that probably the way solidarity would exist would be privileged. And this doesn't across both ways, because our model is necessarily saying that we have flexibility in the individual development and empowerment of women that can exist for every single iteration of feminism. They assert no woman will be upset in second opposition. But clearly they would be, clearly they would be if they're not represented by a movement, as I think opposition points out. And their own buy-in argument does not make sense at all. It knifes their framing from first. If it is true that women in developing countries are fully and completely dependent on the feminist movement, and they were always going to buy into it, they probably weren't just going to say, oh, I no longer care about my own rights because the feminist movement is not trying hard enough. The feminist movement is trying. They're just not sacrificing other women for the good of these individuals. It is unclear why this causes people to move out of the feminist movement. We see that women at the top were likely to help the ones at the bottom when they had institutional and systematic change that opposition refused to acknowledge. On all bases, it is this case where the feminist movement is able to survive. Incredibly proud to propose. Thank you."

What does this look like? It means that they embrace the concept that LGBTQ individuals are capable of having a nuclear family. Note that this is quite similar to what the LGBTQ movement did with the free love movement when it came to doing things like trying to co-opt marriage equality for queer individuals. B, we think the messaging the movement would then adopt is they would advocate for the legitimisation of LGBTQ individuals being able to do things like have a family. So they focus on creating accessibility pathways, for example, making it far easier for queer individuals to adopt a child or have a biological one through IVF. Secondly, note that there are many iterations of what the nuclear family ideal looks like. So at this precipice in the debate, we think the LGBTQ movement would frame the ideal through the lens of queerness. For example, having the ability to have a family isn't only restricted to heterosexual individuals. But note that this doesn't mean that the community will have to advocate only for family at the expense of other things. We think they can still do it. We think they can still advocate for queer individuals having access to things like marriage. It doesn't have to be exclusively family."

For example, that having a mother and father isn't necessary in order to raise a child successfully, queer individuals can do this too. Thirdly, what is the actual comparative that opposition needs to defend in this debate? Note that in the context of the status quo, we've already been able to secure things like marriage rights for queer individuals in many liberal democracies, but the one stereotype that we have yet to defeat in the status quo is the notion that LGBTQ individuals are incapable of having a family because they're going to corrupt our children. Note that the stance of having a nuclear family isn't one that exists in a vacuum. It is a lifestyle choice that the movement is going to prescribe onto individuals. Therefore, on the side of opposition, they also need to prescribe an alternate ideal lifestyle for LGBTQ individuals to pursue. Note then on our burden. Insofar as we prove that, them choosing to co-opt a nuclear family ideal is able to empower the ability of LGBTQ individuals to pursue a family and uniquely dismantles the harmful stereotypes that are imposed onto them in the status quo, that is enough to take this round. Two arguments. One, on how the adoption of a queer family model is the best form towards humanising members of the queer community. And secondly, while we maximise the choice of members in the community to have access to things like family planning."

                  "end": 681.86,
                  "text": "On the first argument, three parts. One, note that the adoption of the family unit for many social movements has actually been an extremely strategic move, because a vast majority of the social movements in the status quo were successful largely because they chose to integrate the family unit into their models of hypocrisy. For example, the civil rights movement saying that all individuals, regardless of race, should have the ability to do things like have children. Or the feminist movement choosing to co-opt the nuclear family to show that working women are able to simultaneously hold a job and raise a successful family. What this means is that every social movement to an extent in the status quo recognises that society is built upon the family unit, and we believe that the LGBTQ movement participating in this trend is crucial towards their success. What is the conclusion of this layer? One, it shows that the concept of the nuclear family model is malleable and it's susceptible to evolution, so it isn't a stagnant one that opposition would likely try to argue to you. But secondly, past precedent shows that other movements have been largely successful when they choose to adopt this model, because what you're doing is you're trying to show the rest of society that we can be the same as you, and we are not as different as you think you are. Secondly, why is this trend of co-opting the family unit actually beneficial against fighting stereotypes? Because note, the biggest stereotype that queer individuals face in the status quo is that you are incompatible with the quote-unquote normal ways of life, that you are unable to exist as a functional member of society because your sexuality is different from the rest of them. The way you combat this is by humanising them. So how exactly does embracing the family unit humanise these individuals? Two ways. One, we do things like spotlight the very human experiences of queer families when it comes to raising their children. For example, through shows like Modern Family, which show Mitch and Cam who are able to successfully raise their adopted daughter Lily, and the parallel once again is the free love movement, where we showed that all individuals deserve the ability to love whoever they want, and that was highly successful when it came to garnering things like marriage equality. But secondly, and more importantly, note that society's greatest respect is reserved for parents. Because uniquely, parenting is something that requires large amounts of sacrifice. It's difficult. And when we show that queer individuals are able to be good parents, we think this respect is cross-applied to LGBTQ individuals, because society can empathize with them with how difficult it is when it comes to raising a child. And the way we overcome these differences is by showing that our interests are aligned. Why are we able to do this? Because now we think that the notion is that these individuals are just like me and they deserve my respect. For example, Pete Buttigieg, who's not only a politician, is also capable of being a father. I think these are the instances of humanization that we think are good. Lastly then, on impacting, what are the two stereotypes we dispel? One, that these individuals are not capable of being selfless, because when we show that parenting is extremely difficult effort, it takes plenty of positive perceptions that are now attached to these individuals. And the parallel is that politicians who don't have families in the status quo are criticized as incapable because they can't even control their home. Literally every single successful politician has to have proven their capability via having a successful family. But secondly, and more importantly, we remove the gender stereotypes of maternalism and paternalism that exist in families. Because what we show now is that queer relationships can be diverse, that a family can sustain without having a maternal or paternal figure, and that both parents are capable of offering things like emotional compensation to their child. Before I go on, sure. Modern-day feminism and other social movements reject nuclear families as it confines people to static boundaries of being the breadwinner or the caretaker. Why should the LGBTQ movement then adopt this despite the rejection by parallel social movements? So, one, that's not true. I would argue that feminism, the only reason why we're advocating against the nuclear family unit is because it does things like say that women only have to have things like children. But uniquely on our side, the counter-narrative that we are pushing is that LGBTQ individuals don't deserve the right to have a family. Uniquely, when we dispel the stereotype that they are capable human beings, that is when we actually maximize choice."

                  "text": "Second argument on how we maximize the ability of members to have access to things like family planning. The preamble of this argument is that the purpose of the LGBTQ movement has always been to empower all choices. Three ways. One, not that society has historically disempowered LGBTQ individuals from having a family. Not only have they faced multiple hurdles in terms of the aforementioned stereotypes in the first argument, but the greatest injustice you could impose onto these individuals is that when they cannot access their right to have a family, why absent of this emphasis, you won't be able to get it on their side? One, the movement isn't going to concentrate resources on creating accessibility pathways. So sure, there'll still be queer individuals who want to have children, but these are only the most wealthy who can afford the high cost of IVF. What this means is that people, absent of having the movements backing them, will be structurally locked out of accessing family planning. Secondly, how does the queer movement empower the choice to create families on our side? One, we advocate for paving accessibility in two ways. So one, when it comes to independent organizations like NGOs who provide funds to access things like IVF adoption and they provide consultation services. This is crucial because the barrier of entry into family planning for queer individuals specifically is very high. But secondly, we lobby governments to pass legislation that enshrines the ability to have kids. So we provide parental leave to queer parents, prevent discrimination in adoption centres, and we increase the accessibility of these individuals to experience the joys of parenthood. They would doubly punish these individuals on our side because absent of them actively embracing this model, you don't say that all queer individuals deserve the right to have a family and you don't empower them. No one should be stripped of the ability to have a child and that is May we now have the first crop take off the case for the side opposition. Hi, there is a microphone on the table. Do you want? Can everybody hear me if I talk at this volume? Then we're good. Thank you."

It says that there is just one way a family should look and that all people ought to choose to operate within that structure. This was never what the most diverse, broad-spanning community in the world wanted to embrace. Your queerness has no conditions. On setup, firstly, what does actively embracing the nuclear family ideal look like? The community sets this at the standard through messaging, social pressure, activism, and leadership. You, as an LGBTQ plus person, are told to aspire towards A, getting married, and B, having children as ideal. This debate then operates in two spheres. First, in countries where marriage and children are accessible to queer people already, like liberal democracies. In these countries, Proposition would actively put down and criticize gay people who did not get married to one person and adopt or have children the same way we might criticize single and childless people in the status quo. Second, in countries that do not have legal marriage and adoption, their side identifies this as the primary concern of the movement. This is a concern that Prime Minister completely skips over.

The feminist movement rejects motherhood as a precondition of your acceptance in the community, and the civil rights movement never focused on this. I mean, people had children before and after the civil rights movement. But secondly, note that their argumentation here was just example level. We think that there is more likely moral panic surrounding queer people, and so we would like, we see more dehumanization at the point at which you saw this type of adoption. Secondly, the second thing they tell you is about how the biggest stereotype in the status quo is that you're not a functional human being if you are a queer person.

                  "text": "Our first substantive argument is on decreased choice, and the thesis of this argument is why you get more coercion of LGBTQ plus people on their side. Three ideas here. One, structural alienation of subgroups within the LGBTQ movement exists on their side. Look, the queer community does not just contain gay and bisexual people, it also encompasses polyamorous people who date multiple partners and asexual and aromantic people who do not have interest in long-term relationships. Also, people who do not want nuclear families, slash do not see this narrative as appealing, regardless of sexual orientation, are not going to buy into the movement on their side of the house. Secondly, even for people that did buy in, you limited opportunities for exploration that were crucial to LGBTQ plus groups. Why is this the case? Because gay and trans people who are raised surrounded by heterosexual couples and heterosexual norms often do not realize their identity until later on in life. On their side, these people felt behind and excluded because they hadn't been able to immediately settle down the way that their own community, their only support system, said that they should. Thirdly, adoption and other ways of having children are very expensive. Even if it's legal, even if some NGOs step in on their side of the house, adoption is very difficult. It requires home inspections. It requires tens of thousands of dollars that are spent on the process. Further, we think the closer you get to emulating straight relationships, the more likely you are to see a need for expensive tech processes like in vitro fertilization that they tell you about. These were three groups of people who together comprised the vast majority of the LGBTQ plus community who felt shut out, invisible, dejected, and as though they were the wrong kind of queer people on side proposition's best ground. On their worst though though in countries that never Listened to queer people's calls for reform everyone felt dejected and as though they were unable to live a fulfilling life We think that is what this affects them go who choose to have children. Similarly, even if you embrace the family unit as a queer movement, it doesn't mean you need to shame queer individuals who don't opt into the model. Listen to their own mechanisms on their side of the house. They say that this social movement and this narrative is going to be so strong and so empowering, so obviously there would be coercive pressure in order to buy into the things that they tell you about. We think this is very tense with their own case."

The LGBTQ movement does not exist to pander to heteronormativity and straight norms. In fact, it would be tremendously harmful for the community to embrace the nuclear family. Three ideas here. One, on the capital trade-off between advocating for marriage rights and other rights and protections in countries without pre-existing progressive laws. Look, every dollar you pour in, every speech you give, every lawyer you hire, every event you organize for marriage rights trades off with those same things in favor of workplace protections, hate crime laws, visibility, and so on. This is according to their own warranting about the concentration of resources. There are two harms of this. First, on the scope of protections and what is more pressing. Marriage is not desired by all LGBTQ plus people, whereas basic economic and harassment protections are. Moreover, our protections are logically prior to marriage and adoption because the severity of harm is so much greater. Queer people need material subsistence, the right to feel safe at work, the right to not be killed as more pressing than a marriage contract. But second, more immediate rights and protections lead to marriage rights. This will flip their entire case. The best way to get a homophobe to change in their ways is for them to exist in and see the humanity of queer people in common spaces with them, which can only exist when basic workplace protections exist. Additionally, homophobic people often view marriage as sacred, thus they're further polarized away with their type of advocacy. This means more immediate rights lead to marriage rights eventually, but not the other way around. Secondly, on losing buy-in into collective actions in all countries. Very simply, we told you there were many LGBTQ plus groups and other groups of queer folks who cannot and do not want a nuclear family. Moreover, many people in the movement just don't want to have a family and children. These are huge swaths of people. You are likely to isolate and alienate them when your movement devotes significant resources towards their concept, fracturing the ability for the movement to do anything in collective action. Thirdly, on backlash, there's a unique moral panic surrounding children because society views them as particularly vulnerable. There's also a unique moral panic surrounding the sanctity of marriage within religious and conservative communities. Thus, it's safer and steadier to make sure that you can get immediate, smaller reforms because you risk danger to queer people otherwise. Three impacts. One, they lose access to more important material problems. Two, you lose the ability for the movement to advocate for anything. Three, you risk further danger. Queerness has no conditions. That is what we stand for. Thank you. And that's the first up for that very fine speech. And it is now time for the second up to extend the public case."

Now, what is the characterization of parallel social movements in the status quo, and how does the queer community fit into this trend? When we talk about the civil rights movement, we aren't talking about Martin Luther King, okay? We are talking about depictions of fresh off the boat, Asian families like Kim's Convenience, like Raven's House, making sure that every single disparate community is represented in the most humanized way possible, because society's greatest admiration is reserved for their parents. What this humanization does, is does more than say that they're humans, but say that they are selfless, they love individuals, they're responsible, they're capable, they have emotional intelligence to raise a child. They love, and they love beyond themselves, not selfish individuals. That is the greatest stereotypes that queer individuals have to overcome. That they refuse to carry their family's legacy. That they're living for themselves, living in their twenties forever, refusing to live in reality and for others. We make them selfless. We make them charitable and kind. That is how you humanise individuals. The suffering, the troubles of parenting, all of them make them selfless. We make them charitable and kind. That is how you humanize individuals. The suffering, the troubles of parenting, all of them make them uniquely humanized under our side of the house. The feminist movement as well is diverse. So they can't just claim that the feminist movement is inherently anti-motherhood because the feminist movement is probably the world's greatest social movement. The thing done on proposition is that motherhood was never a precondition to being a woman, but you were allowed to access it if you wanted to, and that is the crux of all social movements."

Because all of their analysis on having more pressing issues is exactly dealt with when we get more resources, more critical mass, and more support. This looks like two things. One, out of sympathy. This looks like the freedom for love movement, which means that straight individuals are likely to sympathize with you by saying that society is oppressing you and depriving you of a human right. The human right for marriage and love, on our side, we extend it to the human right of having and loving a family. Secondly, when it comes to critical mass, we think the other stereotype that the queer movement has to overcome in the status quo is that they are exclusionary. Why have a queer parade, a pride parade, and not a straight pride? And that is exactly how we get rid of the stereotype of exclusion because now there's no difference between a straight mother, a queer mother, a lesbian family. We all just want to love our children. We just want the best for our children. And through the depiction of queer individuals like this on our side of the house, we are able then to get humanization and political support. That means they will vote for your issues. That means they won't believe that you're overreacting when you're talking about, like, oppression. That means they believe you deserve rights, and that is how you get empowered in policy, but also in terms of, for instance, workplace discrimination. They don't believe you're inherently unhardworking, because if a queer parent and a queer father can love their son above all else, then surely all queer individuals too can share those characteristics, and we eviscerate the stereotype that they live only for themselves."

Yet somehow on their side of the house, they'll be able to create structures that prevent protection and etc. Surely they don't have to prove a positive comparative, but we are able to prove that the humanization of individuals gets far better. In fact, in developing countries, this probably gets even better because, for instance, the nuclear family structure is far stronger in these countries. For instance, in Malaysia, you need to have children to bring your family pride. But the only reason why they detest queer individuals then is because they can't have a family. They can't carry the family name. But now they can. Now they have a family. Now they have children. Now they have a loving wife. And now the queer community is likely to get more support then. Before I go on, I'll take a point. Proposition is running to the middle. Loving your children or showing families on TV that are gay is not their side of the house.

If you also want to defend depictions of family, if you also want to defend enshrining the queer family as being a viable option for queer individuals to take, then you are contradicting your first argument about how there are other more important things to care about. We are saying this is the most important thing because this is the prerequisite to everything else. Your case needs to engage dynamically. But secondly on individual empowerment in two ways. One as I've previously stated, every social movement is built upon empowerment, and even if that's not true, society itself is inherently oppressive, so any counter-narrative by social movements are required as the counter-narrative and the corrective mechanism for existing oppression. But secondly, when opposition says having children is difficult, that can't substitute for analysis. Just because you might not want biological children doesn't mean the millions of queer individuals don't. We must therefore empower the choices of these individuals, because IVF isn't the desire to be closer to a straight person, it is the desire to see your genes passed on, a biological extension of yourself for you to love and to care for and raise into a human being. And these are all points of actualization that opposition cannot co-opt insofar as none of their resources can go towards this empowerment if they believe this is so unimportant. But lastly, we proved that we're able to empower multifaceted representations of queer individuals insofar as historical depictions of queer individuals have been premised upon one-dimensional characterizations defined by their sexuality. Like the butch lesbian who wears flannel and sits on a motorcycle, the difference is that on their side, they are accessories to a plot and they're disconnected from the main story. When they become family members, when they're integral to the nuclear family structure, they interact with other people within the story in meaningful and interesting ways. And they're able to have dimension that opposition would never allow them to have. The American dream was premised upon actualization and autonomy, empowering all individuals to achieve whatever they wanted to. If it was a family, proposition test, hear, hear. Thank you. All right, everyone good? Awesome."

I want to forward another extension as to why they get less support on their side of the house and it's because they decrease solidarity and cooperation with other movements. Note that right now the LGBTQ plus movement is able to cooperate with other progressive movements like the feminist movement and more younger left wing movements. The problem with the nuclear family is that it directly contradicts the aims of those movements. For example, in the feminist movement, they're trying to get rid of the oppressive labor roles that are endemic in nuclear families, that women have to be the provider for children, and that men are the breadwinners. It was oppositional, young, ambitious people because they didn't want to settle down and throw away their career. This was a massive impact because they got less financial support on their side of the house and they got less political support. These young individuals and feminists were less likely to show up for political rallies, less likely to lobby, which means that you not only lost LGBTQ plus people, you also lost massive levels of support from other individuals."

You never got change in terms of marriage. You never got change in terms of adoption if you didn't get buy-in. Buy-in was an a priori concern to every other impact in this debate. They never got access to their arguments if they did not have a strong movement. The second thing I want to talk about is about individual choice. Go ahead. Do you oppose the queer community's greatest political success of legalizing queer marriage since there are polyamorous people on your side as well? We would argue that if that comes at the cost of trading off with more immediate needs that people have, then sure, we oppose it. But on our side of the house, we think that we get better movements and stronger movements, which means we still accomplish the very same aims that you talk about. The second thing I want to talk about is individual choice. And I want to note the volume of material that Sungjoo gave you that was just never engaged with their side of the house. We told you there were polyamorous people and there were asexual people that were structurally alienated, that you limited the exploration of identities and you prevented people from exploring on their side of the house, which is a keystone experience in the LGBTQ plus community. That it was simply very, very expensive to do things like raise a child and enter a marriage. And there are two impacts of this. First of all, you vilified people that weren't able to do things like access marriage. And second of all, you forced people that didn't initially want to get into marriage to do it, which means that for a long period of their lifetime, they'll be very, very unhappy. Panel, I want to note that marriages are something that are inherently coercive. It is very, very hard to break out of a marriage, to do things like split assets. There's massive societal and reputational harms. So what do you do on their side of the house? You not only destroy the movement, but you reduce the quality of life of individuals. All of their argument is that people deserve a choice to pursue things like marriage. We would argue that, number one, this is contingent on people having the resources and the capacity to do so, but second of all, there's other mechanisms of fulfilling long-term marriages. Even if we don't support nuclear families on our side of the house, we're still fine with people having things like children, having things like families, having things like houses. I want to note that in this debate, the most important thing was buy-in, and when you fractured the most important thing, which was support from the LGBTQ plus community, you never got buy-in, you never got success.

I think it's insulting for them to say these are too irreconsolable values when we say that these are just things that are human and you can instead do it. We actually proved the flip. It's actually incredibly empowering for queer people to reclaim this ideal as something we can have for ourselves rather than them permanently letting the elite straight people concentrate it within their own. Second, I want to clarify what the act of embracing means because they assert it means forcing everyone into it. Our burden was never to get sweeping legislative changes overnight but the reason why embracing it was necessary and why free choice was insufficient was because the movement historically said and per their analysis says this is something that's bad for you so the only way to get that free choice and neutralize it is by saying this is an option which you can opt into instead so we are opening up choice for them and the parallel of this is simple supporting legalization of marriage doesn't mean all queer people are going to be pushed into becoming legally married right it's just a choice that's open and available for you that's the thing you never engage with they will oppose everything under their side two issues in the speech first on having narratives of choice while we're able to neutralise it. Second, on creating access for queer families. First, on the narrative."

And it was this framework to which you could operate to say that this is something, in comparison to other values in society which they may value, is something that we precisely can co-opt because it's in line with what it means to be a human and you can't necessarily bring this into the queer movement. I think first off claims that it polarizes homophobic people doesn't stand. What we explain was that it humanizes them. And the reason why it's like to trend towards acceptance rather than rejection is they don't give any reason why queer people are going to be like homophobic people are more opposed to queer people rather than queer people being in a family. What I'm saying is that because they believe in the idea of a family, per their own analysis, entering the family unit is what lets them see you as human individuals. Why is dispelling such narratives so important? Because first, it's what holds the community back from attaining social acceptance."

                  "text": "unless you're able to have this. Maybe there are other grounds to which you can get acceptance, but we explain why engaging on the specific issue of family unit is important. Their contention is that parallel movements oppose the family unit. This is untrue. The conception of a nuclear family has evolved to be inclusive of things like interracial marriage and adopted kids, and this deals with the extension of second opposition. It's all I can do on this. They don't prove it. Which means the burden they've yet to prove is why are these values so bad that they can never ever reconcile? You know, specifically in developing countries where the nuclear family was important, that we had to get this and it's going to be good. Let's do the weighing on coercion. Let's take what is our best case. On our side, some people are nudged towards opting into the nuclear family. On their side, some people are nudged away from the nuclear family. How do you resolve the deadlock? The first is that there are other barriers that make people reconsider having children. The time and monetary constraints of a nuclear family is what gave rise to countervailing narratives like don't have a child if you can't afford him, or be prepared for 18 years of parental duties which neutralises the push to have children. In comparison, it's easier to coerce someone out of having children because there's no tangible visible cause yet to say you are a bad queer person if you don't align with the values of not having children. That's why there's more coercion on their side because it's easier to bully someone out of it which is why we promote choice. But secondly, the problems of a nuclear family can be largely mitigated through community support for queer families or work-life balance legislation. But the harms of the lesbian woman who longed her whole life to raise a child but now cannot do so is exclusive to their side because they can never have a child. And that's why having a child is inherent to the nuclear family. On exclusivity of harm, we win. That's the distinction. That's why their side is far worse for choice. Their only mechanism for change are TV sitcoms. If you see gayness as sin, and you see a gay family on TV, you are more likely to view that as the conglomeration of sin than seeing gay people as handy dandy. That is an insane demonstration of your inability to listen to our case. What we said from first was that if you agree there's a concentration of resources, but how you're better able to push for these things means that you're not necessarily saying you have to opt into it, but the creation of the platforms and policies that you have is what pushes people towards it. And this issue takes some of their best on the second thing of creating access for queer families. Even if you could dismantle the idea of a nuclear family, the question was whether you should. Because the narrative that queer people are compatible with the nuclear family unit is precisely what lets you advocate for the support structures that enable them to safely start families, like IVF or adoption centres. I think it's the prerequisite to opening up choice, which responds to the seventh minute on org about why it's hard to have a child. I'm saying that embracing the nuclear family is what creates the platform for you to want to have that child. And this is important, because if you agree that these people are going to otherwise suffer, they really want to have a child because it's so important for their self-actualization. We create the pathway for them to get that point. It doesn't exist on their side. Their only response is this trades away resources from other predictions. This is just ridiculous. So we should just define all queer art because it's seen as less valuable. We should abandon protests to have trans people in the military because it only affects a small group of people? What we explain is that it's an important issue, so we should put resources into it, even if there are other considerations they should make, that is just non-comparative. Secondly, we explain it's actually easier to campaign for family support because family is glorified, because it's seen as intersectional with other movements, like supporting Planned Parenthood welfare, it becomes easier for us to get these legislative protections on our side or the forms of social acceptance that are on their side. So at the end of this clash, they don't actually have any exclusive harm or benefits in this debate. Our third substantive expands on this excellently by explaining that, even if it wasn't direct material alleviation, it was through media representation that empowers queer people. Within pop culture, we pivot away from homogenized portrayals of queer people in movies as the eccentric character or someone who's the Mary Sue by showing that why within these families, there are someone who's core, someone that can be lovable, and someone which you are humanized with. At the end of this debate, we proved two very simple things that means we make it to the finals. First, we're able to explain why these parents are better able to have those children there, but two, why these people are able to get rid of the worst stereotypes that currently hold down the queer community."

Honestly, Team USA was disappointed when Team Malaysia decided that this debate would be about we have to defend gay people never have families and they get to defend that they always have access to families. I want to start this speech by really stepping into reality and talking about what this debate is actually about. Their side of the house needed to prove to you an overvailing narrative that told people nuclear families were something you ought to have, something that we should idolize, something that spurred all the change they wanted on their side of the house. Let's be very reasonable panel. Our side never needed to defend that these people could not have families. They themselves characterized you in first that in a vast majority of cases people could already have families when they chose to. That marriage laws across the world made it so that people could access these familial units. What then was the difference between the two sides? Because Team Malaysia, you guys getting up here for the entirety of the debate and trying to say we don't support families was not sufficient argumentation. The reality was this. Our role is one in which you got advocacy for immediate needs, that you still have things like access to gay marriage, but you've got support for the choices of LGBTQ people. Their side of the house had to defend an adoption of the norm, a norm that a nuclear family was viable. The second thing I want to do just at the top of this speech is point out a contradiction. Last Peeker says we didn't have to support the nuclear family narrative as it exists today or the specific iteration of it, but then they go on to say about why this narrative is such a good thing. Guys, if you think the nuclear family narrative is so problematic, then why are you supporting it on your side? Presumably you would also rather support a world where people had the agency to commit free choice, that we supported things like people's liberation and didn't antagonize people for settling down."

The first push we heard was on fractionalization, that when you were induced to the idea of a nuclear family, and when this is something the movement necessarily pushed for, the adoption came with a trade-off. In order for the LGBTQ movement to substantially push for change and to encourage people that this idea of a nuclear family was good, it came at the expense of ideas like liberation. It came at the expense of the idea that you could spend the rest of your life or take the first dozen years of your life to figure out who you are. You could explore your sexual identity. The idea of a nuclear family was diametrically opposed to these things. They could not just get up here and say, oh, we get this too on their side of the house, because the adoption of a norm, what this looked like when people were giving speeches about having a nuclear family and how it was so good to be a gay person and a familial unit, all of those things necessarily came with a trade-off. And that alienated people. In movements all across the world where support for LGBTQ people was already in the vast minority, you needed the person who was asexual or didn't have romantic preferences to buy into your movement because then you galvanized collective change that uplifted everyone.

But the change then was that you threatened one thing that people felt was closest, that the idea of the nuclear family was so enshrined in conservatism, which they concede to you themselves, and that necessarily meant that people felt aggravated and threatened when you also tried to adopt this idea of a nuclear family, that they felt threatened and were not likely to open reforms, that they immediately shut down. They hated the idea that people were overstepping on the nuclear family that they believed righteously belonged to them. So all of this meant that their arguments in this round were applicable to the vast minority of people, the places where nuclear families and the choice already exist, but our arguments catered to the vast majority. It is way too late again for Proposition to Reply to come to this. The last piece of material then I want to forward to you is this idea of elitism. They try to say that, ah, we make things less expensive on our side of the house, but this is not really the reason why things like IVF were so expensive. It was because companies knew it was an inelastic good and that people would pay anything to have access to those things, and they were able to use this monopoly power to create high prices. Their side of the house, maybe if they get a little bit more support of that, is knived by the fractionalization that occurs when they feel like the only way for the LGBTQ movement to go forward is to regressress because they concede this. The nuclear family is an outdated idea of how society runs, so why on earth proposition would you insist that everyone go to revert to it? I have no idea. Before I talk about the second clash on better outcomes. If conservatives are so uncompromising and will antagonize every deviation from the patriarchal nuclear family, how does a queer couple in an area where queer marriage is legalized opt into a family? I think that on your side of the house, you get more antagonization. I just explained to you that people feel like the thing they value the most, the nuclear family, is being stripped of them to begin with. This is why you preferred our counterfactual, where we did not set the bar as so high as to try and take a nuclear family, but pushed for gradualism, that you could still get access to things like equality in the workplace for LGBTQ people, but you did not need to insist on this primary doctrine that dictated the language and the rhetoric of the movement on your side of the house."

The act of embracement was a question of the lifestyle of those individuals and insisted that there was only one way you ought to live and one presiding paradigm. It was not about choice. This was different from things like marriage. It was about the one way you ought to live and one presiding paradigm. It was not about choice. This was different from things like marriage.

In response to a POI we give in their first they say ah the feminist movement like embraces nuclear families. Guys, that's just not true Feminism and fourth-weight feminism today is diametrically opposed to those ideas So in this regard we think it was a reversion of norms for the LGBTQ community to go back to adopt a nuclear family when their other, sister movements were harming it, which meant you got less buy-in from constituent and neighbouring social movements on our side of the house, and you got less ability, rather, to mobilise the change you so needed.

I think this entire issue is contingent on how people are going to react to the queer nuclear family, and their case of change also relies upon some degree of humanization. Insofar as we prove that our humanization is the most effective, that is how you're able to overcome stereotypes. You only believe it's a sin because you believe that queer individuals have horrible morals, but when you see them loving and caring for the child, then it gets rid of the stereotype that they are selfish, that they don't care. Three things. One, about backlash. How do you think any movement ever got any change? If people were so homophobic, does opposition really believe that the moment you say, let's have queer marriage, thereby encroaching on the sanctity of marriage, people are like, oh, that's fine. At least you don't touch the children, right?"

One, we told you about platforming successful stories, stories that on opposition would not exist because we told you about structures that never existed. Secondly, because of shaping parental perceptions. Like the feminist movement, they were not opposed to family because they empowered motherhood. They were opposed to the patriarchal norms of nuclear family. We can then be opposed to the homophobic norms of patriarchal family, and that is how families evolve over time. That is the reason why women are allowed to work and still have families, because things are allowed to evolve. But thirdly, on shared history, historically children are the very thing that connects all individuals when it comes to the love is free, it is about making common ground that opposition eviscerates."

What opposition has to defend is a world that never touches the idea of a nuclear family. By embracing it, we are able to show alternative mechanisms of somebody who could still love their children. The impact is simple. It's not just IVF. It is about stopping the demonization of queer families who are told by the movement that they are conforming to heteronormativity and are not allowed to access families."

Firstly, organisations who wish to keep their statutory status should appoint a large number of female leaders reasonably quickly at every level of their hierarchies. And obviously we would not be happy with just one or two token candidates. Secondly, insofar as we get tax revenue from this policy, the money will be spent disproportionately to help women and will also be part of the international aid budget. Thirdly, given that international policy requires a reasonably sophisticated tax code and state apparatus. We would imagine that this happens in primarily Western liberal democracies. But we say that our principles apply in any country in which opposition can prove to us that such tax codes exist. Fourthly, this debate presumes that the state and the religion are separate, so it does not occur in democracies like Saudi Arabia or Iran, but it does in secular states like India, South Africa and most of Europe. Fifthly, we realise that some of these institutions carry out genuine charitable activities and we support this. So we will therefore make all charitable activities tax deductible, just as we allow charitable work by corporations to be deductible. Just to be clear however, we will ensure that these activities are genuinely charitable, so things like missionary work do not apply. However, full day and exercise such things would. Let's be clear, these normalizations would still be tied to property, assets, investments and income."

                  "text": "empower women all across the globe. On to my first argument. Why tax exemption is a privilege and not a right. We think it is high time to update the RK policies with the favour of religion in order to reflect more modern values of equality. We believe that the government should have every right to tax women's coordination pursued precisely through the first view on the principle of reciprocity. Religious institutions could not exist without the support continually provided to them by the government. They could not hold poverty if the government did not hold up the law and the police force which we all pay for. More importantly, they could not exist without the right to free association, speech and freedom of religion, which is upheld by the police and the judiciary, which, once again, we all pay for. It is abhorrent that religions can derive such benefit from the taxes we pay and the laws which we uphold, and they do not contribute their fair share to upholding them. Secondly, as long as religions don't pay tax, the burden on ordinary people is dramatically increased. The general population pays for the billions of dollars of government spending, and whilst some of this burden falls on the wealthy, a lot of it does fall on ordinary, wealthy-class people, the poor and women. In our world, it becomes possible to alleviate this burden when religions pay fair taxes. Team Canada will leave poor women to make up for the greed of religions. So, to be clear, the premise of this debate is that religions owe an enormous debt to society and to the government and should have been paying taxes for it very long time. However, just as the government has taken it away, so too can the government forgive. With this, it could be reasonable for the government to forgive this debt if the religion helps it to promote certain policies. In the same way, crediting by forgiven debt is the debt of the enemy. However, it is reasonable for the government to forgive the debt of religions, since those religions help to promote certain useful policies. What we propose is to do something of a deal with religious organizations that is unprecedented for such deals. We already give Times Square this to corporations who promote affirmative action in the second or combat climate change. We will forgive the debt of religions which promote female leaders. That's what we stand for."

That's what we stand for. heroes. Now onto our second question. So it's time to know, why is policy resolved in the appointment of more women? Firstly, how does our membership incentivize change within doctrines? Let's outline in my example the money involved here will be a sufficient incentive for change within the religion. Note that this is an extremely large sum of money that we're talking about. It would impact religious institutions both on a small and on a large scale. On a large scale, when the Catholic Church has to pay tax on the CC channel, when it has to pay property tax on trying real-estate materials in every major city in Europe, the church that currently exists will not be financially viable, as any reserved religious organization would not be able to exist as it currently does. In addition, we imagine that for most religious leaders, the thought of losing their jobs, their buildings, and other pet projects they've been working on for a long period of time will be a sufficient incentive for them to change their policy. Furthermore, we think that on a smaller scale, with independence laws and smaller congregations, they will also come by without policy. We imagine that it is most likely also that for inferior leaders, that will close down entirely, as would be the case given that they will die of small donations and tax exemptions too. Furthermore, we think this incentive would also speak to particularly hardline and devout leaders within the movement. Why have that aspect? Because every program that a hardline leader wants to promote still requires money. Launching new missionary efforts, converting new funders, or introducing new education programs in order to save souls, these things all require money. You see, no reason why they would prioritize not appointing female leaders over anything other than a bit of their doctrine. In addition, we think this is especially true given that we imagine that at least some religious organizations will have a private policy and will then keep their money and their missionary benefits. Given that happens, any church where you please honor that we refuse to comply, this is being outcompeted and losing followers as a result. Now, we think that this policy, this chain, will be fairly easy for leaders to make within their religions. Why? Two precisely. Firstly, if a religious leader was to introduce a policy, even if they are doing so for purely financial motives, it is very easy for them to claim that they are doing it for genuine doctrinal reasons. That's why when Pope Francis wanted to soften the church's stance on homosexuality, he was able to back himself up by claiming that the Bible already supported him. The Jew on Jesus' son on the mountain said, if a man is gay and loves God, who am I to judge him? Thus he justified an entirely new policy with reference to old, already existing doctrine. Can you imagine something similar would happen when appointed human leaders. He perhaps would quote Jesus' words, but the person with the most knowledge should be the leader, or any other thing of sorts. This is especially easy given that religion can be very contradictory, and leaders can choose the interpretation that most believers get pregnant with women in order to prepare for the equality, while still adhering to their religion. The second reason why this change will be easy to make. There are men inside a school who want to change doctrine. Who want to change doctrine. This is for two reasons. Firstly, they want more confidence. They will get back if they incorporate other values into their religion. And secondly, they live in a modern world, they absorb modern media, and the idea of female leaders is just by no means a thing. And this means that there are people who exist who want to change doctrine. There is no less resistance for them to do so. But, we'll thank you furthermore and lastly why is it that this change would be accepted by members of these individual organizations for comprehensive reasons firstly it is the nature of religious leaders that the court was deferred to them because they think they come from a place of higher purpose and they represent something bigger than the individual religious leaders commonly affect politics in a community they have dinner people's, have the power to win hearts and minds, panel. And as such, they are trustworthy and essential parts of communities. Secondly, when women show charisma, knowledge, and dedication, the men who oppose their curriculum will come to respect them and learn that they should respect women in the more general sense. Thirdly, with generations, what now seems to be radical ideas become far more accepted, and what we see is that this resentment is going to naturally cease to exist with time. Fourthly and finally, it is just not true that women take no leadership roles in these communities to begin with. There is to an extent no female leadership, and it was our policy to build on that. That's why in the Indian Tunchayak, the community councils, that is, women routinely take leadership roles. If conservatives can accept women on village councils, they can certainly get used to female priests. Part of it for all these reasons, and because we refuse to grant privilege to those who willfully slander women, we are very proud to propose."

The first idea they gave us is that they're going to require religious institutions to appoint a large number of women, they're going to require them to appoint them quickly, and they're going to require them to appoint them at all levels. We have a few questions about that, because that actually was sort of vague when you get down to it, right? What is the timeline? How many women need to be appointed? When it comes to the formalities of the tax code, Team Wales needs to have those answers. We'd also ask you, does a woman need to be the pope? Really, how consistent are they going to be with, of course, forceifying all levels of leadership happening? Another question, would they consider the mother superior of a covenant of nuns to be a female religious leader? We ask you secondly, what if women genuinely believe that their role in the religious structure is not to be a formalized leader? What happens in Team Wales' world when no women volunteer themselves up for this position? In terms of their argumentation, they told us that taxation is the right product for religion. We told you that society can also benefit from religion the way that religion benefits from society, and that's why we've negated the obligation to tax like we do with charitable institutions. And if it's true that they're so principally required to pay their taxes, why are they willing to present an exemption if they comply? The only reason is that they actually don't want to separate the church and state. They want to use the church as an arm of the government to promote their politically subjective doctrine. I think this is really tense with the model they brought. We gave you a POI on the roles of men and women in the religious institutions and whether or not they thought they were equal. They gave you a sort of evasive answer in which they said, we want equality, which we know, under the status quo, they don't think the roles of men and women are equal within the religious framework. This means two things. Firstly, it's tense with their concession that women have existing power and existing roles. It means that they just don't value those roles, and I'm going to prove to you why that's a real underestimation of the power of women."

The reason we know this is true is that Kopp concedes it. It's their exact mechanism that they use in the trade-off they want to have between the rights of some and the rights of others. I'm going to demonstrate why it is that they've significantly undervalued allowing the most robust incarnation of religious freedom. And here's why it's important. Question mark. Religious freedom is a necessary extension of several other things. It's a necessary extension of freedom of assembly, of freedom of association, and of freedom of expression. It also is a necessary extension of the right to autonomy and the right to self-determination. These are all things that Team Will seems to value when it comes to a very specific group of women who are religious and who have the aspiration to become leaders. They don't want to apply those values to all members of a society which rights are prioritization. Here's where it gets far worse for teen women. The rights violation that they're engaging in is one which people can buy their way out of. Wealthy congregations are just going to pay the taxes and get their tax status out of the way and carry on with business as usual. So that means that Proposition is only prepared to violate the rights of the poorest within society. That means that Proposition's best case scenario uses extortion to weaponize people's poverty against them. Team Canada finds this intrinsically immoral,"

Power structures within religious institutions are not as rigid as team proposition makes them out to be. Remember, religion is not just about giving people a way to believe in a higher power. Religion is also about giving people rules to live by and a way of thinking. So yes, religions typically do have different roles for men and women, but to say that one role has more value and power than the other does a disservice to the countless roles of women within the religious framework. Let's look at nuns within the Catholic Church who know, don't give sermons every Sunday, but have spread education all around the world for hundreds of years. In the minds of millions of children raised by nuns, women hold a different but a hugely potent responsibility when it comes to activating the lives of their wives. On this basis, it's wrong for the government to tell women that they are oppressed and then ride in on some sort of a white horse. It's up to women themselves to decide that they want change. And if and when religious women decide that they do want this change, there is an existing mechanism for them to realize this change that affirms freedom of religion rather than violating it. A process is as follows. Religion, like the people in this room, places a high value on discourse and debate. This comes in the form of a discussion of different interpretations and readings of foundational religious texts. Slowly, when dissenting opinions gain ground, they form a new congregation or a new sect. This is why you have Catholics and Protestants, Shiites, Sunnis, Wahhabis, and Alawites. The difference between these groups is their opinions on what the best interpretation of their text is. Specifically, within Judaism, you have egalitarianism Judaism, which is actually specifically focused on the principle of granting equality within the framework of traditional Judaism. I think that's the best proof there is that we can get the same outcome on team composition without using an unnecessary intervention on the important framework on religion. But finally, they make the change slower and less likely to happen. Why? Proposition wants this debate to be about the most extreme religious groups that are the least likely to change on their own. These are the exact religious groups that already perceive the modern world to be at war with their God. They believe that God is the highest authority and not the state, and that the state is attacking their way of life by trying to violate that higher authority. This means they leave public society, in which they feel threatened, and turn inward, they turn insular, making them less receptive to values of liberalism, making them less receptive to the change the proposition wants. They failed on their burdens. We're proud to have them. Thank you."

I'll first be rebounding their facile attack story case, then be talking about their freedom of faith point, as well as their second substantive argument. Now firstly, about their facile attack story case. So basically the only attacks that they had were on our mechanism, and that we weren't specific enough. No thank you. Firstly, we tell you that we are giving general mechanisms that are going to work different in each case scenario. We don't necessarily have to give you a unique time frame for everything. That's not our burden to take. They then tell us that we have three burdens on our side.

They tell us that we have to show this depressing problem, no thank you, that the model is the only way to achieve it, and that we get more good than harm. Firstly, and the idea that it's a depressing problem, my first speaker did address this, and I will be talking about this entirely in my substantive, no thank you. They tell us that we have to prove that it's the only way to do this. No! We have to prove to you that this is a way to do this, and that this is a way that we are going to achieve the aims of equality that we think are so important. We're having to have policies that occur simultaneously. We're just saying, no, thank you, that this is something that we think is good for society, and that is how we achieve less harm than good, because we create this type of equality. They never told us what their versions were, because conveniently, of course, they didn't have any. We think that their purpose is to show us why this model won't work, why it won't provide some equality for women, and why at the very least it will result in no thank you. Tax revenue, even if our case doesn't stand, right? So they tell us in response to our case that tax is a privilege, not a right. That we think that no women are going to volunteer for these positions. We think it's completely a distinct mischaracterization to say that no women believe in their religion enough that they would like to lead other members of their church. That's simply untrue. We think that secondly, no thank you, they tell us that we're trying to use the church as a political tool. No thank you. If the political tool is to make the equality of women a priority, to make people, girls go into education, no thank you, to be able to empower them to achieve the most that they can, we're fine if that's a political motivation that we believe the church should be doing. Basically, we contradict ourselves when we say that there are women in power, but not women in power already, that this change hasn't already happened. Well, we told you that there are women in political power, and why is this important, right? Because the church right now is bypassing what changes are occurring in all other parts of society. In India, women serve in representative councils. No thank you. But in religion, women are still uniquely excluded from religion. And that's why this incentive uniquely applies to them. No thank you. They did not respond to my entire first speaker's argument about why this will work. They simply brushed this aside and their first speaker completely responds to this, we'd like to hear some information about four minutes of our speech. Thank you. No. Now to this point about the"

Firstly, if a belief has a harm to an individual, if a belief is causing these individuals to not be able to go to school, as is the case, we're thinking, of values that perpetuate women not having education, not having enough power in society, we think that that belief is irrelevant. Secondly, we don't let racist people, people who think that there should be segregation, allow their beliefs to be absolute, right? We tell them, no, it's wrong. Men, like, blacks and whites should not be segregated. That's why we have anti-segregation laws that have been passed. Thirdly, the whole idea that identity is absolute is completely incorrect, right? We also think that justice is a belief, but Sharia law is not allowed in courts because it's uniquely harmful, and it has institutions that are uniquely persuasive and harmful, and as such, identity is not relevant in that case. They need to show us why identity in every case is absolute, if identity in religion is such an important thing. They tell us how men will be underwritten by religion and these institutions will just pay tax. No analysis as to any of the systematic reasons why we told you we get women appointed is true. No, thank you. They tell us that people will pay to discriminate how this is immoral. Firstly, the payment in itself, when people have to give tax, this lessens discrimination. So essentially, their principle of how you're paying to get out of discrimination isn't true because the tax money is lessening discrimination by promoting policies towards women. Secondly, there's a difference between paying to do a good thing versus refusing an incentive to do a bad thing. Governments sell licenses to do things like dump chemical waste or sell permission to dump CO2 in the atmosphere. But in my doing this, something that's bad for society, for the company, the religion is harming people as a whole, right? We can't pay everyone directly, so people give government compensation to the reclendent of these people. No thank you. Now to their second point, lastly, about how the empowerment is of. Empowerment doesn't mean you should appoint these women. We think when you appoint these women, you result in a lot of the same benefits that they have already. You result in good religion. You result in people who are devoted to their faith. But you also get promoted ideologies far more in your world. No, thank you. They tell you that, like, the role of women is different and accurate and equally potent. Ladies and gentlemen, do you think it is okay and that women are equal when a half of your population doesn't, like, half of your population doesn't go to school, when they're not allowed to have the basic right to be educated, right? Because that's what happens in these societies, when you perpetuate the idea that women should be housewives, women should clean the kitchen, women don't have the responsibility or the ability to defend, like, to defend other people. They tell us the last thing to thank you, that organic change is extremely important, and how, like, this is something that has happened already. We already gave you reasons as to why this is the case. Not only that, we tell you that these churches need incentive to change their ideologies.

At the very least, on our side, we get a woman no longer having to suffer her personal agonies and silence because she knows a woman will represent her in a court as well, in a religious court as well. Secondly, this will foster the notion that women can be independent, autonomous, and educated. With female leaders appointed, there will be an expectation that women should be educated and prepared for roles as leaders. Parents will realize that it's commendable to give girls a choice and give them the opportunity to be educated, and will ask for more education on the side. Ultimately, we want women across the world to lift their eyes to the horizon, to achieve as much as their hard work will allow, which is why we're so proud to stand under the team line that we will not grant privilege nor favor to those who willfully slander women.

So they can't have most of those things. But also, they say that they'll remove tax exemptions for missionary activity. But missionaries often do a lot of non-profit work themselves in communities and other countries in the world. How are they going to tax exempt one half of the activity that missionaries do, but not the other half of the activity that missionaries do, but not the other half of the activity that missionaries do? This is why they still don't protect non-profit activity on their side of the House."

But on Team Wales' side of the house, people are not going to see this as a religious interpretation, but as a state interpretation of doctrine, which is why people don't accept it. This is especially important when Team Wales concedes that Scripture doesn't explicitly rule out women for leadership, meaning people have to be able to buy into it, something they're not assuring on their side. Then in response to the third POI, they say, well, if excommunication was inconsistent to their principle, then they wouldn't support it. It's their job to tell us, ladies and gentlemen, whether it's inconsistent with their principle, not Team Canada's job. The final one-minute argument they brought you was this idea of how people will basically have and find opportunities for girls. There are three billion Muslims and Christians in the world. Do they seriously think that families within those communities don't support opportunities for women, don't support women in leadership? Indonesia is a Muslim country that has had a female, that currently has a female president. I don't understand how this is an argument that they can make. Well, let's look at Rebuild. In"

It's the really important content Team Wales are very contented with. Yes? Please enlighten me. What's the moral difference between a man believing a black person is lesser than him as a leader, and a woman is lesser than him as leader? The moral difference between a man believing that a woman is lesser than him and a woman believing that a man is lesser than him? Well, the difference is that in either case, people are entitled to their beliefs. What you're against is them being implemented in terms of policy.

                  "text": "The premise of this argument is that removing tax exemption comes at the expense of the non-profit work religious institutions do, which is harmful to women and destructive to communities. Both teams agree that there are in some cases going to be religious institutions that will outright reject the attempt at enforcement, but on Team Canada we can tell you that number is a lot greater than Team Wales is willing to admit. What is the problem with this? Well, let's look at some of the activities, the non-for-profit activities, that religious institutions do that Team Wales is going to be skimming the top. First of all, general activities, such as providing homeless shelters, such as providing drug rehabilitation, especially in those poorest communities that they're leveraging where the state has failed to provide those services themselves. Second, faith-specific activity, such as spiritual counseling, such as faith-based education, the interpretation of scripture, things that the state necessarily can't provide because the state doesn't have the religious power and authority that churches do. But third, a lot of these services that religious institutions provide are actually benefiting or benefit women the most because of things like childcare and daycare, because of fundraising for single mothers who have to raise families by themselves, ladies and gentlemen. These are things that Twin Whales is going against. What's the problem with this? All of these things are funded out of donations. Some of these donations go to missionaries. Some of these donations go to the churches that they're going to shut down. Why is this bad? First of all, less services means people are left in the dust. Since not-for-profit activity, by definition definition spends all of their money on helping people, by cutting some of that off, necessarily some people are not going to be able to get services. But we think it's wrong for Teen Whales to be able to decide that the state can force a woman to quit her job to take care of her children because there isn't enough childcare in her community, if it means that there will be a female priest at the altar. We don't see how teen whales can justify this feat of social engineering if it is fought on the battlefield of forcing a homeless person to have to go through the bureaucratic system of welfare that they might have been excluded from before rather than getting help from the church that they've depended on for so long. But second, women are often the very people that lead all of this not-for-profit activity. So for example, women in Iran buy textbooks and give them to women who are forced to stay at home, which is a big part of the reason that there are now more female than male scientists in Iran. Unfortunately for Teen Whales, a lot of missionaries are the ones that go and deliver these textbooks to people, something that they wouldn't tax exempt. But third, often this affects the poorest communities the worst because it is those communities that depend on these essential services more than any other. Often the church is the lifeline of an entire community. And if Team Wales is willing to close down that house of worship to enforce a political agenda on that religion, we say that is awful, we say that is abhorrent. Ladies and gentlemen, Team Wales aims to use the houses of the holy as a grounds for an experiment in social engineering.

Now we will give the case of the opposition as well upon the speaker, Mr. Srikant. Thank you. It's very easy to be a bit in this debate, because it was quite telling when the second committee decided to drop the entire principal argument after our responses. So, twice I've talked about the principal and as to how TeamGames has already won the principal convincingly. I'm checking out to prove to you why social reaction there and speaking won't be as massive and women have better outcomes in our world. Before that, I'd like to talk about the gender criticism of their entire case. If they're going to predicate an entire argument on charity, they must listen to the model to start with. Because in the model, we clearly told you, we will have tax-deductible options for churches who want to do charity. We already do it for corporations, right? When corporations want to supply to charity, they don't, they can subtract that amount of money from tax they pay. Which means that churches will still be able to give food to the poor and still be able to make sure that people don't go to the vets starving. And we think the churches will take this option, right? Because it's the same to let people starve. You can take the tax deductible option and give money and food to people who are starving. So like the entire second argument's logical link is missing because these strategies can still work, everything could work better. But what happens in our world is that the money that the church accumulates on property, on the paintings they hold in Christian chapels, won't be used to promote sexist policies anymore. That's the real benefit they couldn't take down."

                  "text": "Let's start talking about the principle. Here, the first speaker's first point was, she had two things to say here. First is that this is an extension of a basic right, and secondly, churches can buy their ways out of it. Rich churches can buy their ways out of it. About the extension of basic rights, note that we responded to it by saying that no right is absolute. Yeah, right to free speech exists, but we still ban hate speech if it means that speech will be used in a negative way. Secondly, that right has to be balanced relative to women's right to be free from discrimination. And they never could tell us why women should be continually discriminated in their side of the world. But secondly, they tried to nuance it, right? They tried to say that, oh, it's theologically women are different but still equal. That's because there's a massive social indoctrination by the patriarchy to make women believe in this. When Islam started, Hazrat Muhammad's youngest wife Aisha was a scholar, was a judge, was a warrior and was a governor. But as things moved religion is selectively sexist, but men in positions of power inside religions are sexist. And in their world, that never changes, and I'll tell you why it changes in our world as well. But finally, we told you how the point about buying their privilege out does not also work, right? Because firstly, if the result of that buying their privilege out is is massive improvement for women in leadership and also the tax money that we are getting will invest in women's education and all of the policies that are true women I think that's what outcomes but secondly we might predict second speaking gave you and and and and and now she told you that we already have our governments to set set permits for dumping waste like many governments and for permits or dumping waste. Like many governments sell permits for dumping nuclear waste. Because even though there's a minute source of harm in that case, even though rich companies can get away with their privilege, it's still beneficial because that money can be used for more policies that is beneficial for all. So in their world, that thing here is awful. But finally, when I asked him a POI, what's the moral difference between racism and sexism, he had no answer to it, which is to tell you that sexism is as pernicious as racism. If a man cannot categorically say that a black, if a white man cannot categorically say that a black person is worth less than me, religions should not have the right to say that women are less worth than men. I think that's categorically a problematic thing, and this is akin to racism, something we cannot tolerate at all. Given all of these things are true, our principle stands. Our principle was simple, and their second speaker's response was extremely feeble and weak. Our principle was, churches owe a massive debt to the government already. Note that they couldn't take down all those analysis which passed away. We told you that one, that there's a principle of reciprocity. The church literally survives because the state protects its right to survive. And secondly, we told you how when church doesn't pay up, then poor people and women has to pay up. And it's immoral to shift that burden of payment to people who are already vulnerable. They have no response to it. Given that thing is true, then we told you when, like with the predatory analysis, that the church owes the debts to governments and the government can make a deal out of this debt. The government always makes deals out of people. When they settle with corporations, when a corporation owes something to a government or violates its laws, the government makes a deal in a government or violates its law, the government makes a deal in a private settlement in the court. So the government has the right to do whatever it wants with the debts that it owes to the government. And they have conceded. The churches owe a debt to the government, both financially, both from the principle of reciprocity. That's why the government can do whatever it wants with that debt, and we have won that principle as well. I'll move on to the efficacy before I take one more question. Would you force the Catholic Church to appoint male nuns or male father superiors? Alright, like this tactic of trying to get forced answers out of a small three-word. You're telling me how that's principally different? Like, please enlighten me in your last speech of the day how that's principally different from our side. Take your principles off at least."

Because they try to make you believe that religions are conservative, are oppressive, and they are modern, and they are good. There is a tension in the characterization. But what's important is to get the distinction between why Paul allowed homosexuality and why he won't allow sex, women leadership. Because men won't voluntarily hand their privilege away. The reason why Pope was okay with homosexuality is because it affects gay men primarily. So a man in a position of power inside the church's hierarchy won't hand his promotion to a woman. He will hold the promotion, right? Which is why in affirmative action policies, men won't handle their leadership position away. The government has to force organisations to force men to hand their leadership positions away. They have to tell me why men in positions of power will have any incentive to hand their privilege away and we think they won't do it. Given that's true, the knowledge of affirmative action is clearly consistent. When that doesn't happen internally, we must have an external push and they have conceded, our external push is going to work, which is why the second speaker's analysis is that charities won't exist because he believes that our push is going to work. Now the burden of the third speaker thus becomes to tell me why men in portions of power in churches and mosques will voluntarily give their leadership position away to women. And I think that's a rather hard point to pull and they won't be able to do it. But secondly, we clearly told you how organic change does not happen. Now, this is quite unfair on them as well. Because they try to tell us that their attack on our model is that, oh, what's the timeline? Oh, how many leaders will you have? They tell us that their attack on our model is that, oh what's the timeline? Oh, how many leaders will you have? Now, I want to ask them what's their timeline? Because I'm going to 2000 years after the birth of Jesus, to have a woman in the leadership position. And Petra, you haven't given me a female leader, ladies and gentlemen. What's your timeline, Team Kanda? Will you give me a female leader after 3000 years? I want to know your time and how it happens. But secondly, the efficacy point really clearly does not work as well. Because we don't know how churches will be able to provide charity and furthermore churches have every incentive to change. The final question remains will leaders comply and they cannot beat that thing down. Because we told you leaders have every incentive to comply. Why? Because it's a two way street. Leaders lobby against a motion policy in the White House. Leaders lobby against any policy they don't like, which means they depend on the government to a very large extent. Given that's true, leaders have every incentive to comply with this change. And given that's true, it's easy for leaders to manipulate this theology. A leader can say, just like gay men are allowed now, women are allowed as well, I think it's totally consistent with our theology. And if leaders do it, our policy is successful. At best, we have shown you that sexation is going to work. At worst, we are getting massive amounts of tax money, billions of dollars, which we are going to reinvest in women's rights and women's education.

Before that, a couple of things. I want to clarify two points from some opposition that were completely mischaracterized and strawmaned by Prong. The first, why our argument about churches being able to provide fewer services is still a huge harm that they have to contend with. They can't just say that they're going to reinsert taxisem status when churches have non-profitable NGO work. The reason for that is a lot of their essential services they provide are directly linked to their religious activities. So missionaries are the ones that go into communities, like the missionary women who a lot of their essential services they provide are directly linked to their religious activities. So missionaries are the ones that go into communities, like the missionary women who go into communities and provide them with training about how to use contraception. They host food banks and all those sorts of things on their own property, but they're getting rid of that with their property tax. So our points about the impacts of getting rid of essential services on communities still stand. Secondly, I want to clarify, they're pushing onto us that we have to establish a distinction between racism and sexism. Let me clarify this. One, this point that they're making is hung on them proving that what we're doing is actually sexist. I'm going to debunk all of that in my speech, so you can wait for that. But second of all, the clear difference here is that racism says that one race is good, the other race is bad. What we're saying is we're protecting the ability of religions to say women are important, but they're important in different ways, and it's up for women within those communities to determine what their role is within that religion and what it means to them to be an empowered woman. We are saying that it's important for women to be empowered, but it's not the role of the state to impose on those religions what it means to be an empowered woman. Before I get into my two areas of clash, I want to point out a strategic point about this time proposition's case. They have a tension in their characterization about how religions feel about women in the church. The first narrative that we get is that these religions are so oppressive towards women, the government needs to intervene to protect them from discrimination. Women can't even go to school or access basic social services. The second narrative that we get is these churches are already being forced to liberalize because their congregants are moderate, because they want to attract and appeal more congregants, and they point to movements around the world. What is the strategic impact of this tension? If the first narrative is true, that these men and that these religions are so conservative, they undercut all of their benefits. Because one, if it is so antithetical to these religions to not appoint women, they just won't follow this motion. But two, if they do appoint them, those women will be labeled as heretics, they'll be mistreated, and none of their benefits about respect occurring will ever accrue. But if the second narrative is true, that these religions are already liberalizing, they haven't proven to the necessity of this motion. And in fact, they've dropped. Not only this motion isn't necessary, but it actually hampers liberalization, because religions need to feel secure in their ability to control their narrative and how it will make people feel like if they support women's rights, they're supporting the state's attack on their doctrine, the state's attack on their freedom. More importantly, the fact that they haven't resolved this tension is harmful for them for the simple reason that they bang their case on proving that they protect a group of women, that they protect this vulnerable actor, but the point which their characterization about how actors will act is unclear. You can't believe that any of their benefits will accrue. Versus on our side of the house, we tell you that the impacts are certain. The impacts of people losing the ability to access their faith. The impacts of poor communities losing out on essential services. I have no idea what the world of proposition looks like by the end of this debate. That being said, two areas clash. Firstly, on the principle. The major claim that we get at the top of PROC is that religions are only able to exist because of services from the state, giving them a privilege is unfair. Ten, you should not weigh this point about tax exemptions being unjust as the most important theme in this debate. The reason being, they are very willing to reinstate that tax exempt status, both if they appoint women to certain positions and if they can provide social services and goods. That is to say that their principal argumentation isn't really about tax-exempt status being unfair, it's about socially engineering religions to achieve a certain outcome. Their more important claim that all of their material is predicated on is the assertion that it is objectively wrong to not have women in positions of power, because men have opportunities that women don't. I have two responses. My first is that this argument assumes that the moral code that society has is the same as the moral code within a religion. People opt into a religion because it provides them with values upon which they center their decisions, upon which they can construct their faiths and their identities. It is an intensely personal and private decision when you opt into a religion because it tells you the type of person you want to become. There are many things you may think are objectively wrong or not fair. So for example, when an individual refuses a life-saving blood transfusion for religious reasons, or when parents teach their children creationism, those may seem unfair and unjust to us, but they're just people opting into their own moral code and their own sets of values. But the second and more important response here is the assumption on team proposition is that equality means the same thing, even if it's important, outside and inside of a religion. We've never heard a response to the point that if you are a woman in your religious community, and people respect you so much because you're their nun, because you're their mother, because you're a special teacher, they see you as their connection to God and they value your respect so much. So we've never heard why it isn't equal if women are respected in other positions. Why is it equal if they have the same opportunity to flourish in other respects? The next area that I want to look at is the idea of empowering women. The major claim that we get from their side of the house is that this motion will lessen discrimination towards women because religious institutions are now incentivized to appoint women. In a case where they aren't, governments spend money to help women. And within religions, women are seen as role models. Before I resume that, sure. Ma'am, your second speaker concedes that female leadership is consistent in theology. Why do opportunistic men leaders handle the privilege of women? So, well, part of your case is saying that they're liberalizing already and that they have an opportunity to change. Our case is that we think that there is a movement within these religions to liberalize and to give women positions of power. If there isn't, we would say that it is up to the women within those communities themselves to determine what equality means to them. And if they're happy with being in a position where everyone else respects them because they're their nun, they're their teacher, that's okay because it's about what's important to those women, not the state passing down Western imperialist notions of what it means to be equal, of what it means to not be discriminated against. Let me respond to their mechanism of how they actually protect women. The first assumption is that their mechanism will actually work in the wealthiest and most conservative churches. We say that they're going to swallow up the tax. And even if the government now has more money to spend on women, not sure what that means. Like, if their problem that they characterize is that the problem is that within religions, people don't respect women, they don't solve the problem even if the government on outside spheres is spending more money on women. They draw to our point about the disproportionate burden on poor churches, on the churches that have to make a choice between their faith and staying alive. But critically, the assumption on their side of the house is that within a religion, your respect comes from your title and your status. It doesn't. It comes from the fact that people, your congregants, believe that you are appointed by God, that you are their connection to faith, to spiritual, to the divine. What they do is they say to these people, the state is now determining who the person that represents you and your faith is, and people won't buy into that. At best, it looks like the woman is tokenized. She's able to give a 10-minute sermon, but people don't really care. At worst, it looks like that woman being called a heretic and saying that she's a traitor to her religion. At the end of this debate, they haven't proven that they're able to protect the most vulnerable actor that they've baked their entire case on protecting. Moreover, we told you as it actually gets worse for the women, who in the status quo are already pushing for their legalization, pushing for them to have respect within these religions. Don't make this a war on God. Don't make this a war against the state. Make it the ability of women to fight for their freedom in the war that they want to fight themselves. Thank you."

The government has to consistently strike balances and find ways to compromise. Today, Team Wales did not want to compromise. In this case, it's a compromise between freedom of religion and all the other rights and freedoms to which it's ancillary.

Their response to this is that men won't cede their power, and they talked a lot about it with Francis, saying that homosexuality is okay. I don't hear any reason why it was that straight people were willing to cede their power in some sort of way that men aren't willing to cede their power. I think queer people struggled for this right, for this emancipation, very, very hard. And I don't think they've been very fair on T-Mills by painting the Pope as this magnanimous guy who woke up one morning on board for the gay agenda. I think gay people within their religious framework said, we need a change, and then fought for it without the intervention of the state. Okay, we need a change, and then fought for it without the intervention of the state. Okay, women and religion are already doing this. We empirically disproved this idea that men won't cede their power by showing instances where men didn't have to cede their power for women to get the power. They formed new congregations, they formed new sects where they did it for themselves. Rather than asking the government to give them power, rather than asking men to cede their power, women got up and took it. This prevents their ability to do so."

This is something that they've not once responded to, so we don't know why class inequality is somehow better than gender inequality. On the note of things that Team Wells never seemed to respond to, why is it that they don't want to talk about insularity?

We think we do that. Now they tell us that governments should make balances and trade-offs, literally in their reply. That's exactly what we're doing. This is a balance. This is a trade-off between getting more tax and between empowering equality, which we think is extremely important and worth this trade-off. Now let's talk about what the world looks like now. Team Canada told you that women are already in power because, you know, nuns are a thing. They told us that freedom of religion is absolute, that theology already permits female leadership, and that organic change is already happening, and that that's really great.

First argument, motherhood removes women's control over their own selves. Three ways in which women's choices are hurt. Information, the choice to enter motherhood, and the ability to leave. First, on information. Glorification of motherhood is responsible for the lack of information about it. When it crowds out other information, right? When you don't know what kinds of pain pregnancy induces. when you don't know post-mortem depression even exists, where women feel incredibly depressed after they've given delivery, when many women don't even know when they're on the delivery bed that women often defecate during the process of delivery. But also, you don't know about the long term. You don't know that it's going to suck out all your time, your money and place an incredible familial burden on you. But why is motherhood the glorification of this non-responsible for it? Because you grow up with the idea that this is something you have to do. You never seek out information. You're told you don't need this information when this is just something that's automatically assigned to you based on the sex that you were"

How incredible it feels when your child does this, when your child does that, but never what it looks like for you. But second, the choice to enter is imaginary. It starts at birth when you're born as a girl child. The kinds of dolls you get are dolls of children asking you to take care of them. When you're asked constantly when you're getting married, when you go to little girls as uncles in Indian weddings and ask them, oh, when do you want to get married? Or who do you want to marry? What kind of a child do you want to grow up? When it invests itself in tangible things, when literally parents across spaces like Shrilankar Vandesh give their girl children a humanities education as opposed to a STEM education because that just perfectly sets them up for that marriage. When there's a familial and societal pressure, right? Because you save up for marriage if it's a girl child and you save up for college if it's a boy child. It's not just that that the narrative often is overwhelming, often becomes an external pressure, but that it physically limits your choice.

That if this debate is about children, it's about the little girls who are told this from when they grow up. Because boys get the Power Ranger toys and the job options. But girls, right from when they are born, are told by the men in their families that this is what you're going to be. But finally, it removes the choice to leave relationships, to leave families, to leave marriages. Because even saying that you don't enjoy being a mother is something that's shocking. Oh, what? Did you just say that? You're not even allowed to talk about it, right? When you're told, when you say it, when you can't complain about the housework you're doing, you can't express your opinions, but you also can't leave a relationship. You have to stay for the children. You have to stay to care for them. You have to stay because it's your role to protect your child. It undermines the choice to get a divorce. When you're constantly told, what will happen to your child? What will happen to that boy that's in your house? Remember, glorification uniquely hurts women and little girls. And in respect to what kinds of other pressures exist on women, this is something that is intrinsically problematic, something that we always forget and reject. Before I move on, yes? The expectation to have children is always going to exist for women. How is it easier for women to deal with this expectation when we are all constantly told that motherhood is not rewarding for them and we are the negative? So let's just rephrase that. They're saying, oh there are other things that contribute to this precious wealth. Then why do we need to remove one of the biggest contributors to it? But the other thing that they're saying in their POI is, oh we'll oppress you. But you should feel good about it. That you shouldn't complain about it. That you shouldn't get to, that movement shouldn't get to organize against it. Because when a feminist woman questions that, they're questioning something that's so important, so culturally relevant, we reject that. Second, glorification of a mother's sacrifices comes at the cost of her dreams. What is the cost of modernity?"

We lose these scientists, these economists, these accountants. But also, you lose financial independence, right? You lose the mobility to leave a motherhood that you've entered at the point which you didn't have a job, at the point which you don't have your own personal savings. You're entirely reliant on the family. But there are many women who choose not to do this, who would rather choose not to do this. Opposition always forces them into this. Insofar as we save just those women, it's intensely regrettable. But even if sexism always places the pressure to have a child, what else does this concept of motherhood extend to? It extends to not being allowed to have your own hobbies, your own social life. But in that life, it's, oh, my friends are my child's friends' mothers. But I can't do the kinds of hobbies that I like, because I need to concentrate on my child's hobbies. Even if it's about women who are always going to end up in these marriages with these same children, they are still women who don't get to have their own lives, their own experiences, and in the least some mobility and some savings to live. But the extension of this is the external pressure, right? The external pressure that results in men getting a lesser burden in families. It's saying, oh, women are mothers so men are fathers. They can do things like taking care of their money. They can do things like taking care of careers. And it's based on disproportionate burdens on women. They have to take care of the dishes.

Obviously we believe that females should be able to do whatever they like,"

So now, what did sarcopoposition say? That this is never rewarding and that glorification harms women and pressurises them to become mothers since it basically makes the duty to have children better. Not to steer a battle. That they never actually explain why perceiving mothers as having an enriching experience means that this duty is going away, or why this duty is made stronger by enriching experience. They never say how, but when we start to perceive motherhood as something negative or neutral, how then this duty is just abolishing. We're going to show you that this duty still exists and that this debate takes into the context whether we should reward these mothers for fulfilling that duty or whether we're not rewarding them. Why does this duty still exist and why this type of position to fail to provide another explanation? Firstly, women will be and are always the persons who are the only ones physically capable of carrying a child, so hence that duty will still exist under their shoulders, not under the male shoulders, they are the only ones physically capable of carrying a child. So hence that duty will still exist under their shoulders, not under the male's shoulders. They are the ones giving birth. And secondly, all societies, even the most liberal ones, are the ones to pressurise females still into having children and into bringing offspring to their nation. Even Germany pays mothers in order to have offspring to their nation. So this pressure still exists for these two reasons, and cyoposition never showed why this will cease to exist. So let's now talk about why rewarding mothers is good for societal level and secondly why it's better for parenting. First point, no thank you. Rewarding means that females' position in society will be better because the role still exists and we rather want to reward them and make them to see somebody that is not just fulfilling their burden that exists on their both sides, but rather somebody who is making that decision themselves, who are strong human beings, who make that decision because they believe that this is rewarding for them and they believe that they can gain some very personal benefits under that. Firstly, because you're not as strong if you're just as good in that duty, but rather we want to perceive females as doing that because they're doing it for themselves. And women are seen as not just doing their duty and being submissive, but rather wanting that baby and therefore deciding themselves to take that burden and to carry that baby. So, for example, New Zealand's Prime Minister just decided to have a baby in the office and we see it as a positive thing because she wanted to do it, because she feels that this would help her become a better person, help her become a happier person, a better Prime Minister for New Zealand, and we celebrate it. And therefore, the society feels that women are not just simply giving in to the pressure that society gives, but rather taking it because they want to. And this is something that we celebrate. Because, for example, in conscription service, this is a duty that, for example, in some states are for people. We celebrate that the person in health aversion becomes a better human being. And therefore we see that positive attributes are after doing that duty given to that person. And the same happens with women who happen to give birth, because they're seen as now better and more developed human beings. What are the impacts of this argument? Firstly, it means that females, when they break out of this duty to just live in, to be submissive, and rather be independent, strong women who make that decision themselves, are much more likely to be perceived as equal with men, because now they're not dependent on men and doing what men require, but rather doing what they themselves want. And so it makes the society perceive them as stronger, more capable, and hence policies that make their lives easier, such as, like, pay gap policies, or, for example, anti-discrimination policies, like the females are not accepted into the same jobs as men, or now, like, not as effective, because females are perceived as better, stronger, more equal with men, not having to do that duty, and rather, when they take that duty, it's something for the personal development, taking you in a second, so we expect it for the society if we see and perceive females as stronger themselves who want to do it, rather than just giving in to the pressure. Oh, is your point that somehow motherhood is appreciated more when it's seen as mothers doing it for their own self-interest? Yes. We believe that we want women to feel like they're doing something for their own self-interest rather than just giving in to some patriarchal policies. This is the fundamental prerequisite of female being empowered, being strengthened, and being perceived as equal to men. We celebrate it. Secondly, how it's better for parenting. Because when parents feel and when mothers feel they're doing it for their own good and for reward rather than duty, this is better and much more easier for them to, for example, be in labour or to be pregnant. Why? Because if I believe this is good for my own being, if I'm pregnant, if"

So it helps parents and women to be more able to cope with these extreme hardships, that 18 years of bringing up the baby and caring for that baby and sacrificing yourself for that baby, is because you feel that this is a rewarding experience and the society feels that you're becoming a better person and that you're doing it for your own good and you yourself believe that it's for your own good. So what it means is that females and mothers are much more happy and mothers are much more happy to do it and therefore doing the job better and hence their children, when they're not perceived as a duty, but rather as a reward, are much more likely to feel so happy because their mothers want to engage with them, want to be nicer towards them and therefore doing their duty better. For all these reasons, because of the societal position, secondly, better parenting, I beg you to pause."

                  "text": "Three big ideas that came out of that last speech. Firstly, that this duty will still be placed on women. Secondly, that this causes an appreciation of mothers for doing what they do. And thirdly, this idea that this narrative needs to be better bettered. Let's deal with these one by one. Firstly, on this idea that this duty still exists, we agree. What we are saying is that this narrative is much worse in terms of perpetuating this duty. That is to say, we agree that on both sides there will be some exemption of gender roles. We think those gender roles will be worse on your side. Three reasons. Firstly, the fact that you can't resist at the point where there is no way for you to mobilize against this kind of oppression. Because the justification behind this is, oh, this is good for the women, that's why you can be mothers. Secondly, the fact that these women aren't given the full information of what the harms could be, meaning they don't have an incentive to resist due to the lies and misinformation created by this cultural norm. Thirdly, the fact that this pressure often is imposed by people like men, who actually believe that it is a rewarding experience and therefore impose this pressure on women. They think women can't make the best decisions for themselves. They think this is a genuinely good decision to make. Then on the second item, this causes the appreciation of mothers for doing what they do, and this causes the perception of them as being women. The first thing to note is that insofar as they want to say that this allows them to cope with things like tremendous external pressures, we are happy to respect women in ranges of different professions and occupations for doing what they do. We're happy to extend that kind of respect. That's clearly not what this debate is about. But secondly, we don't really think they are perceived as equal in society when what they are expected to do by society is to be a mother, is to not go to work. They are not going to get equal pay at the point where an employer expects them to quit their job early because they have to stay at home and be a parent. But thirdly, this idea that this creates better policies. We think policies like parenting and cream are much worse off as far as companies perceive this. As you know, this is a rewarding experience. We don't need to give you more of a reward. This is just an invitation. We don't think those kinds of policies are meaningfully passed on your side. Contrast is then against our argument. The fact that this narrative removes women's control over themselves. They say, oh, women make this choice. This choice is really empowering. We are happy with women making the choice to become mothers. What we said is that in a number of instances, their narrative causes women to be structurally unable to make that choice because of misinformation about these harms, because of the fact that you grew up with the idea that you are meant to be a mother, because when you go to a wedding, you are told, when is your wedding going to be? When are you going to become a parent? No, thank you. These kinds of coercive pressures are perpetuated on their side of the house. Lastly, on this idea that this narrative leads to better parenting because it brings happiness to people. Two issues. Firstly, if women don't choose to become a parent, presumably they might actually be worse parents because eventually they will realize that this is a tremendous strain on them, meaning it's bad for the children. Second, we want children to have good role models. We want girl children to realize that their mothers are in the working profession and that is good for them, meaning it's actually good, no fancy, for the children. But what they didn't engage with is that it's destructive to the lives of women at the point where they are deprived of financial independence as a result of their policy. They are deprived of having access to things like friendship, hobbies, having a social life, and that this expectation is a source of unique discrimination against these individuals. Go ahead. Men oppress women because they perceive them as weaker and because they feel that they have the power, rather than because they believe that this is good and rewarding for women. The point is that men perceive the notion of motherhood as being a weak profession. We would rather a woman be able to make the choice to not be a mother and go to work, become a business executive. We don't think that would be perceived as weak either. That's the comparative in the long term that we stand for."

Firstly, this narrative excludes women who don't have children, and second, this perpetuates the notion of familial blood relations being crucial. First, this narrative excludes women who don't have children. How is this true? Firstly, it undermines reproductive autonomy. It stigmatizes women who do things like have abortions, use contraceptionists. Why would you do that? Being a parent is really rewarding. Having a child is really rewarding. That means you're both a child killer and someone who gave up on a rewarding experience for yourself, which means they never understand the actual reasoning for why women do things like have abortions, do things like seek some kind of reproductive autonomy over themselves. And that kind of narrative constantly re-entrenches itself because now women aren't given autonomy. It perpetuates the notion that women are making bad choices for themselves. It is men who should now be determining women's choices because clearly they're making a terrible choice by having an abortion. This means women are systemically denied access to their choices about reproductive health. But second, it stigmatizes women who are physically unable to have children, people like infertile women, who are told they've been denied the experience which defines their womanhood, who are condemned as barren. Within the impact is that women are systemically denied the ability to make choices about themselves and constantly face stigmatisation. On the comparative in our world, women are allowed to relieve rewarding lives which are not just based on the idea of them having children. It means they're able to make reproductive choices about their ability to have an abortion, to not have children in the long term."

                  "text": "This narrative perpetuates the idea that having biological relations with your child is absolutely crucial. In their world, biological motherhood is the unique kind of motherhood which is glorified. Two reasons why this is true. Firstly, because this glorification looks at the full process of motherhood. It's not just you raising a child, it's you having that child biologically. It's the process of pregnancy which is significantly glorified. You have to take on the entire burden of having a child. But secondly, the narrative that exists right now is that the reason this is a rewarding experience is you're extending that experience to someone who you consider is your truly own family. Your blood, no thank you. Someone who's a part of your family and a part of you who you're now having a shared experience with. Why is this incredibly problematic? Two sets of reasons. Firstly, women who adopt children are stigmatised. This means that adoption in general is disincentivised. But this also looks like LGBT women being systemically discriminated against because they can't have biological children. Because biological procreation is the only means through which it is legitimate to have children. But second, it suggests that the only purpose of sexual relations and sex is procreation. The idea that the point of you being able to pursue a sexual life is to fulfil that thing which makes your life the most rewarding ever, fulfil the ability of you as a woman to have a child. This means it's stigmatising, denies women access to sexual pleasure of their own and sexual autonomy, perpetuates the idea that only men can enjoy sex. In the most extreme cases, it looks like actively denying the ability of women to make these choices through things like female gender mutilations. But it also means that LGBT individuals are discriminated against because they are not allowed to pursue their sexual pleasure because it can never truly result in you having a child. It means their relationships are not meaningless. We agree that the narrative of the gender roles of women exists on both sides. But this narrative of this being a rewarding experience for women makes it much worse for all of these women. Because the belief that women have to get meaning from their motherhood gives birth to an egregious burden. Very proud of you. that women have to get meaning from their motherhood gives birth to an egregious burden of many problems. 8 minutes 16 seconds.

We can see the fact that gender roles are a bad thing and women would probably be better off if they had more choices. They still have to prove why the societal pressure wouldn't exist. Their point still remains while Truman asks, when are you going to have a child and when are you going to get married? Because the whole society still sees you having a child as a necessity and something that you need to do. The point is about whether we see a child being given born to as a reward for the society. They need to prove why we telling the mother that you are going to be born from having a child is a good or bad. We tell you that the perception of telling a woman that in the instance where you do have a child you are going to benefit more than you are going to get harm is good for those women.

We can still tell you that you might have post-mortem depression but it will pay you off in the end because you as women will benefit from creating someone and if you're caring for that someone then you're going to be happy once you have that child. This is a narrative that can exist with that information, and if that's their problem, then let's fix that.

Moving on to the Roan case and the things that we heard from Team India. First to tell you that people have very little know-how and that this harms them. We all have told you, we would rather have you deal with these things that you might go through. In this instance, we are told that this has always been to be one. They tell you that women can't pursue their dreams, which I think that is always going to exist under their side, because the first thing is that mothers would still have been told to have a child and get married. But furthermore, notice that women might dream of having a child and that's a legitimate dream for those women as well that might give self-exhortation to some women and they are actively saying that these women shouldn't get self-exhortation from that place because they are doing less legitimacy to those women's dreams and that's something that they maybe shouldn't be doing within that in the instance of today's society motherhood is becoming more volatile and you can be a mother while achieving those dreams as well, but we don't have to actively undermine the glorification or the value of being a mother in the conventional sense. We think that this is a benefit that they are taking away from the women in our societies at the moment. But I want to tell you an extension about how women who are currently using counter-productives are going to be worse off. In things as well, if they continue to the path of this due to the fact that children already exist, then those women are always going to be worse off. In the instance where they continue to the fact that this duty to have children already exists, then those women are always going to be harmed under their side as well. They're still trying to have children and all of the harms that they tell you about in your extension will remain in the instance where they continue to the fact that this duty still exists for these women and they're actually improving any of the cases that they outline in their extension. Then they tell you that you are raised to believe and this is the only thing that's going to be rewarding for you. I think that this is good because in the only thing that's been rewarding for you. They tell you that this is good because in the end it might still be good for you. They tell you that it takes away financial independence and friends from these women but we don't see why that's true. They are giving a very crude, very crudely characterisation of motherhood. You can still go to work as a mother and you can still have friends that you had before. This characterisation is simply not true and see, maybe it isn't telling you why it should be true because mothers are still human beings and can still interact with other people outside of their family. They don't think that they are simply closed off to their child that they have had. We don't think that this is a characterisation that they can get away with in this way. Before we move on to an extension, Doug. Do you support the narrative in developing nations that say that women should find it rewarding to be homemakers and cook and clean for their husbands? I'm going to tell you why that's beneficial in this argument now. I think it's beneficial for these women to have that role, but have no role at all. Moving on to my extension. So, I tell you that this debates about whether motherhood is seen as good or bad, whether it is seen as rewarding for these women or not. We need to consider the historical aspect and the developing nations in these lines of argumentation as well. We have already talked about how this duty is always going to remain for this woman. People want to carry on their civilization or their nation, and early women can fulfil that role, and that is why the duty is always going to remain for them, argumentation that teenager simply doesn't engage with. This role would exist on either side of the house. We now need to look at the fact, how are we portraying these roles, and how are we telling those women to deal with those roles, whether they are rewarding for them or not? I think that it's beneficial to say that women are rewarding from the roads that they currently have. Notice that this reward isn't only seen as individual. In the instance where we're doing something rewarding, then it's going to be seen as a reward by those other people as well. In the instance where we are creating the agenda road for those women, then because of the fact that you are doing good in providing that gender role, you even get some kind of position in that society. In the instance where you are successful as a mother, then you are seen as a good person because of the fact that you are a mother. These women gain some kind of position in these societies because of the fact that they are creating some kind of benefits for those people in those societies. In the instance where those women don't even have a role as a co-maker, and they have much less legitimacy, much less position, much less leverage, to ask for some kind of changes for themselves. This is exceptionally exacerbated by the fact that these women are not going to be seen as successful. Their role is always going to be seen as a negative thing, that they are never going to get any benefits out of, or that they are never going to be able to create any benefit by. In the instance where this role is rewarding,"

The conception that exists on the side of opposition is giving women opportunities to demand more rights and more opportunities for themselves. They play a bigger, big role in the society already, thus they can see that they desire more rights because of the role that they have in those societies. They are capable of raising the family, which means that they are capable of doing other things, an understanding or a rhetoric that these women in those countries can use. This also exists in these conservative nations as well. Women in Saudi Arabia can say that, I have a role as a woman in your society, give me driving rights as well, because I'm capable of running your family, I'm capable of running your car as well. I think that throughout history, and in more conservative or developing nations, women are able to use the role that they have inside the family to get more rights in a whole societal scheme. Team.

The vast majority of people don't want to be actively hateful to women nowadays, but rather they think they're doing it for the women. They think I'm doing it for my daughter. That entire subset of people they drop. But notice, we engage with their best case. We said the difference is that these are pressures you can fight, when now women are told that what's being pushed on you is something you don't like, rather than having the excuse of this isn't oppression, because you ought to be enjoying this. That is the world that they stood for. Not that we were the only side that told them that when the narrative isn't you are enjoying it, only then society knows it's a problem. Only then society is likely to fight against it. We had this in our previous speakers and they pretended in their third speech that we weren't the ones who were responding to their world. No thank you. But furthermore, other people buy into this pressure. That is, the way funding works. The way funding works, when you fund your daughters to go into humanities versus STEM, and the way you think that you're acting for them, most of these choices that push women into motherhood are made before women can voice complaints. And why that matters is because of the fact that the people, the guardians who are making these choices, actively think that they're doing it for the women. The women have little ability to object, and the women have little ability to go get other information. That's why it's likely that this is the strongest portion of the various oppression, the oppressionist forces that act on women, that forces them into motherhood without any reconciliation."

The narrative is no longer there. Is that I as a man don't need to help you out because well you're enjoying what you're doing, right? I don't need to help you in any way. It becomes motherhood is a burden that you need not necessarily enjoy and that means me as a father now should try to pitch in as much as I can, much more than I can. That's why their side made motherhood worse. When you're forced handling five kids all on your own, without anyone to care for you, we were the only side that removed father's excuse for not staying at home by saying, oh, you're enjoying it, so I'll let you have all the kids to yourself. That was the world that we contested, taking them on their very best case, the women who stayed in these homes as well. What were the arguments that they brought up? They said that this makes women look stronger and better in society. But does it? You admire soldiers because they're sacrificing something and you don't assume that they're having a good time. You admire soldiers because you think they're doing something hard. This is the exact opposite. You're saying women are enjoying themselves. Why should we care for that? Yes, it's hard, but the reward is even more. Yes, there's depression, but it's worth it at the end, in their very own words. How are you admiring mothers anymore? Rather, you're saying that they enjoy themselves. This is something that they're doing for their own selfish self-interest. That's not the narrative that we want to push. And that's why all of their ideas on how women can ask for more rights, false. Two responses directly to their second speaker's argument. Firstly, assume that they had the argument of how this empowers women by making them role models. This is non-economic work. They have very little money to lobby. They have very little ability to put themselves up in society. That's why their version of how women get uplifted is what we've been trying for the past three centuries. And surprise, surprise, it hasn't worked. What has worked is having women in businesses, having women as CEOs, which means that that is the most uplifting form of empowerment that you can give them. We might agree that women in businesses are beneficial. You need to prove why without creating a base rate for these women, they wouldn't even have had access to getting into those businesses to change something. Okay, like this entire idea that the society is so oppressive that no women works anywhere in the world is simply false. Note that we've continuously told you that the main reason why women are pushed into having children is this narrative that they enjoy themselves. They've never realised, they've never tried to deal with that, which is why we think at the end of the day, they haven't proved that women, all women are going to be oppressed anyway."

They burden them even more when they are pushed and refuse to have the ability to question it. Lastly, the third question about those who don't have kids. There was literally no engagement on this from their side. We give you two arguments on how there are people, the most vulnerable people, who cannot have children or who don't want to have children. Those who do abortions are now shamed because they're told you're giving up a pleasure of your life. Why should we allow you to do this? That's what Republicans say when they say we're not going to allow this abortion legislature because women don't know what they should deserve the most. Children help them out. We won't let them take these children away. A huge argument on the most vulnerable people, on LGBT individuals, on people who want to actually avoid having children was completely dropped from their side of the house. And that means they don't care about choice panel because they refuse to deal with the argument that condemned those who actively made the choice not to. That means that their society didn't realize that the vast majority of depression, the forcing women to have children without questioning it or being able to make choices for themselves, comes from the idea that they enjoy it."

                  "text": "to talk about two things in my speech. First, I'm going to look at why gender roles will still persist in respect of glorification, and then secondly, I'm going to look at what are the tangible harms when we don't perceive motherhood as rewarding. So first off, why are these gender roles still going to exist? Well, there are two first arguments. Firstly, that motherhood removes some sort of autonomy from women and they have to cause their career. And then secondly, that women are forced into the same roles that are individually not allowed to have a social life. This is basically the same argument. And moreover, we think that both of these things also exist under the proposition team, and theyover, we think that both of these things also exist under their proposition team, and they are both rebutted by us talking about the fact that gender roles are going to exist, because firstly, like historically, women have a duty to bring up children, this is something that has happened in societies, because men did physical work while women were just domestic, and women gave birth to children, which means that this will fundamentally still exist under societies, so thank you. Secondly, all societies want to be sustainable, even in the present. We've talked about this in all of our speeches. For example, there are many countries paying mothers to have children. We still have that duty. These women still have that responsibility. This all means that women are still going to be forced into these roles, and all the harms that they talked about, of having to quit your career, no thank you, of having to take a man very early in your life, are still going to exist. But moreover, what we have talked about is that these gender roles are even going to be entrenched under proposition, and this is because women, this is only going to be perceived as women are only fulfilling the duty that we have given to them in society, no thank you, because of two main impacts. Firstly, we don't to them in society. No, thank you. Because of two main impacts. Firstly, we don't see them being pregnant because they want to, but because we just as a society want for them to bear that child, which means that we don't recognise the autonomy of women to make independent decisions about their life. When it is something that is actually rewarding, no, thank you, then we recognise that this is something that is part of women's autonomy, and we think that this is something that overall attains some sort of societal change. Secondly, we also, when it's not rewarding, then we don't recognise that these women have some sort of personal growth when going through such a hardship of actually bringing up a child, no thank you. The impact of all of this is that it is harder for women to portray themselves as strong, equal individuals in our society, which means that all of the harms that they talked about are going to be so much greater. But lastly, under this point, one more thing. They talked about infertile women and LGBT women, and then asserted that we didn't respond. This is not true. We already said that all of these problems that are associated with these groups are going to exist under their side, as they are also not filling the role that women are given in society, which means that these people are still going to be seen as worse, or are still going to be negatively perceived. This is a symmetrical argument. This group shouldn't exist in this debate. Moving on to my next point about what are the actual tangible harms when we don't perceive motherhood as rewarding. But before that, Sean. In your best case, where gender roles still exist in women-stained families, why is it worse when women cannot question these roles and fight to share both? Yeah, I'm getting onto that. So they talk a lot about the fact that women can't mobilise because men see it as something positive and also something about misinformation. You need to look at the fact of why do men oppress women in societies. This is because they feel that they are supreme to women. Now we need to look at under which team do men feel more supreme to women and under which team do men perceive women as worse off. Under us, women are seen as benefiting from motherhoods, a duty that is going to be given them under any case. This means that under us, women are going to be perceived as a stronger social group, one that more justifiably should have a voice in our society. What is going to happen under them is that women get no sort of benefits. It is not rewarding. They don't improve as individuals, which means that we don't perceive them as strong individuals. This also contributes to a domestic narrative of them only being in that role. They shouldn't exit that role because they didn't get any sort of benefits from being in that role, which is something much different from what happens under our case. But now they also talk about the fact that men don't understand why reproductive rights are important in any way and that they're just going to force them down. But we think that men will never understand why reproductive rights are important anyway and that they're just going to force them down. But we think that men will never understand why reproductive rights are important when women don't have a voice. Women are the agents who are going to tell men when reproductive rights are important. This is how it is happening in our society. Women need empowerment for them to have a voice. We as a society and men overall need to acknowledge that women can be strong individuals, that they can be successful at something. We need to give them this political voice. And we think that their alternative narrative is that giving birth and bringing up a child. It's just some sort of mutual duty. So we don't feel that we'll attribute something positive to them. We also don't understand that if it's seen as just a neutral duty for women, then why would men help? Why would all of their conservative narratives disappear? We think that men will still see it as something that is inherently for women, and they're not going to be contributing in parenting, so we don't believe any of that argumentation. But what else did they say? Overall, they said that women don't know how hard childbirth is. And overall, that rewarding experience"

And we think that if we see this job as actually rewarding, then we acknowledge the hardship that women have to go through. It is a false characterisation to say that we see that women enjoy this. It is the fact that we understand that it is hard, and we understand that they benefit greatly from it, and that we are acknowledging this hardship. Which means that we understand that women are strongly capable. Which leads to, like, overall two things. Firstly, it means that it's going to be easier for women to actually be in society so that, for example, employers see them as deserving of a job or deserving of a promotion and things like that. So it's easier for women to actually participate in society and not be oppressed. But secondly, we think that it's also for women individually, as being people who have this role and duty anyway, that they perceive their own hardship as beneficial anyway. So the comparative is that if they have this duty and they don't perceive their hardship as beneficial, then it's much harder for them to actually do that duty. They don't want to do it. They feel themselves as more repressed, which means that this is going to lead to a more overall internalisation of the fact that they are repressed in that society which will make it harder for women to actually try and get that political voice that they need more of a which will mean that there will be a larger proportion of women who see bringing up children as a duty as something negative which means there will be a larger proportion of children who don't have a very nice upbringing because it is seen as a duty not something loving, which means there will be a larger proportion of children who don't have a very nice upbringing because it is seen as a duty, not something loving, not something caring, something that we talked about in our second argument.

They tell us that people coerce women into having children because they actually think they are helping all of these women, and this is something that wouldn't exist on their side. This isn't actually true. They never actually deal with the fact that these people think that these women have a duty to have that child. They would still tell all of the same things to these women that they have described in their speeches. They would always still tell these women that you need to have that child. They would still tell all of the same things to these women that they have described in their speeches. They would always still tell these women that you need to have a child because that's what you are meant to do. No matter whether this is beneficial or harmful for these women, people would always expect that from these women because we have given you a strong analysis about why people always think that women should bear those children as they are the only ones who can do that and thus ensure the fact that this civilisation or this nation is going to exist in the future. They never actually promote that, actually engage with this argumentation, and simply say that because it is seen as beneficial, people are more inclined to do it, but never tell you why this inclination to actually make women have children wouldn't exist under their scientific house. But they also contradict things about this duty idea that we provide to you, because the second speaker says they can see to the fact that this duty exists. The third speaker, however, completely dismisses this idea and simply talks about the fact that mother would be seen as a rewarding thing. They needed to deal with this argumentation rather than simply dismiss it and not engage with it, something that we didn't get from sight for positional disrespect."

Eventually people understand what being a mother looks like, and we also give you analysis of why people are aware of this hardship, and thus reward mother more because of the hardship that they are going through, and this hardship is known to these people. You obviously see mothers having swollen ankles, or having post-modern depression, as you know about the hardships of motherhood, even if you haven't pampered about it, etc. In theory, the mothers have very limited opportunities, which is an untrue characterisation that we constantly refute, and instead, the mothers can have a normal life, and furthermore, the point about time being not able to have children is not exclusive to our side and it's another harm that they are actually dealing with because of the fact that this duty exists. The already changing conception of motherhood has all the harms they point out to exist on the better side as well. We give you a strong analysis"

Firstly it can be seen as important on the side of position because of the fact that you as a mother create social position for yourself, create social leverage to influence some kinds of things. Women would be seen as more inferior under their side because they don't actually create something that is beneficial for the general society, but also are seen as more inferior because they are simply doing something that may not save them to do, but is very harmful for the women. In our under-ourside women are doing something that is beneficial for them and seen as rewarding, the swimming can say that I am doing things for my own benefit and for my own choice, giving more leverage to the ideas that they have. But furthermore, they have earned a strong position because of the fact that they have motherhood, the extension that I have that was completely unanswered by cyberposition. Ladies and gentlemen, motherhood is a good thing and we should reward it and it is great benefit for women. Thus, I vote. Thank you.

But we also engaged with our worst case. When they told us that they perceive women as strong, you know, women are perceived as weak because they're given and condemned to care roles. They said you are weak and can only be a mother. If you want strong women, choice is what creates women who are seen as strong. When women can become successful, that's what creates the idea and breaks the gender roles that you described. Problematically, they never showed why individual women were happy. Not that they showed why women being happy caused this link to changing perceptions in the first case. But even in our worst case, even when women were stuck in these relationships, we gave you four benefits. They have a voice, and they get to share the burden, and they get some mobility to live, and they get some social life rather than living around their children. In the reality, they didn't fight for individual women with careers, employees who didn't give maternity leave, they didn't fight as a feminist organisation this abortion, for infertile women, for LGBT women. We stood on the side of the most vulnerable. In light of what our future of the global world should be, if the question is what do women want, we say let them decide."

We are not okay with you being coerced into believing that those minuscule moments of happiness cancel out every single sacrifice you make along the way for that to happen.

Telling people that social work is rewarding equally causes them to become social workers. Do you therefore oppose this narrative? Yeah, sure.

But that's not the debate, whether you can garner small moments of happiness from your child. This debate is about whether that happiness weighs up in comparison to every single sacrifice that you make along the way. Because when is something rewarding? Something is only rewarding when the output or the outcomes of that action outweigh the efforts or the sacrifices that you make along the way. What do these sacrifices look like? First, the physical sacrifices. Now take it back. You as an expectant mother go through nine months of the worst hell that you'll ever experience in your entire life. You wake up every morning feeling nauseous, feeling the need to vomit, not only your food but also your blood. You feel like your food habits and what you want to do, where you want to go, what you want to see, all of these are being deeply affected and deeply changed by the concept of that pregnancy. You spend sleepless nights because your body's hormones have gone haywire and you literally cannot function throughout the entire day because you are exhausted, because your body feels like a bag of bones and flesh and not a functioning human body. In labor, you're going through the most painful experience known to man. A human woman's cervix will expand nine times its regular size when you're giving birth."

Imagine all of that pain happening to you, and you simply believing that it doesn't happen. But the pain is also psychological, because this is a unique experience. We as men, or we as husbands and sons, cannot relate to what our mothers go through, our sisters go through when they are going through this pain. We cannot relate, we cannot console them in any effective manner whatsoever. These people psychologically when they are giving birth, when they are bearing children feel weak and feeble. Feel like they are victims to their circumstances and there is nothing that they can do about them. No medicine will comfort them as much as they want to. But finally, the harms are also to your identity. So even after that child has been born, you are forced to give up all of your identities in favor of motherhood. You lose out on your careers because your identity as a businesswoman or your identity as a politician comes inside your family, comes secondary to your identity and your responsibilities as a business woman or your identity as a politician comes inside your family, comes secondary to your identity and your responsibilities as a mother. But then, why are the rewards that you gain not sufficient? Because these harms are objective, but the rewards are, the harms that you incur are always objective, but the rewards are often subjective. The happiness that you gain from your child is not always rewarding. One, your child might not be successful but even if he is successful he might not follow exactly in your footsteps, grow up exactly how you imagined him to be. This child, but in the vast majority of cases, even if this child succeeds you have no ownership about that success because society tells you that these are all personal efforts of that child in and of itself. The conclusion of this is that the narrative that says that it is all worth bringing life into this world is simply false. Why is it bad to preach an incorrect narrative? Because the person that is making that decision is deceived into that narrative. This is the exact same reason why we don't allow things like false advertising or fake news. Because they establish a version of reality that is simply not true. But more importantly, this specific narrative is one that cannot be countered. Especially in developing countries where you are told that it's a requirement for women to have children. It's a responsibility of women to have children. This narrative is inescapable and thus it harms these women the most. Yes? The motion clearly calls for you to oppose motherhood as a whole. Do you not think it is convenient for you to just shrink your case to coercion? So, we don't think it calls for us to oppose motherhood as a whole. It calls for us to oppose the belief that motherhood is rewarding and only a rewarding experience. They cannot misconstrue the motion to their benefit. Second argument about why this narrative is coercive. What is coercion? Coercion is a form of manipulation that implicitly pressurizes you to do something. What are the tenets of coercion? Firstly, an informational asymmetry. Even when that information exists, that this isn't a rewarding experience, that is hidden from you by society, by means of that larger narrative, that this is rewarding. But secondly, also the lack of opt-out mechanism, why you cannot abandon that child. Even once you find out that this is not a rewarding experience, you cannot shirk your responsibilities. You can only embrace them further. Why is this coercion unique to all other forms of coercions that they will likely talk about in their case? One, the scale. Because compare this to the coercion that advertising or fake news chooses. Advertising coerces you into buying something. Fake news coerces you into voting for a certain party. This coercion literally coerces you to give up all your pre-existent identities and form a new identity. An identity which you do not understand the implications of. But secondly, also the effect. So other forms of coercion have a widespread effect and do not cater to you as an individual. But this is an individual, this"

Your parents, your colleagues, your co-workers, all of them tell you that being a woman is an amazing thing. It's a glorious thing. And all of these harms are minuscule compared to that. Art and media tell you that the holy grail of womanhood is motherhood. That all of your identity has to be tied to that one single thing. What are the impacts of this? This impacts you in a couple of different ways. Because your entire identity being hinged on motherhood tells you that motherhood is all you need to be happy. So it's okay to give up that six-figure salary job. It's okay to give up that European vacation. Because you know what? You're a mother. And being a mother is all that will garner you happiness. But more importantly, you're also pushed on more responsibility because if something is rewarding, you have to work for that reward. So if the rewards are greater, your responsibility is greater. This is the way in which society tells you that it's the responsibility of women to look after their children. It's the responsibility of women to ensure that their children are brought up. And this narrative is a key component of that. We think that motherhood is great, but it's not as great as society will tend to inflame it to be."

First, we do not regret the widespread belief that motherhood is a rewarding experience. Second, this obviously does not mean we have to stand for false or false experiences of motherhood, such as for instance when a woman is raped. Hence, this debate is clearly about instances where women choose to engage in motherhood. So to be clear, this debate falls under the category of third-wave feminism, where we recognise women's choices and everything that they are agen-ted should always be respected. Next, this does not mean we cannot stand for other empowering narratives, such as for example, women choosing to pursue a career in the workplace, we can also stand for fatherhood being an easily rewarding experience. No thank you. The role we envision is one where motherhood is valued by society, as is the case with any other profession. And this means that we are more likely to have things such as pensions deemed for an elderly woman, or paying housewives for their work."

Second, how we change societal attitudes towards women. kedua, bagaimana kita mengubah sifat sosial terhadap wanita, dan kedua, saya akan membincangkan bagaimana di luar mencipta lebih banyak keadilan dalam tanggungjawab rumah. Tetapi sebelum itu, beberapa pertanyaan terhadap kes mereka. Pertama, saya akan mengambil alasan pertama mereka tentang naratif palsu dan kedua, saya akan membuktikan mengapa keadilan ibu tidak kohesif. Tetapi sebelum itu, kita hanya perlu perhatikan bahawa kes mereka sudah berkurangan, walaupun sebelum saya mempertanyakan kerana mereka mengatakan bahawa pertemuan ini hanya berkaitan dengan keputusan yang akan dihukum. Kami telah memberitahu anda dengan jelas bahawa pertemuan ini perlu berkaitan dengan semua keputusan. Dan sisi mereka juga mempertahankan kebanyakan yang dihukum dalam pertemuan ini, bukan hanya keputusan yang dihukum. Dan saya akan membuktikan mengapa kebanyakan keadaan tidak dihukum dan mereka membuat keputusan dan kita harus memperbaikinya. Pada sub-sentensi pertama, ia adalah naratif palsu. Mari kita tahu bahawa mereka mengambil keuntungan, tetapi mereka hanya mengatakan bahawa ada keadaan kesakitan yang berlaku. Dua jawapan. Mari kita tahu bahawa mereka menggoda tentang makanan tidak berfungsi. Kerana saya rasa kesakitan ibu bapa sama-sama subjektif untuk semua orang, walaupun kita adalah makanan atau tidak. Jadi saya hanya mengeluarkan naratif ini dari pendapat ini. Kedua, mereka mengatakan perbezaan antara kesalahan objektif dan kesalahan subjektif, bahawa beberapa keuntungan adalah objektif atau kesalahan adalah subjektif. Mari kita tahu bahawa segalanya dalam keadaan ibu, ialah subjektif seperti kesalahan yang ibu menderita, kegembiraan yang ibu menderita, semua ialah subjektif. Jadi siapa yang akan diadjudikasi, apakah itu menyenangkan atau tidak? Saya rasa metrik untuk adjudikasi adalah pilihan dan anda fikir not? I think that the metric for adjudication is to be choice, and you think that the choice is something that outside empowers. Let's then move on to the last random idea of identity. I think that if anything, having a rewarding narrative is what empowers women even more. I will show you later why this rewarding narrative is what empowers women in the workplace as well, something that their side wanted to talk about. On the idea of coercion, we think that outside breaks the idea of coercion because we think there are competing narratives on our side of the house as well. So we think that women can make a fair and balanced choice in regards to whether or not they think the choice of parenthood is clear. No thank you. So I think that this is basically the case dealt with."

                  "text": "My first substantive will show you how we empower women. The thesis of this argument is that women who choose to be mothers should not be told that they are oppressing themselves. We start from a very basic premise that motherhood is something that a sizeable number of women are going to engage in. We obviously do not live in a world with artificial wombs or one where males can take on the biological function of giving birth to a child. So for society to function, we do need offspring, and we think that only women can do this. In fact, I think it is uniquely empowering to be a woman, to be able to carry on your legacy, to be able to contribute to the future of humanity by giving birth to the next generation of people. So why is the narrative that motherhood is rewarding and empowering for these women? Because we believe that it is wrong to tell these women that they are oppressing themselves. If anything, I think this narrative stands on a very patriarchal notion that the value of the world is based on what men do. So if their side sees this coercive, I think their side encranges this coercion even more. Think about it. A mother's process of teaching their children, pouring their hearts and souls into the child's upbringing is inherently valuable. When a mother goes through children's fairy tales and Aesop's fables, instilling moral values, no doubt, into a daughter, till the day she comes home with a police force job acceptance letter in her hands. When a mother nurtures social interaction skills into a son, till the day she sees him walking down the aisle, happily married. So who is Tim Blankenash to say that all of these emotional fruits of labour are always inferior to capitalist pursuits? For one observer, hence we think that we recognise that the fruits of motherhood is empowering. But before I move on, Sean. In a world where these successes of the children don't exist, what do you tell mothers around the world? We think that you can debate only a small extent of this debate when the children become unsuccessful. The point of sight of Team Singapore is very clear. We think that when mothers engage in parenthood, they recognise that there's a spectrum of outcomes that might occur to a child. But regardless, the choice that they make is empowering. They need to do it with this entire spectrum, not just the cases where the child goes wrong. dan keadaan yang mungkin akan berlaku kepada anak-anak. Tetapi tidak kira-kira pilihan yang mereka buat adalah memperoleh. Mereka perlu melakukan dengan sepanjang jenis, bukan hanya kes-kes di mana anak-anak berjalan dengan salah. Jika ada apa-apa, saya akan mengambil alasan dan mengatakan bahawa walaupun anak-anak tidak menjadi SDIU atau SDIU atau menjadi penyakit, itu tidak bermakna idea keadaan ibu-ibu secara keseluruhan ini tidak berharga. Kerana ibu-ibu sendiri yang membuat pilihan dengan pengakuan ini. Tetapi kita harus tahu bahawa idea kepercayaan hanya berdiri di sisi mereka. themselves made the choice with this recognition. But let's just note that the idea of disempowerment only stands on their side, because it stands on the male narrative that only office work is valuable. So the point here is this. On both sides, women are going to choose to be mothers. The question is why proposition can tell them it is not valuable. Let's then move on to the second substantive, how we change societal attitudes towards women. The thesis of this argument is that the narrative that motherhood is rewarding combats the notion that the work of women is inferior to that of men. We start from the central claim that the narrative that motherhood is rewarding for the mother equally tells society that motherhood is valuable. Think about it. We tell lawyers and doctors, no thank you you that the job is rewarding for them as an individual. But we think that similarly, this can be done for motherhood as well, to tell them that their job is equally valuable for society. And with this, we think that we can protect a spectrum of women. First, we protect working mothers, what type of proposition mother to talk about. We think that workplace gossip entrenches the narrative that working mothers who choose to take care of their children are quitters or losers. If anything, I would suggest that it is on our world where we are able to break this narrative, to be able to tell mothers that they are making an empowering and rewarding choice, and there are practical benefits to it."

We think that if it were true, they would also justify deceiving people to donate one of their two kidneys, deluding them to the point that they believe that this won't hurt you. More importantly, deluding them to the point that they believe that this won't hurt you. More importantly, deluding them to the point that they believe that it will be rewarding. Never ever recognizing the immense cost to it. But no, we think that's horrible. Because the same way in which you delude the person to believe that their bodily autonomy is not that important, that the physical harms are not that important, the psychological harms don't exist, we think that analogy applies here as well. We believe women cannot be used as battering rams for the society's economic labor, for families to pass on their legacies, for their families to go down the heritage lines. Because while they sacrifice so much, it is true to say that they get little in return. More importantly, as I'll prove to you, why states give them very little in return. First point of argumentation from that side. Patriarchal societies, no thank you, say that motherhood is not valuable. We see portraying motherhood is not a rewarding experience. It's not the same as portraying that it is valuable. You can show that it's a valuable experience by telling people about the immense costs of it. The immense harm that these women go through and they still do it simply to benefit the society. What you do in your side of the house is tell them that you, when you go through this period of motherhood, get more rewards than the sacrifices. That on an individualistic scale, this is the holy grail of reward. That this benefit outweighs any of those harms and therefore you should not ask for more. But more importantly, if they want to place this debate in patriarchal societies, we think your side worsens it, where people believe that this experience is in and of itself so rewarding that perhaps us catering to these women is not a necessity anymore, that perhaps they get so much more in return, that when they claim that we need paid maternity leave, that we need more people in the society to cater to their needs, their demands, that it is more of an asking for a privilege. We think that's a world in which your patriarchal status gets worsened. Secondly, they tell you that you entrench coercion by showing that it is oppressive. No, we are not telling people that motherhood is a wrong thing to do. We are not telling people that ithood is a wrong thing to do. We are not telling people that it's an oppressive thing to do. All we are saying is that we need people to recognize that there are harms, that there are also benefits. And for these people to find that out by themselves. We believe that there will be people who look out into the society and see how some women do get certain levels of rewards. When they see their child walk, when they see their child speak their first words, those are rewards that they will categorically conceive. But the problem is when you tell this woman that those rewards are so immense that it will outweigh any sorts of harms and to a great degree you will not let them know those harms in the first place. That is the competitive that you need to address. Then they tell you that the pain and the benefits are always subjective. So we need to empower choice. And that's exactly our stance. We need to empower choice for that means to get rid of the most coercive narrative and the result of which is disbelief. Lastly, no thank you, bringing children up to be successful, carrying their legacy on is immensely beneficial to the community. They can see that these women will to a great degree want to be mothers in the first place. So I don't see why conceiving children is going to be a loss for our side. They will conceive children. The comparative is in which side does the pressure on children increase? In a world where you tell that the reward is in the form of your children being successful, in the form of your children not being recalcitrant, of your children being obedient. That is a world in which the pressure on these children to subscribe to the same illusions that you have portrayed, that you have given to these mothers, is a world in which you coerce those children to meet those demands that these women have. Coerce the students to fulfil those demands that these women have. And in a world in which they do not, these women become frustrated to a point where their family life becomes worse. And that is the comparative that you need to address. Yes. We told you very clearly that the value of motherhood exists regardless of whether or not the child is beneficial. Your burden is to show why there are more harms than benefits to motherhood, not that there are just harms."

In reciprocity the state gives them very little protection. In most states, even in the USA, there is no filial responsibility laws. Children, when they grow up and need to look after their own family, their own business, and especially their own children, they have very little capacity to look after their families. Often they do not realize that they have a moral obligation to look after their parents, which means they are still vulnerable. Secondly, in the vast majority of countries, women have less political capital. Very few parties cater to them. And especially when they grow old, because they are less economically productive, very few states have an incentive to cater to them. The conclusion is that when these women become vulnerable, the state and the community together gives them very little protection during that period of vulnerability. This narrative blinds you from seeing that. First of all, it's a relationship that is unreciprocated. You give more, you get very little from that child, but secondly, you give more, but you get very little from the state that coerced you to do all of this. The narrative glorifies those 16 to 18 years of motherhood, venerates it with illusions and blinds you from expecting the ways in which this period will expropriate your self-defense, your protection while the ones that propagate it will give you very little in return. The problem in this debate is not the fact that we do not understand how motherhood is valuable. We do that and especially that can be done better in our world. We do not think that motherhood is in and of itself a rewarding experience where we think that we need to reward them, that we need to give them a value, not the fact that this experience will be in and of itself valuable enough.

It is coercive to force people to get married because there is no opt-out clause because you can't get back the years you spent married to that person. You can't use huge amounts of bodily autonomy lost because you have to talk to your spouse and live in the same house as your spouse, for instance. So literally every single choice that they want to stand for is going to be coercive as well. The question is this, when people weigh the costs and benefits and decide that it is meaningful for them, why is it that this is not rewarding and why is it something that we should frown upon? Literally, that case seems to tell us that if a person chooses to become a mother, they will tell that person, no thank you sir, that she is betraying her sex, that she is oppressing herself and living under a false consciousness.

First of all, I want to point out that on our side, we actually expand the choices of women because we help them to expand access to the workplace. Now the second speaker says saying something is rewarding doesn't mean it's valuable. No, in our first speaker we clearly drew the link. When you say something is rewarding, that means that you aren't wasting your time doing it. That means that you are having a productive life, for example, doing it, and you aren't just being, no thank you sir, a random person who is wasting their life away. That links to the idea that it's valuable, because you are contributing to your life and having a meaningful life. If anything, the notion that women are wasting their time or are useless or are inferior to men stems often from the idea that the work they do at home is not valuable. So in fact, on our side, we increase access to the workplace. Because the reason why women don't have access to the workplace right now is because of the notion that they are wasting their time outside and that a woman is being a burden to society if we let her be a mother. If anything, on our side, we encourage more government support, no thank you sir, for mothers who want to return to the workplace, because we understand that the mothers who have gone to become mothers have created a valuable contribution to society. So the point is that, no thank you sir, on outside, we do not stand for coercion, no thank you sir. In fact, what we stand for is choice. Because at the point at which a mother chooses to stay at home, at the point at which a woman chooses to have a child and become a mother, we think it is our duty not to tell her that she is wrong and that she doesn't know best for herself, but to tell her that she is doing something that is rewarding for her. My second question therefore is on whether motherhood is actually rewarding as a concept, and I'm going to show you that it is in many cases.

Because they say that they would tell women that it is rewarding to have small moments like seeing a child walk. If they believe that there is no opt-out clause for motherhood, if they believe that it is always disempowering, then they would tell us that nothing about motherhood is helpful, nothing about motherhood is rewarding. The fact that they don't is because they concede that this debate has to be about weighing the costs and benefits.

My outline for today is on how we create equality yang dilakukan di dalam perjalanan sebagai seorang peguam, di dalam mahkamah sebagai seorang peguam, di dalam hospital sebagai seorang doktor, tidak membuatnya terlalu berat untuk ibu bapa sebagai seorang orang. Tidak mengapalah. Argumen saya untuk hari ini adalah bagaimana kita mencipta keadilan dalam tanggungjawab rumah. Klaim penting dalam argumen ini adalah bahawa kita memanfaatkan wanita untuk mengambil tanggungjawab lebih banyak di rumah. Jadi sekali lagi, ini berguna dengan alasan tertinggi untuk wanita yang terpaksa tinggal di rumah. Jika ada apa-apa, kita berfikir mereka akan menjadi wanita yang tidak berjaya, kerana mereka berada di masyarakat patriarkal, mereka akan terpaksa tinggal di rumah di kedua sisi. Soalan ini diberikan bahawa mereka mempunyai tanggungjawab rumah, Anything we think that are going to be women, unfortunately, as they sit in patriarchal societies, will be forced to stay at home on both sides. The question is, given that they have domestic responsibilities, which side ensures greater equality by ensuring that fathers also play a part in domestic responsibilities? So what does this look like? It looks like doing chores at home, so women aren't the only ones doing chores. It looks like spending time taking care of the child at home, for instance, because the parent is someone who is able to share responsibilities for picking up the child after work or caring for the child as childcare. Why is it true that on our side, we have more fathers who are willing to play a role at home? We think the notion that motherhood is inherently not rewarding stems from the idea that any work done at home is inherently less valuable and degrading. The idea that if I contribute at home or I stay at home, I am not contributing to society. And that is why mantu is not rewarding. The idea of how many of the things they talk about, how it takes away your future career options, also apply equally to fathers as well. And therefore, on their side, they discourage fathers from being able to have work and stay at home and care for their child, because equally, many of their arguments are symmetric and are tied to fathers as well. Before I move on, Shua. By your own analogy, the death of soldiers isn't particularly rewarding for that soldier itself, but we recognise that it is valuable, important and not degrading. Why does everything that is valuable have to be tied to the notion of reward? Sir, we do acknowledge that being a soldier is rewarding. We think it is rewarding to stand up there and die for your country, and stand up there and protect the country where your family lives. Similarly, we think it is rewarding when you stand up there and raise a family, when you raise someone and mold someone into the image of who you want that person to be. You have to show us why this reward is not something that you can recognise, and we think it's often linked to patriarchal notions of what capital gives meaning. So my argument therefore is on the idea of how we encourage more parents and more fathers to contribute at home. As I said just now, the idea of how their arguments often apply equally symmetrically to fathers as well. So the idea of how there's no opt-out clause when you leave the workplace and you can't return in the future. The idea of how it's physically demanding. Unfortunately, we understand that many women do bear the brunt of pregnancy, but their arguments are often what discourages fathers from staying at home and taking care of their child as well. Given that on both sides, what they're doing is essentially discouraging fathers from being able to stay at home and take care of their child, we think it especially punishes mothers, because they themselves admit there is already a societal perception and an expectation for mothers to stay at home. In that case, if there is already an existing societal expectation for mothers to stay at home, then if you levy the same narrative on both sectors, we think you disproportionately"

Because nothing can convince them, like these narratives cannot convince them that it's okay to be that. This debate is about people who are making decisions at the margin. People who are in the middle, who are uncertain about whether they can or cannot be mothers. And it is there, we say, whether that belief of the glorification of motherhood, whether that helps them to make a good decision or helps them to make a bad decision. Second thing to clarify is their entire idea of creating this forced link between the fact that rewards essentially mean valuable. Look, we already told you that in cases where you get some rewards out of something, doesn't automatically make it very valuable and vice versa applies. So you might give a lot of money to charity, right, billions of dollars, but you might not get any rewards out of that because that money wasn't used to produce. Which means that it is a valuable thing and a gesture that you did, but that didn't give the rewards that you really want to get. We don't think it applies in all cases. Having that cleared out, three things I'll be talking to you about in this speech. First, under which world are women worse off? Second, is it really true? And if it's not, why it's principally abhorrent as to what they do? Thirdly, under which world do you protect more children? Before I move on, sure. Your narrative affects women who want to be mothers because it makes them feel ashamed of their choice and tells them that they were acting wrongly. Why does it make them feel ashamed if we say and tells them that they were acting wrongly. Why does it make them feel ashamed if we say that it's very painful, you have to sometimes give up things, and that you might not ever get back again? We don't think that is shame, that is a realistic reality check telling that mom that you have to give up a lot. Going into more of this in my class."

How many ads did you have to see about when a mother struggled her entire life, but when the first day she saw the child walk, forgot about everything, and everything was fine?

Because people in the middle, when they're trying to make this decision, right? That okay, is it really worth it? When they see these sorts of ads, when they see these people constantly telling them that guess what? Everything will be forgotten. The sacrifices you made, the bodily pain that you made, or the fact that you left your job. It's all alright because when you see your child walk, it's gonna be fine. We think that is the delusion that they feed and we think that's taking away the empowerment. Because under our world, we believe knowledge is the best form of empowerment that you can give women. Where you can give women reality checks, saying that it's not going to be always okay, it's not going to be that guess what, just because you see your child becoming a police officer means that you'll forget the sacrifices that you made. You might still feel bad about it. We think these are important things to tell moms. And that is when you empower women, where you do not give them false lies, but you give them the true reality checks so that they can assess for themselves.

                  "text": "So if I break this down, the case doesn't exist. The first thing is that they claim that the attitude towards people change. And here's a simple logical flaw that I found there. If it's already very rewarding bearing a child, why would society want to give you more rewards? Because if you remember this correctly, they claim that society would be willing to give you more things for the pain that you bear. But, I'm sorry, this is apparently the most rewarding thing in your life. Why will the society be incentivized to give you more? If anything, society actively tries to take away things from women by telling them that guess what, you do get things. That's a sad thing to say, but society really feels that way. We don't think, ladies and gentlemen, they have an incentive structure under their world that creates any sort of change. But more importantly, why does our world change this incentive? Because under our world, motherhood is a selfless act with oftentimes no rewards or little rewards. Where women do this, at the good little rewards. Where women do this at the good of their heart, women do this because they want the next generation to be fine. We think when women, you prioritize women as doing something of a selfless act, only then will the society want to change their attitudes, not under their wall ladies and gentlemen. In comparison, what did we give you? And these are things that haven't been refuted, right? We told you why there's a disproportionate responsibility that you bestow upon women. Because how many times have you heard or seen in an ad that fatherhood is rewarding? Because in the vast majority of cases, it was always motherhood to be the bearing light of what it means to bring out a child. What that does is, in patriarchal and developing countries, we are not just talking about nice countries and liberal countries. In these countries, it's a way in which people bestow extra responsibility, which they say, that since this is so rewarding for you, please go take care of them. We think that is something, an active harm, that they don't stop. But secondly, we think the entire argument that we showed you about why states don't give protection is also reestablished given that on a comparative we showed that under their world there's no incentive for a reward. At least under our world, states recognizes the fact that these women are doing a selfless act and we need to give them additional rewards and additional protection for it. So conclusion being, under our world, we create an incentive structure for women to be helped in society, under their world they don't. Second, is it really true? If not, why is that bad? No thank you, right? Note that it's crucial to recognize that our cases are not the minority of cases like they would like you to think. Because success is very rare, what reality is that you don't go the way in which you perceive things to the minority of cases like they would like you to think. Because success is very rare. What reality is that you don't go the way in which you perceive things to happen. But before I move on, sure. So if you believe that the narrative of motherhood is so rewarding, then to be clear, why would y'all like... If your side believes that the narrative of motherhood is not rewarding, why would there be any incentive for your side to ever reward mothers or encourage motherhood? Because they know that since rewards don't exist, society must give the women rewards. As simple as that. But why isn't it true? Because note, it is their burden to tell us. Why? For in cases where it isn't true, you would still tell women that it is rewarding, right? That is their burden because these are the women that are being deceived. Because we gave you a plethora of harms and the plethora of instances where these women are coerced, right? We told you about how they feel bodily pain, psychological pain and things of that sort and why the returns is not always existent, right? In that we heard no response. So in simple conclusion, given that we saw in some instances this must be true, you have no right to deceive these women in those certain instances, if not all. And lastly, as to what makes a child do better off. This is very simple, and I'll quote the second speaker here. They say that happiness comes when you mold someone into someone who you want them to be. If that is so, if you make women this dependent upon their child's success, imagine what they do to make sure that their child is successful, right? Because since we have no direct engagement, this contradiction in and of"

This doesn't sound to me like what the motion is calling for them to do. So even all these convenient grounds, let's take down this one claim of coercion. First response, society also coerces men to work because often this is also rooted in biological notions of men being more strong and more able to work in the workplace. But why does that side not say that this is wrong? Why does that side say it's fine to coerce men into entering a 9-to-5 job to make money for the family?

You are here wearing nice clothes because society says if you don't wear clothes, you would wear dark clothes, you would probably look un-perlapable for society. So every choice is coercion.

But we think that even for women who engage in this, who opt into this, we think we should empower these choices. What we should regret is not the expectation of women entering motherhood, but the larger societal structures that do not value them entering and engaging in these expectations. Because we have a 9-5 work day that says that you cannot reconcile the childcare responsibilities with being a person who works. Because your side says we should not pay housework because this job is not valuable. Because your side says we have no place for women in a formal economy when we create this capitalist structure, but women are not rewarded for the choices that they take up. So they tell us here, that this all-realty tells us that they assume what is best for women. I'm sorry but no one in this room knows what is best for every single woman. So what we should err on is maximising the number of choices that women can access, and for every choice they do access, even if it is to be a mother, we should accept that and create the best possible conditions for these women who choose to do that.

                  "text": "about how the narrative currently is too skewed to be rewarding women who want to become mothers, and therefore we should rebalance this scale. First, are you seriously suggesting that women don't know what they are getting into when they are pregnant? Literally, look at the number of pregnancy books that you see in bookstores, the number of how young girls are often listening to their mothers about their stories of giving birth to a child. They know all of this and even if they don't, they have friends, everyone around them who does give birth to a child. Think about all those family gatherings that someone says, when you give birth to a child, you need to note 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No, this is what it's going to be like. So clearly, we don't think that there's a problem with information asymmetry. But second, your side is rather extreme here because if you claim that the halves are always going to be so bad, then you are essentially saying you are restricting choice for every single woman because it is just so bad to be a mother. That sounds to me like the most anti-feminist argument you can probably come up with because we think that women should be able to make choices. Your side does not allow them to do that. Second question on how our side benefits mothers. I'm going to here deal with the new advance in their third speaker because they said if motherhood is so rewarding, you will always find meaning in it regardless so the narrative does not affect it. This makes no sense. Societal narratives obviously inform public policy and here's where I'll deal with their third substantive. As they currently aren't identified, the problem with the status quo is that the state does not compensate women. But the mechanism is strange. Ask us in the POI, why is it that when we say that something is rewarding, we will get rewards for this? Because clearly, we exist in a capitalist society. So value is often ascribed to the capital. If you give me a moment. That's why lawyers and doctors get the highest salaries. We say that these jobs are rewarding. And that's why they are compensated with the highest salaries of society. Because society places a higher premium on you see that these jobs are rewarding and that's why they are compensated with the highest salaries in society because society places a higher freedom on you engaging in these jobs. Clearly in a capitalist society, when you see something is rewarding, you get more rewards for that. Before I go on, yes? If this information asymmetry does not exist and if the benefits are so objectively true, then why won't women conceive children and bring them up to be better human beings on our side of the house? Because we think that on your side, you initially tell them that there is not re-braining. And this is what leads governments to not have support for them because they have to make a choice between entering the workforce or being a mother. That's what happens when you say that only one mode of being a woman is legitimate because your side forces them to in this false binary. Back to my arguments. When they say that motherhood is not rewarding, there is less of an incentive to remunerate these individuals for entering motherhood because now states see mothers as not being economically productive. They have no incentive to give them pensions or support schemes. What is the comparative on our side? The first"

After giving birth to me, my mother went back to work only to receive a huge pay cut because she took her entirety of her maternity leave. And this signalled to her employers that she was taking her motherhood responsibilities too seriously. That is what will happen on your world when you say that motherhood being a rewarding experience is not a legitimate idea. So on your side, women who go back to the workplace do not get appreciated because they are simply seen as favouring one form of being a woman more than the other. Stuff the law to me like a case. Ma'am, if motherhood is already rewarding, why would external forces want to reward it more? I initially just dealt with this argument by saying that on your side, you do not reward them. You can't claim that the comparative is that we already reward them too much. When women don't have pension schemes currently because they don't have a job, when women who are housewives don't get remunerated, you can't argue to me that now we are rewarding women too much when women don't have pension schemes currently because they don't have a job, when women who are housewives don't get remunerated, you can't argue to me that now we are rewarding women too much. That simply goes against the grain of reality. Back to my argument. Even if we take their keys at the highest, so let's accept their substantive is true, that when you say something is less valuable, you have more rewards for this. This helps our argument on fatherhood because we say that when you make fatherhood seem more rewarding, you have more government support and this helps women as well, because you don't have to be the only one shouldering the responsibility of taking care of the entire family alone.

That is a bit strange, because the premise of the entire case is that motherhood is always dead. The physical pain always outweighs any rewards you might be able to get. In that case, they can't stand for governments giving help to mothers because they would encourage more women to become mothers. If they want to be consistent in their case, they cannot stand for any government help for mothers at all because any government help for mothers, any policies like maternity leave, would encourage more women to become mothers. And if the central premise in their case is that motherhood is always a bad thing, and to be consistent, they can't stand for government help at all. So to be clear, unless they abandon the entirety of their first argument, we have to recognize that the work they stand for is a work where society doesn't help mothers. They must actively stigmatize the idea of being a mother, because being a mother is always a false choice, that it's always going to be bad for the woman. The reason why they didn't stand for that earlier is because they conceded that mothers can sometimes be empowering, and that is the case we ran. More importantly, we told you, when women choose to be mothers, we think it is important for them to be able to feel empowered. What the water proposition does is make them feel ashamed. Recognize that this bit must actually apply to these mothers and if you're gonna talk about on the margins, then sure, if women wavering on the fence deciding whether to become a mother or not, if they choose to become a mother anyway, what they do is tell them that they are making the wrong choice, what they do is strip them away of the ability to get help from society."

More importantly, when women choose to make this choice, we give them practical support because on our side, we don't stigmatise motherhood. We tell you that motherhood can be a legitimate choice. And when we that motherhood can be a legitimate choice. And when we understand that motherhood is a legitimate choice, that is when governments provide support. That is when companies provide support. That is when societies provide support. Because we understand that this is not something to be found upon, it is something to be looked upon and rewarded. There is a reason, and it's not a coincidence. Why is it every profession we think is rewarding, we tend to value it even more in society? We say that being a soldier is rewarding for yourself, but it's also something we value, which is why we help veterans. We say that being a doctor is rewarding because we help patients, but we also help to value it in society because we understand that they save lives in society.

In fact, we told you why.

So much overpowering the harms that it is a rewarding experience. They claim that this is not so coercive. Well, if it's really a widespread belief as the motion already says, then probably it overpowers every other opposing narrative to the extent that this is to a great degree coercive. They tell you that all choices are coerced. We told you why. One, they don't coerce people as vulnerable as women are because they coerce men to be social workers, they coerce men to work, and I don't see why those are as coercive as these are.

                  "text": "But now moving into my first argument about empowerment, where we claim that we empower minority communities because we tell their stories in mainstream media. This argument will prove that meaningful representation only comes when you see someone like you having their own story and character and not just having the same skin colors. So why do we reflect minority experiences more meaningfully? We think first thing, this happens because we write a new character, right? With a backstory, complexity and nuance. This means that as a writer, you have to tell a compelling story about this person. On Up, you base your character on the old version, and you don't write a new backstory with new character traits, since the character already exists. For example, when Hermione in the Harry Potter musical was cast as black, nothing changed about her character. She didn't tell the story of the young black girl. The only thing that changed was her skin color. Secondly, on our side, you adapt other characters to that minority. When you write a minority character, you have to write into the script the relationship that exists between minorities in that show, like for for example, like family relationships in Black Panther, but also relationships with other majority characters. And thus you portray the complexity of the experiences that are unique to minorities, right, in society. We think that often you recast, you don't have to consider minority experiences in a meaningful way. Because instead, the minority is an afterthought into a pre-existing story. They are assimilated, they are unimportant. Listen, we're not saying that we get a perfectly nuanced Hollywood on our side. We're reasonable. But we think on the comparative, opposition is far more likely to be shallow and stereotyping of these minorities. Why? Two reasons. Firstly, because of the visibility of what you change on up. Viewers already know the original story. They know what James Bond is meant to be about. And thus, what you add when you put a minority into that role sticks out like a sore thumb. It's thus perceived as how stereotypes will also be perceived. This is basically how, in the new female reboot of Ghostbusters, they added period jokes, simply because the new characters were women. This leads to stereotyping, because you necessarily have to change specific things to indicate that a minority doesn't have it. But secondly, on our side, we can reflect positive societal change through lead roles. Society has largely become much more accepting, much more open to minority narratives. And we can have pop culture that is celebratory of minority identities. Like Moana, for example, which celebrates indigenous identities. Why is all of this important? Because we think we get much more meaningful representation. Indigenous girls are told that they can be their own Disney princesses with Moana, and not just the same little mermaid, just with darker skin. Their culture can be celebrated in the mainstream. And even if this doesn't appear to be a significant difference on the outside, because you still have the minority's visual characteristics displayed, we think carrying with that the unique experience and narratives holds all of the crux of what representation truly is. In our world, minority stories are told with intent and caution, and not just as an afterthought. Minorities are told that they matter for who they are, instead of just being told to be content with seeing their skin colour on TV. But now moving into"

Okay, this argument will prove that when we create newly enrolled, we get less angry majority, like less angry privileged people, and therefore have more exposure of minority stories. So how do people pursue new minority entertainment on our side? Minority, they're seen as a new story and a narrative with unique characters.

But it's much better when you keep around the unique experiences of what makes someone a minority, and not just the skin color, not just the stereotypes, right? But continuing on with my argument, we think people are unlikely to watch these movies on our site for reasons like liking the gender, like the genre for example. Like if you like action movies, you're likely to go and watch Black Panther. But also, things like having big Hollywood ads and exposure, seeing your favorite actor, minority or not, on a movie poster. And we can still benefit from things like franchises, like Star Wars, creating new minority leads. What happens on Up when you read Hots? Firstly, you're more likely to get backlash. Listen, we're not saying that people are outright and explicitly racist, but we think people in an oppressive society are're more likely to get backlash. Listen, we're not saying that people are outright and explicitly racist, but we think people in an oppressive society are much more likely to feel anger when they feel like their favorite character is being co-opted by political correctness. These same people may be open to thinking Black Panther is awesome and saying the catchphrases of Wakanda, they just don't want you to take James Bond away. We're not defending these people, but we think their anger perpetuates harmful narratives. What is the impact of this? When hardcore fans of original franchises are angry, they do things like spread bad publicity, through Twitter hashtags, through online ratings. Like when the female group of Ghostbusters rated very poorly on Rotten Tomatoes and ended up not selling much in theatres. On our side, you get more exposure. You're more likely to see these stories and think of minority experiences as important. We don't want to live in a world where entertainment of minorities is disregarded because it's the second and worst version of the original role. Stand with me. of the original vote. Stunned vote."

The first is the backstory, creating a pre-storyline to justify a transition. For instance, a character can have a backstory of growing up in poverty that he subsequently overcame, even though they might not have been part of the original character. Second, continuing a storyline of a particular character, where the role of a lead character can be passed on to a minority. For instance, in a very contemporary example, Captain America handing the shield to Falcon, for example. That's also a form of recasting a character. Third, alternate universes or adaptations, where conditions of lead characters are re-explored through the lens of a minority character. So there can be changes to the original story for viewers to compare and contrast."

The first of which is Spider- Into the Spider-Verse, where Spider-Man is portrayed as an African-American kid in the form of Miles Morales. And also, it was able to integrate minority parts into the story. For example, Miles Morales had an uncle that played Proud of, which represents all the sort of problems that exist with African-American kids growing up in a black neighbourhood, for example, that is riddled with crime and gang incidents. We bring in another example of Othello, about how Othello can have remade plays where Othello is played as a Caucasian rather than as an African-Italian man, and his wife now becomes the African-Italian wife, that's the Mona, no thank you, rather than the Caucasian wife. The value of this analysis is that our stories remain believable and enticing to the original audience. But crucially, we can incorporate new aspects of minority culture without having to make a new rule. So we think that it is an unfair imposition on site proposition to say that there can only be visceral differences, like a change in the skin colour, but we cannot make minor tweaks to the storyline or the context. For example, because we think that all of that is within the purview of site opposition, because it uses the same character, just minor tweaks, not an entirely new character that is unheard of. That is the key distinguishing factor between the two sides. Don't let them mislead you into saying that"

                  "text": "So I have two broad arguments, two broad rebuttals for today. First, on empowering minorities, and second, on coming perception. And on the first idea of empowering minorities, recognize that their side talks about a sprinkle of representation on our side. But they themselves have no mechanism as to why the writers and the scriptwriters on site proposition won't have the same sprinkle of representation they talk about. We POI'd them about why these writers have any incentive to do so. They had no response, no structural features why the writers on site proposition who create new rules are not under the same stereotypes and the same discrimination and the same racism that they claim exists on our side. In my first argument later in my constructive, I'll prove to you why the writers on our side have even more incentive to be even more representative. Second question, on public perception. And they tell us that on our side, these characters will stick out like saw of thumbs. But I think that that is inherently racist of side composition. To say that a black James Bond has significantly different characteristics just because he's black and just because he's not James Bond anymore. I don't think that that line of argumentation has any relevance into this debate as I'll further prove in my argument how I'm able to reiterate these individuals. So my first argument on river exposures with minority representation. And here in my first argument, I'll continue to clash with the lack of mechanism from side proposition as to how to impact representation. The thesis of this argument is that recasting minorities in existing gender roles generates even more attention on minority representation. Premise, the industry of popular culture and art is ruthless, both in the production as well as the consumption stage. On production, most studios and production houses, filmmakers, have strict vetting processes for scripts because they demand security and certainty for profits. They often tend towards more established brand names, characters they know have stood before and will probably continue to sell again. That is why they often go for sequels and prequels. For example, on consumption, most art and culture consumers also tend towards the mainstream because they don't want to venture to new content that they're unsure of whether it's good or not. You don't know whether the money that you're about to spend on a movie ticket, no thank you, is worth it, whether the evening that you're going to spend watching a new play is worth it or not. And there's often an inherent inclination towards films that these individuals grew up liking. So even if the remake, the sequels are not as nice on our side, they think that it is better because these individuals often have emotional attachments to the films that they grew up watching as children, for example. Why is it better then that recasting is so much better for minority representation on our side as compared to new roles? Three reasons. First, because recasting is more likely to be approved by production houses. It is safer and can make at least some profit because of the established brand name. And it doesn't have to be astronomical profits because these production houses would rather go for the certainty that you can make some profits rather than the risk that no one wants to watch a movie that is completely unheard of on site proposition, no thank you. If only they give the opportunity to clash with their first argument, our site actually has more incentives and more ability for screenwriters to become even more reflective. Why? Because if you're working with an established film, production houses are more likely to give you bigger budgets. They are better able to hire fact-checkers, for example, or key experts on the representation in order to make sure that the recasting of the role is accurate and representative. When you go with established fields, then it's your production houses are more willing to give you more money to do these things. The second reason is because recasting is better able to capitalise on fan bases. And here I want you to clash with their argument on corporate perception. Because on our side, people are more likely to go with established roles that they want to identify with. So for example, when Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse came out, for example, there was a huge or immense public backlash because people were generally very amiable to the idea of Spider-Man because they grew up watching that particular character, reading that particular comic book. So it is not true, on site proposition, to claim that they are being banished. Why is this so important? Because representation for minorities is about scope, about how many people know about it. It is about the ability for you as a kid to go to school on dress-up day, hold on a moment madam, and say, I can identify with this, and not get re-obsessed with the majority population, just because they haven't heard of this character before."

Second argument on breaking traditional oppressive strongholds. And the thesis of this argument is that recasting uniquely attacks old constructs that harm minority representation. When comparing content and production, people are only able to do so when there's a common basis of comparison. So for example, we are able to disarm negative stereotypes when the new release of the James Bond film that is played by a woman, for example, is able to show that being a womanizer is not true in society and not intrinsic to the character of James Bond. It is on our side when we show that there is no enclaving of minority representation because there is no one in society that says only black people can play this particular character, only the majority of people can play this majority character. On our side, we increase the representation for minority cultures because we get better incentives and better abilities."

Often, they believe that these sequels are going to be popular and make these actors famous exactly because of the rationale that Team Singapore gave you, right? Instead, these roles attract extreme backlash. This is important for two main reasons. Firstly, actors are targeted. Fans attack the actors, not the casters of them, exactly because they're the visible representation of this acting choice. So they get blamed. This looks like Leslie Jones, a black woman in the Ghostbusters reboot, being harassed enough on Twitter to have to delete her account because she said it put her mental health in danger. But the second impact is that harassment often focuses on their minority characteristics. This looks like Twitter trolls saying things like that a new Ariel is ugly because she's too dark, right? This horrifying rhetoric not only impacts on the actors themselves, but on the rest of the community that we want to help on side proposition, right?

I think on side opposition, they give you structural reasons as to why certain movies are likely to get more funding, more advertising, and more, crucially, attention. But I also think it's odd for them to say that we just can't give new ideas or new looks on these characters. Because think about it, a female version of Sherlock can have a new story about how she was raised differently, but I think there are certain callbacks that can be done to fans. So for example, this character has very similar idiosyncrasies with the previous character. All of these things are ways in which movie studios can attempt to make similar ideas, but still, because they need profit-making incentive, they presumably want to make the character as interesting as possible. They presumably want to give these people something new to watch. So I don't think it's true for them to say that they're just going to recast characters, because if that's the case, they're really not going to make any money. So on both sides of the house, we have to accept, there will be studios who try their best. The question is whether or not we give them the means to do so."

                  "text": "And I'm going to be attacking this in two questions. The first is on the reach of social justice, and second on deconstructing insidious narratives. So first, on the reach of social justice. Under this question, I'm going to explain why we get more people to consume art that contains minorities. And recognize that this is important in this day, because it's the main way that prop will be able to achieve the vast majority of their benefits. Recognize that cultural resonance occurs when the majority is appreciating. This is for two reasons. The first is because often people trade stories about ideas about things that they've watched. So watching a film is also important because of the people that you watch that film with. The second reason is because the benefits of their case only go as far as the scale and quality of anything on their side. So why do you not get this on their side of the house? Matthew gives you a couple of reasons. Matthew explains that the movie industry is incredibly risk averse. Because in other areas, for example, like testing products, you can have a test group to watch a movie. You can't do that with art, for example, because your test group is the art itself. What that means is that movie studios don't want to spend exorbitant amounts of money on things like world building, character building, pushing out new trailers, lots of ideas, and they have to straddle that with, for example, anything like spoilers in a movie. On their side of the house, new characters often become extremely hard for people to add to these areas. And that often means that movie studios choose to do a lot less on their side of the house. The comparative is actually very different. The comparative is when you have a character that many people know and love, that's when more people are willing to watch it. And yes, people often do go to the studio, not to watch the same thing, but to watch new and added expansions to the character, new and added expansions to the story. Like when people watch Superman, they don't fall in love with Superman because he's white, they fall in love with Superman because he represents ideas of strength, power, the idea of overcoming adversity. These are feelings that people want to see expanded upon, and that's why people will still be willing to watch films, even if they are recasted, because they represent ideas, not people, on their side of the house. To be crucial, we get more investment, more advertising, and more people to watch these ideas. They don't, on their side of the house. But what's the main response? We heard just a glib claim about backlash. I'm just going to take this down. The first thing I want to point out is that backlash seems to be rather symmetrical on both sides of the house. Presumably, if someone was really racist, they would say, that's not how I want my action hero to look anyway. So that's really symmetrical. But I'm going to push this further. I'm going to explain to you why backlash may not be as bad as they say. Because it is discussion, but actually way better than ambivalence on their side of the house. Ambivalence, which means that people don't discuss the boundaries to which people are likely to push for. They don't discuss the many issues that exist. The way we think about discourse is that more people are able to look at it and understand the consequences to which it comes from. By the way, it's also important to recognize that people aren't actively racist. People want to hide their racism sometimes or they're more subtle in nature. And what that means is that people aren't going to hate a character just because he's African American. Or more, for example, because they think that the story is not good. They can't sit on our side of the house because that character has been tried and tested and people know that it's good. So I think it's wrong for them to say all of these structural reasons. So to be clear, they get significantly less of their benefits on their side of the house because people don't want to invest in new movies because people don't want to watch them."

                  "text": "Madam, I just explained to you why people would be willing to watch new extensions of their characters, especially because movie studios have an incentive to call back to these groups, and why they have an incentive to add new dimensions to a character, apart from just stereotypes because movie studios actually want people to watch these films. Moving on. So the second question on the deconstruction of insidious narratives. Here, I need to point out that often, narratives and understandings are subconscious. So for example, when we think about masculinity, we tie it to certain images of popular culture. So for example, the idea of masculinity is tied to James Bond. I think it's important that we deconstruct this. Matthew gives two reasons as to why changing the nature and character of such a person deconstructs this. Because now you break the image that only a man can be a spy. You break the image that only a man can be powerful. You break the image that only a white person will be able to carry out certain actions that they otherwise wouldn't. And it's bringing these narratives crucially that allows us to push forward and not fight for social justice. Because we need to break tropes that currently exist. We can't just break images and add more ideas. We need to finish the current ones and tie them not to have been created in the past. I don't think they create this and I don't explain and they don't explain why they repunt this. The fact that they don't respond they create this and I don't explain it, they don't explain why they're rebutting this. The fact that they don't respond to this analysis in Matthew is damning to their case. I'm now gonna move on to my team's third and final argument on allowing for the creation of new perspectives in the medium of art. The thesis for this argument is allowing for the creation of original, well, the recasting of original characters pushes for the creation of new ideas. This argument takes proposition at the highest because we explain to you why we better fulfill the purpose of art and push for core social messaging at all. The premise of this argument is very simple. Art runs with perspectives and I think this is relatively important. Art from the very beginning of time, like Shakespeare, was all about stepping into another man's shoes and accepting how they were able to feel. So the second premise of this argument is how we allow this better to happen on our side of the house. The main reason is scope. So for example, co-opting a character with certain thoughts, images, or ideals that many people have already known means that people are more willing to empathize with their character in the first place. So what's important here is that people already empathize with this character. The way we push this is when we flip it on them. So here's a good example of this. Watching the movie 12 Angry Men might give us some understanding of how, for example, the racist they call else might be towards African Americans. But it also talks to us about power structures of men. Flipping the narrative and, for example, talking about 12 Angry women that has been released, changes this significantly. It allows us to see new perspectives on the ways in which things are created. Here's another example of this. Flipping the way in which we tell the story of Julius Caesar in plays, for example in Shakespeare in the Park, allows us to analyse the power relations that occur between men and women, but more crucially than that, juxtaposition is important here. Juxtaposing the former and the latter allows us to see the differences in how people see them. And this is important. It allows more self-reflection on the ways in which we view popular culture. Because it's important if people see something, oh, I didn't realize that I would think like that. But the more you push on this idea, the more likely people are able to see the biases that they have in themselves because they are able to compare and contrast new ideas and new beliefs from the ones of the old. And this is a unique thing that can only be done on our side because people don't often automatically contrast things, especially when they are seen, for example, in things that they don't automatically relate to one another. So what is important in our case is that we've proven to you that we get more scale, we get more people watching minority films, we get more of their stories out. We believe that recasting, rephrasing health minorities"

First of all, we do think that on their art side, you do have the profit incentive. This is for three reasons. A. Because minorities are a big part of the consumer market. This looks like in the US, having a significant percent of the population being black, which means that they will be interested in watching this. And on top of that, the fact that you're likely to have a specific genre means that people are going to attend this movie and you're actually going to get revenue. This is a structural reason alongside all the things we've been telling you, such as the fact that you do have a new storyline, you need to think of the experience and make it more representative. Because you get the backlash of this very human and the fact that you have to restructure the narrative around that minority character. We've told you structural reasons and they can't misrepresent us on this. But second of all, even if you really can't get any revenue, you just cast a famous person alongside a minority character. This is not exclusive on their art set in the house. This can look like a very famous actress that might or might not be minority, which, by the way, we think there are many actresses that are minorities, so you can get these famous actresses or actors playing these roles, getting that revenue, or you can just cast someone else along to actually get it. This proves to you that there are alternatives to increase revenue and increase production for the movie industry that we do get on our side of the house, because this actually does lead to more revenue."

Look, they can't say in their stance in the beginning of the first page that you change the backstory and you introduce an alternative continuing storyline, but then that it's tried and tested. These are very different, right? By their characterization of how recasting looks like, you basically, recasting inherently includes replacing a character, right? This doesn't look like replacing, this is their characterization of what will happen looks more like what will happen in proposition, where you actually introduce a character and then you- Do you mean triple? No, lastly, this is important because it makes production companies actually have an incentive, right? You can still gain revenue. Minorities are not a way that doesn't give you financial revenue. But second of all, second response to this, they said that they capitalise on the fanbase right? First of all, the fanbase, even if we concede to this, they don't really increase the demographics and the number of people that are exposed to these movements. Because presumably these fanbases are like very small that they're willing to go they're willing to go again to watch a movie that's so remade. They can't claim that they increase the exposure that exists to these minority experiences in the movie industry, but then say that only the fanbase will watch this. We give you incentives on our side of the house why people will still want to watch this.

So at their best, we get equal heart and equal benefits on both sides of the house. But secondly, they undo this because the reason when you repass someone, you fundamentally undo the storyline. And don't believe them when they tell you that people will buy into this. Because what their point actually looks like, it's changing who James Bond is. This is important because fans won't buy into the storyline anymore and will think that this is just changing the storyline that they were so invested in. Take all their mechanisms about how fans have an emotional connection to these characters. We can see to this and we think all the things we've told you about backlash actually get worse. We told you on our side of the house that this backlash doesn't allow these minority experiences to progress. It leads to things such as hating the actors and spreading racist and sexist rhetoric on platforms that are available to so many people, and actually entrenching and worsening the issues that exist. They haven't told us, they haven't responded to the point of the world truth in our second speech, and they haven't told us the way in which they actually feel with this backlash.

Very convenient change of characterization whenever it suited their responses. What was the reality? We told you earlier on the topic, Matthew, that people watch movies not just because of specific characters, but because of the values and the ideals that characters represent. That's why even if you recast, the values should make it the same and the people will watch it.

Second, on representation. First, on awareness. We told you how there's an increased scope of people watching due to their writing on the tales of existing popularity. The only response we get is this one line I heard from speakers. It that says that fan bases are small. No, this is a contradiction. Because if fan bases are small, none of their logic stands. All the stuff that they said, we will be interested in the action genre, no thank you, doesn't stand at all. In reality, we don't think these fan bases are small. Look at all the examples we gave you of extremely popular recasted movies, we don't think these fan bases are small. The second thing we tell you is upon the increased scale of minority productions. This means that even if we concede that people equally watch productions on their side, which we don't, on their side, there's less art for them to concede. Here, to their credit, they were more responsive. The first thing that the speaker says that just get a famous actor, it might or might not be a minority. First of all, that already consists of what they said in their first two speakers, about how it was extremely valuable that new minority actors portray these roles. I think they have to choose between either forsaking on some movies or their second speaker's understanding of minority actors. Second, they can't just do this mechanism by magic. Popular actors demand money. If the film is not going to succeed because there's no fan base, where is this money going to come from? I don't think they can just get a popular actor on their side. The second response was, oh it's an interesting genre. Sure, but in the same genre, there are many competing films. And I think, as compared to a small minority film that no one has ever heard of, people are more interested to watch John Wick 3 or Fast and Furious 8 for example. Because these already have an existing fan base that supports them. Their next response was, minorities are a large part of the consumer market. First of all, this is not necessarily true. We don't think that minorities are a large part of the consumer market in all cases. Their example is of African Americans. What about much smaller places like the LGBT community, like the disabled community? Their side simply does not cater to all these groups on their side. Their final response is, we need to be interested in advertising. That's again not true because advertising for an unheard of film is drowned out by the massive advertising budgets for all the huge franchises that compete with these films. Their final response is that recasting is a risk as well. That's not true. We think that because of the existing popularity and existing fan base, for that particular values and ideals of that film, it's less of a risk than their side. These were just all the responses, no thank you, to the scale of production on our side. Their last response was they're the incentive to fake minority movies because of demand and that's precedent. This isn't true. Let's address this so-called precedent. Here I'm going to take down their shining bright examples of Black Panther and Jedi Rey. You know what?

We didn't really hear a response to this POI. We think it's because the incentives are symmetrical to not make these characters reductive and actually make them representative of the community. I'm not going to deal with their outlook on backlash and their point of information. We told you there was a spectrum of individuals in society. There were those really discriminatory ones and there were those on the middle ground. We want on both. First, on the really discriminatory individuals. We told you right from first speaker that it's much harder to degrade and target who a character that you love and are passionate about. We think it's really, really discriminatory individuals. We told you at our first speaker that it's much harder to degrade and target who a character that you love and are passionate about, with this wisdom in really, really discriminatory individuals. On the middle ground, we gave you reasons like formative progressivism, why discrimination is much more subtle today. We thought it was unpopular to say, I don't like this character because he's black. But it wasn't unpopular to say, I just don't like this character because he's not very imaginative storyline. That changes on our side when really racist individuals has to come out and say I don't like this individual because he's black that's when it's benefited on our side my second speaker told you why discourse is better than ambivalence this also takes on the second speaker's argument about minority actors because it was hung on backlash let's go even further we benefit minority actors and all the children who want to be actors on our side because we increase movie production and this art is more successful. If they really want to talk about Backlash, I will give you the example of Kelly Marie Tran who was told by Star Wars fans that her portrayal of Rose Tico was terrible because it wasn't imaginative. That was because it was a new character that people didn't like on their side. If they would care about Backlash, they would be supporting our side. What have I shown you? On our side, there's more consumption of art and culture representing minorities, there's more art raising awareness on minority issues, and there's a decrease in backlash. Second point of contention on representation. Their main argument here is that there's more shadow and stereotypical characters on our side. That's not true. We challenge them to give us a systemic reason other than the frankly racist notion of sticking out like a sore thumb. And we only got one thing, that you need this character to be representative of experiences and therefore you can't fit it into the mode of the existing character. That's not true. We're talking about backstories and sequels being able to fit into the mode of the existing character as well as talk about all the minority issues on our side as well. But next, I don't think there's any minority meaningful difference. Because if artists wanted to be reductive and shallow, it would happen on their side too. Even in new characters, you can have very shallow, very stereotypical characters on their side. I don't think this is a benefit they can claim. What did we tell you instead? We gave you three mechanisms for Matthew to combat discriminatory rhetoric. This continues to clash with their notion of discrimination. We told you one, on breaking stereotypes. Two, on reforming discriminatory rhetoric. This continues to clash with their notion of discrimination. We're talking, one, of breaking stereotypes. Two, of reforming discriminatory characters. And three, that we're talking about the major traits of the majority group are not intrinsic to this character. We don't think that any of them have been responded to right from first speaker. This is important and fatal to their case. I want you to ask yourselves why it was they were afraid to engage with these arguments. What have we proven? We better awareness, we better representation, we better help the vulnerable minority groups because we have been casting, we now will go to the second one."

How exactly did the incentives of filmmakers and producers and tastemakers on their side change? When we asked them this in a point of information, they couldn't give an answer. That makes the debate very clear. This debate is not about racist caricatures. This debate is about the vehicle of social justice that we ought to choose. And I'm going to explain to you, by walking through the two worlds at the end of this debate, to explain to you why the world of the opposition was significantly better. But first, the world of proposition. The world of proposition was the world of the African-American child who brings his favorite superhero to school, only to throw it in the trash when he goes home because nobody recognized who it was. The world of proposition was a world in which minorities will not be able to as often see themselves on screen. This is often because of the fact that, as we said, it wasn't really respond to at all by the way, about how filmmakers often are incredibly risk averse, how fanbase sounds incredibly risky, why all of these things explain and suggest why their side gets significantly less political capital and support for these films. And question, importantly, this is where all of their benefits, including their first, second, and third arguments, were harmed."

I think, moreover, in the world of proposition, they don't even lose, win their argument on backlash, because we gave you structural responses all the way down the line. In the proposition, racists will remain to be racists. People will still continue to say that the action heroes that they pump out on their side don't quite look like action heroes at all. But I think it's important to recognize in this debate, therefore, is that the world of the proposition was unable to deconstruct the pre-existing narratives that caused these ideas to come out in the first place. So look at all the tropes that currently exist in their world. Yes, they have new characters, but the tropes and classics like James Bond still continue to tickle the imagination of children all around the world. If that's the image of a spy that they want to have on their side of the house because they don't deconstruct the fundamental images of masculinity that are tied to saving the world, then I think they don't get the benefits of social justice. So to be very clear, the side of proposition has equal amounts of backlash, but they don't reduce the amount of minority benefits that they have on their side. So all their benefits don't accrue. In fact, they make it significantly worse for all of these reasons."

We were the world that recognised that filmmakers on both sides of the house had the incentive to make films watchable for all. The question therefore is how we empowered them to carry out this activity. And it was the world of the opposition that explained how that was done. Because we were the world that explained why they had more investment into these movies. We were the world that explained why people would be more willing to watch these movies in the first place. Because people who have emotional connections don't just watch these movies because of the fact of their skin colour. They often watch these movies because they represent values and idiosyncrasies and jokes that they themselves understand. So for example, I'm a great fan of Sherlock. I will continue watching it if they change the gender. Same with Doctor Who because Doctor Who is a character that's constantly passed down because of certain ideas and idiosyncrasies that exist in this debate. So to be clear, fans will watch them because they care about the values that are created. I think what's important is in the world of the opposition, people get and watch these films together. That cultural capital on both sides of the house that we want is only acquired in opposition. It's in the world of the opposition where people are actually able to hear the new stories and new voices of minorities because people watch them, people understand them, people admire them. We believe that recasting recaptures our audience. I've never been prouder to oppose. Thank you. Singapore began this debate characterising these characters that we were costed as beloved"

By centering the reinterpretation of religions on this public agenda, the most important platform of shaping perception, by the way, the LGBTQIA plus community takes like the wind out of the ultra conservative sail.

And this is by, this is because of the anti-religion aspect, like of the religion. So what is our metric in this debate? Firstly, we would like to get more inclusivity for the LGBTQIA plus movement, its members, and especially religious gay people for the sake of intersectionality. So now to our first argument on how we get more acceptance. So the status quo, there's a clash of LGBT and religion, right? This is what we call it in the framing. They are framed as mutually exclusive. And the primary attack on the LGBT is that it's against religion, right? This is what we call gender framing. They are framed as mutually exclusive. And the primary attack on the LGBT is that it's against religion, right? Therefore, it's withholding more people from supporting this community. So the problem of the religious people with LGBT is not the fact that they exist or that they would be harmed by them, but that it violates their religion. So in the status quo, a lot of religious communities view gay people as sinners right because it is against the religion this is what they claim"

The movement is now only in opposition to those religious individuals who are expressing active hatred towards the community, to those who are doing active harm, right? Because the movement itself does not generalize against another group, which makes it less hypocritical. So how do we get our acceptance? Two layers here.

And when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how there are fundamentally good parts of religion that they support, like, for instance, love not taken love love your neighbor for instance um they do not uh they no longer feel that they are being attacked by the movement and that in conjunction with religious leader like the pope starting to be more supportive of gay of gay people is likely to lead to less opposition on both sides since there are some values which both can agree on right secondly religious gay people are more likely to go to church if they are not shunned by the movement right this means for instance more directive exposure for not taken for these groups to members of the movement and this is good because they can see that individual like they are individuals and human beings who deserve love and respect so how does this work people are more likely to be afraid of things they don't they like don't know anything about, right? And that is just like, that they just heard bad things about, right? And this can be simply explained by evolutionary reasons, like for instance, how a child is afraid of strangers, because they are not certain if that person is going to harm them in any way, or if that person is going to protect them. So what impact do we get here? Firstly, by centering the narrative in the movement, they push back on the primary attack on them by eliminating the mutual exclusivity narrative of religion and LGBT leads to more acceptance. Therefore, there will be a safer environment for the LGBT people fulfilling the whole goal of the movement, right? And also, not only for LGBT people in general, but especially for those most disadvantaged by their community, helping the most in need, falls principally in the line with the mission of the community, right? But before I move on to our next argument, I'd like to take a point. You are running away from your Bowdoin-Assad proposition in this debate. You can't say the LGBT movement is neutral towards religion on your West Side. The LGBTQ movement has to support a certain interpretation of religion on the West Side of the house. Look, we think that what we characterize you in our framing is that currently this exists because of this entire religion narrative, right? That someone who is gay must be a sinner according to that side. This is the principal clash in this debate that we are like basically characterizing how we are getting rid of that, right? But now onto our second argument or how we get more LGBT friendly policies and how we get more discussion and therefore recognition by the church. So this is directly coming from the first argument, right? Because as we get less violence and polarization, the perception of the movement is going to shift, right? Because the goal, again, is acceptance and equal rights for all. And when this centering happens that we give you, like by the analysis of the first argument, the people are going to change their mind. And why is legislative change more likely to happen on our side of the house? Firstly, because conservative legislators have to cater to the voter base, like this includes a lot of religious people. And conservative policies and pushes on policies have to cater to the voter base like this includes a lot of religious people and conservative policies and pushes on policies have to embrace religion and the interpretation of religion that their voters subscribe to so in state in the status quo they push mutual exclusivity of religion not taken and lgbt because that is the belief that dominates their voters right but by centering this topic um essentially what is going to happen is that they engage the conservative religious voter base, their perception is going to change, and policy makers will have no other choice but to follow it. We get more discussion and willingness to engage on LGBT topics as a whole. So what impact do we get here? Firstly, if more social acceptance comes from religious voters, the parties will have less incentive to sabotage pro-LGBT policies, like, for instance, gay marriage, gender affirmative care, etc. So, basically, we're getting equal rights role as these conservative policies and politicians have to cater to their voters. But secondly, on vulnerable stakeholders like children. So, religious parents now, in this status quo, just send their kids, for instance, to church to cure their sexuality, right? And this happens in the status quo because there's a lack of understanding around the topic, right? They have a lack of empathy for these people because they don't know what they feel like. And they make them feel guilty. And literally small children who feel gender dysphoria or discover their sexual identity at a younger age are made to feel guilty about themselves and this is fundamentally wrong because they have no control over this right this is proven and they have severe impacts on their mental health like no like they have lower self-esteem they're more likely to not become a malfunctioning in adult life and because they have been told that something is wrong with them like no wonder that in the status quo the suicide rates are this high and this has to change because in the status quo lives are ruined and ended like and ended like based on this immensely flawed perception so if the impact here is that we get more inclusion for the community where they can function properly they can work without being discriminated against they can get married they can adopt kids and have their own family go to church and practice their religion without other people bashing on them. Never bring project proposed."

The movement as a whole is large and composed of individuals who do individual things in their private time. Proposition cannot simply support having gay preachers talk about rights in their own church or private discussion groups between closeted Christians. They need to support reinterpreting religion as being the center of public attention in the movement and the center of the LGBTQ plus narrative. Prop needs to prove that religion needs to be one of the most important things in the movement. That is their burden in this debate. Prop is already way behind because their first told you that they're only going to support being neutral. And that is way out of the spirit of today's motion, given that they need to support religion as the center of this movement. Secondly, the center of the LGBTQ plus movement right now is pride. And that's exactly what opposition supports. The big issues supported by the movement are things like body positivity, sexual freedom, and free expression. This pride movement manifests itself in activities like colorful parades, drag racing, supporting Beyonce, things of that nature. We can support members individually taking stances on religion on our side. We don't think the movement as a whole, however, should take a stance on religion. We don't think that the LGBTQ plus movement must completely oppose religion on our side, given that there's religious members of the movement too, who are very active within LGBTQ plus advocacy. If Prop proves that the two have an antagonistic relationship right now,"

The first is that Proposition needs to support the LGBTQ plus movement actively reinterpreting religion. If you reinterpret religion, say something like Jesus loves you even if you are gay, then you are actively taking a stance on that religion. You are not remaining neutral on it. Therefore, by the very nature of the motion in the action of reinterpreting religion, you must already take a stance on what religion means. It's also pretty disingenuous to reinterpret a religion whose values you do not even align with, given that you are making such a big change towards Christian canon, you presumably have to be a Christian yourself as well. Secondly, proposition soft case is probably not in the spirit of the motion, but even if it is, it's such an unimpactful case. Taking no stance on religion at all is not going to make religious individuals like bishops and the Pope, according to their impact, support the movement all of a sudden. They won't support this movement that used to hate them that now is just neutral towards them. You need to change the minds of so many conservatives who believe that you are a movement of sinners in order to change all of these important people. Even if the LGBTQ movement is currently anti-religion, religious gay people can separate different social circles and different parts of their identity. You can go to church on Sunday and then go to pride parade some other day. Before I move on, I'll take a point. So we, you're misunderstanding our case. We tell you how we're not taking a stance on whether religion is good or bad, but we're breaking the gate of like telling that religion has to conflict with like your sexual identity response. If that's your stance, you can cross the aisle right now and take a seat on our side of the house, right? Because that's exactly what religious movements look like in the status quo. They have no active stance."

Even in the gay positive set, even in the gay positive sex of current religions, such as the Metropolitan Community Church in LA, gay rights are integrated into religious family values, promoting the nuclear gay parent family and sexual abstinence amongst gay partners. This sect is fine, but applying the values of the sect to the movement as a whole publicly means sacrificing the sexual freedom aspects of the movement that currently exist. If you reinterpret religion, you must do so under the assumption that the larger values of religion are good. The further you stray away from this fundamental aspect of religion, the weaker prop case becomes because at that point you can no longer co-opt religious people into your movement. The impact of this is threefold. The first is that you sacrifice the authenticity of the movement. Every single thing the gay movement wants to support, that individual members want to do, has to be checked against the millions of pages of text written under all of the major world religions that currently exist. Every new activity being done will need to be checked for whether or not it can align with the new religious compliance of the movement. For example, it is unclear whether the LGBTQ movement can uncontentionally support surrogacies and IVFs for gay couples on prop anymore without knowing whether or not they are able to justify it religiously through one line of text in the Quran and one line of text in the Bible and one line of text in the Torah and all of these religious texts that exist. The second impact is on the fracturing of the movement. A lot of people in the LGBTQ movement are anti-religion for a variety of reasons. Some are liberals who dislike the way conservatives have infiltrated institutional religion. Others come from religious communities and face oppression in them. This will create fracturing within the movement as those individuals become alienated from the new center. Unlike beautiful colors and fun musical events, religion is one of the most controversial issues in the world. This translates to less political support for LGBTQ plus candidates and less legislation and less cohesion in the movement as a whole. Not having an explicit stance on our side does not alienate the religious members because they're able to separately discover their religious identities. But taking a stance on prop in favor of religion is a stance against certain members. The third thing is losing the potential for intersectionality. The trend in the status quo is that all the movements are pivoting towards sexual freedom. Feminism supports sexual freedom and women reclaiming their sexuality. The Black Pride movement is re-centering around sexual freedom and reinterpreting Black culture as being freeing instead of degenerate. The LGBTQ movement stands at the center of this intersectionality by emphasizing sexual freedom, where feminist icons like Beyonce has a new song called Break My Soul that samples the drag queen Big Freedia. This is good because there is strength in numbers. LGBTQ people will always be a minority, but they are no longer one when combined with all the other social movements. Sexual freedom is their common ground, and prop takes that away. This weighs up against the marginal increase in support from religious communities on prop, because the sudden recentering of religion on prop goes against centuries of homophobia, whereas on op it's fairly easy to get other oppressed individuals to become allies when they can also relate to the trauma of the oppressed. Second argument, therefore, on trauma."

Their parents and communities indoctrinated them into believing they were sinful, they might have been sent to convergent therapy. These people are few in number, but given their suffering, high impact in this debate. Coming out of the closet was probably the hardest experience in their lives. There's a reason why LGBTQ movements from the most conservative communities choose to completely change their identities after coming out. They quit their jobs, they find new friend groups, they move to New York City, they completely leave their churches. The LGBTQ plus movement on our side is a safe space and a source of catharsis for these people. It is able to act as this type of space because the movement has a completely unique culture that is the antithesis of church culture, where people are encouraged to be themselves, to do whatever they want, rather than value things like purity and chastity. People from the oppressive backgrounds are therefore able to find themselves and recover from their trauma through the movement exactly for that reason, because it helps them forget about their old lives for long enough to build new ones. This changes on prop, where the LGBTQ movement forces these individuals to relive that trauma every single day of their lives. They inevitably have to co-opt and center religious procedures and individuals in the movement in order to have authority and ethos when reinterpreting values. This looks like having gay preachers talk about the Bible, giving sermons which per Christian tradition will inevitably include the hints and stories from possibly traumatic childhood childhoods. That's why this argument matters because even if you buy proposition case that is simply going to be part of the movement, so long as it is part of the movement that trauma is all relived. So for all these reasons I'm very proud to oppose. I would like to thank the leader of opposition for that fine speech and would like to call upon the deputy prime minister to continue with the case for the side of proposition. Take care.

We think members of the community will still and should stand up to discrimination and inequality and oppression whenever it comes from things like religious people, right? We think furthermore, this means that this is like an open and average non-fundamentalist religious people are still likely to support the movement. Right.

So even if you buy this argument, we think that like, there's not going to be a lot more fragmentation than in the status quo. There are still things like, like some gay people not supporting trans people, etc. Right? We don't think that the movement is like completely unified in the status quo, because it doesn't have one uniform narrative, right? So moving on, we think that, no, thank you. We think that like, we think that we still have potential for intersectionality because note that they say that the only thing that like intersectionality is based on is like this support for sexual freedom. We don't think that this is true. We think that in general, a lot of these movements are based on the idea of acceptance and equality, right? That's the fundamental tenet of all of these movements, not sexual freedom. We see this is with, and this is why, like, for instance, there are like different like conservative individuals who are like very, very religious supporting the feminist movement. Right. We think that what this means is that we're still likely to get this kind of intersectionality with the support of the government goal of getting of having more equality and less discrimination. Right. We don't think that sexual freedom is what is like the central tenant of these movements. Now let's talk about trauma, and I'll directly respond to this in our point of intersectionality, but I'll move on to a POI before that. How do you gain enough ethos in the religious communities to impactfully reinterpret the Bible if your movement is still neutral and half the people in your movement publicly hate religion? Our movement is not neutral. We tell you in our framing and we tell you in the beginning of this speech that what happens on our side of the house is that we have a very direct support for religion as a concept for people believing in things. We also tell you that we have a direct support for very specific religious concepts this is not neutrality right furthermore we think that this in itself lets individuals focus on common ground between this movement and and and um and religious values which means that religious individuals are are no"

In the state of school, because the LGBT movement has put on at least an implicit anti-religious stance by openly opposing religion, right? We think on the other side, there are a lot of religious leaders who are still somewhat against the LGBT movement, right? We think that this duality, the people are most ignored are religious members of the LGBTQ community, right? We think that there are a lot of people who still believe in religion. We think that this happens regardless of their family, like, treating them not that well, right? We think that they can still embrace the, like, abstract concept of religion, even if their religious families were bad, right? We think that this is what the movement highlights, because on your side of the house, you're literally pushing the narrative that like the religion is the direct cause for the suffering of gay people through things like different like church camps or whatever, trying to change their sexuality, right? We push back on this narrative. We say that there can be like a coexistence between the religious movement and um religious people and the lgbtqia plus movement right so what happens on our side of the house is one religious we've lessened anti-religious sentiment in the lgbtq community these individuals can still be mad at their abusive families this is not something that is re-traumatizing them secondly we think it can serve as a place of acceptance for people most torn by their identities, which they perceive as contradicting. And we also stop people from being torn away from their religious families in cases where they are not abusive. Thank you."

If they want to support having a very neutral ideology where everything is very passive and we only talk about things that are uncontroversial, you never get enough support to get any religious individual to care.

                  "text": "questions in this debate, one on religious backlash and how religious groups will react, and secondly, on the obligations of the LGBTQ groups. One, on religious backlash, three things. First, on the prop mechanization, they simply assert that on their side, LGBTQ groups will accept religion and this will solve all the problems. Their fiat only goes to the extent of reinterpretation, which means often like, that looks at things like, for example, looking at the Bible, looking at parts of it and saying, this can be interpreted to say that LGBTQ is being supported. Reinterpretation does not mean you can fiat mass love and mass support. So already their core mechanism, which that everyone in the LGBTQ movement will suddenly support and praise religion is one that is already untrue. We tell you it's more likely going to look like things like reinterpreting the Bible and negotiating what the religion actually thinks about LGBTQ groups. That already means that a core mechanism is off in this debate and it's a wrong characterization. But furthermore, this also impacts things like the fracturing of LGBTQ movements. Because we told you, if you do actually try to accept religion as a whole, many individuals disagree. Because if you look at the status quo, there is a large degree of negative sentiment within LGBTQ groups against religion. So for that reason, on their side, there will be a lot of fracturing. We heard no response to this entire argumentation. So on their side, LGBTQ groups are much weaker. That's bad because when it comes to things like voting power and uniform policies that we want to support that get changed for everyone, you get less of that when you fracture the movement as a whole. That's already bad. So that's already important to point out, because that means the characterization of what reinterpretation looks like is already extremely off. The third speaker needs to address this."

                  "text": "Secondly, how will religious groups respond? And we're going to take them at their best and say reinterpretation just means to some degree that, you know, you just accept religion, right? Which is already, you know, as we pointed out, not the point of this debate. There's a gaping hole in the proposition case. They assert that religious groups simply will just accept the entire LGBTQ group at the point when you bind to religion. But they never actually prove this. Like one, just because the LGBTQ group says we like, you know, like parts of religion, why is it suddenly true that religion, like religious individuals will bind to the LGBTQ movement? Because as you characterize to you within religious groups, there is some sentiment against LGBTQ ideas, especially for more devout individuals, because people interpret the Bible in ways that say things like, for example, you know, it's wrong to be LGBTQ, and many people who are religious buy into the ideology. So even if this entire social movement buys into religion, why is it something that every religious individual will care and buy into the LGBTQ movement and vote for them? That's a mechanization never proven. So their entire upshot of, you know, then you get this massive voting base, never actually like legitimizes on their side. But secondly, as we told you, a more realistic view of this debate means you do have to reinterpret parts of religion, right? So people in LGBT groups are likely to challenge certain ideologies that are given by religious bodies. Like otherwise you have a lot of compromises, right? So for that reason, that also leads to further backlash. This already means their entire impacting and the only link to get to the impacting, which is that mass violence from religious groups occur is unlikely to happen in the very first place. And they never prove it. They just assert it. But furthermore, we're going to take that to even higher ground, right? Why is that religious backlash likely to occur? And this is like a larger impact. Because we tell you the very process of reinterpretation leads to backlash. Because what happens on their side in most cases that you look at the Bible, and you say, we disagree with how you perceive LGBT groups, we think the Bible says this, and for example, look at this passage, we think that process in of itself, especially what done by LGBT movements, and individuals who are not religious experts is specifically bad, because that is a process that like in general is seen as very sacred by individuals who care about religion, right? Because interpreting the book of like, like a very religious book, like the Bible, for example, is supposed to be done by individuals who are in high places of religious authority. So when individual movements try to co-opt that and interpret it on an individual level basis and implement those ideologies within their social movements, we think that leads to a lot of religious backlash because that seems something that is very important. And therefore, it looks like they're disagreeing with their religion. That's where religious backlash is actually likely likely on their side so you get even less support from religious groups they need to respond to this argumentation why is this so important because it speaks out all they're impacting at an even higher ground right like because it proves that politicians for example have an incentive on their side to take more extreme stances against lgbt groups when you're for example a republican politician because now the general sentiment of republicans and individuals who tend to be more religious tend to be against these movements. That takes out the best case impact. Also, all the argumentation I gave you about why they don't prove religious backlash, also shows why even in the very best case, they don't prove mass buy-in. So their only impact in the first feature is that we get more voting power. It doesn't actually happen. We're also going to introduce a new impact here. This is a new substantive, because we think in the status quo, if you want to get your LGBTQ ideas into developing countries, which often have more extreme religions, you need to take a more passive stance. On their side, when you try to reinterpret actively and you tell these countries, well, we are telling you this, right? We are interpreting religion. This is what we believe is true. That is a world where you need to mask backlash in those areas. That's specifically bad because that means infiltration of LGBTQ ideologies and acceptance never enters regions that are extremely religious in places, for example, like Saudi Arabia. So you never get that degree of implementation on their side of the house because you take too extreme of a stance. That's a big problem. So we proved you a religious backlash likely to occur and therefore all the impacts of buy-in don't occur. What do we tell you then? That's the second question. What are the obligations of an LGBTQ group? One, on religious individuals. Probe runs an argument in the first speech about children and gender dysphoria, but did absolutely no work to link this to religion or anything, right? So already the entire statement is quite irrelevant because they don't link it to the debate. We also flip this because we tell you that movement on our side is more accepting, right? Because our core ideology is saying pride is important. On their side, the core emphasis is talking about religion. So on a comparative on our side, these demographics are better off. But what do we tell you? We give you a very important argument on why we prevent trauma. Steph gives you this entire argument, and the only response you heard to it essentially saying that on their side, it's going to be better, right? And the only mechanization is that, you know, religious groups once again buy in and are accepting. We already proved to you that's unlikely to happen, but the biggest difference on our side is that you get to opt in. Because even in their best case, if religious groups do buy into your religion and are very happy about it, that doesn't mean this individual doesn't have the trauma go away. But on our side, you get a safe space. If you go into, like, you know, an LGBTQ rally, there is no talk of religion in most cases. In general, you have an accepting environment to be yourself and be proud of who you are. On their side, when you go to religious, when you go to LGBTQ rallies, religion is the center of what is being talked about. It will be constantly discussed. So for that reason, you never get a safe space in an environment to be yourself and escape your trauma of religion. That's a massive impact that affects a lot of people. We never heard a proper response. Secondly, and what are the goals of the movement? This takes the entire proposition case at their very, very best, because we're going to assume everything they say can happen, just say they get, you know, a little bit more religious buy-in. Why is our side still better? Because crucially, we think the purpose of the movement is to cater to the most people. And there are many other issues that affect a lot more individuals than religion. Because even if religious people buy in and religious people feel a little bit better on our side, that's a relatively small demographic of the entire movement. We think other issues, like for example, getting legislative change, things like for example, widespread fighting against discrimination, affect much more individuals and pride therefore should be the focus. The reason this is crucial is because one, if you just weigh on our side, everyone benefits from those things, right? So even if you're a religious individual in an LGBTQ movement, you benefit from, for example, less discrimination. On their side, only religious groups buy in and in general, this is like a lesser impact. But furthermore, on our side, there's also less fracturing because you cater to much more people. On their side, there's a religious focus. Many groups likely fracture away because they don't buy in to the general idea and don't agree with this being the center idea of a movement. That fracture means less political power and less change. So on our side, we cater to the most important issue, and we actually benefit a much larger group of people. We think that's crucial because the goal of the social movement is to cater to a large group of people to get large-scale social change. On their side, you cater to a small group of people and make that the entire center of the movement. We think that's fundamentally wrong to get change. We never hear a response to this, so we beat them at their best extremely clearly. For all these reasons, very very proud to oppose. I would like to thank Deputy Leader of Opposition for that fine speech and I would like to call upon Proposition Whip to conclude substantive part of this debate. What is out of proposition? Hear, hear. Okay, just to confirm, am I audible and visible like this? Yes, you are. Okay, I would like POIs verbally because I want you to be looking at the chat. And my speech was 13.

Second of all, then we tell you how the LGBTQ movement is directly framed and seen as some kind of, which is like the antichrist, basically, who's opposing the religious movement, who is actively committing sins. This was also acknowledged by the side of opposition. And this is very harmful because at the point at which they are framed as being very anti-religious, even though most of the members of the LGBTQ community are not directly opposing religion, they're just not accepted by religious people, that is why they are shown as some kind of like anti-religious, they're not going to be able to get acceptance on death of the house as long as this mutual exclusivity framework works on death of the house. So that is what they are destroying uniquely in this debate, they have never responded to this framework, so therefore they already lose on that. So first, who is able to create more acceptance? As I've already mentioned, at a point at which they are not able to show by this mutual exclusivity narrative is going to change they're not going to be able to change anything about the situation of the LGBTQ community right you tell you in the very framing of our first speech that the major attack the most majority thank you the primary attack that comes to LGBTQ people is coming from the religious community on the basis that it's against their religion right so the main like pushback on the LGBTQ community is not because of their existence not because of what they are doing it is because they believe that it's against the religion because it's mutually exclusive. That is what you're uniquely destroying. Firstly, we believe that they have given you three main pushbacks on this. Firstly, that the LGBTQ movement is not going to like embrace this, right? They're already strongman in that case. No, thank you. They are already strongman in that case when they are telling you that, oh, this is going to be a religious movement. They are not going to feel safe. They are not going to be able to like feel equal. Again, this is only the public agenda that we are pushing outside of the community. And we are is going to be a religious movement. They are not going to feel safe. They are not going to be able to feel equal. Again, this is only the public agenda that we are pushing outside of the community. And we are still going to be able to co-opt the equality because we are only going to co-opt the sentences and the frameworks from the religion that is directly not clashing with the active agenda of the LGBTQ community. Secondly, they're telling that this is going to be like major fracturing because of the anti-religion sentiment. We tell you that this anti-religion sentiment only exists in the status quo, no thank you in the movement, because of the anti-religion sentiment. We tell you that this anti-religion sentiment only exists in the status quo, you know, thank you, in the movement, because of the, like, anti-LGBTQ sentiment coming from the religious movement. So at the point at which you are going to be able to destroy this kind of sentiment, this is not going to be true on the SOTA, because you are only going to support those kind of ideas, which is not contradicting the core ideas of the LGBTQ movement. So the fracturing is not going to be, like, as severe as they tell you. But we tell you that in the second speech, even if that would be the case, the LGBTQ movement. So the fracturing is not going to be as severe as they tell you. But we tell you that in the second speech, even if that would be the case,"

So they have clearly not mechanized why there could be some significant impact on deaths of the house. And thirdly, they tell you that, oh, the religious groups are going to not respond well. Again, this is conduct for the mutual excluded narrative, which they feel at your desk, right? At the point of which we take out the perception of the LGBTQ movement of being the antichrist because they are directly going against religion they are directly saying that religion is bad they are not interpreting religion as a way that is applying to them they are going to be taking out it's like very backlashy response from the religious groups on the house so we have managed to prove to you that we are going to be able to get more acceptance on also the house at the point that you destroy this argument you thought this second they tell you that intersectionality is going to be happening significantly more on House of the House because, again, the basis of intersectionality is the belief in equality, which you're going to close on House of the House. At the point at which we do so, all of the social movements that they have on House of the House are going to be still intertwined with the LGBTQ community. So you're not going to lose any kind of political capital on House of the House. But what we uniquely got is the support from some religious communities. We're also going to be subscribing to the equality narrative. So again, intersectionality is going to be significantly more dominant on us or the House. Then the response about developing countries and how it's like extremist religious coalition is not going to have like any kind of backlash after this point.

They are not going to be able to combat that as long as they do not accept these kinds of communities, as long as they do not try to target the religious community and call them into the into some level support on the LGBTQ community. What we got is more support for this kind of for the movement, and therefore more discussion on the agenda and not active sabotage by the other side of the house that is going to happen on this. So on the obligation of movement, we are clearly better because we are still keeping the core values of the LGBT community. And we are managing to co-opt some level of religious support and therefore create more discussion and obligation of the movement to push some kind of places and get more gay rights. So therefore we are very proud to propose. Thank you.

The motion requires proposition to defend more than that. It requires a proposition to get the LGBTQ movement to center reinterpreting religions within the movement. This isn't the same thing as getting rid of mutual exclusivity. Why? Because on all sides of the house, you can still say we support intersectionality, right? That you can be a gay, you can be a gay Christian, you can be a black Christian, you can be a woman who is a member of the LGBTQ movement. We can do this under the capacity that we don't take a stance on religion in general, right? That we accept you whether or not you're religious."

Their burden is a lot bigger because their burden requires the movement to go into religious authority and tell them how to properly interpret religion in a more pro-LGBTQ way. They're running away from this burden. But second, even if you believe that you don't run away from their burden, their incredibly soft case poses a trade-off with all of their impacts. We point this out to you in second because no response. The trade-off is this. It's that if they only want to highlight very few areas of similarity between the LGBTQ movement and the religious movement, then you don't get much religious buy-in, right? Because if the only thing they highlight is, oh, we both say love thy neighbor, then like no religious person is just going to buy into your movement if you only highlight very few areas of similarity. That's a crucial trade-off. But third thing I want to note at the top is that there's just a lack of illustration, right? It is still unclear at this point in the debate exactly how they want to reinterpret religion, right? Do they want religious officials to do it? Do they want members of the activists to do it? No idea from them the LGBTQ movement. First, on the authenticity of the movement."

For the LGBTQ movement to be valuable, it needs to authentically represent the views of its members. We explained to you in the top of our case that reinterpreting religion means aligning with those values. Thus, you restrict to what your movement can support. Because in order for the LGBTQ movement to support something now on Thursdays at house, they need to find some support of that thing in religious texts, right? Sure, you might find support of like gay marriage, but you might not find support in virtual fertilization, which is crucial for gay couples in order to have a kid of their own, right? Therefore, they severely restrict what the movement can support if the movement has an obligation to align with religious texts. What were their responses? Their first response is no, but we can do this softly, right? We only need to highlight the areas of similarity, like loving thy neighbor. We don't need to compromise on other values. Two responses to their response. One, there's a signaling effect, right? Because religious interpretation isn't a secular rational discussion of values. It's an argument from authority, right?

Therefore, when the LGBTQ movement supports engaging itself in reinterpretation, the prerequisite to reinterpretation is the idea that you believe that the Bible is a source of authority, because you cannot have religious arguments about who is the right interpretation unless you believe that the Bible is a source of authority. Therefore, if you believe that the Bible is a source of authority, then you just run into a lot of contradictions, right? Because if you say the Bible is a source of authority here, therefore that's why you can't, that is why we can get gay marriage. Then you also have to defend why you can get IVF, even though IVF isn't explicitly said in the Bible. But second, if their case is about highlighting similarity, I don't need, I don't know why you need to reinterpret religion in order to highlight similarity. You can highlight similarity without reinterpreting religion. Highlighting similarity is saying, look, I support loving thy neighbor. You support loving thy neighbor too. So we both support loving thy neighbor. That's what highlighting similarity is. Reinterpreting religion is your interpretation of religion is wrong. This is how you correctly reinterpret religion. So this quabble is about similarity. You can probably still find some similarity on all sides of the house. Their second response is, oh, but body positivity and other things like sexual liberty is not fundamental to the movement. Therefore, the only thing that's fundamental to the movement is about loving everyone. And religion also says you should love everyone."

                  "text": "No, body positivity is central to the movement. Why? Because it's a prerequisite of loving who you want to love, right? Sexual liberation means you can marry who you want. You can have sex with who you want. You can engage in romance with who you want. Not with the conservative notion of marriage. That is to say, one between a man and a woman and one in which you cannot have sex until you marry. So it is fundamental to the movement. Equality comes after that. So their third response is like, oh, but we can do it publicly to religious authorities. We don't have to change what happens within the movement. No, publicity is how people engage with the movement. Public events like gay pride provides, public events like social media posts is how people engage in the movement. So you can't do it publicly, but not have it affect the movement internally. It doesn't make any sense. On our side, we give the LGBTQ movement what it wants at its roots, which is liberty. And that'll be provided when you do not have to constrain yourself to religious authority. Second question, let's talk about support for the LGBTQ movement. They say religious groups will support you. Understand that their argument is contingent on an unproven premise. They need to prove why religious authorities will accept your interpretation instead of responding to you in a violent way. Because their case is contingent on the LGBTQ movement saying, this is the right interpretation, and religious people saying, you know what? I was wrong before. You're right. You know, your movement is right. I'll interpret it in the way you want me to interpret it. We think people are more likely to respond aggressively. They can concede that the LGBTQ movement is right. There's a variety of reasons for why this is the case. One, they've been taught a certain interpretation of religion for their whole life. The priests and the popes have expertise in interpreting the Bible. A random LGBTQ activist has no expertise in reinterpreting the Bible. So they will believe their traditional pope or an LGBTQ activist every day. But two, the church doesn't want to tolerate a slippery slope, right? Because they can see that their interpretation is wrong in this specific instance. It delegitimizes their power to exercise other interpretations in the future. Therefore, the upshot isn't the church will not support you. The upshot is the church will clamp down on you in more aggressive ways. Because in the status quo, you do have some level of more ambivalence within the church, right? Like Pope Francis in the status quo is relatively ambivalent about LGBT issues. He doesn't really try to talk about gay marriage. But on this house, you actively attack him. You attack the church. You tell the church, your interpretation is wrong. You need to reinterpret it using my interpretation. That is when the church is more likely to clamp down on priests, for example, who might be somewhat tolerant of LGBTQ activism in the status quo. Contrast their impact to our impact. Our impact is that you lose the liberal coalition that the LGBTQ movement is currently built towards. In the status quo, the LGBTQ movement has a coalition with the feminist movement and other minority movements. All of these other movements also oppose religion because religion also restricts their autonomy. The feminist movement opposes religion because it goes against the right to an abortion, for example, which is fundamental to their movement. Therefore, when the LGBTQ movement betrays other allies by saying, you know what, I will support religion by reinterpreting, by supporting... Did speaker disappear for everyone else? Okay, I paused the timer at 6.45. May the team members perhaps contact your teammate? Hello, can you see me? You were breaking off. Can you see me now? You were breaking off. Can you hear me? Now we can, I think. But you were breaking off when firstly asked that question. Oh, sorry. What was the last thing you heard from my speech and what's my timestamp? It's 6.45, so half a minute and a half, roughly. I think for me it was the end of the comparison between the impacts about intersectionality. The stuff about feminism, right? Yeah, yeah, you finish that one. Okay, okay, okay. Their response to this argument is that people in the movement hate religion in the status quo because the movement hates religion. No, they hate religion for their personal reasons. They believe that religion is the antithesis of the LGBTQ movement. They believe that religions will cause them trauma in their previous life. Therefore, on their side of the house, they're likely to create fracturing both within the movement and within the broader liberal coalition. This is bigger than their impact because it's a problem of probability, right? Maybe you get religious people to support you on their side, but you probably don't insofar as every other religious doctrine tells them to hate gay people. On our side, you lose the certain support of the liberal coalition when you decide to betray them by saying, I will not be pro-religion. I'll teach them how to reform their religion instead of taking a stance that is anti-religion. Our impact is more probable than theirs. Third, let's talk about religious people within the LGBTQ community. The first thing I want to say is what we told you at the top of 01, which is how much of their benefits actually has to do with the public nature of supporting religion or the public nature of reinterpreting religion. Because you can still have things like private discussion groups on all sides of the house, right? Those are things that are not related to the debate. So the debate is about gay Christians accepting themselves. They can still accept themselves by private discussion groups on our side of the house, right? Those are things that are not related to the debate. So the debate is about gay Christians accepting themselves. They can still accept themselves by private discussion groups like other gay Christians who have successfully converted. They need to defend publicity. What was our impact? Our impact was trauma, because what you eliminate for them is choice. When the movement on their side of the house takes a reinterpreting religion stance, that is when everyone within the movement has to support that in reinterpreting religious stance. They can't support a wide variety of other other things such as being pro-religion or being anti-religion on this house you give religious people trauma you prevent the escapism that currently exists in the status quo and for them the movement that was supposed to provide to them escape them is just a reminder of their old religious tendencies for these reasons we are very proud to oppose sorry about lagging out hopefully everything is clear no No worries. I would like to thank Opposition Report for that fine speech and would like to call upon Opposition Report's speaker to sum up the up-and-changers debate. You're here."

You don't have to reinterpret religion or reinterpret religious texts to say you can be religious and also a gay individual. That was also what we pointed out, especially clearly by Bowser. They need to respond to this somehow. This already points out that the impact is not really actualizing. But we also know the very best. We were very generous in this debate.

But furthermore, we also told you that reinterpreting specifically as a mechanism is seen as very sacred by religious groups that should only be done by religious authorities in their religion. So now when another movement tries to reinterpret and do things that seem very, very important, that is likely to lead to mass backlash. That's an especially important link that was never responded to. So for these reasons, we're able to prove to you why these movements will receive a lot more backlash on our side. So all they're impacting on, you know, by and from religious groups are unlikely, in fact, to get much worse on their side.

That was especially important. Impacting that was never responded to. So you proved to other best case doesn't actually like happen. Therefore, on their side, religions react in worse ways. Secondly, on vulnerable individuals, this argument on trauma was never probably responded to. And this is very important because that has a massive impact on these individuals. We told you these movements in the status quo are crucial safe spaces for individuals who were traumatized in religious groups and religious environments. On their side, you take that away when the fact that every time you go to a rally, every time you go to a topic, the center of discussion is still religion. And especially on the best case, if it's accepting religion, that's specifically traumatizing. We never heard a sufficient response.

That leads to a lot of fracturing and harms individuals within the movement, because many people within LGBT movements have very strong ideas against religion and see it as a negative thing. That leads to fracturing, but also leads to mass harms to a group that the movement is supposed to protect. That also harms vulnerable individuals. That leads to the clash in terms of very actualized impacts. Three, what are the goals of the movement? This argument took them to their very best, but they never engaged with this. And that's a big problem for them. Because we told you that even in their best case, if you get some more buy-in, it is unclear why a couple more voters who are religious is going to be the tipping point for anything. So many of their impacts aren't very clear. What we tell you is very clear. The movement needs to cater to as many people as possible, especially its most vulnerable actors who are a member of the LGBTQ community. We get that on our side when we talk about things like pride that affect much more people. Religion is relatively niche. This is important because we told you when you get change on our side, it benefits everyone, right? So even if you're religious on our side within the group, you also benefit from things like, for example, less discrimination as a whole. That benefits both our people on our side and fulfills the purpose. But furthermore, we also want you to get less fracturing, and that's also crucially important to get political change. Movements need to actualize the most important policies, and since they have limited resources on their side, centering a policy and focusing on something that doesn't affect everyone is not a good strategy for the movement to take. On our side, more people are benefited, and we get more change. For all these reasons, vote for the opposition."

You're here. panel in the status quo there is open opposition between religious individuals and the lgbtq movement someone needs to take a first step to close this gap when a religious person looks at the lgbtq movement all they say see is a movement that dislikes them a movement that is directly against them we think we need to we need we on side of the house, they can't just say that they support the same things. They need to actively stand and say, we support you. We support your ideology. We are not actively against you. We think this is a crucial difference that they need to engage with, right? We tell you what this specifically looks like. And yes, we do include reinterpreting certain ideas that are directly going against like being gay, being OK within like religious texts. We don't think that this is going to lead to extra backlash because as we tell you, these individuals who are so against gay people who are who believe that they are like they are bad. We don't think that by the movement reinterpreting this specific thing, they're going to change their mind. What they're likely to respond to and likely to change is the minds of individuals who are not like actively opposed against being gay as a lifestyle. We see this a lot in countries like for instance, Hungary, but they just don't, they just think that the movement is against them. They think that their ideology is against them. This is what we actively respond to on our side of the house. So what do we tell you on more acceptance? Note that on their side of the house, they don't really change anything, right? We think that when it comes to things like the feminists or things like individuals within the movement, they're likely to still support the core tenets of the movement, which are things like equality, which are things like less discrimination, they're still likely to vote for individuals who support these ideas, specifically because these are core concepts that they're going to support objectively, no matter what the movement is like saying. So the delta of this debate is purely religious people, right? We tell you two different layers of mechanization in first that they never directly respond to on why we're more likely to get support from religious individuals, not necessarily religious leaders, but religious individuals, right? We tell you first that in the status quo, people view gay people as their enemy, and this is partly because of their tie to anti-religious ideas, right? We think when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how they actively support it, apart from a few sentences that being gay is not okay, right? We think when the movement starts talking about how they do not oppose religion, how they actively support it, apart from a few sentences, that being gay is not okay, right? We think that what this means is we think that they support the fundamental parts of religion about love and support, that they directly support religion because it spreads these concepts. This is how animosity and opposition can be struck down on our side of the house crop does nothing to this right secondly we tell you that religious gay people are much more likely to do things like go to church on our side of the house because the movement itself doesn't actively oppose this right you're no longer like shunned by the movement this means that there's much more direct exposure for these groups to members of the movement we This also looks like what we tell you, that the movement itself is much more likely to want to directly interact with religious people because they don't view them as an enemy, right? We think that these kinds of programs don't happen on their side of the house, specifically because of this neutrality and not wanting to engage with religion. We think at this point, we are much more likely to win religious people to our side of the house, right? What this means is that we get far more support from these groups. We do not lose support from any other group, precisely because of what we tell you on why they support the same core tenets, right? We also tell you that religious people within the movement, they're not traumatized by religion itself. They're likely're not traumatized by religion itself. They're likely to be traumatized by specific individuals who have used religion as a weapon. We think that it's good for this reason as well that the movement centers religion and talks about it more because they're able to differentiate these two things and not look upon religious people as a whole, as an enemy. This again leads to much more dialogue within the movement on our side of the house, leading to much more support from religious individuals. Thank you."

First of all, what does this redefinition look like? We think that this redefinition looks like using narratives such as dressing for the male gaze, but then saying that it isn't really dressing for the male gaze, it is more about your confidence. But at the end of the day, the implicit things within these narratives are still that you're doing it so that you are observed or treated well as per the male gaze. So we think that these narratives are still inherently patriarchal. This looks like things like wearing lipstick at work, wearing high heels in corporate spaces, wanting to be a housewife, validating things like being caring above your own well-being. And we think that what this has categorically done in the status quo is that it has reduced the sub-movements within the feminist movement that are against gender roles categorically. Rather, it has given power or increased the sub-movements within the larger feminist movement that glorify these gender roles, which is to say that there is many different variations of feminism within this larger scope of monolith of feminism as a movement, and we think that some sub-movements have been impacted more unfairly by this narrative than others have been. What do we oppose then? Categorically speaking, we oppose the fact that this movement promotes the idea that this is empowering. Yes, your point. So if I do want to be a housewife, can you tell me that I'm a bad feminist or just that I have bad cases of being a housewife? No, we don't tell you anything. That's like saying, if I wear red shoes instead of blue shoes, what do you tell me? We literally don't tell you anything. We don't think that everything that you do has to have some sort of categorical value message that you send. Sometimes you just don't take stances on something, right? Just because you don't say something is empowering doesn't necessarily mean that you say something is bad or you don't have a place. That's like saying, oh, so do I have no place in the feminist movement if I wear purple shoes? Then in terms of argumentation, two arguments."

Firstly, I'm going to start by proving why this is inherently patriarchal. The reason this is inherently patriarchal is, first of all, let's understand where traditional gender norms stem from. These things really do stem from things like the male gaze, right? So what are the historical preferences in terms of what men value? And the reason this is implicitly true is if you think about it, why do you necessarily wear lipstick? Although in the current status quo, the narrative might be that this is to make you more confident, the reason that you necessarily do become more confident when you wear lipstick is because you infer that there is going to be someone in the boardroom who is a man and he might take your opinions with more credibility in the point in time that you're wearing lipstick. Which is to say that this is still ruled or powered by men to a large degree and this is largely largely still based on what appeals to men. So narratives like wear red nail polish instead of black because that is more appealing to men, that makes you a siren woman, these are all things that are entrenched in what is more appealing to men and they cannot categorically deny that. Yes, your point? So, women are not in my mind that you say, you're just not in sense. No, you do exist. In that point in time, I don't necessarily understand what your sexuality has to do with the fact that you're wearing lipstick. First of all, your point doesn't really make sense to me. But other than that, I still think that lesbians still do benefit from men finding their opinions appealing or men finding them physically attractive to a large degree, right? It is not that if you're a lesbian, there's not going to be any men in the boardroom whose attention you might benefit from."

So even given the scenario that opposition tries to posit that you're a lesbian woman, we think that there is a large degree of positive reinforcement that is garnered towards you in the case that you do buy into these gender roles, right? Which is to say that when there is this positive reinforcement, it is very, very hard to step away from this positive reinforcement at that point in time, because the moment in time that you do, you start craving it, which is to say that this is a very powerful mechanism to lock you in and ensure that you keep doing these things over and over again in a way that is implicitly coerced upon you, but you are not able to actively recognize that you are being coerced to do this, which is even more harmful because when you don't recognize that there is active coercion, it is harder for you to fight against this. But even in the instance that it might not be patriarchal and you might really do it from your own self-will, we think that this is still very important for us to oppose for a few key reasons. The first is that society already rewards traditionally feminine behaviours. How does it reward them? Compliments, attention, we think that there is also a large degree of validation that you get from media houses who look around you, posters, have attractive women wearing beautiful heels, wearing beautiful lipstick, which is to say that there are implicit expectations for you to do this. How do these implicit expectations exist? These implicit expectations exist in the forms of narratives such as you look tired if you don't wear makeup. This means necessarily that society to a certain degree is expecting that you buy into these narratives and at the point in time where you're not able to do this, society tells you to a certain degree that you are doing the wrong thing or that you are not making the right choice. What is this doing effectively tells you to a certain degree that you are doing the wrong thing or that you are not making the right choice. What is this doing effectively for you as a conclusion? This is telling you that the conclusion is that when traditional feminine narratives are given a place within the feminist movement, we are limiting choice. Why should we then oppose it? We think that we should oppose it because society already has narratives of appreciation for traditionally feminine roles. Which is to say that if their concern is that women who buy into these traditional gender narratives will not get appreciation within society, that is a dumbfounded concern. Because they already do. Like I tell you, they get validation, they get appreciation, they already have a place within society. Who is the feminist movement more important for? It is more important for individuals who don't really have a categorical space within society, who don't fit into other alternative spaces and who need feminism because that is their home, that is where they find their family, and that is where they find appreciation, that is where they find acceptance. We think that at the point in time where this space ceases to be for them, we think that they largely, largely are harmed. So the reason this is so crucially important to oppose is number one, it is inherently patriarchal, which is to say that the feminist movement promoting something that is inherently patriarchal as empowering is just principally wrong because that is again at a juxtaposition with its own ideals but number two even in the case that it is not we think that we should prioritize individuals who don't have another home which is why we think that we must oppose it. Second argument for you then has the following pieces"

It is homogenizing itself with patriarchal ideals. What does this specifically mean? It specifically means that at this point in time, the positioning of feminism as a movement is diluted because you no longer know what it stands for. Given that I've proven to you that these ideals do necessarily stem from patriarchy, I think that it is true to a large degree that now, at this point in time, the ideals of the feminist movement itself, or the position of feminist movement within the status quo is going to be diluted to a certain degree. What does this then mean? This means that the movement is going to perpetuate these ideals in many other spaces, which alienates a lot more women who don't fit into these ideals. So, thirdly then, we also think that people start seeing the movement as less valid given its diluted positioning. What are the impacts of this? We think that the impacts of this are that in the long run, we are able to reach less people. Why is this necessarily true? We think, first of all, that at the point in time that there is a large degree of diluted positioning of this movement, number one, on a policy level, this movement is just going to be seen as less valid, which means that policymakers, lobbyists are not going to be able to see conclusions that are derived from this movement and expectations that are derived from this movement as valid. But more largely, we think that there is also going to be a large degree of social opposition in the status quo, which makes it harder for people to buy into this movement.

So this looks like the fact that the feminist movement may want to empower women at the same time as seeking other specific policy aids. We don't think this sort of thing comes at the expense of that. No, thank you. But we also acknowledge that the feminist movement exists in a range of scenarios, in the developed world, in the developing world. More on that later.

I think it looks like pointing to female politicians and CEOs who are saying they can do it, they can do multiple things, they can be a mother at the same time as being powerful, rather than what I think you get on their side of the house, which is only pointing to idols who are distinctly unpatriarchal and only the women who do not buy into any of these societal pressures that we think that they are quite coerced into doing.

They say you're buying into the patriarchy as the feminist movement and so therefore you shouldn't do this. They say that because gender roles stem from bad places, we should reject all of them. Panel, I think it's quite sad that Team Nepal think women have absolutely no autonomy and not a single woman chooses to be a mother, no thank you, or chooses to have children, or chooses to do traditionally feminine things. But I think many women do choose to do these things. I think at the point at which we've already moved past the second wave feminism that they're choosing to stand behind, women do have these sorts of choices. Then they say they're coerced. But I think actually, if you're coerced into doing these things, this sort of narrative from the feminist movement is even more important. Because if women truly are coerced into having children and into buying into the patriarchal structure, then I think the least that these women deserve, when they literally have no other alternative, is the support of the movement that's supposed to represent them, right? If side propositions think women are coerced into being feminine, I think the movement should help them get away from that. I think they should help them feel empowered in the thing that they're literally apparently"

                  "text": "being forced to do. Moving on to my first argument then on how we get more buy-in to the feminist movement on our side of the house. The premise here is that in order to be maximally successful in achieving their aims, the feminist movement needs broad support. Crucially, it needs support from people who would not otherwise automatically buy-in to the feminist movement needs broad support. Crucially, it needs support from people who would not otherwise automatically buy in to the feminist movement. We think these are the sorts of people who they exclude. But we also think that other than getting buy-in for the movement as a whole, it needs to allow all women to see themselves in the feminist movement and all women to feel appreciated and that the movement is there to support them. So how do we get more support from the feminist movement on our side of the house and how do we support members of the movement more? This happens in a couple of scenarios. I think firstly it happens for women who are already in positions of power and people who have already benefited from the old narratives of the feminist movement. This looks like women who have already gained their position in their career and have been told by second wave feminism that they should be buying into things like having a job into not being feminine. I think feminist movement owes these women things like saying actually no we like now we've reached a point in society where you can be feminine and still have a job we think that you should we should let these women opt into the feminist movement we think you should give them support. But we think secondly and most importantly it's crucial for women who literally cannot not be feminine on their side of the house. We think often women who most need empowerment and support for the feminist movement are those who have to take feminine on their side of the house. We think often women who most need empowerment and support for the feminist movement are those who have to take feminine positions. This looks like women in the developing world who don't have access to jobs or high-paying positions, who literally just need help in, I don't know, securing support in their relationship. Side proposition denies them this because of the fact that it's patriarchal. They deny helping these women. They exclude them. They make them feel like the feminist movement isn't for them. It also looks like women who already in marriages, already have children, and already want things like policy for childcare, but on their side of the house, feel alienated by the movement. Because we think what their actual counterfactual is, is saying that the feminist movement is only for women who are not feminine. It's only for women, it's only for people who are not expressing these patriarchal traits that they say the feminist movement has to reject. Thirdly, we think you also get more buy-in from people at the lower level. We think you get more buy-in from children. We think on the other side of the house, when the feminist movement is seen as something super radical, when it's seen as political lesbians who are all anti-men and they're all anti-traditional patriarchal roles, we think that's the point at which, especially in conservative circles, feminism is actively demonised. People are saying it's unnatural. People are saying, oh, I'm not going to be a feminist because I think that's strange. We think at the point at which the feminist movement is able to attract the majority of women in society, who we do think generally do have pretty feminine traits because of the fact that they have been indoctrinated by the patriarchy, as they would like to say. We think that's the point at which they get more buy-in. I think that's the point at which the feminist movement is able to help more people. But what do we think the macro impacts of this and why are they so important? We think firstly and crucially you do get more policy change on our side of the house. Look, we acknowledge that electoral change in terms of feminism is often quite difficult. We think that's why this narrative is super important. We think the problem on my side of the house is you often alienate the women who have the most power. You often alienate the older women who think the feminist movement is too radical. These are the women who have money, these are the women who are most likely to turn out to vote. We think on our side of the house we improve this by making the feminist movement more palatable to these sorts of women who do actually feel like they want to be done. I'll take that for your life. Do you know why our radical stance is wrong? So your only response is that when you are radical, you get backlash. Are you really saying that we should stop doing right things because right things sometimes get backlash? No, that's not a response you have to listen to me. I'm not saying that the reason why we shouldn't do this is because of the fact that we're going to get backlash. I'm saying the reason why you should do this is because if you do say that women are indoctrinated and women do feel the need to be feminine, there are societal pressures telling them they need to be feminine. I think we should be supporting these women. I think"

Why do we think we counteract this on our side of the house? We think on our side of the house, women can be proud of the fact that they have raised a family, that they have made sacrifices, that even though they are doing traditionally feminine things, that their role is still appreciated in families. We think this impacts different groups in many, many ways. We think first, it allows women to actually get more help from men and more help from other people. Because we think on their side of the house, when femininity isn't seen as something empowering, that's the point at which men are shying away from the sorts of things that would actually help women progress out of these patriarchal positions.

Because there are other incentives to care for mothers. Because motherhood, number one, is already valid by society to a great degree, but we also don't see why feminist movements are forced to leave motherhood as a consequence of not supporting fashion. We think these two things are completely independent and therefore their just entire stance makes no sense. Let's look at further what they say, however. They tell us that most women need to be able to see themselves in the feminist movement. What does first speaker clearly tell you here? She tells you that a variety of women exist in the status quo, which is to say that some women probably want to be mothers, probably want to be housewives. But there are other women who exist, who want to do other things, who want to conform, like who don't want to conform to the already existing narratives in society. We think at this moment it becomes increasingly important for a feminist movement to be a strong idea for them, to be a strong institution for them, which is what we think side opposition does not give these women, and that is why we think we win this debate."

I think, firstly, if you're coerced into having children, I think society already gives you a lot of solace, which is to say that if my father and my husband force me to have children, they're obviously going to be happy that I have children. They're obviously going to tell me, oh, you're such a great mother. We don't really see what new impact they bring here. But secondly, they also say that women who are mothers or women who conform to these narratives are going to be locked out of jobs now because other women don't want them to get those jobs. I mean, what is the link here? I think the greater idea that all of them are women is something that overpowers the difference of them wearing lipstick or them being a mother. We don't really see the link between why we have to support people promoting lipsticks, people promoting conforming to gender identities, or people promoting being housewife is a great thing in order to support the fact that women should have more jobs. We think these two things are just logically something that they cannot claim for us. But lastly, they claim that they get more buying from children. And this is because on our side of the house, the movement somehow becomes extremely radical. Panel, this is just unfair characterization. We think we can still focus within the liberal sphere to a large degree. Why is this likely the case?

Therefore, we think largely that our approach to this debate has an untrackable yesterday. You have to do that in the traditional perception of feminine roles. Traditionally, feminine behaviours are seen as weak and detrimental to the feminist movement. Why would you keep this definition? How does this empower women? I mean, there's going to be an answer to that on Clash Analysis, but I also don't think it's as simplistic as saying you literally oppress women. I think there's more to it than that. I'll flag it up for you. But let's look at the last thing, the other things that they say here. After the buying from Children's Point, they say that you often alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, no link. They just say you alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, no link. They just say you alienate the women that are most powerful. I mean, just a call out. They don't do that. I think the movement has incentives to include those women. I think if they do not prove to us why these rich women, in all instances, are women who promote the identities or who promote the narrative that we oppose in today's motion, if they are able to prove that, we are ready to bite this bullet. But insofar as they are unable to prove that all rich women are women who promote the narrative that we oppose in today's motion, if they're able to prove that, we're ready to bite this bullet. But insofar as they're unable to prove that all rich women are women who like promote the identity or promote the ideas that we are trying to oppose today, we think we can still claim a lot of the benefits that comes from these women. Lastly, and this is like their hair, maybe they say that this leads to better treatment of women because historically, women are seen as financially inferior and they go on like a very disconnected link and how mothers are left out again structurally we think the incentives to not speak out against things like wearing lipstick going like wearing how he was conforming to being housewives and being mothers had to very very independent things we don't think we leave them out but the more important clash and this is i've gone to rebuilding at this point because i think their case just doesn't make sense because it's so like, you guys are going to be like political lesbians, right? We think the more likely comparative is that there exists a spectrum of women in society, which is to say that some women want to be housewives, but some women also want to not adhere to these social constructs.

How do we deal with both of these stakeholders that are on our side of the house? Firstly, let's analyze the stakeholders that they say we leave out. We think institutions like the family, institutions like society have already accepted patriarchal norms to a very, very great degree. What does this look like? This means that if you want to be a housewife, if you want to be a mother, if you want to be a traditional woman, so to speak, society already accepts you to a very, very great degree. Which is to say, they don't tell you, you're a bad mother because you conform to the ideas that we set and we think are good. If you conform to those ideas, you, by definition, become good to those people. You become a virtuous woman to those people. Now, what are the most vulnerable women in these instances then? We think the most vulnerable actors here are the women who do not want to conform to those narratives. What this means then is that they probably do not want to be mothers. Now, in this instance, we think a feminist movement serves as a unique institution that is contrarian to the narratives that already exist in society. Which is to say that even if adhering to patriarchal norms is something that is not harmful, we still maximize choice. Why is this the likely scenario? Because I told you earlier, in order to make a choice, you also need an institution to be able to conform to you that you are going to be able to make that choice to empower you. We think then the feminist movement has a principal obligation to be this unique powerhouse for this movement. At the very point in time you start conforming to traditional feminist norms again. We think you get an unnecessary burden of like promoting these women who are already taken care of by society. We think their main focus should be on those other women that are uniquely left out in the society. That is what we argue. Therefore, we think that we do not leave any women out and we take care of these people who want to do other things, who do not want to adhere to society. Here they conveniently tell us that we're going to be leaving a lot of women behind, but as I've already pointed you out, pointed you out earlier, their contentions are merely superficial because there is no structural reason behind it. Lastly then, before I end my speech, I just want to give a bit of illustration on how these feminist movements then evolve. We think that permeation of their narrative in society is something that is also very, very important, which is to say that if they have one solid narrative, it is much more easier to follow them as compared to if it is very, very diluted. So on their point on children, I don't really see why a child is going to be able to pick and choose between 100 different feminist movements while children on our side are basically going to be, I don't know, anti-political lesbians. Therefore, we think it's very, very simple. You need to ground yourself in reality. You need to be able to maximize the choices for this woman. Vote side proposition. Thank you. Proposition 2,"

So you have to tell all the women who want to wear high heels, who want to wear makeup, who want to be housewives, who want to be mothers, or who are forced or pressured by society into doing all of those things, that they are, no thank you, engaging in something that is not empowering, that is not feminist, that makes them not a good feminist, that makes them not part of the movement. Second, they claim that they don't have to alienate all of the women who want to be housewives. Note first that this is not just a trivial debate about wear and makeup. This also encompasses traditional behaviours and roles. See becoming a housewife, see becoming a mother. But also we think you necessarily do alienate these women when you say what you are doing is not empowering, when you refuse to expand your definition of empowering to encompass the things that these women choose to do. So that's their burden in this debate. I think they've already lost because of how badly they've tried to shirk it.

First, let's challenge the premise that all of these ideas are a result of wanting to seem more palatable to men. You might wear lipstick because you like it. It might be because it makes you feel more confident. It might be because you want to attract other women. There's nothing innate about, say, wearing the colour pink that is associated with women. Indeed, in the Victorian times, it was marketed primarily to young boys. But look, even if we say, maybe I do like nail polish because the patriarchy has told me to, A, I'm still getting utility from wearing that nail polish as a woman. But B, let's be comparative. Because note the burden that Olivia brings you in first, that they literally do not engage with. She says that their world looks like the second wave feminism that dominated before this contrasting narrative was introduced. Their world looks like telling women it's not empowering to wear makeup. Instead, you want to step outside of these worlds deliberately. The only thing that is empowering for you is to behave more like a man. That is the point at which you get people like Margaret Thatcher from the country of England, who stood up and said, what has women's live ever done for me, who wore shoulder pads and made her voice sound deeper so that she could be more respected because she would seem more like a man. So their world is not maybe about appealing to men, but it is about imitating to men. So we think even in their best case, they are still appealing to the patriarchy in their world. But even if you don't buy this, let's challenge the idea that on"

                  "text": "principle we shouldn't support this and therefore they win this debate. This is purely an assertion that the priority of the feminist movement ought to be ideological purity. We think that the aim of a feminist movement is not just to stand for equality, but to achieve it too. So we're happy to make some sacrifices if we get more utility for women. For example, we would say it is a good idea to have a 30% quota for women in Parliament, even if that's not a 50% quota, because at least you're achieving something for women, at least you're getting some utility. So I think we've taken down this argument, which they themselves established as their path to victory in this debate. But even so, which side gets more support? They shoo on this argument to the last minute of their first speech, and they pretty much drop it in second. But they claim that on our side, we alienate women who do not conform. Three responses. First, this is purely assertive, because we don't think it's necessarily true that more women want to adopt the masculine corporate mould of being a woman rather than being feminine. Probably different women prefer different things at different times. But many women on either side of the house are going to be either pressured into following these social roles or they don't want to feel rejected by the feminist movement when they do. So we think they also have to engage with the fact that they alienate women. Second, we think when you are less extreme, you say that more people can engage. Because unlike them, we don't have to stand behind labelling a certain set of behaviours as disempowering. We can say that we redefine these behaviours as empowering, while also accepting that other choices can be empowering too. Third, we think that often the women we support on our side are the most vulnerable, who are coerced into appealing to this feminine mould of being. I'm going to expand on that more later in my extension. We say, by contrast, we're able to get more women involved in the feminist movement on our side. First, they say, well, there might be women who don't like the kind of thing you're standing for on our side. I think I've dealt with that already. But second, and this is a really strange claim, they say the feminist movement does not owe you solace if you are a woman who appeals to society's model of what a woman should be. Because you already get that solace from society. Panel, we just don't think this is true at all. Women in the developing world might appeal to the patriarchy's idea of what an ideal woman should be. That doesn't mean they're getting maternity leave. That doesn't mean they're getting reproductive rights. That doesn't mean they're getting the kinds of benefits we think they deserve. So we think we get more support from more women in our world. But we also get better treatment of women in our world because of all of the analysis that Olivia brings you against, you know, engagement. When she tells you how in their world they support bad narratives about women that say you have to be more masculine or otherwise you're a bad feminist. They support bad narratives about femininity, behaviours that label as feminine, that means that traditionally feminine professions are devalued on their side of the house. That if men decide that they want to help with the washing up once in a while, that is also labeled as bad, that is labeled as weakness because it is associated with femininity. So they get less respect for women, they get less respect for women's choices, and they get less buy-in from the movement from men. We think already we're winning this debate. But look, before I go on, I'll take that one. In a room full of people who always say they're women for the male, to appeal to their male gaze, you would get more support if your woman had been up here by the principles that govern the male gaze. Is that right or wrong in your sense of the word? Look, we think that if we get more rights for women, if we get more maternity leave, if we get more reproductive rights, we're kind of happy to stand behind that. Like, sure, respectability politics might not be palatable, but we think it certainly does win you votes and it wins you actual change. Now, let's talk about the women who they claim are already catered to by society, so don't need feminism. Contrary to what they tell you, we think these are actually the most vulnerable women, because the women who are coerced into making the choices that they label as traditional femininity are often those who have the least power to opt out. They are those who are the most vulnerable and need the most change. How do we shift the priorities of the feminist movement to help them in our world? Three reasons. First, the feminist movement wants to empower women. So when you tell feminists that it's empowering if you choose to be a wife or a mother, they're going to advocate for making it easier for more women to make that choice. Second we decrease stigma around wanting to adhere to these roles so women no longer feel like bad feminists for advocating for these policies to saying please make it easier for me to get childcare. But third in our world there is a narrative that marriage or motherhood ought to be empowering. In their world panel there's an expectation that it's innately damaging. So you hold your husband to a lower standard, you accept that you won't get help for PND because you think they need the side of the house. That's just going to be an innately disempowering experience. So in our world, more feminists advocate for things like maternity leave that make it possible for women to have children and remain in the workplace or affordable childcare to make motherhood easier. Notice how highly you should weigh this in the debate. Because so many women want to be mothers either way. We help that vast majority of women around the world. Second, this is often a prerequisite to the benefits they want to talk about, because it's only when you get maternity leave that you can then have a corporate job. And third, we think this is specifically useful for the most vulnerable women who are coerced into having children on either side of the house. At least in our world, we get them some protection. We get"

We tell you that the redefinition probably looks like the feminist movement arguing that it is good and it is empowering and it gives you power to dress for the male gaze because you look good on camera, for example. You want to be a housewife? That is empowering because you're a girl boss and whatnot. Things like media that is dominating the culture of how women think. How women think that if they are staying at home, they are being empowered, they are running the world. The clarification that should come here explicitly is that the motion reads opposes the attempts of the feminist movement. We are not opposing the belief as a result.

Secondly, it is still controlled by men in implicit forms, like when you give validations by appreciating a woman for wearing the reddest lipstick that you've ever seen in your life. So they cannot argue that now the women control it, because you're only editing a part of the narrative. The fact that lipsticks look good on women came from the male gaze.

Firstly, there is no choice that is given to you. You're limiting the choice. The choice not to wear lipstick is not present when the feminist movement, who was supposed to be the only avenue for liberation against patriarchy for the vast majority, tells you that it is in fact empowering and therefore you're not supporting the movement when you do not wear a lipstick on your lips.

We have clearly won this. Second clash, then, on the harms to the movement on an overall basis. Let's tell you what, we have told you what happens on two levels. One, there is a diluted messaging because of the way that this narrative interacts with the narratives of patriarchy. Patriarchy says something, this narrative says, oh, some things of patriarchy are good. When in reality, this movement was supposed to be a direct opposition of patriarchy because this is the only ground of liberation. Because the opposing ideal is accepted, now there's a diluted version of messaging. There are no clear boundaries that are set, for example, or maybe you just alienate women as a result of accepting a lot of these changes. But secondly, there's a change in the stance that is adopted by the feminist movement overall against patriarchy people now become more accepting of the male gaze for example in feminist circles so they influence other decisions of other feminists within the movement yes I'll take that point tell them they're empowered and they have the power to raise up against this patriarchy who completely reject them. Thank you for your concern. It is really funny how they asked this POI in my third speech. Firstly, this does not come out in their speech. Secondly, even if that were to be true, that people in developing countries are forced to stay at home, we tell you that it is logically flawed because these people are the least affected people by the narratives of the feminist movement. The reach of the feminist movement is predominantly in the western or more liberal spaces, for example. Even if it exists in the third world countries, it does not really affect to a large extent to the women who are being forced to stay at home because ideally they do not have access to feminist gateways, therefore that is happening to them.

Secondly, you're seen as an active harm to the movement so you're an outcast. And thirdly, billboards advertise to you that you are not empowering enough. There is a buy-in reduction that comes after this because the goal of the feminist movement is to oppose and change patriarchal norms and this is directly contradicted. Therefore, you lack political potency. To this we hear a weird response. They tell you that there's going to, people are, more people in their side are going to push for maternity leaves and, I don't know, paid leaves for other reasons as well.

This debate instead happens on the way that the feminists are structured within these parliaments. So two harms result in comparing our cases.

Because what she told you is that the priorities of the feminist movement are shifted on our side, when women are more likely to be empowered to lobby for things like better maternity leave. They threw out a lazy response in the last ten seconds of their last speech, which is that both sides are going to push for maternity leave on either side of the house. This ignores the nuance of Maya's analysis, because on our side of the house, you don't feel ashamed for saying, I want to be a mother, and I want maternity leave, so that i can fulfill my goal of being a mother and stay at home for a particular period of time at that point given that the feminist movement is likely to be advocating for quite a lot of things it's only then that the policies that push for things like maternity leave actually get higher up on the agenda this was really really important and can win the debate outright firstly because it was logically prior to their benefits of getting women who are locked out of opportunities in for example stem"

Patriarchy looks a lot thinner. Let's then talk about protecting women. So their main push here is that you galvanise these gender roles and that these gender roles are definitionally against the patriarchy. They give three reasons for this. The first is that this is rooted in things like the male gaze and that men are the ones who value things like wearing lipstick. A couple of responses here. Firstly, okay, maybe men once liked women wearing makeup and thought they looked pretty, but women now value wearing makeup and they like feeling pretty. They like walking out the door and knowing that they are projecting an image to the world that they want to project, that they feel confident in projecting, they feel comfortable in their skin doing so. So their claim really boils down to men valued women looking pretty first. And I don't think they would claim that the feminist movement should reject everything that men first valued, that the feminist movement should reject knives because men were hunters first and valued knives before women. Their claim just really doesn't make sense on a principled level. But secondly, and this deals with the second mechanism they give you on how these things are still controlled by men, redefinition carried out by the feminist movement is an active process. So yes, once lipstick was valued by men, but women can now say, here's how lipstick empowers me. And you get different narratives arising to the forefront of the feminist movement. So we're able to reclaim this control from men. And note that if it was true that these things like lipstick are still controlled by men, this is still going to be the case on their side insofar as they can't stop people from wearing makeup so what we do is we allow women's voice to dominate the conversation"

But secondly, if it is true that all people are being coerced into wearing lipstick and wearing makeup, we think that people at least feel better empowered when the feminist movement is telling them that you can wear your lipstick with pride and that you are a powerful woman when you wear lipstick and you're not just an insecure woman. The last thing I want to note, though, is that the most damaging thing for women is being deprived of choice. The reason why the male gaze is such a bad thing is because the male gaze originated from when men put women in pretty dresses and they gave them no way of opting out of that and they just looked at them and they just wanted to consume them like they were objects. Nepal has stuck in the past. Times have moved on. So there are three different scenarios that I want to go through to prove why choice is actually maximised on our side. Firstly, if I want to, for example, enter the STEM world, which is the push that we get at the end of their second speech and isn't really resurrected, and I can enter the STEM world because I live in a developed country, for example, I probably will do that when I decide of a house. There's both incentive and capacity. Secondly, if I can enter that world and I wanted to, but now I don't because of the shift to, because of the shift to, for example, saying that staying at home is okay, we think that's fine, because I'm able to access my preferences, I'm able to realize that maybe going into that corporate world wasn't the right thing for me. And actually staying at home is the right thing for me. And the third context is that at least like if i can't go into that stem world if i can't be a corporate lawyer and i want to at least i now feel more empowered when the feminist movement is willing to take me on board at least people are more likely to respect me the last thing they say then is that the feminist movement the feminist movement doesn't need to do this because these things are actually valued by society this is just largely untrue because as being a stay-at-home mother in today's context isn't free isn't isn't appreciated it's vilified by other women because it's women at the top of the corporate chain who say that i've jumped so many hoots you haven't i'm superior to you it's by men who get home after work and expect women to listen to them expect that they've had a tiring day that women have done nothing and that women who are just structurally inferior them. And even talking about their example of makeup, if you're wearing it, you're seen as insecure. We're far more likely to help women, but note also, we're far more likely to get men supporting the perception of women, because when men"

Yes? What do you think happens when there are no attempts women who want to go into these traditionally feminine roles and they don't get to do so on their side of the house because they feel locked out of the feminist movement because they have to make a choice between actually accessing their preferences and joining the feminist movement and all of the community that you want to claim on your side. Lastly, let's talk about buy-in because we told you we got more support. Firstly, because of the fact that there are women in the developing world who feel like the feminist movement is now for them. They say that you'll already feel the sense of solace. This isn't true because the feminist movement tells these women that you're inferior because you're a housewife. This is incredibly harmful for them. Solace comes and buy-in comes when the feminist movement tells these women that you can be a feminist too. We also told you about conservative countries where feminism is demonised, where feminism is seen as radical. We're likely to mitigate that perception and change it and bring people who were otherwise being locked out of the feminist movement into the movement in the first place. Even if you're unsure as to who gets more support, know that people are probably unlikely to be alienated from the development of the people they want to"

First, we told you we do not have to judge these women's choices because we are not saying that we do not want women who do not step into these traditionally feminine roles to be empowered. Rather, this was a debate exclusively about how we approach these types of feminine roles. Do we redefine them as empowering or not? Do we accept what proposition tells us that they ought to be looked down upon? Or do we say that they are actually a legitimate choice? So we don't have to tell women who don't opt into this that they're doing something wrong. But second, we told you that if you have the desire and the capacity to step outside of these boxes, you're probably a feminist anyway, you're probably already relatively privileged, you're probably already making that free choice to yourself on either side of the house. By contrast, we told you this debate is about redefining these things as empowering. Note that we. So they have to accept telling women that it is not defined as empowering on their side of the house. They have to accept telling women that they are doing something wrong by the feminist movement, that they are not empowering themselves, that they are being bad feminists. But also just note how we gave you a feminist history lesson up and down the bench. We told you about how the comparative they have to stand behind in their world is second-wave feminism and that told women these choices were illegitimate. They never engaged with that. But look, even if you don't buy any of our other things, we think this clash wins us the debate because we prove a critical mass of women on our side. We think that gets actual better policy. But finally, which side gets better treatment for women? What did they say on this clash? Nothing. Panel, just check your intuition. Like if one team literally walks into a debate about the feminist movement with no positive claims on how this makes life better for women, I think that should be a pretty clear gut check that they're not winning this debate. But we gave you three clear paths to how this makes women's lives better. One, women are told that their choices are empowering. They are able to feel included. They are able to feel not like they're being shamed every day for being bad feminists. Second, because femininity is insignitized. So you can go into a female-dominated profession, you can be a housewife, you can ask your husband to help with the chores, and those things are not seen as weak. Those things are not seen as reprehensible and less worthy of respect in our society. And finally, know how they fail to engage with my argument, how we get better treatment of women, because this is about what the feminist movement chooses to prioritise, and it's only in our world that we get respect for these choices and therefore the feminist movement facilitating them. So because we actually make life better for the millions of women around the world who want to be housewives, who want to adhere to these expectations,"

We told you that the most important women within the context of this debate are women who do not have alternative safeties to fall back upon. So women who did not receive any validation from society, women who did not have any other support circles within external society, these are the women that we should care most about. We were happy to concede that even if this makes the movement radical to a certain degree, this radicalization is not a completely negative thing insofar as that these individuals who are benefited from the radicalization are the individuals who need to accrue these benefits the most, which is to make the larger point that if they get these benefits, we still make the world a better place at the end of the day. What did they then tell you? We told you that the people who conform to these traditional narratives already have society's support. There's two instances here. They try to argue on women who don't exist within liberal spaces. They tell you that women who exist in developed countries are most affected by this narrative. The problem with them making that claim is particularly and categorically that these women are unaffected by the narratives of feminism in the first place. My mother exists in a third world country. She speaks no English. She literally does not care what happens to the feminist movement. She does not care whether the movement calls her empowered or does not call her empowered because she doesn't care about the movement. She doesn't know what the movement is. The movement doesn't treat her. When the movement doesn't treat her, I don't necessarily see why the value calls or the judgment calls that the movement takes about her status as an individual is so crucially important because that is literally what the entire case has been contingent on. They are going to reach women in the developed world and they are going to call them empowered, solving their problems. We do not see the mechanism for how they end up reaching them."

If you already think that wives and mothers are empowered, what is your incentive at that point in time to ensure better regulations for them, better maternity leaves for them?

Rather, we believe in ensuring that we can state the mechanisms to ensure that that title becomes accessible to them at some point of time in the future, which means that we are able to maximize change just because it is going to be easier for us to advocate under our ideology. Now, they try to wash away our entire principle on why ideological purity is important. However, this principle now becomes important under this clash of who maximizes change. The only point in time that you are able to maximize change is the point in time where you are able to ensure ideological purity. Why is this so necessarily important? Because when there is no ideological purity, the movement literally does not know what it stands for. When there is a lot of differentiation and radicalization within the movement literally does not know what it stands for. When there is a lot of differentiation and radicalization within the movement it is not a cohesive theoretical movement to follow. We think that at that point in time we end up losing a lot of arguments because we literally can't even agree implicitly within each other which is to make the larger point that if you care to make any sort of change if you care for any sort of utility and if you care for people who are actually affected by the movement, vote proposition."

Proposition is the style that stands for all women and for that reason we're so proud to propose. Before I forward two substantive arguments within this speech, onto our set of big things. Firstly, what does a world where the feminist movement promote the maximization of individuals look like? We think it is one where we prioritize things like choice feminism. So there are two main defining characteristics underneath this. One, individuals in every aspect of society are left to decide what is best for them. So for instance, when it comes to social interactions, we'd be perfectly fine with women weaponizing the patriarchy for their own benefit. Or when it comes to things like economic enfranchisement, we will also be fine with women cursing a job promotion, even if it comes at the expense of another woman. Secondly, there's respect for the individual choices that individuals make. So for example, when our political opinions divulge, that is acceptable, we don't need to condemn women for it. Secondly, what is the nature of the feminist movement in the status quo? Three things. One, I'd like to point out the feminist movement is experiencing an unprecedented level of power in the status quo as a result of all-time awareness regarding necessity for things like gender equality. But two, not that many of the things that are fundamental for basic living standards, for example, marriage equality and voting rights, have already been achieved in the status quo, so there isn't as much as a need for solidarity as opposition may point out. Lastly, the biggest hurdles that the feminist movement experiences now are no longer collective systems of oppression, but rather individualistic, and we only think it's under a paradigm where we empower individual empowerment, where that can be dealt with."

                  "text": "Lastly, not that this debate isn't about the instances where what is good for the individual and the collective alliance, because on either side that would be symmetric. What we need to focus on is that when individual empowerment is perceived to come at the expense of solidarity, that is where the trade-off happens on the side of opposition. Two arguments can be reached. Firstly, a principle on how the maximization of individual empowerment best deals with the diverse circumstances of women, and secondly, why individual empowerment overcomes the hurdles to a success that women face. Only first argument, three parts. First of all, not that the patriarchy's enforcement of oppression is varying, so I'd just like to preface this argument by saying that gone are the days where all women are affected in the same way by coercive structures. Why is this the case? We think it's because the patriarchy's imposition of oppression is no longer universal but in fact it's subjective. To illustrate, for example, women who are conventionally attractive in the status quo are treated as sexual objects by men, but the same women who might not fit the norms of conventional beauty aren't able to enjoy things like pretty privilege. So what this shows is that social expectations have evolved to the point where oppression is individualised, and we think the best way to combat it is to allow individuals to pursue the avenues of empowerment that they deem are most suited for their circumstances. Secondly, we think solidarity on their side, as espoused by the feminist movement, merely extends the oppression that women face. Why is this the case? Well, in order for them to have things like collective solidarity, three things happen. Firstly, all women are presumed to have to operate on a collective in order to save individuals who might not know what is best for them. So what you do essentially is that you homogenise what is best for all women. So for example, a woman who chooses to don the hijab is considered to be oppressed, and individuals who might opt into things like sex work by her only fans are perceived to not want to do it. It's merely coercive. Why is this problematic? Secondly, they would institute policies that come at the expense of other women. So for example, the justification for banning things like the hijab is that it's anti-feminist and that all women are actually coerced into wearing it. The problem here that we want to highlight is that more often than not, the most privileged women who are often white and wealthy get to dictate what is best for all women because what is inherently tied to the notion of solidarity is that it entrenches a savior complex. Finally, in order to do things like maintain solidarity, there's a necessity to demonize any women who don't fit into what the collective ought to do. So you on the side of opposition want to push everyone into the same agenda in order to deter individuals who might want to opt out of it, need to do things like demonize any anomalies and that is seen exactly on the side of opposition when the movement does things like stigmatize sex workers by saying that they are coerced into it and they don't actually want to do it. It's extremely discriminatory towards them. Finally, not only the purpose of the feminist movement is to empower individuals, and insofar as the first two parts of the argument have proven that they cannot get that change that is tailored to the individual, their world actually fails women. What happens on our side when we do things that prioritize agency? One, individuals aren't shamed for pursuing things that divulge from what the collective ought to know. But secondly, because we think that individuals are the best arbiters at ascertaining what is the best form of empowerment for themselves, they are more likely going to access it on their side, compared to those when they have to compromise, and some women are inevitably going to get traded off on their side. But before I go on to the second argument, sure."

                  "text": "On to the second argument explaining why individual empowerment overcomes the hurdle to a success that women face in the status quo. Firstly, I'd like to characterize the political status of the feminist movement in the status quo. So although it may be controversial to consider yourself a feminist, we have already amassed enough numbers in doing things like voting legislation into effect, garnering baseline protection for women. So what this shows is that any critical mass that opposition wants to talk about that is only achieved via solidarity is no longer necessary for the feminist movement. What we need to do instead is to combat how stereotypes that manifest on a case-by-case basis, which a narrative of solidarity uniquely cannot cater to, because you aren't focusing on the individual, you make all women focus on one thing. Secondly, look at all the labels that incapacitate women are actually combated under our narrative. And I'd like to highlight something here, which is that individual empowerment under a capitalistic system, which exists on both sides of the house, by the way, will always come at the expense of someone else because resources are zero-sum and someone will always have to lose out. So we don't care if the structure is contributing to stereotypes. What we uniquely prove is how our narrative can deal with these stereotypes, but they can't. How are women empowered on our side? Three things. One, when we don't shame women from prioritising individual upliftment, we think that is when they're more willing to accept things like job promotions, without feeling a sense of guilt that the feminist movement says that you have deprived another woman of that opportunity. Shame on you. But suddenly, traits associated with men no longer become exclusive to men only when women are also able to ascend to positions of power. So for example, a woman is no longer considered bossy. She can also be considered a leader when she is the CEO of a company. But thirdly, for those in the most vulnerable positions in society, what we tell these individuals is that the only obligation they owe is to them themselves and they don't need to sacrifice more in order to be considered a good feminist. What we tell these individuals is that the only obligation they owe is to them themselves and they don't need to sacrifice more in order to be considered a good feminist. Here is the comparative that opposition will have to defend. We think their rate of progress is actually far slower. Why? Three reasons. One, whenever a woman has the opportunity to ascend the corporate ladder on their side, the movement tells her she should wait because if she accepts this promotion, she deprives another woman of that opportunity. So certainly, on that, we think there's less ascension to power because resources are spent on attempting to uplift everyone and their inevitably rationed on their side. Lastly, in their best case, when there are women who land into powerful positions, you don't spotlight these individuals because their participation contributes to oppression. Finally, we think opposition forwards an extremely damaging perception of the movement, that we are all the same, we have to fight for the same thing, but we don't suffer from this because our narrative is one that's focused on how all individuals deserve the ability to individually empower themselves."

Two, rewarding giving back to feminism by glorifying activists like Malala Yousafzai. Three, telling people that they should never pursue individual development at the cost of other women. So I want to make something very clear. Our narrative does not tell women to only pursue success when other women would get it because that would be absolutely absurd right if you were to tell a woman that she cannot take a promotion even if she's been given it just because another woman can get it but what it does tell you is that you should not do so at the cost of solidarity so you should never undercut another woman to get a promotion you should never try to act hyper feminine and outdo your feminist sisters to be able to get that promotion it's quick rebuttal before argumentation.

I'm going to flip their claim. It is their side that cuts out sex workers and people who wear the hijab because there is no incentive for a white woman to feel solidarity with the people on the ground. And fundamentally, you as a person in privilege, when you do not cut across the aisle and recognize that that woman is your sister, have an incentive to buy into that privilege. White women who benefit from the stereotyping of black women as hyper-aggressive continue to reinforce that stereotype on their side of the house because it explicitly benefits them. Our side is more likely to support these people because it is about doing what is in all of your best interest. So doing things like improving the rights of sex workers is something that will happen on our side of the house because you have solidarity to do so. Their second argument is flawed."

Second mechanism, people are less likely to identify as feminist because it hurts them. I agree with Arjun when he says we live in patriarchal societies, but what does that mean for you when you identify as a feminist? If identifying as a feminist means you have less access to opportunities, their side would also say it is very likely, and women are likely to believe, that you shouldn't identify as a feminist openly in the instances where it makes your job prospects worse off because people think of you as worse off. So just less people buying into feminism. But three, it marginalises very vulnerable women because on their side they push the burden on individuals. To be considered a valid member of the feminist movement, you need to be successful. On our side, solidarity feels much more achievable because all you need to do is create a community. All you need to do is be a woman and be part of the movement and that is enough. Their side is vulnerable, even if this is not the narrative, it can easily be misrepresented to put pressure on an individual and alienate them from the movement. Second level of this argument, while even if they is not the narrative, it can easily be misrepresented to put pressure on an individual and alienate them from the movement. Second level of this argument, why even if they get by, it doesn't result in meaningful success. Two reasons. One, in a world where you focus on individual development, you are less likely to question the metrics of development in the pursuit of it. What does this mean? It looks like women in the workplace being so focused on climbing up the corporate ladder that they do so by things like playing up their appearance, playing into hyper feminine stereotypes without questioning whether or not that hurts the actions or hurts the needs of other women.

The problem then is that it is these women that become the face of the feminist movement. It is them that we are able to dictate inside policy and ignore issues like police brutality when they take up the vast majority of the talking time that the feminist movement gets. This flips their first argument of why they can care about minority issues. Why then is the counterfactual of solidarity good? One, the feminist movement doesn't just value individual success, but your ability to help other women. This shifts the conversation away from CEOs towards activists and away from girl boss culture. Two, women are less likely to be alienated. Having to do success on your own is fundamentally isolating. This is problematic because even when women are suffering the same amount as each other, their side is one that tells them you still have to compete and cannot confide in each other. It is our side that creates a feeling of community. That means women are less likely to leave the feminist movement when they fail. Three, women themselves feel more valued. Individual development is extremely difficult to access. Now when you are just a member, you are considered far more valuable. The importance of this argument is simple."

I want to note that individual success is extremely hard. Women have been structurally locked out of access to capital because of historical inheritance. They've been locked out of opportunities because of sexist hiring laws and they've been locked out of access to education. All of these are structural issues that you cannot fix individually on your own. Why then does PROC make it more difficult? One, to succeed in the workplace, you cannot rely on other women because they are your competitors. Your only alternative then is to buy into patriarchal norms, which creates a vicious cycle where if you have bought into patriarchal norms, you tell other women the only way they can succeed is by also buying into patriarchal norms and reinforcing the patriarchy. Two, it encourages complacency because you feel that just by being successful on your own as a CEO, you have done enough.

Because if we accept the characterization that the feminist movement is perhaps the globe's most diverse and intersectional political movement, we think that individual empowerment is the key principle that unites these disparate groups and their various lived experiences. So, two responses here. One, all the attempts on solidarity on opposition necessitate a selfless and thus self-sacrificing perspective on feminism.

It is thinking, believing that all women are just like you, prioritizing all of their suffering. And this is important because maximizing individuals' benefits means that you want all individuals to be able to reach that kind of individual growth as well. And we think we are then able to protect all women. In a world of diverse oppression, opposition forces the arbitration between subjective and different suffering. And that is where opt-out actually occurs. Because there is no obligation for anyone to identify as a feminist. But if you tell women that the claims to political strength exist, right? So let's say the cost of voting for a party at the expense of your own exists anyway, insofar as the cost symmetrically exists, the difference is about the messaging to push people who want to do that. So we tell individuals everybody is suffering and we make them recall their own visceral suffering to sympathize with somebody else. Our president tells you we don't care about your suffering because you need to care about somebody else instead and it is that messaging that pushes most women away from the movement. But moving then on to the concept of intersectionality, we tell you about the white savior complex, opposition says you perpetuate the patriarchy. We are going to weigh this in two ways based on their own analysis. Firstly, if they say that women are selfish, then they will believe that they themselves know best, which means that even in opposition's best case, even if the women end up helping other women, we say that because they do it from a lens of privilege, it is not an inherently beneficial thing for opposition to claim. So for instance, enforcing things like not wearing the hijab, or forcing women to go to work when they want to be stay-at-home mothers, these are all legitimate choices that women can take. I can self-actualize from being a mother just as I can from being a corporate woman, but it in fact exacerbates oppression and hampers autonomy of individuals when women are the one enforcing that onto other women. So even if they help, they don't use their own resources and that harms individuals. And I think it's actually quite offensive for opposition to say that all the developing nations are like vulnerable women, can't uplift themselves if there is no white woman standing there to help them. Surely they have their own resources, they have their own movement. But this is about the prioritization of those resources, and opposition doesn't allow you to do that because they enforce a liberal form of feminism onto women who don't want it. But secondly, even if they want to help individuals, we think that help only comes when you respect the individuals who need it. Opposition tells you that they already believe in the patriarchy. The women who want to be mothers, they're not real women. They've just been brainwashed by the patriarchy to want to be a mother. They don't actually want these things, but we think it's a legitimate choice for women to make, and we actually respect these decisions. Therefore, we get the best form of intersectionality on the other side of the house. Before I go on point,"

                  "text": "On your side, you would say it is bad to sexualise women in all instances when it is empowering for some women to do that on our side. If it is true that there are certain women who are structurally more vulnerable, you need to prove to me why that instance and that solution is applicable to all women, the vulnerable women, the majority of women. We don't think that there's that kind of universal solution, which means that is why you must vote for proposition. But secondly, how does this lead into the purpose of the feminist movement? Two things as well. One, I think when we talk about the internal differences within different women in the movement, we need to know that a pretty woman who ends up succeeding is still a woman, and if they say there's a patriarchal society, then they are still a pretty woman who is being oppressed. Principally, we don't think that the movement should tell you and shame you for being successful just because you wanted to survive. In a society that necessitates your survival, if opposition characterization is true, and the patriarchy is so pervasive and so oppressive, it is still horrible for them to force a woman to give up the positions of power or to use them as battering rams for political success insofar as they are still suffering. Relatively, yes, they might be more privileged, but they are still suffering and the point of the movement isn't to instrumentalize members so that other people can succeed by virtue of the failures of the patriarchy. But secondly, for opposition to assign the success of a woman purely to their beauty is offensive because that just implies that absent pretty privilege, they cannot succeed. Our character education told you that in a meritocratic society, all capable individuals will likely advance and they will likely be successful. If the corporation wants to make more money, they will pick the person who can make them the most money, who will be the most meritocratic individual. Women will succeed on our side regardless of whether or not pretty privilege exists. The difference then is becomes whether or not we can use these women in positions of power to upend the stereotypes that opposition talks about, which means now it's no longer about structural change. It is about making sure that masculine traits or hyper-feminine traits no longer exist. On our side, there is no such thing as a masculine trait because all women who are competent are just women. They are not masculine women. They are not successful women. They are just women. And it is on our side of the house that we empower individual empowerment, not hyper-feminine traits, which opposition has still failed to characterize. But secondly then, on the damaging rhetoric on opposition, I think opposition tells you that there is something universally different about being a woman, that they have a unique obligation to each other by virtue of them being born with double X chromosomes. And that is harmful because insofar as opposition wants to talk about allyship, wants to talk about universality of the feminist movement, that can only happen when we say, feminism is about equality, feminism is about all individuals. Feminism is the most intersectional political movement there is. That is why we are anti-racism, we are anti-transphobic, we are anti-of-all xenophobia, because we respect all individuals as individuals, not by virtue of you being a woman. It is individual empowerment for individuals by virtue of you being an individual, not because you are a woman. An introvert's opposition has failed to respond to the characterization from first about how the most pressing issue for the feminist movement in the status quo isn't a universal system of oppression but rather an individualized one. Our side of the house will fulfill the burdens in a multiplicity of ways. For the most privileged individuals, for the most vulnerable individuals, and for all individuals the feminist movement must represent. Thank you. Sorry, can you wait? So, yeah. Do you think you can continue in this temperature? Yeah. No, I'm going to be fine. in this temperature? Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm absolutely fine. Please continue this. Yeah. Southeast Asia, that's right."

Because this really seems to be the only thrust that we get from the previous speaker. Perhaps because they realise that the vast majority of their material on choice feminism, on requiring different solutions to different problems, falls within the purview of the feminist movement on either side of the house. Given that building solidarity between women does not mean extinguishing their differences, but rather identifying the common threads and problems."

So let's respond to this claim first because it really is the most relevant part of their case. They say that there is a high barrier to participating in the feminist movement on our side of the house because you do not acknowledge sufficiently the suffering of each individual person within the movement. I want to question, firstly, why is this any more likely on their side of the house? Like, their conception of the feminist movement is just quite strange, because they seem to say that you have all the strength of numbers, that you have the critical mass, that you have the feminist movement and its legitimacy, but somehow the movement is atomized between different proportions and groups of individuals, simultaneously pursuing various different facets of sexism and different solutions. I do not think this is the likely characterization, particularly in a world in which you do not focus on solidarity among women and on individual development."

So if they really wanted to prioritize the struggles of the most vulnerable women, why do you give front centre to celebrity culture, to girl-boss feminism, that prioritises the women that make the Fortune 500 magazine, rather than the broad majority of women, perhaps not on an individual case-by-case basis, but as communities of people with common struggles to which they ought to respond. The second thing that I want to do is flip this argument. The ability to access a community is far greater on our side of the house and barriers to entering feminism are lower. Two reasons for this. First, as they point out, when the feminist movement focuses on individual development,"

It is only women who have advanced in their career, in their birthplace, that are able to become feminist icons and idols. It is only women that have achieved significant prominence and celebrity status that are seen as feminist idols and part of feminist iconography. So the zero-sum nature of capitalism bleeds into feminism when you focus on individual development. Comparatively, on our side of the house, when you focus on individual solidarity, each woman recognizes that they are a part of a greater goal, that they are part of a fabric of a feminist community, and that merely by being a member, by holding hands with their family sisters, that they are contributing to that sense of solidarity, which is the primary goal of the feminist movement."

                  "text": "The second structural reason why access is more likely is because on our side of the house, solidarity is something that is internal to the feminist movement. So we get to control the narrative, we get to control the metrics. We can tell women when they are acting in solidarity with the movement, we can control, even if capitalism outside tries to make noise, we can tell women that they are valued members of the feminist movement, merely for their participation in it. On their side of the house, they learn the benevolence of the oppressive patriarchal norms. In the workplace, they often structurally exclude women even when they attempt to appease to patriarchal norms because they would rather hire men in the first place. So the number of women that are able to access the feminist movement is far greater on our side of the house as well. This argument takes them at their best. Even if participation is the metric by which we decide support, we think there is more support on our side. Moving on to the second part of this first clash. They say, and this is me again, taking them at their best in their first speech, that there are diverse ways in which sexism occurs, for example, high religious standards and pretty privilege. The first thing that I want to make, which is a very trivial observation, is that choice feminism is not exclusive to their side of the house. Presumably narratives of self-ownership and of individual empowerment are reasons for why women, even if they make different choices, can still unite on the basis that they have the right to make that choice and not men on their behalf. So regardless of whether you wear sexualised clothing or whether you wear conservative clothing, the ability to make that choice is something that all women can agree should exist and should be given to them. But let's take them at their best. Why do we think that there is a greater focus on superficial differences within the feminist movement? It is because in a world in which the feminist movement does not attempt to build solidarity between groups of women, these women view themselves as oppositional to one another and antagonism between these women increases. For example, women that don't conform to pretty privilege and high beauty standards now don't antagonize the men who are responsible for creating those beauty standards, but rather antagonize the women that are exploiting those beauty standards to undercut them in the workplace. This is because anti-feminists on their side of the house get to control how women form their communities when the feminist movement does not try to promote solidarity in any way at all. This is because in culturally conservative societies, women probably have an incentive to form some kind of community with other women, merely because humans are social creatures and because we have a desire for community. In a world in which it's not the feminist movement dictating what kinds of communities that should be, and when you don't unite on the basis of a common feminist struggle, it is far easier for conservative notions that you should identify not with women in general, but rather on the basis of culture, on the basis of race, on the basis of class become far more likely. So this ossifies women into independent groups in a way that cross-collaboration becomes more difficult. Rich women do not help poor women on their side of the house because they view themselves as part of a class first and a gender second. Before I move on, I'll take a point. So it's not that our case it dist district the feminist movement's political collectivization"

Your messaging is far more likely to be that your suffering is something that another woman is using to their benefit, which is the argument that we just made. So this responds to that point that there are diverse ways in which sexism occurs. On our side, we can more effectively externalise the blame onto men, because when all women are united, the common enemy becomes men, that set patriarchal standards like high-beauty norms. The second response that I want to make broadly to this claim is that you are more likely to question the basis of individual development on our side of the house. On their side, you're highly focused on the goal of individual development itself, by any means necessary. Maybe it means leaning into patriarchal norms like being bossy and assertive to get managerial positions, or leaning into hyper-sexualisation. But on our side of the house, women are far more likely to take pause. When they don't feel this intense need and desire to compete with other women, perhaps even the prettier women wonder whether they should be really, why they are forced to exploit their physical appearance in order to gain an edge in the workplace where men don't have to do so. So the feminist movement takes pause far more effectively on our side of the house. Briefly on this claim that you shame women for success exclusively on our side, the first thing that I want to point out is that as per their framing, in a capitalist society, on both sides, you will resent women who are successful. Why does this resentment decrease on our side? Firstly, in a world in which you promote solidarity, you feel that you contributed to the success of that woman. So you are far less likely to feel resentful even if you don't immediately get the promotion, because at least you are a part of the community. Secondly, you know that these women haven't resorted to nerdy tactics like leaning into patriarchal tropes to become successful. Deal briefly on which side has better opportunities for women. Three structural reasons as to why even if women enter positions of power, why they will not give back to the community. Firstly, they get into positions of power by leaning into patriarchal norms. When they know that other feminist women won't give them a leg up in the workplace, and the pressure is on them to individually develop, and that there is no solidarity, you lean into patriarchal norms to get the promotion, and you don't help other women, because you feel that doing so, and identifying as a feminist after you have made it to the top, risks your position. Secondly, even if there is some incentive to give back, there is no ceiling in capitalism to how far you can individually develop. Even the most successful women will become complacent and think, even if I just individually develop, if I don't give back to the community at all, when the feminist movement focuses on individual development, by individually developing alone, I am a feminist and that is sufficient, and never give back in the first place. For all of these reasons, sign the proposition. Thank you very much."

I want to note this is in major tension with their claim that women on our side would otherwise be greedy and selfish and would not have any way to extend these benefits to others. But there is no mechanization on their side for how exactly the movement uses this narrative to influence goodwill within other women, how you create the structures of giving back and redistribution, which is why actually at this junction and debate, they basically don't prove anything. It's just a critique for capitalism. They never prove why you overcome those degrees of capitalism. But what we do is we co-opt their characterization. If these women are selfish and greedy in all instances, that is precisely why when you allow them to expand upon their own incentives of self-development, their own incentives of self-interestedness, they are able to participate within the movement because their participation is no longer contingent upon solidarity that requires massive amounts of sacrifice. But what we also want to point out is that this is an extremely soft line for opposition to concede, that we are okay with self-advancement when it doesn't come at the expense of others."

So at the point where they want to prove that we want people to equally advance, they have to explain why it is possible for their side to create the platform, create the conditions for all women to succeed equally at once. They don't prove that. Second, I want to note all their impacts are contingent on our side being fully elitist with the standard of what it means to be a woman. But this is incredibly reductionist view of our case, because first prop setup tells you why there is respect for other women at a point where there's no gold standard, but precisely why you view people as being able to maximize their own autonomy and pursue their own goals, which also leads to the flip on their side, because all of their accusations of elitism still apply on their side. They don't explain why you having a girl supports girl's narratives means elitism goes away. In fact, it compounds because you allow women to shape what it means to support other girls. What is the way in which their obligation extends on their side and we are immune from this because we no longer say one person has to sacrifice for another. And this also responds to their new argument of defaulting to metrics like race or class, which is contingent upon fractionalization, but we instead why when you no longer divide people into saying this is what you have to do, you don't get that levels of fractionalization, which is why we're able to better unite them on our side."

First on inclusive empowerment and secondly on social political change. First, on the inclusive empowerment, I think it's ironic that Sri Lanka tries to win on opt-in, because we explain that the major problem with feminism is that people are certain standards that they aren't able to meet, their oppression isn't universal, but it's different. And even if it all comes from the same source of patriarchy, it's about the way their lives are affected that necessitates a different response to these patriarchal scenarios, which is why more people can consider themselves feminist on our side. Because if their narrative is just saying, girls support girls without any trade-off, there's no impact on debate because you just say everyone should support each other no matter what they do, where they go. That doesn't seem very nuanced from their case, especially since they want to engineer certain social outcomes. If they want to engineer those positive outcomes, that means it's a direction you have to steer women towards and any deviation from that direction has to be demonized. You have to say, if you don't come protesting, you're a bad feminist. If you don't come alongside with our policy change, you're a bad feminist. Which is why their side necessitates a heavy demonization of women who want to pursue their own self interests. What do they respond to this with? They say two things. First, their response is not everyone has an equal capacity to get self-empowerment. One, this assumes that everyone has equal capacity to be in solidarity. They don't prove this. But a lot of women can't or don't want to self-sacrifice because it isn't aligned with their own preferences. But secondly, if precisely when the movement promotes individual empowerment, that they want to build a platform where they can be on equal footing. They want to build society to a point where eventually they have the equal capacity to empower themselves. To promoting choice feminism, to destigmatizing sex work so people feel more comfortable speaking up about abuses. To see only their true free choice in opting into OnlyFans. And here's the killer third response. Even if First Op is right and some women are poorer, our narrative doesn't depend on materialism. Because we are saying your circumstances are different. So even if you're still poorer on our side, what our narrative allows you to do is uplift yourself in that case. Because you're saying your autonomy doesn't matter how rich you are, you can still find solace in your family because our side is personalized, their side isn't. Second, their POI asks, isn't it better for women with pretty privilege to not exploit it but instead share it the problem on their side is the person with pretty privilege never even rises to power in the first place because their side preemptively shames them listen to their rhetoric all girl bosses are harmful we should never be able to have them so you never let them rise to power and let them be the icons that can create positive change so if that's what I want to say that we don't want people to be influenced by saying that this is how you break corporate culture, but instead you want them to fight against the corporate culture, but you never have someone being the spokesperson. You never have that loudspeaker in an influential position in society in the first place, which is what we say instead was more likely to be true."

For example, protesting for abortion rights achieves both of these goals because you can be in control of your own uterus, but you're also giving back to society. So we frame advocacy on the basis of empowerment, not on the basis that you must always help women because it's necessary. It also empowers your own individual autonomy. So that's why advocacy still happens on our side. And this is a massive amount of cases because if you want to advocate for feminism, then in a lot of cases, you directly protesting is going to be good for you. But when it's bad for you, that's when opposition just turns a blind eye and says these women don't matter. On their side, it's when you have the feminist movement going against the hijab in places where Islam isn't the dominant religion, you tell them that you have to do this because it's feminist.

That's the deadlock on both sides, even if both sides get somehow hijacked by the rich. But in our third substantive, we challenge how effective opposition's form of solidarity truly is. On either side, women have diverse preferences and lived experiences. They don't get rid of these differences. They mainly tell women to disregard what could be a crucial part of their identity. That's precisely why Diya Sigh splits up the movement and creates in-fighting, where you don't get these women wanting to participate. Precisely why conservatives attack the movement for being homogenous. That you support bad women no matter what, because girls support girls in all instances.

                  "text": "Panel, P3 asserts that we do not mechanise while emphasising solidarity means that women will not compete with each other at all costs. They just conveniently ignore all of the mechanization that we provided to women of one. When Aasrin talked about how the selection of leaders within the feminist movement on our side will now prioritize women who give back to the movement primarily instead of focusing on themselves and their own end goals. People like Malala being emphasized over girl boss CEOs that do nothing for other women. That was the mechanization that we provided. Let's look at their mechanization. Because P3 asserts that having a trailblazer is all that matters because doing that means that other women can go through, break the glass ceiling and achieve the same results themselves. It might surprise you to know that the first female state leader in the world was in Sri Lanka. So that was trailblazing. That was breaking glass ceilings. You know how many women we have in parliament right now? Less than 5%. The problem is, when you do not have women in solidarity, collectivising and supporting each other, what you do get is the most elite, the most rich, the most ethnically privileged women breaking those glass ceilings, getting to the top, enjoying those privileges and not helping anyone else at all. Capitalist systems exist symmetrically on either side. We agree with Malaysia. It is that that is exactly why on their side the women who make it to the top never ever help those who are left on the bottom grounds. It is our narrative of solidarity, the communities that you create, the acknowledging that you only reach the top because of women slaving away on the ground that helps or impairs those women at the top to help those on the ground as well. I want to note that their case is extremely unstrategic because the only way in which they can win is through this extremely narrow characterization of what solidarity looks like. They say that solidarity means that you extinguish all differences between women but they never explain why this is true. Like, solidarity doesn't mean uniformity. Solidarity just means that you acknowledge a bigger oppressive power harming all of you, i.e. the patriarchy, and that you should work together to combat it. That other women succeeding means a good thing for you and that you should work towards achieving those benefits as well. So we think that you fight against the patriarchy collectively and that is something good for you as well. P3, again, asserts that we have to support a norm of solidarity that means that you have to sacrifice your own well-being in order to benefit another woman. No, solidarity, the narrative of it on our side says that you should support other women because those women benefiting means that you benefit because those women rising up in power means that they enact policies that help you on the ground. That is the narrative. That is why women show up to protest on our side of the house. I'm willing to bite the bullet. Maybe we shame the women who climb up and do absolutely nothing to help the other women. Why do we care? We would suggest that women who are on the ground, vulnerable, and could be benefited by those women in positions of power should be shamed if they do nothing benefited by those women in positions of power should be shamed if they do nothing to help other women in vulnerable positions. The fact of the matter is, their case might work in Western liberal democracies. Maybe in the UK, women are best able, best placed to promote their own individual development. But in places like Sri Lanka, places like Malaysia, countries I would note are the majority in the world, but also have the majority of the women in the world, also deserve to be able to climb up the ladders to benefit from collective solidarity between women as well. So we would suggest that they need to debate this motion in the world in which women are the most vulnerable, the world in which women need collective action, not perfect Western liberal utopias. I'm going to talk"

                  "text": "But like you pointed out, you can still be in solidarity with other women insofar as you don't actively cut out the chance of another woman succeeding. You can take the promotion. Look at what they're suggesting. They're saying that our feminist movement will tell women not to take a promotion if all the other women in the factory also can't simultaneously get a promotion? That's just not how the world works, Pranay. The feminist movement isn't going to tell them that. What they're going to say is that if you get the promotion, do something to help other women. If you're going to get the promotion, do it in a way that doesn't actively undercut the chances of another woman getting that promotion. First question then, which rules are better for the movement? They say, here's why women who succeed on our side contribute to other women far more on our counterfactual. The first thing we pointed out is that our narrative prioritizes and values women who give back to the movement as well and that's how you become a leader within the movement so to become influential within the feminist movement, we would suggest that these women have to do far more in terms of collective action to benefit other women and therefore can use their pulpits of power to speak out about feminist issues. Look at Ashin's unresponded mechanization about why women on their side who work within the patriarchal society without any semblance of solidarity actively dissociate from the feminist movement because calling themselves feminist actively hurts their chances of staying within that power and position of power as well. So why is it that they put women, even if they put women into managerial positions, that they're ever going to do anything else to help other women at all? Absolutely no analysis. But the second thing we pointed out is that when their women succeed and become part of the oppressive patriarchal structure, when poor women start criticizing those women for the oppressive conditions in which they have to work, for example, that creates a division within the feminist movement. And you know who's most likely to win within that division? Who's going to drown out the other part in discourse? It is like the first speaker says, white, rich women have the most power within the movement. It is on their side that those black, poor women have no way to speak out. Because their women, who succeed individually, are the leaders within the movement as well. So the ability for you to shut out vulnerable women who criticize you for being in a position of power and doing nothing to help is worse on their side, which means that for the most marginalized women, the majority of women I will note, they have no recourse on their side of the house. Here's the thing, because their side depends on the benevolence of women that they shoot to the stratosphere in terms of success to help others This is unlikely because I want to do something on probability Chanika points out that they leaned into patriarchal norms to get to the top in the first place Which means that they will likely perceive helping other women as something bad that would make them risk their own position Which is something that they don't want to do. Because if their case is true and they can achieve massive success, that is when you're also very unlikely to risk their success because you've achieved so much already. You feel like you don't have to help other women. I need to continue on with my life and being able to go up there. But here's the tie-breaker. We think that women, even if they wanted to take the risk, will not do so on their side of the house because they know that there is no safety net. If they fail and if they are fired from their job, there is no solidarity among women on the ground. So even if they are fired, there is no safety net. On our side, there is something along those lines, which means that women in top positions are more willing to take on risks to try and help other women as well. Some women benefit on either side. Here's the thing. They might have a deeper benefit for a small minority of women, but those are probably the most privileged women anyway. It is unclear why we should care about the rich white women who are probably going to do well in life anyway, being able to get one more promotion. What we defended was far more women benefit to a significant extent. When women get into mid-level management and do things like better HR policies, these are the changes that change people's lives that we were willing to stand for. So we win on getting better goals. But even if not, we have a range of mechanisms undisponded to as to why we have a stronger movement that is more likely to achieve those goals, a tie-breaking way for you to decide your ballot. First, Ashim pointed out that the pressure placed on women to succeed, on their side, on their own, is far higher, and therefore women are more likely to opt out of the movement. This is important because on our side, even if your life doesn't go perfectly, when you see other women succeeding, you can derive satisfaction from it because you think that you contributed to the other woman's success, which means that you are far more likely to stick out of the feminist movement, turn out to protest and ensure that policy gets passed that benefits women on the ground as well. The reality is, the feminist movement dies on their side. Because they buy into capitalist norms that pits women against each other, we think solidarity is far better. Thank you very much.

And two, they have no incentive to help those less privileged than them. The way here is what came out in Chanitur's speech that got no response. There is no upper ceiling in capitalism. Once you get to the top and the narrative is to maximize your individual benefit, you have never given an incentive to give back to the people at the bottom because you can always go higher.
